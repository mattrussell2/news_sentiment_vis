["Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the financial messaging service that moves money around the global banking system will be cutting off Iran's Central Bank.\n\n\"I understand that SWIFT will be discontinuing service to the Central Bank of Iran and designated Iranian financial institutions,\" Mnuchin said in a tweet. \"SWIFT is making the right decision to protect the integrity of the international financial system.\"\n\nThe decision by SWIFT means Iran's Central Bank will be cut off from the international banking system and will cause significant economic pain, observers say. The move comes as the US tries to squeeze Iran with a slew of sanctions and economic measures that administration officials say are meant to make the regime change its behavior.\n\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told BBC Persian that Iran's \"leadership has to make a decision that they want their people to eat. They have to make a decision that they want to use their wealth to import medicine, and not use their wealth to fund\" destabilizing activities in the region.\"\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday reimposed all sanctions against Iran that had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear agreement. Treasury officials said at the time that the US had advised Swift to stop providing services to certain Iranian entities. And they made clear they were willing to force the matter.\n\nI understand that SWIFT will be discontinuing service to the Central Bank of Iran and designated Iranian financial institutions.

An average of nearly 84 million people have been added to the Earth's population every year since 1985.\n\n\"As women have gotten more educated and participate more in the workforce and they get access to health services, no surprise, fertility has come down tremendously,\" said study author Dr. Christopher Murray , director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. \"And it comes down faster in younger women.\"\n\nOther factors have been shown to predict falling fertility rates, including better infant survival rates and later marriage.\n\n\"The age at which women are getting married is increasing,\" said Dr. James Kiarie , coordinator for the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Team in the Department of Reproductive Health and Research.\n\n\"Marriage is one of the biggest drivers of having children all over the world,\" said Kiarie, who is not an author on the new report.\n\n'The world is really divided'\n\nWhile total fertility rates fell across all 195 countries and territories in the data, they were split roughly down the middle between those below replacement level and those above, Murray said. \"Replacement\" describes the total fertility rate \"at which a population replaces itself from generation to generation, assuming no migration,\" which comes out to about 2.05 live births, the authors say.\n\nFor example, a woman in Cyprus had one child on average in 2017, while a woman in Niger had 7.1. This range is lower than 1950's, in which total fertility rates ranged from 1.7 live births in Andorra to 8.9 in Jordan.\n\n\"The world is really divided into two groups,\" Murray said. \"In a generation, the issue's not going to be about population growth. It's going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.\"\n\nIn countries that want to boost fertility rates, the creation of financial incentives for families, including parental leave, has been shown to have a small effect, Murray said. Only 33 countries, largely in Europe, were falling in population between 2010 and 2017, according to the report.\n\n\"The country that's probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,\" Murray said. \"In a place like India -- that is still above replacement but very soon going to be below replacement fertility -- that's just such a dramatic change.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean the global population will soon reverse course. A United Nations report last year predicted that the world population would swell to 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. That report forecast that over half of the expected growth between 2017 and 2050 is likely to occur in Africa.\n\nIn just the past several years, Kiarie said, parts of Africa and Asia have substantially lowered fertility rates. The countries that have seen the sharpest declines are those that previously had lower rates of contraception, where the introduction of family planning made a more significant impact, he added.\n\n\"There's been rapid progress, but I think in terms of ... the areas which have the biggest unmet need for family planning, it's still largely in Africa,\" he said.\n\nLifestyle continues to kill millions\n\nThursday's report comes alongside six others , funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, on the global burden of disease. The findings include a rising prevalence of obesity in nearly every nation, idling or worsening mortality rates in some countries, and a high burden of non-communicable diseases, contributing to nearly three-quarters of deaths worldwide in 2017. The top risk factors were high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high body-mass index and smoking.\n\nLifespans have also gotten longer on average since 1950, climbing from 48.1 to 70.5 years for men and from 52.9 to 75.6 years for women, according to the study. However, the study authors say that just because women live longer doesn't mean they are living in better health.\n\nAn editorial published by The Lancet points out that countries around the world are falling behind the United Nations' global health goals in some way, and the study \"should be an electric shock, galvanising national governments and international agencies not only to redouble their efforts to avoid the imminent loss of hard-won gains but also to adopt a fresh approach to growing threats.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWhen it comes to fertility rates, Kiarie said that the UN goals \"are about the ability for people to have the number of children they want,\" as well as when and with whomever they choose. \"What is key is for that ability to be there, in the women's hands.\"\n\nWhat often gets lost in discussing fertility statistics and population numbers, Kiarie said, is the focus on individual people, their desires and how countries can empower them to achieve those goals.\n\n\"How can we ensure that people do what they think is right for themselves?\" he asked.", "(CNN) The #NeverAgain movement, started by students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after the February shooting in Parkland, Florida that killed 17 people, set a clear demand on elected officials: pass more restrictive gun laws, or we'll vote you out.\n\nThe results of the midterm elections suggest that the movement made headway in suburban districts across the country, but failed in more rural, conservative states. The next Congress may then pass bills regarding assault weapons and background checks in the new Democratic House only to see them stall in the even more Republican Senate. For gun control advocates, that's progress, but not enough.\n\nWhile mass gun shootings have become a regular occurrence in America \u2014Thousand Oaks, California this week, a Pittsburgh synagogue last month, Maryland's Capital Gazette newsroom this summer, Santa Fe High School this spring, Parkland this winter, Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, Texas last year \u2014 the response in Washington is expected to be as divided as ever.\n\nBut Democrats who are taking the House say they will push forward to pass gun control bills early in the new Congress.\n\n\"Especially today, we're reminded of the urgency of this,\" Rep. Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, told CNN. \"Last night at Thousand Oaks, one of the safest cities in America, just like Parkland, just like Newtown, we saw another mass shooting ... and Congress needs to take action.\"\n\n\"I'm confident in the early days of the next Congress, we'll move forward on common sense, bipartisan gun safety measures that have enjoyed overwhelming popularity everywhere in the country except the United States Congress,\" he added.\n\nDeutch said implementing universal background checks, a \" gun violence restraining order ,\" which allows law enforcement to ask a judge to temporarily take guns away from people who are deemed a threat, and banning so-called \"bump stocks,\" are at the top of his list, along with other school safety and mental health initiatives.\n\nWith Democrats in control of the House, they can also hold hearings on gun violence, which they tried to pressure Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte, the Republican Congressman of Virginia, to do last year. In March, Rep. Jerry Nadler, the New York Democrat who will take the gavel next year, said \"it is long past due\" that the committee address the nation's gun laws.\n\nThe Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut, motivated President Barack Obama to issue executive action to strengthen the background check system, but Congress failed to pass legislation expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales. Republicans then took control of Congress by winning the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016, halting that bill and other measures. In October, a year after 58 people were killed in the Las Vegas shooting, President Donald Trump said that \"bump stocks,\" which make rifles fire at a faster rate, would be banned in the coming weeks. That has yet to happen.\n\nFor years, Democrats did not run on the gun control issue. But they've recently become more emboldened to campaign on it, according to advertising data from Campaign Media Analysis Group provided to CNN. From January 1, 2018, through Election Day, there were 125,879 pro-gun control ads for House, Senate and governor races \u2014 more than triple the number in 2016. Anti-gun control spots also jumped \u2014 from 77,625 in 2016 to 118,166 in 2018 \u2014 but the increase was less than double from the last election.\n\nDeutch credits the #NeverAgain movement started in his district.\n\n\"The fact is that the families and the student survivors from Stoneman Douglas have spent the past almost nine months forcing this issue into the center of the political debate,\" Deutch said. \"That's why you've seen so many ads. That's why you've seen marches not just in Washington but all around the country. And that's why so many of my soon-to-be former colleagues were defeated because, for years, they thought that they could ignore arguments from families and gun safety advocates and sit back and comfortable receive gun company money, and think they would be protected.\"\n\n\"This election, because of this incredible leadership from young people, they were shown the door,\" he added. \"That's going to impact the way members of the House and the Senate approach these issues going forward \u2014 and forever.\"\n\nThere's been a modest increase in Americans' support for stricter gun legislation over the past year, according to a survey published last month by the Pew Research Center . CNN exit polling of the 2018 contests showed 10% of respondents named \"gun policy\" as the most important issue, behind health care, immigration and the economy. The vast majority of those people \u2014 70% \u2014 were Democrats, indicating that the Republicans' enthusiasm on the issue may have slipped.\n\nStill, gun policy isn't talked about much in advertisements compared to other issues. And when it is, there tends to be more anti-gun control ads than not. In 2018 congressional races, there were over 68,000 ads run mentioning \"anti-gun control,\" 2.8% of all ads, and over 47,000 spots run mentioning \"pro-gun control,\" about 2% of ads overall, according to CMAG.", "", "(CNN) A competitive House race in Maine will be decided by \"ranked-choice\" voting, marking the first time in US history the process will determine the outcome of a congressional race.\n\nMaine voters had the chance to rank all candidates by preference in Tuesday's midterm elections for the US House and Senate . Instituted for the first time this year, the new state law mandates ranked-choice tabulation be applied in any federal race in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote.\n\nIndependent Sen. Angus King and 1st District Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat, both received majorities, according to unofficial tallies, and avoided the instant runoff. In the 2nd District, however, the unofficial tally had incumbent GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin leading Democratic state Rep. Jared Golden by 46.2% to 45.7%, respectively, according to the Bangor Daily News . Two other candidates split the remaining 8.1% of the vote.\n\nBeginning Friday, votes will be tabulated until two candidates remain and one has the majority. Voters are not required to choose more than one candidate in any race if they prefer not to participate in the preference process.\n\nWhile this would normally be done in multiple rounds, both the third and fourth place candidate will be immediately eliminated since the third-place candidate can't mathematically win. The votes for them will be tabulated simultaneously, which should give either Poliquin or Golden a majority, and therefore, a seat in Congress.\n\nThe process may take a few days because about half of Maine's municipalities use paper ballots, which are counted by hand. The other half use optical scan machines, whose results are put onto a memory stick.\n\nPaper ballots, which are locked and sealed in a secure box that needs to be processed and logged when they are taken to Augusta, the capital, are fed through a high-speed tabulator and then put onto a memory stick in the same format as optical scan results.\n\nThose memory sticks, also sent to Augusta through secure delivery, are put into a computer with a special algorithm program to calculate the results. This computer is not connected to the internet and is used solely for ranked-choice voting tabulation, according to Kristen Muszynski, communications director to Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap.\n\nDunlap has authorized tabulation to continue through the weekend and the observation of Veterans Day on Monday, to ensure the count is not delayed.\n\nThe final results are expected to come as early as next week.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "Washington (CNN) This week's shakeup at the Department of Justice could affect the outcome of a subpoena challenge that an associate of Trump ally Roger Stone is waging against special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThat quickly became clear Thursday during oral arguments at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is hearing the challenge from Stone associate Andrew Miller.\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson instructed attorneys from both sides to argue their case as if the hearing were occurring 24 hours earlier, before \"the events of yesterday afternoon,\" a veiled reference to President Donald Trump's decision to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday.\n\nHenderson, appointed to this court by President George H.W. Bush, said the three-judge panel would likely ask the lawyers to file new briefs adjusting their arguments to reflect the news.\n\nThe Justice Department shakeup affects the Russia investigation because acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker has assumed the role of overseeing Mueller. Whitaker has previously bashed Mueller in public comments, raising concerns that he might now move to shut down or neuter the probe.\n\nAt one point during Thursday's hearing, prosecutor Michael Dreeben was asked whether Mueller's overseer could change or rescind the May 2017 order that appointed the special counsel.\n\nDreeben acknowledged that Mueller's boss had the power to make those changes. The line of questioning seemed to lay out a road map that Whitaker could follow to fire Mueller, though nobody explicitly stated that in the courtroom or mentioned Whitaker by name.\n\nOutside the courthouse after the hearing, Miller's attorney Paul Kamenar more explicitly described how Mueller could be removed.\n\nWhitaker \"can either revoke the regulations altogether or amend the order ... and therefore make Mueller an at-will prosecutor ... meaning he can be fired without cause,\" Kamenar said. \"And we think that that is the way under the Constitution it should be done for accountability.\"\n\nIn a discussion during the hearing about Mueller's supervision, Judge Judith Rogers noted that \"what may be inappropriate to one deputy attorney general might not be inappropriate to another.\" The comments from the Clinton appointee were a nod to the reality that a new boss for Mueller could reach very different conclusions about whether he was running a fair investigation.\n\nBeyond the drama unfolding outside the courthouse this week, Thursday's hearing largely focused on the substantive issue of whether Mueller had been appointed in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nKamenar argued that Mueller has \"extraordinary prosecutorial power\" and \"lacks supervision\" despite \"acting like a US attorney at large.\" According to his arguments, Mueller is so powerful that instead of being appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he is more like a US attorney -- who needed to be tapped by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nKamenar also made a case that Rosenstein never had the power to appoint Mueller in the first place. He said Sessions' recusal from overseeing the probe in March 2017 meant Rosenstein \"could handle the investigation part but not the appointment part,\" which was still under Sessions' purview.\n\nJudge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, had some sharp questions for Kamenar. They engaged in an extended back-and-forth about the case law, with Srinivasan appearing to disagree with some of Kamenar's interpretations.\n\nFor his part, Dreeben pointed to a series of court decisions and urged the appeals panel to \"take heed of precedents\" and fully uphold Mueller's powers. Before Thursday's hearing, four district-level federal judges had upheld Mueller's appointment and constitutional authority.\n\nDreeben also pushed back on the notion that Mueller lacked adequate supervision.\n\n\"He is aware of what we're doing,\" Dreeben said in an apparent reference to Rosenstein. \"It is not the case that the special counsel is off and wandering in a free-floating environment.\"\n\nThursday's hearing came after months of legal wrangling. Mueller's team subpoenaed Miller in May, demanding that he testify before their grand jury in DC. Miller eventually beefed up his legal team and, with funding from conservative legal groups, decided to fight the subpoena.\n\nHis case was heard by Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, who eviscerated his legal arguments against Mueller's powers in a sweeping ruling in July. She ordered Miller to appear before the grand jury, though that hasn't happened yet, since the case was appealed.\n\nMiller is one of about a dozen Stone associates who have testified before the grand jury, given voluntary interviews to investigators or received subpoenas from Mueller's team. Investigators have ramped up their scrutiny of Stone in recent months and have focused on his supposed contacts with WikiLeaks, his political committees that were active in 2016 and more.\n\nStone and Miller have known each other for years, with Miller occasionally working as Stone's driver, traveling aide and \"tech guy\" who handled Stone's website. A self-identified Libertarian, Miller has also been a legal marijuana farmer in California and currently paints houses in Missouri -- and he says he knows nothing about Russian collusion or election interference.\n\nStone, who was not at Thursday's hearing and was not a party in the proceedings, vehemently denies colluding with Russia during the 2016 campaign and questions whether the Kremlin even interfered, despite the consensus from US intelligence agencies.\n\nThis was the first public appeals hearing regarding the Mueller probe. Kamenar said after the hearing that he would \"certainly\" appeal to the Supreme Court if the appeals judges rule against him, though experts say it's unclear whether the high court would take the case.\n\n\"We believe at that point with this current bench that they would find that Mueller is basically acting as a rogue type of a prosecutor,\" Kamenar said. Asked if he was referring to the presence of newly minted Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Kamenar replied, \"Absolutely.\"", "After 6 years out of the public eye the Spice Girls plan to reunite for a reunion tour next year, though neither Posh Spice nor Victoria Beckham will participate.", "(CNN) \u2014 Anyplace can string up a few lights and call it a holiday celebration.

When she was asked on Thursday about the video and the misleading way it portrayed the incident, Sanders said, according to a White House pool report, \"The question is did the reporter make contact or not? The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement.\"\n\nCNN emailed Sanders later Thursday and asked her how the video came to her attention and whether she was aware of Watson's background and whether she had vetted the video herself before posting it. She referred CNN back to the statement.\n\nOn Twitter, Watson strongly denied having edited the video in a deliberately deceptive fashion. Watson said that the only editing he did was to zoom in on the area around Acosta's hand.\n\nWatson did provide a clue as to how the video may have inadvertently come to show a misleading version of the incident, however. He said that the basis for the video he posted was not raw footage or even a clip taken directly from a network. Instead, Watson said, he had downloaded a GIF, edited it, and exported the final product as a video.\n\nA GIF is a media file that compresses video by removing a significant number of frames from it. It allows individuals to show moving images without uploading large files.\n\nIt's possible that the processes and technology involved in creating a GIF, downloading that GIF, editing it as a video and re-uploading it could have created the discrepancy between what the video Sanders posted shows and what the original video from the press conference clearly showed.\n\nWhatever happened, the White House press secretary tweeted from her official account a misleading video to justify the punishment of a journalist, and sparked a debate over which video should be believed. That has people who monitor disinformation online, who have worried about the impending arrival of technology that will be able to seamlessly alter video to create the impression that people are saying or doing things they haven't done, very concerned.\n\nIt's widely expected that internet trolls, partisans and perhaps even rogue states will ultimately seize on sophisticated video manipulation to advance their causes. But the fact that the spokesperson for the President of the United States tweeted a misleading video and then stood by it underscored the danger and wide-reaching impact of the possible information wars.\n\nIn a Thursday afternoon statement, Whitney Shefte, president of the White House News Photographers Association, said, \"As visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth. It's deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country's highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - Los reporteros de muchos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n han expresado su apoyo a Jim Acosta de CNN luego de que la Casa Blanca revoc\u00f3 su pase de prensa.\n\nEl \"hard pass\", que facilita la entrada a los terrenos de la Casa Blanca, fue suspendido por la administraci\u00f3n de Trump el mi\u00e9rcoles por la noche \"hasta nuevo aviso\". \u00bfPor qu\u00e9?

Click to subscribe!\n\nI kid. But not really.\n\nLook, I get why Democrats, in the immediate aftermath of President Trump's firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the appointment of Whitaker, sought to push the idea of recusal. Whitaker has made any number of statements in the past that suggest he is disinclined to provide the sort of defense of Robert Mueller's probe that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has. In a 2017 op-ed for CNN, Whitaker wrote:\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel. If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\"\n\nThere's plenty of other fodder just like that from Whitaker, all of which makes the same point: Whitaker, like Trump, is very skeptical of Mueller's probe. Which could be, at least in theory, grounds for Whitaker to recuse himself.\n\nNotice how I said \"in theory.\" Because here's the reality: Whitaker ain't recusing himself.\n\nConsider everything we know about how Whitaker came to be chosen as acting attorney general:\n\n1. Sessions drew Trump's ire for recusing himself from the Russia probe due to his status as a prominent surrogate for the President during the 2016 campaign. (Sessions' recusal came after it became known that he had not revealed several interactions with Russian officials when under questioning by senators during his confirmation hearings.)\n\n3. Trump fired Sessions the day after the midterm election, after 18 months of bullying him publicly and privately -- all of which sprung from his anger at Sessions' recusal.\n\n4. Trump chose to pass over Rosenstein in picking an acting attorney general.\n\n5. Trump named Whitaker to the role -- in a tweet! -- after Whitaker had repeatedly spoken out regarding his issues with Mueller's probe.\n\nNow ask yourself this: Given that sequence of events, WHY the hell would Whitaker ever recuse himself?\n\nAsked about the possibility of recusal, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday morning, \"I don't know why he'd be recused. I'm not recused. You're not recused.\"\n\nHe was literally chosen for the gig to NOT recuse himself. He was named so that Trump could seize back control of an investigation that he has long railed against as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax.\"\n\nNot convinced? Think about this: If Whitaker had spoken and written about how much faith he had in Mueller (and Rosenstein) and what a good job they were doing, do you think he would have been picked by Trump to be acting attorney general?\n\nOF COURSE NOT.\n\nTrump spent much of the past 18 months fuming -- in private and in public -- about how long the Mueller investigation was taking, how it was a total hoax, how Mueller and his investigatory team were hopelessly biased and on and on and on. On Wednesday, Trump made his play -- to, if not end the Mueller probe, then get some control back over it. (There is some debate as to whether Whitaker, who does not have Senate confirmation, can even serve as acting attorney general.)\n\nHere's what Trump said when asked about the Russia investigation on Wednesday afternoon -- before the Sessions firing went public:\n\n\"I stay away from it. But you know what I do? I let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money, but I let it go on, because I don't want to do that. But you're right; I could end it right now. I could say, 'That investigation is over.' \"\n\nOr he could take baby steps.

Amazon ( AMZN ) and Google ( GOOGL ) are reportedly planning massive New York expansions with thousands of new employees.\n\nAmazon is said to be planning to split its much-hyped second headquarters into two locations, with one rumored to be in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York. The company originally promised as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs for the project. Even if that number is halved, it could still mean tens of thousands of jobs in New York.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, is considering a large office space in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood, the Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday. The move would potentially expand Google's already sizable presence in New York, with space for more than 8,500 additional employees, according to the Journal.\n\nWhile Amazon and Google have so far declined to comment, longtime members of the New York tech scene were quick to hail this week's reports as proof of the city's ascendance with this sector.\n\n\"I have had a front row seat to watch the emergence of the NYC tech sector over the last thirty years,\" Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capitalist with New York-based Union Square Ventures, wrote in a blog post Thursday. \"It started as a trickle, then a stream, then a river, and it's feeling more and more like an ocean.\"\n\nJulie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit network of tech leaders, told CNN Business that the news is a \"vindication\" for what she and others have long evangelized: \"New York City is an international hub for technology.\"\n\nThis vindication comes after years of private and public efforts to boost New York's tech clout, including city investments in cybersecurity and a virtual reality lab as well as new tech campuses from Cornell and New York University . At the same time, homegrown outfits like Etsy, Yext and MongoDB have all gone public, Tumblr was acquired in a billion-dollar deal and WeWork now ranks as one of the most valuable startups in the world.\n\nBy 2016, New York City's tech sector had 128,600 jobs, setting a new record for the city, according to data released last year by the Office of the New York State Comptroller.\n\nEven with that surge in activity, Amazon and Google could find it challenging to vie for tech talent given the sheer scale of hiring both be looking to do in the years to come. Samuels says there is certainly potential for a \"short-term crunch\" in the tech talent supply in New York.\n\nBut this needs to be weighed against New York's true strength for big tech. Unlike San Francisco, New York is a hub not just for the tech industry, but also for advertising, media and finance \u2014 areas that some of the largest tech companies are increasingly branching into.\n\n\"The next generation of technology tools that are going to be built are going to be built in partnership with existing industries, and that's going to require being where those industries are,\" Samuels says. \"And New York is obviously where those industries are.\"\n\nCase in point: Google. The company, which has spent billions on New York real estate this decade, including buying the Chelsea Market earlier this year, doesn't just go after engineers in the city. It also has recruited a large marketing staff and opened a production facility for YouTube to attract creatives.\n\nFor years, Google has been what Wilson calls the \"anchor tenant\" for the tech ecosystem in New York, luring tech talent to the city and serving as a potential pool from which other big and small tech companies in the region can recruit. Now, he writes in the blog post, New York may have not one, but \"two large and well known anchor tenants.\"\n\nWhen asked if this could one day help New York's tech scene to surpass Silicon Valley, Wilson sounded more circumspect. \"I don't see [it] over taking,\" Wilson told CNN Business by email. \"But NYC mattering more and more is what I see happening.\"", "CNN's Chris Cillizza breaks down what the House, Senate and gubernatorial results mean for the country over the next two years.\n\nSource: CNN", "(CNN) Two signs of the times: another mass shooting and more Twitter outrage.

The medical association has long maintained that firearm-related deaths and injuries should be treated as an urgent public health crisis.\n\nThe recommendations include urging doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety.\n\nThe argument also comes at a time when organizations like Scrubs Addressing the Firearm Epidemic , known as SAFE, are coming together to demand an increase in federal funding for gun violence research while calling on lawmakers to implement \"evidence-based policy\" on guns.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NRA dismissed the flood of comments.\n\n\"The so-called 'uproar' on twitter or what could [be] characterized as a normal exchange of emotions and uninformed opinions has nothing to do with the substance of the article being promoted in the tweet. It's clear form the comments that they didn't read the article,\" Jennifer Baker wrote in an email. \"It's just another example of gun control advocates with the help of the mainstream media blaming law abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of deranged people and exploiting tragedy to push a gun control agenda that would not prevent these crimes. The gun control policies they advocate for are already the law in California and they did not prevent [last night's] tragedy.\"\n\nBaker added that the focus on the NRA is misguided.\n\nIf medical organizations \"would like to concentrate on a public health crisis,\" she wrote, \"they should focus on the mental health crisis that results in nearly 50,000 suicides per year, the medical community's complicity in the opioid crisis that takes over 42,000 lives per year or the 250,000 deaths due to medical errors.\"\n\nFew NRA supporters appeared to get into the Twitter mix with the doctors, nurses and others.\n\nBut some stepped onto the field, like @wickedgrin1, who said, \"This is a crime issue, not a public health issue. Doctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue, to be corrected by government interference in private lives. This is the opposite of what medicine should be, and there is not end to it.\"\n\nThis is a crime issue, not a public health issue.\n\n\n\nDoctors arrogantly deem anything they feel strongly about to be a public health issue, to be corrected by government interference in private lives.\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite of what medicine should be, and there is not end to it. \u2014 Wicked Grin (@wickedgrin1) November 8, 2018\n\nAnd there won't be an end to it until doctors are satisfied, said Bob Doherty, an official with the American College of Physicians.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Here's a link to the @AnnalsofIM paper we wrote that has the @NRA demanding that doctors not speak out on gun violence,\" he tweeted. \"Doctors will keep speaking out.

That's the longest losing streak since July 1984, according to S&P Platts.\n\nIn barely a month, crude has plunged 21% -- and that's since closing at a four-year high of $76.41 on October 3.\n\nFriday's low of $59.28 a barrel is the weakest price since February.\n\nIt's a stunning turnaround considering just a few months ago some analysts were warning that $100-a-barrel oil could be just around the corner, especially given the Trump administration's crackdown on Iran.\n\nThe oil slump has been sparked by a combination of forces.\n\nFirst, the global growth fears that rocked the stock market spilled into commodities. Investors worried that an economic slowdown would eat into demand for energy.\n\n\"It's so amazing how fast sentiment shifts,\" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \"The economic slowdown fears are winning the narrative.\"\n\nAnd despite the recent Wall Street rebound, crude has continued to tumble. That's because oil bulls were disappointed by the Trump administration's decision to grant temporary waivers that allow India, China and other countries to continue to buy oil from Iran, the world's fifth-biggest producer.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the move was designed to ease the impact of sanctions on Iran, which took effect on Monday.\n\n\"We're going to let some of the oil go out to these countries that really do need it, because I don't want to drive the oil prices up to $100 or $150 a barrel, which could happen very easily,\" Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nTrump argued that prices have \"come down very substantially\" recently \"because of me.\"\n\nThe flood of production has helped lift oil stockpiles. Commercial oil inventories in the United States soared by 5.8 million barrels last week and are now 3% above the five-year average, according to the federal government.\n\nHowever, RBC's Tran said physical demand for crude remains solid: \"It's not that bad out there. It doesn't warrant a 20% decline.\"\n\nThe bear market for oil unnerved energy investors on Wall Street. Baker Hughes ( BHGE ) dropped 4% and Schlumberger ( SLB ) declined 2%.\n\nBut some analysts are warning the oil tailspin might be short lived. Goldman Sachs and RBC recently called for prices to rebound as the Iran sanctions waivers wear off.\n\nAnd analysts are increasingly concerned Saudi Arabia and the United States have limited room to respond to future shocks.\n\nSaudi Arabia is already pumping near record highs and the Permian Basin is growing so rapidly that it's running out of pipelines. Bottlenecks in Texas may not get cleared up until the second half of 2019.\n\n\"The risks are skewed to the upside through the end of the year,\" said Tran.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) Finding clean ways to generate energy is a priority for scientists eager to reduce the world's reliance on fossil fuels. Now, a team of US researchers say they've found a way to make environmentally friendly energy using bionic mushrooms covered in bacteria.\n\nClusters of energy-producing cyanobacteria were attached to a typical button mushroom using 3D-printing technology, alongside an electrode network to harness the power they produce.\n\nCyanobacteria are common on land and in the oceans, and scientists are intrigued by their ability to turn light into energy via photosynthesis.\n\nCyanobacteria appear in green.\n\nDespite research projects examining how cyanobacteria could be used to make electricity, their use in power generation is limited by the fact that they cannot survive for long on artificial surfaces.\n\nHowever, the mushroom provides great conditions for the bacteria to thrive, thanks to a combination of nutrients, temperature and moisture, and the scientists found they survived several days longer on the mushroom than on other surfaces.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

Sometimes that's the only way the marginalized can get their voices heard by those in power. To be clear, in my career as a community organizer, I organized many confrontational protests. I understand where the anger comes from \u2014 I feel it myself.\n\nAnd yet, I'm wrestling with a feeling of deep discomfort as I watch the videos from outside Tucker Carlson's D.C. home. CNN reported that \"Smash Racism D.C., which calls itself an 'anti-fascist,' or Antifa, group, claimed responsibility for the protest on social media.\"\n\n\"In videos uploaded to Twitter by the group on Wednesday, participants were heard saying 'Tucker Carlson, we will fight! We know where you sleep at night!,' \" CNN reported\n\nJUST WATCHED Cruz swarmed by protesters at DC restaurant Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cruz swarmed by protesters at DC restaurant 01:50\n\nThis goes beyond protesting to harassing and threatening.\n\nIndeed, Antifa is an extreme, violent fringe movement on the left that does far, far more harm in every sense than good and whose bad behavior has been repeatedly used to smear the entire progressive left.\n\nAnd happening in this moment, this protest falls into a general decline in the civility and respect we're showing one another on other sides of the political aisle.\n\nNow I'll say here what I've said before: interpersonal niceness isn't the same thing as dignity, equality and respect in policies and systems, and I would never privilege the former over the latter.\n\nI've always had a good relationship with Tucker Carlson and find him to be one of the more thoughtful people on the right. Also, whenever I think of him, I think about this video that Buzzfeed made about how whenever liberals are talking, Tucker makes a face like they're eating mayonnaise straight out of a jar. This cracks me up. And when I told Tucker about it a few weeks ago, he said he hadn't seen it but the idea cracked him up, too.\n\nStill, I want to be clear that I find many of the policies and ideas that Tucker Carlson appears to support deeply cruel and hateful, and the way he expresses those beliefs -- and treats his opponents on air -- is often cruel as well.\n\nJUST WATCHED Video shows McConnell get heckled at restaurant Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows McConnell get heckled at restaurant 01:28\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\nI don't treat other people with dignity and respect and equality because they deserve it or even because they earn it. I treat other people with dignity and respect and equality because I believe that all people deserve dignity and respect and equality. No matter who they are, no matter what they believe, and importantly, no matter how they treat me. Because those are my values. That's why I'm a progressive.\n\nAnd I'm not going to let any amount of hate and nastiness on the right define my values or drag me down. \"When they go low, we go high\" isn't just a bumper sticker or a tactical choice. It's a moral conviction. I will not let the hate and cruelty of others make me hateful and cruel.\n\nAgain, I've been all over the map on this myself and certainly see the reasons for people feeling not only righteously angry but also expressing hate over what Trump and his allies are doing, and wanting to fight back. And I am wary of false equivalences.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

Politicians who support the forced separation of immigrant families at the border, for example -- small children literally being ripped out of their parents' arms -- seem hypocritical to complain about being bothered, say, at dinner in a restaurant. I get it, and I get the desire to protest in a way that feels commensurate with this new era of injustice.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm going to try to be the change I want to see in the world -- which includes treating other people, leaders on the right and especially voters and followers on the right -- with the respect, equality and radical kindness that I want them to show, too. And just like I don't think their behavior should be the justification for my bad behavior, I don't want my behavior to be the excuse anyone cites for being even worse.", "Washington (CNN) Two of the highest profile races in the country -- both in Florida -- are likely headed to a recount soon.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson's re-election bid is likely headed to a hand recount given that the incumbent Democrat now trails Florida Gov. Rick Scott by 17,000 votes, within the .25% margin required for a hand recount. Nelson's campaign aides believe he will emerge victorious once all the ballots are counted.\n\nAnd on the governor's side, Democrat Andrew Gillum -- after conceding the race on Tuesday evening -- has grown more supportive of a recount of late, in part because his deficit to Republican Ron DeSantis is down to 38,000 votes, within the .5% needed for a machine recount. Campaign aides, though, remain clear eyed about the the long odds that Gillum can make up that deficit.\n\nRecounts, which have not officially been authorized in either race, put the outcome of two of the most closely watched races of 2018 on hold, with Democrats hoping for a miracle that could get both Gillum, a candidate who garnered considerable attention in his campaign against DeSantis, and Nelson, an incumbent who Democrats had thought would win his seat going into Tuesday night, over the finish line with a win.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count. Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\" Gillum's communications director Johanna Cervone said in a statement. \"Mayor Gillum started his campaign for the people, and we are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\"\n\nAt no point in the statement, though, did Gillum's campaign withdraw the concession and sources close to the mayor highlight that his outlook hasn't changed since his Tuesday night speech. It it is important to Gillum, these sources said, that his supporters know they are fighting for every vote.\n\n\"We want every vote counted, we believe that there are still votes out there for Mayor Gillum and we want to make sure his supporters know we are fighting for every vote,\" one source said.\n\nGillum and DeSantis have not talked since election night, the source added. Gillum told supporters on Tuesday that he talked to DeSantis and \"congratulated him on what we expect will be him as the next governor of the great state of Florida.\"\n\nFlorida coming down to a recount gives political watchers d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, given the impact the state's recount played on the 2000 presidential election that saw President George W. Bush elected after winning Florida by 537 votes.\n\nAnd the recounts now have echoes of 2000: Gillum's campaign has hired Barry Richard to represent them during the recount. Richard had previously been known for representing Bush during the 2000 recount.\n\nNelson's campaign has hired Marc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who regularly works issues of voter's rights and election protection.\n\nElias told reporters on Thursday that he believes Nelson could come out victorious if there is a full recount. The senator needs to be within .25% to trigger a hand recount of ballots marked as undervotes (voters who did not fill out all available choices on the ballot) or overvotes (voters who made more choices than allotted on the ballot). The hand recount would only occur if there are enough overvotes, undervotes and provisional ballots left to change the outcome.\n\nWhile he was down 57,000 ballots on election night, that total has ticked down to 17,000 votes on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a jump ball,\" Elias said. \"But I firmly believe that at the end of this process, Nelson will prevail.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're doing this not just because it's automatic, but we're doing it to win. A significant number of ballots have not yet been counted and, because of the size of Florida, we believe the results of the election are unknown and require a recount.\"\n\nElias said he and his team are keeping an eye on provisional ballots counted statewide, which he argued tend to favor Democrats, and votes in Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\nThe center of Democratic voting concerns are in Broward County, the second most populous county in Florida, where lawyers believe there is an issue with how voters were calculated for Nelson. Election officials in Broward County have yet to reveal how many total ballots were cast, let alone how many they have left to count. Democrats believe Nelson's margin could shrink even more once ballots from the county -- along with nearby Palm Beach County -- are counted. Both counties are considered areas rich in Democratic votes.\n\nScott's campaign responded by accusing Nelson of trying to \"steal\" the election.\n\n\"It is sad and embarrassing that Bill Nelson would resort to these low tactics after the voters have clearly spoken,\" said a statement signed by Scott's team. \"Maybe next, he'll start ranting that Russians stole the election from him.\"\n\nRepublicans, confident both Nelson and Gillum will lose, have grown clearly annoyed with the process.\n\n\"It would be one thing if it were 3,000 or 5,000 votes -- but 20,000? Come on,\" said a Republican official in Florida. \"This is a waste of time and it is because they can't come to grips with the fact that they lost.\"\n\nBut Democrats got a boost on Thursday when late-added votes flipped the leader in the race for Florida agriculture commissioner.\n\nNikki Fried, the Democratic candidate, has taken a small lead over state Rep. Matt Caldwell, the Republican candidate. Caldwell, a close ally of Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, appeared to be victorious on election night.\n\nHowever, as the vote continued to trickle in, Caldwell's lead shrunk, and two days after the election, Fried has nosed ahead by just over 500 votes.\n\nThis race, like the gubernatorial and Senate races, is certainly headed to a recount.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correctly state which ballots are counted if a hand recount occurs.", "(CNN) Here's what you might have missed Thursday on CNN:\n\n-- Democrats are calling for Matt Whitaker, President Donald Trump's temporary replacement for attorney general and an outspoken skeptic of the Russia investigation, to recuse himself from Robert Mueller's inquiry.\n\n--Georgia Republican Brian Kemp announced he will resign as secretary of state to begin his transition to governor, despite the race still being undecided.\n\n-- A federal appeals court upheld a ruling on Thursday that blocks the Trump administration from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from being deported.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) \u2013 Estados Unidos: el hogar de la libertad, la b\u00fasqueda de la felicidad y la gran mayor\u00eda de tiroteos masivos en el mundo.\n\nPero los tiroteos masivos no son un recuerdo lejano en este pa\u00eds. En octubre de 2017, el atacante de 64 a\u00f1os Stephen Paddock le dispar\u00f3 a una multitud que estaba reunida en el Harvest Music Festival de Las Vegas. 58 personas murieron y m\u00e1s de 500 personas resultaron heridas. Fue el tiroteo en masa m\u00e1s mortal en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos.\n\nY un a\u00f1o antes, en 2016, un ataque en el club nocturno Pulse, de Orlando, dej\u00f3 49 personas muertas. En 2012, Adam Lanza comenz\u00f3 una matanza en Newtown, Connecticut, asesinado a su madre antes de acabar con la vida de 26 estudiantes y personal de la escuela primaria Sandy Hook. En 2007, 32 personas murieron en la masacre de Virginia Tech.\n\nLa relaci\u00f3n \u00fanica de Estados Unidos con la propiedad de armas \u2013consagrada como un derecho en su constituci\u00f3n\u2013 tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 en medio de un debate emocional y divisivo sobre el significado de estas 27 palabras, que dan a sus ciudadanos el derecho a poseer armas. Lo que tambi\u00e9n, en opini\u00f3n de muchos cr\u00edticos, ha ayudado a marcar el comienzo de una cultura que ve a su propia gente morir asesinada a manos de ciudadanos armados: m\u00e1s que en cualquier otro pa\u00eds de altos ingresos en el mundo.\n\nLas muertes relacionadas con armas ocurren en circunstancias tr\u00e1gicas alrededor de todo el pa\u00eds a diario: m\u00e1s de 1.800 personas murieron por armas de fuego solo en 2017, seg\u00fan Gun Violence Archive, un grupo sin \u00e1nimo de lucro. Pero a menudo se trata de tiroteos masivos que reavivan el debate sobre el control de armas en Estados Unidos y que resaltan su posici\u00f3n como un caso at\u00edpico mundial.\n\nSe estima que hay aproximadamente 310 millones de armas de fuego disponibles para los civiles estadounidenses, seg\u00fan un informe del Instituto Nacional de Justicia (NIJ) de 2009.\n\nIndia es el hogar de la segunda reserva de armas de fuego para civiles m\u00e1s grande, estimada en 46 millones.\n\nLos c\u00e1lculos m\u00e1s actualizados \u2013que tienen m\u00e1s de una d\u00e9cada de antig\u00fcedad\u2013 sit\u00faan la reserva mundial de armas para civiles en unos 650 millones. Seg\u00fan Small Arms Survey, organizaci\u00f3n con sede en Suiza, la cantidad de armas de fuego de civiles probablemente ha aumentado desde 2007. La producci\u00f3n de armas de fuego contin\u00faa proliferando en todo el mundo, superando los efectos que podr\u00eda tener la destrucci\u00f3n de las mismas.\n\nSeg\u00fan Small Arms Survey, es imposible identificar el n\u00famero exacto de armas de fuego propiedad de civiles debido a una variedad de factores, incluidas las armas que no se registran, el comercio ilegal y el conflicto mundial.\n\nLos estadounidenses poseen la mayor cantidad de armas por persona en el mundo: alrededor de cuatro de cada 10 dicen que poseen una pistola o viven en una casa con armas de fuego, seg\u00fan un estudio del Centro de Investigaciones Pew publicado en 2017.\n\nYemen, que tiene el segundo lugar en poblaci\u00f3n con armas de fuego per c\u00e1pita (y es un pa\u00eds sumido en un conflicto civil de tres a\u00f1os) est\u00e1 muy por detr\u00e1s de Estados Unidos en t\u00e9rminos de propiedad.\n\nY, cuando se trata de masacres con armas de fuego, Estados Unidos es una anomal\u00eda: hay m\u00e1s tiroteos masivos p\u00fablicos all\u00ed que en cualquier otro pa\u00eds del mundo.\n\nEn febrero de 2017, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, firm\u00f3 una medida que desechaba una regulaci\u00f3n de la era del exmandatario Barack Obama destinada a mantener las armas lejos de algunas personas con enfermedades mentales graves.\n\nLa normativa original era parte de una serie de medidas tomadas por el gobierno Obama para tratar de frenar la violencia armada, despu\u00e9s de que otros esfuerzos no prosperaran en el Congreso.\n\nGlobalmente, las leyes restrictivas para armas de fuego han demostrado una diferencia a la hora de frenar las masacres. En Australia, por ejemplo, ocurrieron cuatro tiroteos masivos entre 1987 y 1996. Despu\u00e9s de esos incidentes, la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica se volvi\u00f3 contra la propiedad de armas y el Parlamento aprob\u00f3 leyes de armas m\u00e1s estrictas. Australia no ha tenido un tiroteo masivo desde entonces.\n\nEstados Unidos tiene una de las tasas m\u00e1s altas de muertes por arma de fuego entre los pa\u00edses desarrollados, seg\u00fan datos de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud.\n\nNuestros c\u00e1lculos, basados \u200b\u200ben datos de la OCDE de 2010, muestran que los estadounidenses tienen 51 veces m\u00e1s probabilidades de morir por disparos que las personas en Gran Breta\u00f1a.\n\nLa mayor\u00eda de los estadounidenses propietarios de armas (dos tercios) dicen que una de las principales razones por las que las poseen es para su protecci\u00f3n personal, seg\u00fan el estudio del Centro de investigaciones Pew. Sin embargo, la mayor\u00eda de las muertes relacionadas con armas de fuego de Estados Unidos se atribuyen a la autolesi\u00f3n.\n\nDe hecho: los suicidios relacionados con armas son ocho veces m\u00e1s altos en este pa\u00eds que en otras naciones de altos ingresos.\n\nSin embargo, a nivel mundial, Estados Unidos registra menos asesinatos relacionados con armas de fuego que muchos otros de sus vecinos del sur.\n\nDe acuerdo a Small Arms Survey, El Salvador presenta la mayor\u00eda de homicidios con armas de fuego del mundo \u2013excluyendo a las zonas con guerras en curso\u2013, con m\u00e1s de 90 personas asesinadas por cada 100.000 habitantes.\n\nEntre 2010 y 2015, Honduras registr\u00f3 los promedios m\u00e1s altos de homicidios relacionados con armas de fuego: 67 de cada 100.000 personas all\u00ed.\n\nVenezuela y El Salvador est\u00e1n muy cerca en ese mismo per\u00edodo de cinco a\u00f1os, con 52 y 49 muertes relacionadas con armas de fuego, respectivamente, por cada 100.000 habitantes.\n\nMientras que la tasa de Estados Unidos durante ese per\u00edodo es de 4,5 homicidios relacionados con armas de fuego por cada 100.000 personas. Las agencias de seguridad de Estaos Unidos no est\u00e1n obligadas a informar sobre asesinatos con armas cometidos la Polic\u00eda. A menudo, tales incidentes se registran como \"homicidios justificables\" y pueden o no estar incluidos en las estad\u00edsticas oficiales de homicidios, seg\u00fan Small Arms Survey.\n\nNota del editor: art\u00edculo publicado originalmente en febrero de 2018 y actualizado", "\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u062a\u0623\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u062d\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0647\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u0643\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0627 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0631\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0645.. \u0641\u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0623\u0628\u0631\u0632 \u0647\u0624\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645\u061f\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 \u060c 08 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) Election Day was Tuesday, but votes are still being counted and some key races remain undecided.\n\nHere's a breakdown of where things stand:\n\nHouse\n\nDemocrats so far have picked up a net of 30 seats in the House of Representatives, with 10 key races still undecided. That brings the current balance of power tally to 225 Democratic-held seats to 200 Republican seats.\n\nHere's where vote count stands in the 11 races still outstanding:\n\nCA-10: Republican Rep.

Mimi Walters leads Democrat Katie Porter\n\nCA-48: Democrat Harley Rouda leads Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher\n\nCA-49: Democrat Mike Levin leads Republican Diane Harkey\n\n(Note: California leaves a substantial share of its votes uncounted on Election Night, and the margins in these seats are too close for a projection until we know how many votes remain to be counted.)\n\nGA-7: Republican Rep.

A hand recount is triggered when the margin is .25% or less.)\n\nGovernors\n\nDemocrats have picked up seven governors' seats, giving them control of 23 governorships. Republicans control 26.\n\nThere is still one race that has not been decided, and another race where an automatic recount could still occur.\n\nGeorgia: Republican Brian Kemp leads Democrat Stacey Abrams\n\n(Note: CNN has not made a projection in the Georgia governor's race.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Just one day after the removal of Jeff Sessions as US attorney general created a serious risk to the ongoing independence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, lawyers for Mueller were in court Thursday defending against a lesser-known but potentially potent threat to his mandate as special counsel.\n\nMore specifically, they are taking on Andrew Miller in federal court. Among the swirl of names involved in Mueller's ongoing investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 election, Miller thus far has been more of a footnote than a headliner. Now, however, Miller -- backed by a conservative policy group -- is being used as a vehicle for a longshot but high-stakes challenge to Mueller's legal authority as special counsel.\n\nThis is a legal Hail Mary. The likelihood of success is low, but if Miller prevails, the impact on Mueller's investigation will be seismic.\n\nMiller has worked for Republican political operative Roger Stone for approximately a decade. While investigating Stone -- who has said publicly that he is \"prepared\" to be indicted by the special counsel -- Mueller subpoenaed Miller and other Stone associates. While others complied with Mueller's subpoenas and testified in the grand jury, Miller refused . Sensing an opportunity to use the Miller subpoena battle to take a bigger swing at Mueller, a non-profit conservative interest group, the National Legal and Policy Center, took up the cause and is helping to cover Miller's legal fees.\n\nMiller's legal argument , in sum, is that Mueller \"wields too much power with too little accountability\" and thus has no authority to act as special counsel. Mueller's appointment as special counsel is invalid, Miller has argued in court, because no specific statute authorized the appointment; because Mueller was not appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and because Mueller was appointed not by the then-Attorney General (Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself) but rather by the Deputy Attorney General (Rod Rosenstein, who by succession filled in for Sessions following the recusal). Hence, Miller claims that Mueller has no authority to issue grand jury subpoenas, or to do anything else for that matter.\n\nAt least one person agrees with Miller: President Donald Trump tweeted in June that \"[t]he appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!\"\n\nUnfortunately for Miller, no judge has agreed with him yet. In August, Federal District Court Judge Beryl Howell firmly rejected Miller's argument, requiring him to comply with the subpoena and testify in the grand jury. Three other federal judges, including one nominated by President Trump, similarly have rejected claims that Mueller was improperly appointed or exceeded the scope of his mandate as Special Counsel.\n\nEven after Judge Howell ordered Miller to comply with the subpoena, he still refused. Accordingly, Judge Howell held Miller in contempt, which can lead to imprisonment. However, Judge Howell agreed to stay the contempt ruling to enable Miller to appeal without having to sit in jail awaiting the outcome. Judge Howell offered a glimmer of hope for Miller, stating that his challenge \"raises legitimate questions...\"\n\nThe case now heads to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, where attorneys for Miller and Mueller will argue the case to a three-judge panel. Miller's chances of success in the DC Circuit look slim. Miller's own attorney stated recently that \"I don't know whether I will win in that court. Quite frankly, I'm not expecting to.\"\n\nHowever, the fight won't necessarily end with the DC Circuit. If Miller loses, he almost certainly will seek to bring the case to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court agrees to hear only a miniscule fraction of the cases in which a party seeks review -- typically below 3% -- and it requires a vote of four of the nine justices to take on a case.\n\nMiller's attorney, however, sees some hope given the recent confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"He would be a good ally because he has talked about these cases before in terms of presidential power and also limiting the power of the government in many cases and he's also written about this very issue of the constitutionality of the independent counsel,\" Miller's attorney said after Kavanaugh's nomination.\n\nWhat happens if the Miller gambit succeeds? Suddenly, Mueller would be stripped of his legal authority as special counsel. That would not necessarily mean the jailhouse gates will be thrown open and that those who already have been charged and convicted -- Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos and company -- walk free. It seems unlikely that a ruling stripping Mueller's authority would apply retroactively, so those folks should not hold their breath.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sessions replacement a critic of Mueller probe Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sessions replacement a critic of Mueller probe 05:21\n\nThe big question is: what happens to Mueller's investigation going forward? Mueller has more business to do. The Department of Justice could pick up the Mueller investigation and run it out of its own Public Integrity Section or Computer Crime Section. Of course, those sections are part of DOJ and likely could not exercise the same level of independence as Mueller has as special counsel.\n\nMueller's work also could be picked up by US Attorney's offices. Mueller already has farmed out pieces of the investigation to US attorneys in the Southern District of New York and the District of Columbia . While US Attorney's offices traditionally enjoy significant independence, they nonetheless are part of DOJ and would be subject to oversight by the Attorney General and others in the DOJ hierarchy. The primary point of Mueller's appointment as special counsel was to place him beyond the normal reach of politics from within or outside DOJ.\n\nState attorney generals in New York and elsewhere also could take on certain pieces of Mueller's investigation. But state attorney generals inherently face geographical and legal limitations. Some part of the crime must have been committed within the state, and conduct is chargeable only if it violates state laws -- which typically do not apply to conspiring with foreign nationals to influence federal elections, for example, among other conduct of likely interest to Mueller.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAny effort to pick up some of Mueller's work would be piecemeal, and the investigation as a whole surely would suffer because of the fragmentation. Crucially, if Mueller vanishes, then it is unclear who -- if anybody -- would be in a position to furnish to Congress a report on the findings of the investigation as a whole. Without such a report, there would be no formal or concrete basis on which Congress or the public could evaluate the investigation, and nothing on which to base a determination on potential impeachment.\n\nMiller's legal challenge to Mueller is about much more than one subpoena. It is about Mueller's fundamental legitimacy as special counsel. If Mueller prevails in this legal battle, then his legitimacy will be confirmed once again. But if Miller pulls out an unlikely win, then everything will change for Mueller -- suddenly and dramatically.", "(CNN) Jason Coffman approached a host of reporters' microphones on Thursday, and with a quiver in his voice, shared the news he had feared receiving all morning: His eldest son was among the 12 people killed in Wednesday night's shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\"His name was Cody Coffman, my firstborn son,\" said Coffman, his voice breaking as he wiped tears away with a tissue.\n\n\"Oh God ... oh son, I love you so much,\" he said, clutching his chest. \"Oh heavenly father, just please be with him.\"\n\nJason Coffman displays a photo of his son Cody outside the Thousands Oaks Teen Center.\n\nCody had just turned 22, and was in the process of talking to recruiters so he could join the Army, Coffman said.

Bernie Sanders offered a preview of what he hopes the party, led by its incoming House majority, will offer up.\n\nSanders, who plans to meet with House allies next week, will push for Democrats there to advance the first step of his \"Medicare for all\" bill's four-year phase-in plan, which would lower the eligibility age for Medicare to 55 from 65 and cover everyone under 18-years-old.\n\n\"That is a wildly popular piece of legislation,\" he told CNN in a phone interview. \"Would I be shocked if Donald Trump says, 'You know what, that's a good idea and I'm going to run around this country telling people that I, Donald Trump, not only saved Medicare but I lowered the eligibility age?' Would I be shocked if he came out and said that? No, I would not.\"\n\nTrump, he said, is a \"total opportunist\" with \"no political ideology\" -- the kind of politician whose thirst for adulation might, under certain circumstances, lead to his signing, or even championing, just about anything.\n\nSanders, who is considering another run at the Democratic nomination in 2020, has often derided the Trump as a fraud who lied to struggling Americans during his campaign. By giving him an opportunity to aid the working class, the thinking seems to go, Democrats could either see their own policy agenda enacted or, in that still unlikely event, force Trump to shoot down what they expect to be broadly popular initiatives.\n\nDemocrats tossed around a similar logic shortly after the 2016 election, when infrastructure was looked at as a potential bridge between the parties. But the Republican-controlled House and Senate, with Trump's backing, decided to plow forward with long-promised plans to repeal Obamacare. Trump, like he did on Wednesday, has occasionally talked up bipartisan negotiations on issues like immigration reform, only to eventually pull back and side with Republican hardliners and step up his own anti-immigrant attacks.\n\nThe difference now, Sanders reasoned, is that Democrats will, for the first time during Trump's time in office, have the ability to set the agenda -- and a real hand to play in any potential negotiations. He is also planning to push House Democrats to move a bill increasing the federal minimum wage.\n\n\"In a few months, what I would hope to see is legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and get that legislation to the Senate,\" Sanders said, issuing a challenge to his Republican colleagues: \"And let the Senate vote against that if they want.\"\n\nSanders isn't the first to view the President's vanity as a potential avenue for advancing his own agenda. But the stakes here would be different, and more fraught, especially for a likely 2020 presidential primary candidate. His standing with the Democratic base -- if not his supporters on the progressive left -- risks damage for even entertaining the idea of engaging with Trump, whose presidency Sanders himself described as an \"existential danger to everything this country stands for.\"\n\nThe complications would grow if Trump takes the bait and, as Sanders put it, uses a potential agreement as a pretense to \"run around the country telling everybody what a great president I am.\" However fanciful it all might seem in the moment, Trump wouldn't be the first president to cut across party lines in pursuit of a political boost following a midterm setback.\n\nSanders dismissed the suggestion that Trump could turn the tables on Democrats, using a relatively short term spike in popularity to grow his own power and eventually do longer term damage to the same programs, like Medicare, that Sanders wants to protect and expand.\n\n\"I think everybody in America will understand the difference between Trump's first two years and this third and fourth year, and everybody will understand that he's responding to what Democrats have done,\" Sanders said. \"If the argument is that suddenly Trump becomes an advocate for a $15 minimum wage is going to make him more popular, more difficult to beat (in 2020), I don't see it that way.\"\n\nThe new balance of power in Washington has lots of people looking at things through a new lens. Even as Trump declared the midterm results a \"Big Victory\" for Republicans, at a press conference on Wednesday, he mused frequently about negotiating with Democrats, including once and potentially future House speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\"We believe that we have a responsibility to seek common ground where we can,\" Pelosi said at her own news conference. \"Where we cannot, we must stand our ground, but we must try.\"\n\nSanders, who like so many other rumored 2020 contenders traveled extensively ahead of the midterms with a handful of stops in states that figure to play a decisive role in the primaries, called the Democratic midterm victories \"a rejection of not only a reactionary president, who has tried to throw millions of people off health care and give tax breaks to billionaires, but also a rejection of his racism and sexism and homophobia and xenophobia.\"\n\nHe touted the successes of the candidates he stumped for, singling out Pennsylvania's newly-elected lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, Michigan Govenor-elect Gretchen Whitmer, whose primary opponent he endorsed before traveling to Ann Arbor last month in a show of support for the nominee, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and the state's Democratic governor, Tony Evers.\n\n\"Evers in Wisconsin was just a wonderful, wonderful victory,\" Sanders said, \"because he ended up defeating one of the most reactionary governors in America, in Scott Walker.\"\n\nSanders called the narrow defeat of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a progressive populist he called his favorite candidate of the 2018 cycle, in the Florida gubernatorial race the most disappointing outcome on an otherwise positive night. But even in losing, Sanders argued, Gillum had smoothed the way for Democrats in future campaigns.\n\n\"What Gillum managed to do in a very difficult state, not to mention dealing with all the racism that comes against him, is run on a progressive agenda and to mount a really, really very strong grassroots campaign,\" Sanders said. \"Enormous amount of excitement. So while he lost, he took Florida a step forward to become a blue state.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - El 7 de noviembre de 2018, doce personas murieron en un tiroteo en un bar de Thousand Oaks, California.

Un mes antes un hombre dispar\u00f3 desde un hotel de Las Vegas hacia los asistentes a un concierto y mat\u00f3 a 58 personas. En junio de 2016, Omar Seddique Mateen abri\u00f3 fuego en un bar gay en la ciudad de Orlando dejando 50 muertos.\n\nEstos episodios se unen a una larga lista de atentados en los que un atacante ha cobrado la vida de varias personas en un mismo incidente.\n\nCuando se trata de masacres masivas, Estados Unidos tiene cifras excepcionales, pues en este pa\u00eds se han registrado m\u00e1s tiroteos que en cualquier otro pa\u00eds del mundo, seg\u00fan un estudio.\n\nEntre 1966 y 2012 hubo 90 tiroteos masivos en Estados Unidos. Seg\u00fan el estudio un tiroteo masivo es un episodio en el que mueren cuatro o m\u00e1s v\u00edctimas y no incluyen las matanzas entre pandillas o asesinatos que involucren a varios miembros de una misma familia. Entre estos tiroteos est\u00e1n el de Orlando, el de Aurora, Colorado, en un teatro de cine y el de la escuela elemental Sandy Hook en Newton, Connecticut, ambas ocurridas en 2012.\n\nMIRA: Cinco gr\u00e1ficas para entender la cultura de armas en EE.UU. frente al resto del mundo\n\nLos 90 tiroteos masivos en Estados Unidos son cerca de un tercio de los 292 ataques que se han registrado en el mundo. Mientras que Estados Unidos tiene el 5% de la poblaci\u00f3n mundial, ese pa\u00eds involucra al 31% de los tiroteos masivos.\n\n\u201cLa gente ha quedado sorprendida por estas estad\u00edsticas\u201d, dice Adam Lankford, un profesor asociado de justicia criminal en la Universidad de Alabama, que hizo el an\u00e1lisis. Lankford present\u00f3 su trabajo en la conferencia anual de la Asociaci\u00f3n Sicol\u00f3gica Estadounidense el a\u00f1o pasado y asegura que esta es la primera investigaci\u00f3n de ese tipo en compara cifras globales.\n\n\u00bfSon diferentes los tiroteos de Estados Unidos?\n\nLankford revis\u00f3 los registros de los incidentes y encontr\u00f3 algunos factores comunes en los incidentes de Estados Unidos que los diferencian del resto del mundo.\n\nEn ese pa\u00eds las personas tienen una gran probabilidad de morir en tiroteos masivos si est\u00e1n en el trabajo o en la escuela. En otros pa\u00edses esos incidentes ocurren t\u00edpicamente cerca de instalaciones militares.\n\nEn m\u00e1s de la mitad de los casos en Estados Unidos, el tirador tiene m\u00e1s de un arma de fuego. En incidentes internacionales, el atacante t\u00edpicamente tiene s\u00f3lo un arma.\n\nEn Estados Unidos hay un promedio de 6,87 v\u00edctimas por incidente, mientras que en los otros 171 pa\u00edses que Lankford estudi\u00f3, el promedio es de 8,8 v\u00edctimas por ataque.\n\nSeg\u00fan el investigador, menos personas mueren en los tiroteos en Estados Unidos porque la polic\u00eda estadounidense se entrena usualmente en c\u00f3mo lidiar con este tipo de incidentes, a pesar de que no suelen ocurrir con la misma frecuencia que otros cr\u00edmenes.\n\n\u201cLa polic\u00eda fue m\u00e1s lenta en responder en otros pa\u00edses y era m\u00e1s propensa a estar menos preparada a la hora de responder\u201d, dijo Lankford.\n\nEl fen\u00f3meno de la imitaci\u00f3n\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 hay detr\u00e1s de estos asesinatos masivos en Estados Unidos?\n\nMuchos de los tiradores en Estados Unidos estaban mentalmente enfermos, seg\u00fan el informe. Pero otros estudios estiman que el n\u00famero de casos de enfermos mentales no ha aumentado significativamente mientras que el n\u00famero de tiroteos masivos se ha disparado.\n\nEstos ataques se triplicaron entre 2011 y 2014, seg\u00fan un an\u00e1lisis de la Escuela P\u00fablica de Salud de Harvard y de la Universidad Northeastern. La investigaci\u00f3n de Harvard muestra que los ataques p\u00fablicos en ese periodo ocurrieron en promedio cada 64 d\u00edas. Durante los 29 a\u00f1os anteriores, estos ocurr\u00edan cada 200 d\u00edas, m\u00e1s o menos.\n\nEn contraste, la tasa general de homicidios y de violencia por armas de fuego en Estados Unidos ha ca\u00eddo significativamente en las \u00faltimas dos d\u00e9cadas.\n\nAlgunos investigadores creen que esas masacres pueden ser \u201ccontagiosas\u201d: una muerte o tiroteo incrementa las oportunidades de que otras puedan ocurrir en dos semanas. Es una \u201cinfecci\u00f3n\u201d que dura cerca de 13 d\u00edas, seg\u00fan encontraron en otros estudios.\n\nEste fen\u00f3meno de imitaci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s pronunciado en EE.UU. porque las armas est\u00e1n m\u00e1s disponibles para las personas que en cualquier otro pa\u00eds. \"El acceso a las armas de fuego es un importante factor para predecir estos incidentes\", dice Lankford.\n\nEE.UU. tiene m\u00e1s armas que cualquier otro pa\u00eds. Hay alrededor de 270 a 310 millones de armas circulando en el pa\u00eds. Con la poblaci\u00f3n de Estados Unidos de 319 millones, eso significa que casi cada estadounidense tiene un arma.\n\nUn poco m\u00e1s de un tercio de los estadounidenses dicen que alguien en su casa tiene un arma, seg\u00fan el Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Pew. El pa\u00eds con el n\u00famero de armas m\u00e1s grande despu\u00e9s de Estados Unidos es la India, con 46 millones de armas en una poblaci\u00f3n de m\u00e1s de 1.200 millones. La India ni siquiera aparece en el top 5 de los pa\u00edses con m\u00e1s tiroteos masivos. Los n\u00fameros muestran que las leyes m\u00e1s restrictivas hacen la diferencia. Lankford se\u00f1ala a Australia como un ejemplo. El pa\u00eds tuvo cuatro tiroteos masivos entre 1987 y 996. Despu\u00e9s de eso, la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica se gir\u00f3 en contra de que las personas pudieran tener armas y el Parlamento aprob\u00f3 leyes m\u00e1s estrictas. Australia no ha tenido un tiroteo desde ese entonces.\n\n\u00bfAcaso el deseo por la fama es un factor?\n\nSin embargo, no se tiene la misma voluntad pol\u00edtica en Estados Unidos. Con alguna excepci\u00f3n, las encuestas realizadas por Pew despu\u00e9s de muchos tiroteos masivos de alto perfil sugieren que los estadounidenses suelen favorecer m\u00e1s la posesi\u00f3n de armas despu\u00e9s de tales incidentes.\n\nLankford tiene otra explicaci\u00f3n que planea explorar en su pr\u00f3xima investigaci\u00f3n.\n\n\"Es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de cuantificar, pero me ha impactado una investigaci\u00f3n que demuestra que ganar fama es uno de los objetivos m\u00e1s importantes de esta generaci\u00f3n\", dijo Lankford. \"Parece que los estadounidenses cada vez m\u00e1s est\u00e1n buscando fama y no existe duda de que existe una asociaci\u00f3n entre la cobertura de los medios que estos delincuentes logran y la posibilidad de que van a actuar\".\n\nLankford dijo que si algo bueno se puede obtener de su estudio, es que el conocimiento puede ayudar a otros a prepararse para lo impensable.\n\n\"Nuestra tasa de homicidios es m\u00e1s alta que las naciones europeas comparables. Sin embargo, en todo caso, es este tipo de ataques los que nos distinguen de manera negativa del resto del mundo y nos dan esta violenta reputaci\u00f3n como un pa\u00eds\", dijo Lankford. \"Francamente, si queremos darle al mundo un mensaje de lo que hemos aprendido de todo esto, ser\u00eda decirles que: 'Es posible que estas cosas ocurran, as\u00ed que prep\u00e1rense y aprendan de ello antes de que ustedes mismos experimenten una tragedia'\".\n\nNota del editor: Art\u00edculo publicado originalmente en agosto de 2015 y actualizado varias veces desde entonces.", "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration announced additional sanctions against Russia Thursday over its ongoing occupation of Crimea and its interference in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Wednesday announcement comes in the lead-up to a high level meeting in Paris where President Donald Trump could cross paths with Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Despite Democrats winning enough seats to take control of the House of Representatives, the President struck an upbeat and at times combative tone, highlighting a handful of Republican victories in the Senate and touting the role he played in helping pull Republicans over the finish line in a few key races. Over the course of nearly 90 minutes, the President made a series of claims about the Democrats, his support among African-Americans, and the Mueller investigation. We checked the veracity of several of them.\n\nThe President touted Republican wins in the midterm election, including adding to the GOP majority in the Senate\n\nClaim: Midterms were \"very close to a complete victory\"\n\nFact check: Putting the best possible spin on the election\n\nThe President exaggerated the extent to which the midterms were a win for him and Republicans. While Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate, flipping several Democratic-held seats, Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, gaining back key oversight powers. And Republicans lost several other key contests in states Trump won in 2016.\n\nWhat Trump seemed most pleased with however was the performance of a handful of Republicans he stumped for, including two Florida candidates -- Ron DeSantis, who is leading the state's gubernatorial election, and Rick Scott, who is ahead of incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson in a race that appears likely to be subject to a recount given the narrow margin. Trump also held a last-minute rally in Missouri for Josh Hawley, who defeated Democratic incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill.\n\nThe President took issue with a question about whether he was emboldening white nationalists.\n\nClaim: \"I have among the highest poll numbers with African-Americans\"\n\nFact check: This is false.\n\nIt's not clear to whom Trump is comparing his African-American approval rating when he calls it \"among the highest,\" but his approval rating among African-Americans remains very low compared to other demographics. Trump won just 8% of the black vote in 2016 and reputable polls in recent months have shown that the overwhelming majority of African-Americans disapprove of his job as President. A Reuters poll showed Trump with 16% of black Americans approving of his job as President at the end of October.\n\nBy comparison, the most recent Republican president, George W. Bush, saw his approval among African Americans fluctuate, from 32% in 2003, to 16% in 2005, according to Gallup polls.\n\nThe President was asked whether he would be willing to trade a fix on DACA for a larger deal on immigration with Congress\n\nClaim: \"We could have done some pretty good work on DACA, but a judge ruled that DACA was OK. Had the judge not ruled that way, I think we would have made a deal.\"\n\nFact check: It is hard to say this is false since no one can say what would have happened without that ruling. Here is what we do know.\n\nA federal judge in August ruled to preserve DACA protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. And while the ruling did kill some of the sense of urgency to forge a legislative solution, negotiations over a DACA deal had already fallen apart months earlier. While Trump several times seemed open to accepting Democratic offers for a deal that would include border security funding, he ultimately rejected all their offers and countered with hardline demands for restricting legal immigration as part of a package.\n\nThe President was asked whether he'd be willing to shutdown the government in order to secure funding for his border wall\n\nClaim: Democrats' \"whole agenda has been to try not giving me anything for the wall.\"\n\nFact check: Mostly false\n\nYes, Democrats have largely been extremely critical of Trump's proposal to build a wall on the southern border., but it's inaccurate to say it's been their whole agenda to oppose it. Democrats have also been open to compromise. A bipartisan group of lawmakers presented Trump with a DACA compromise in January that would offer a year of border wall funding, which he rejected. Later that month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer offered Trump upwards of $20 billion in border wall funding as part of a DACA deal. Republicans in Congress haven't exactly full supported Trump's wall either. The President also failed to mention that the Republican-held Congress passed an omnibus spending bill in March (which he signed) that did not include funding for the border wall.\n\nThe President was asked whether he'd consider removing Robert Mueller\n\nClaim: \"I could have ended (Mueller investigation) anytime I wanted.\"\n\nFact check: Mostly true\n\nMost legal scholars agree that President Donald Trump has the authority to fire special counsel Robert Mueller and bring his investigation to a close. But he would also have to do so through Mueller's direct superior, which until Wednesday afternoon, was the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sessions' former chief of staff Matthew Whitaker is now the acting attorney general, and unless he recuses himself, he now has oversight of Mueller. But the President also knows that doing so would open him up to allegations of obstruction of justice, with Democrats and Republicans alike warning Trump against interfering with Mueller's investigation.\n\nAsked about healing the divisions in the country, Trump brought up the economy and tariffs on Chinese goods\n\nClaim: \"Billions of dollars will soon be pouring into our Treasury from taxes that China is paying for us.\"\n\nFact-Check: False\n\nIt's true that billions of dollars in tariffs are being collected and sent to the US Treasury Department, but that money isn't being paid by China; it's being paid by US companies that import those foreign goods subject to tariffs.\n\nThe President was asked about shuttering a program to counter domestic terrorist groups\n\nClaim: \"We have given funding for that-- a lot of funding.\"\n\nFact-Check: This is true, but slightly misleading.\n\nWhen the Trump administration took office, DHS put a pause on its grant funding designated to community groups to combat violent extremism. The program was re-worked under then Sec. John Kelly and eventually $10 million in grants were offered to 25 grants programs. Funding for these two-year grants is set to run out next September.\n\nIt's true that the Department of Homeland Security has no immediate plan in place to extend its funding of community groups that work to combat violent extremism. Additionally, the office now known as the \"Office of Terrorism Prevention Partnerships,\" was cut down in size under the current administration.\n\nHowever, the DHS continues to operate in different ways to prevent domestic extremism, along with additional federal law enforcement efforts.\n\nAs of now, Congress has not appropriated additional funds to extend or re-issue the grants. When asked if DHS requested Congress to fund the grants past 2019, a DHS official, that was not authorized to speak on the record, said, \"it is not actually in our funding for FY '19.\"\n\n\"But I do expect with further proof that some of these grants are working, that's something that could be reassessed very quickly in the coming months and certainly by this end of this fiscal year,\" added the official.\n\nAccording to the official, of the 25 current grants, 16 of them can be used to address all forms of violent extremism, including both domestic terrorism movements and foreign influence.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Department as of Wednesday afternoon, the day-to-day work of the probe forged ahead on Thursday.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's top deputy, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O'Callaghan, met with lawyers from the special counsel's team, according to a source familiar with the matter -- just as he has been doing on nearly a biweekly basis for months, as CNN previously reported.\n\nIt's a small but illustrative example of how the Mueller probe is likely to function, at least for the time being, in the wake of the abrupt ouster of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nFor nearly 18 months, Rosenstein has overseen the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election because Sessions had stepped aside from all matters related to the presidential campaign.\n\nBut when Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, leapfrogged over Rosenstein and was named acting attorney general in his boss' place Wednesday afternoon, questions immediately began to swirl about who Mueller would report to, whether Whitaker must recuse himself from the investigation given his fierce criticism of it, if Rosenstein would quit and whether Mueller's work will be curtailed.\n\nWhitaker has given no indication he believes he needs to step aside from ultimately overseeing Mueller's investigation, one person familiar with his thinking told CNN Thursday.\n\nThat belief is echoed by White House officials who also do not believe Whitaker needs to recuse himself, sources tell CNN.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, one of the sources said, it would defeat the entire purpose of naming him as acting attorney general since Trump railed against Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nBut Rosenstein is expected to continue to handle the day-to-day management of the probe, as he would for any other significant criminal investigation.\n\nOne source described it as \"business as usual.\"\n\nHowever, the arrangement may prove challenging down the line, or quickly, if Whitaker and Rosenstein disagree on any significant matter.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported Thursday, people close to Whitaker do not believe he would approve Mueller seeking a subpoena of President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile Whitaker has made questionable comments that could create the appearance of a conflict of interest, there isn't an explicit conflict under Justice Department rules, as might arise if -- for example -- he had a family member under active investigation.\n\nAccording to department procedures, Whitaker would have to initiate an ethics review about a potential problem and has not yet done so. And even if ethics advisers at the Justice Department suggested he step aside, Whitaker is not obligated to follow that advice, sources explained.", "(CNN) \u2014 It's the time of year for holiday hosts and guests to start thinking about recipes and menus, housekeeping and houseguests.\n\nAnd a really big question people must answer: Do you really want to stay with family this year?\n\n\"Of course you're staying with us,\" (insert relative here) insists. \"It's no trouble at all, and we have plenty of room.\"\n\nThat may be true, but sometimes staying at a nearby hotel after you travel is more convenient for everyone involved.\n\nCNN spoke with etiquette expert Lizzie Post about how hosts and guests should handle what she calls the \"in-between no.\"\n\n\"You're not turning them down, but you don't want to be in too close.\"\n\nHow to say 'no'\n\nThe holiday visit may go better for everyone if travelers have their own space for some of the time. Getty Images\n\nLife can be chaotic for holiday hosts, and it's OK to let people know that you're not prepared for overnight guests. Hosts who travel a lot before the holidays are likely to have a hard time getting ready for houseguests.\n\n\"It's perfectly OK to say, 'due to schedules and the way this holiday is working out, it would be easier for us if you were able to stay in one of the local inns or hotels,' \" says Post, who is co-author of the 19th edition of \"Emily Post's Etiquette\" and great-great-granddaughter of etiquette icon Emily Post.\n\nRelated content 15 hotels that go all-out for Christmas\n\nOn the flip side, it's also acceptable to turn down a host who's insistent you stay in their home. Just be prepared for some resistance to your decision.\n\n\"It is your choice, but do recognize that you're going to get the, 'oh, why do you want to spend the money?' You are probably going to get a relative pushing back a little bit to encourage you to stay with them.\"\n\nGuests should make their own hotel reservations, but it's helpful for hosts to offer suggestions for places to stay at a range of prices.\n\nHighlight the value of your time together\n\nIf you're sure you'd rather have your own space, be politely firm about the plans you're making.\n\n\"Make sure that you emphasize that the time you're going to be spending together is time that you're looking forward to, because this can look like you don't want to spend that much time with them,\" says Post.\n\n\"Start out by saying 'we are so looking forward to spending the holiday with you, coming over for dinner,' whatever it is that you guys are going to be doing together, really emphasize how thrilled you are to be doing that,\" Post advises.\n\nRelated content Winter holiday travel tips\n\nAnd if you're not?\n\n\"If you're not, I've got to kind of ask you: Why are you going?\n\n\"It's OK to say no at the start before you even have to get into where you're staying and all that jazz,\" says Post. \"You can say, 'I think we're going to stay at home this year, but thank you so much' if you really don't want to be going.\"\n\nTense relationships -- is it best to be honest?\n\nManaging tense relationships is tricky, and there's no set formula.\n\nPerceptions of strain often vary even among those involved. A child may feel stressed about seeing a parent who is really looking forward to their time together.\n\n\"This is so situation-dependent,\" Post says. Bottom line: Setting boundaries is OK, but \"it's all in how you do it.\"\n\nIf you define your parameters in a confrontational or accusatory tone, you're setting the visit up for trouble.\n\n\"I would instead say, 'I know that things can sometimes get tense, so I was just thinking it might be best if I stay at the hotel and then come over for all of the events, and I can even help you prep.' Offer to take part,\" Post says.\n\nWorrying about arguing with family often creates an awful scenario in your head that really doesn't have to become a reality.", "(CNN) A wildfire is hopscotching across a northern California county at a rate of roughly 80 football fields per minute, forcing evacuations, injuring residents and firefighters, and sending families racing from their homes.\n\nA state of emergency has been declared for Butte County due to the effects of the Camp Fire, which began around 6:30 a.m. Thursday and quickly spread, said the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nYet, for every woman who won, many more went home empty-handed. That's no surprise. Few people realize that on election day 1992 -- famously dubbed the \"Year of the Woman\" -- more than three times as many women lost their bids for Congress as won them.\n\nStill, one measure of our progress may be the way voters and the media treat the women who didn't win in 2018. We have to rally, not just around newly anointed winners, but also around those who, after risking it all, after sacrificing months of sleep and time with family, now have to pick up their lives and figure out their next moves. They deserve our enthusiastic support, encouragement and gratitude. They deserve a \"new girls' network\" every bit as powerful as the old boys' club.\n\nHistorically, women who lose elections have faced a harder road back to politics than their male counterparts. In 1978, following her third consecutive loss, US Representative and activist Bella Abzug rebuked the reporters writing her \"political obituary,\" lamenting that , \"If a woman is defeated, she's meant to return to the kitchen. If a man is defeated, he's given time to get a suntan and a shave and go on to other things.\"\n\nFor men, losing is practically a prerequisite for a successful political career. Nearly every US president elected in the last half century has had at least one significant loss on his record. Looking even further back, a president who in many ways defined America was elected to that position just two years after losing a Senate race for the second time ; his name was Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAfter a loss, men can almost always count on a powerful club of mentors and supporters to pick them up, dust them off, offer them a job and position them for their next campaign. Meanwhile, women have often been blamed and shamed, often unjustly, for their defeats. They are urged to step aside to make room for another candidate (often a man) with \"broader appeal.\" Unfortunately, even years later, candidates like Meg Whitman and Martha Coakley still carry the unfair stigma of their defeats.\n\nThen, of course, there is Hillary Clinton, the first woman presidential candidate ever to win a major party nomination, banished to the woods , despite winning the national popular vote in 2016. Bernie Sanders, defeated by Clinton in the primary, remains a rumored 2020 contender\n\nWe must not allow this old double standard to persist. Movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are shining a light on sexism in the media and changing voter perceptions of women candidates. New research from The Barbara Lee Family Foundation confirms that, in today's climate, it's possible for women who lost in the midterms to rebound. Voters say they will no longer penalize women candidates for having lost an election in the past.\n\nVoters will, however, remember how a candidate handled her loss. Our research suggests that a candidate who concedes with a forward-looking message\u2014who frames her loss as a launch and a promise to continue the fight\u2014is more likely to leave voters with a positive impression of her candidacy.\n\nWhat a candidate does with her time between campaigns can also influence her future prospects. The most successful repeat candidates stay engaged in public life\u2014 whether by serving in another political office, conducting a listening tour or helping other women run.\n\nThese findings affirm what current leaders like Senators Lisa Murkowski and Maggie Hassan have already proven through their own inspiring comeback stories: a loss need not put an end to any woman's political ambition. The underdogs and longshots of 2018 have the potential to be frontrunners in 2020 and beyond. For that to happen, women and their allies must stay engaged.\n\nIn 2004, my friend, now-Congresswoman Katherine Clark, lost her first bid for the Massachusetts State Senate.

She has figure out how to be Elon Musk's first boss.\n\nThe Australian telecom executive is taking over from Musk as chairman of Tesla. She immediately assumes the role, but will spend six months transitioning into the full-time job.\n\nMusk was forced out of the Tesla chairmanship as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for providing incorrect information to investors when he said he had \" funding secured \" to take Tesla private.\n\nAs Musk's new boss, Denholm will be a pioneer of sorts. Musk has been the driving force behind numerous companies, including PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company, but he's never really had to answer to a superior.\n\nRobyn Denholm, former CFO of Telstra, will lead Tesla's board of directors after Elon Musk stepped down.\n\nDenholm -- who is walking away from her position as CFO of Australian telecommunications company Telstra -- will have a full plate.\n\nHere are the biggest challenges she faces:\n\nGet Musk to behave.\n\nTaming Musk's sometimes outrageous behavior -- especially on Twitter -- is part of the settlement with the SEC\n\nIt requires the company to \"implement mandatory procedures and controls to oversee all of Elon Musk's communications regarding the company made in any format.\"\n\nBut getting him to behave won't necessarily be easy. Musk told Recode last week that he would continue to tweet in much the same way and only avoid tweeting things that \"might cause a substantial movement\" in Tesla stock during the trading day.\n\n\"I tweet interesting things pretty much as they come to me, and probably with not much of a filter,\" he told Recode. But Denholm will need to make sure he does, in fact, exercise some degree of caution.\n\nHire an adult to help run the company on a day-to-day basis.\n\nSeveral investors and analysts have argued this move is long overdue . Successful tech companies such as Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook ( FB ) hired experienced hands like Eric Schmidt and Sheryl Sandberg to help bring order to the creative chaos at the companies.\n\nA similar hire by Tesla could stabilize a revolving door of top executive talent at the automaker.\n\nMusk has worked well with such an experienced hand at SpaceX, relying on its president Gwynne Shotwell to run the company while he spends at least 80 hours a week at Tesla. He's shown no willingness to bring in this kind of help at Tesla, but Denholm should put such a person in place -- whether Musk likes it or not.\n\nFigure out what company should build next\n\nThe company's Model 3 is a hit , and the company has finally figured out how to build enough of them to make a profit . But what's next for Tesla? Musk keeps trotting out ideas for future vehicles without offering specifics.\n\nAll we know is the Model Y is promised to be available for sale in 2020, and the pickup some undetermined time after that.\n\nBut a clear timeline on vehicle plans would be helpful, not only for potential customers and investors but the company itself. Tesla has had plenty of problems meeting deadlines: it missed a number of production targets for Model 3s before finally hitting its goal in July.\n\nTo keep on track, decisions should be based on what makes sense from a business standpoint, not what is catching Musk's fancy at the moment.\n\nHowever, Musk told Recode that he might want to build a version of the pickup that will be a \"really futuristic ... cyberpunk, 'Blade Runner' pickup truck.\" He added, \"I actually don't know if a lot of people will buy this pickup truck or not, but I don't care.\"\n\nIt's going to be Denholm's job to care what people want to buy, and to make sure Tesla stays focused -- along with Musk too.", "(CNN) The new acting attorney general who is expected to have oversight over special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation has expressed deep skepticism of the probe, including calling Mueller's appointment \"ridiculous\" and \"a little fishy.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general on Wednesday after he fired Jeff Sessions.\n\nWhitaker, formerly Sessions' chief of staff, made the comments on the radio in 2017 before his appointment at the Justice Department. In those appearances, he also said the President did not obstruct justice when he allegedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nIn other radio comments, Whitaker questioned if the investigation into former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was within the scope of the Mueller investigation, said investigating Trump's finances would be outside the Mueller probe's authority, argued there was a case to be made that Mueller's team committed prosecutorial misconduct if they went outside the bounds of the investigation into Russian election meddling, and said Mueller's probe was taking resources away from other investigations.\n\nPrior to joining the Justice Department, Whitaker served as CNN legal commentator for several months in 2017. A US attorney during the Bush administration, he was executive director of the conservative watchdog group the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust. He lost a bid for the Republican Senate nomination in Iowa in 2014 to now-Sen. Joni Ernst.\n\nHere's what Whitaker said in those 2017 radio interviews:\n\nOn the appointment of Mueller:\n\nSpeaking on the \"Rose Unplugged\" radio program in August 2017 , Whitaker said the appointment of Mueller was \"ridiculous\" and it \"smells a little fishy.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, Rod Rosenstein determined that the Department of Justice couldn't handle this in their ordinary course of work, which I think was ridiculous,\" Whitaker said about the deputy attorney general. \"An effort by Jim Comey to get this put in place and have somebody that he's very familiar with in Bob Mueller conducting investigations. So I think it smells a little fishy, but I just hope it doesn't turn into a fishing expedition, because I will be one of them ones jumping up and down making sure the limitations on this investigation continue because that's the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\nWhitaker added that Rosenstein felt \"political pressure\" to appoint Mueller, and that he was \"certain\" the deputy attorney general now regrets it.\n\nOn the possibility Trump committed obstruction of justice:\n\nSpeaking on \"The Sean Hannity Show\" in May 2017, Whitaker said even if the President asked Comey not investigate Flynn, it would not rise to the level of obstruction of justice.\n\n\"Let's assume that the President asked him to stop investigating Flynn,\" Whitaker said. \"That doesn't rise to the level of obstruction of justice and it doesn't sound to me, based on what's been reported, that Jim Comey, as he sat there, believed that the President was telling him to stop the investigation. As you know in the law and in these types of situations, the words and whatever the president did or didn't say is going to be very important. And, if all he did was make a mere suggestion and not an outright command, I don't think that rises to the level of obstruction of justice.\"\n\nOn the investigation into Manafort:\n\nSpeaking on conservative commentator David Webb's radio show in August 2017, Whitaker questioned if investigating Manafort was within the special counsel's scope.\n\n\"What we do know is Paul Manafort's finances are being looked at,\" he said. \"They conducted an early morning raid of his house. It sounds like unannounced, which again, you know, I could riff on this all day about why no-knock warrants are a really bad idea. And they're looking at his foreign bank accounts and his tax records. And you know, that I think is a question of, is that within the scope of the letter that Rod Rosenstein wrote to Bob Mueller in setting up the special counsel.\"\n\nOn investigating Trump's finances:\n\nSpeaking with Webb, Whitaker added the Mueller investigation would be \"invalid\" and \"fraudulent\" if it expanded beyond Russian interference in the 2016 election. Whitaker said it would become a \"fishing expedition\" that was \"very dangerous to the Republic.\"\n\n\"There is a valid argument that if somehow there is not expanded authority sought, that the prosecutor stepped out of the authority and that it's an invalid investigation and the whole basis of the investigation is essentially fraudulent,\" Whitaker said.\n\n\"If they are looking at unrelated to the 2016 election Trump finances, they have crossed the red line and they're outside of the scope of their investigation,\" he added. \"And essentially they are on a fishing expedition which is very dangerous to the republic.\"\n\nOn the Mueller team's \"prosecutorial misconduct\" and the need to speed up the Mueller investigation:\n\nSpeaking with Webb, Whitaker added if the Mueller team didn't handle \"bias\" or what he considered conflicts of interest, it raised the question of if there was prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\"You could have things like prosecutorial misconduct,\" said Whitaker. \"If they don't handle these conflicts well, especially on the special counsel's team. And that there is a real bias or if they do kind of run away and just start investigating whatever they darn well feel like investigating. I think there is a real risk of not only a legal blowback and cases making its way to the Supreme Court on prosecutorial misconduct or whether or not somebody was supposed to recuse based on conflicts.\"\n\n\"I also think there was an interesting comment yesterday from the President on this investigation and that is why don't these folks hurry up,\" he said. \"I mean it is not helping this administration and really not helping the federal government generally to have the president and his associates under the cloud of a federal investigation.

The investigation is ongoing, Garrison told reporters Thursday.\n\nRipley Entertainment, which runs the duck boat tours called Ride the Ducks Branson, said in a statement Friday they are cooperating with authorities in an ongoing investigation of the incident.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of the grand jury process and are continuing to cooperate with the US Attorney's Office and other authorities as they determine the facts surrounding the accident that occurred on July 19th,\" public relations manager Suzanne Smagala-Potts said in the statement.\n\n\"Above all, we are committed to supporting all our guests, employees, and families who were affected by the accident.

It's a higher rate for the 50 largest metropolitan areas combined, with 4.9 people per 100,000 killed by a gun. This is an increase from 2012-13, when the national rate was 3.7 per 100,000 nationwide and 4.1 per 100,000 for major metropolitan areas.\n\nThe rates vary widely by city. For example, there's a higher chance of being killed by a gun in New Orleans than in the Providence, Rhode Island, area. About 1 in 100,000 residents was killed by a gun in Providence and Warwick combined, compared with 16.6 per 100,000 residents in New Orleans.\n\nNationally, homicide was the 16th-leading cause of death, the new report notes. Guns were used in 74% of those deaths. For children between the ages of 10 and 19, guns were used in even more homicides: 87%.\n\nMen and boys were most often the victims of homicides, accounting for 85% of the firearm deaths.\n\nFor suicides, there is also a great variety between cities. Oklahoma City, for instance, saw 13.5 suicides by gun per 100,000 residents, compared with New York, Newark and Jersey City, which combined for a rate of 1.5 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of people older than 10 who are using a gun to kill themselves has increased, too. Researchers don't use statistics from gun deaths for children under 10, because those self-inflicted deaths are probably accidentals, according to the report.\n\nSuicide is the 10th-leading cause of death for everyone over 10, with guns used in half of all those deaths. It's the second-leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 19, with guns used in 42% of those cases.\n\nThough the gun suicide rate for young people is notably lower than for other age groups, the report finds that those numbers are increasing.\n\n\"I rarely take care of a suicide attempt with a gun in the emergency room. The kinetic energy of a bullet is far more effective than taking pills that have a longer duration and more opportunity for intervention,\" said Dr. Stephen Hargarten , director of the Comprehensive Injury Center, associate dean of the Office of Global Health and a professor of emergency medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.\n\nHargarten, who was not involved in the new report, said many groups are working to reduce firearm-related suicides, but it remains \"such a challenging area.\"\n\nThe latest increase in gun-related deaths is similar to the rates seen in the 2006-07 time period, the report said. The US has the world's highest rate of gun ownership by civilians, according to research, and the highest rate of gun-related deaths among industrialized countries.\n\nThe authors of the new report note that it is \"too soon to know\" whether this recent increase in gun deaths represents a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a long-term trend.\n\nHargarten said he hopes the US government will see an increase in gun deaths in the proper frame, \"as a complex biological and sociological disease,\" and increase funding for research. Gun violence is the least-studied of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, a 2017 study found\n\nHargarten said he has seen cities, states and even major medical groups starting to spend more money on this kind of research, but he -- like many others who do research on gun violence -- feels that the federal government needs to \"step it up\" to figure out what is causing this problem.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Where is the federal government in all of this? When there are so many deaths, we need to invest in this issue now,\" Hargarten said. \"Look what we did with HIV and AIDS when it was breaking out in the '80s and '90s. The federal government addressed it, and the complexity and the political issues, and it helped groups most at risk, by investing our resources appropriately, and it made a huge difference in that disease process. It's imperative that we do that for guns.\"", "(CNN) The man behind \"The Grinch\" hopes the film will help grow the hearts of moviegoers.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, who voices the Christmas-hating Grinch in a new animated take on the Dr. Seuss classic, told CNN the holiday story is as timely as ever.\n\n\"When he [Grinch] realizes that Christmas isn't about materialism, it is about joy and kindness and generosity, he says love and kindness are the things we need most and the world needs a lot of love and kindness at the moment,\" Cumberbatch told CNN.\n\nThe actor said he felt pressure in voicing such an iconic character.\n\n\"I like a challenge,\" Cumberbatch added. \"It's not the first iconic character I've done, and hopefully it won't be the last.

Over the weekend, they had reached out to a number of U.S. reporters who cover online disinformation, including me.\n\nAt that point, though, there wasn't much to report \u2014 just a random, anonymous website making wild claims about the Russian group outsmarting the American intelligence community and Silicon Valley and their efforts to prevent a repeat of 2016, when the trolls successfully posed as Americans on social media in an effort to sow chaos and discord.\n\nThen on Monday night, Facebook announced that, acting on a tip from the FBI, it had taken down a network of Facebook and Instagram accounts due to concerns that they were tied to the IRA.\n\nFacebook didn't disclose what accounts it had taken down. Only the FBI, Facebook, and the people behind the pages themselves should have known what they were.\n\nBut on Tuesday night, that odd website posted a list of Instagram accounts that it said included some of those which had been taken down \u2014 and it got the list right\n\n\"This evening a website claiming to be associated with the IRA published a list of Instagram accounts they claim to have created. We had already blocked most of these accounts yesterday, and have now blocked the rest,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber security policy, said in a statement late on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 2018 midterm election was in some ways a test for American intelligence and for tech companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google. They had failed to stop Russian meddling in 2016, but promised to do better in 2018 and 2020 and beyond. Until Election Day, with some exceptions, it seemed that they had indeed done better.\n\nBut the website and the boasts it contains raise new questions about that. Was there in fact a successful Russian meddling campaign going on under everyone's noses? Or were these empty boasts, bluster meant to cover up for a lack of impact this time around and make the IRA seem more effective than it is? If it is bluster, was the IRA ineffective in this election because it was stymied, or because it didn't try? Is this website and network even really the work of the IRA?\n\nSome of the accounts were designed to appeal to activists on the left; some looked like they were run by supporters of Donald Trump. Others weren't political at all: There were fan accounts for Rihanna, Kid Rock, Kendrick Lamar and a porn actress, for instance. The IRA has previously used a similar tactic, running a network of seemingly innocuous accounts, often about pop culture, to build up an audience, before eventually exposing that audience to divisive political content.\n\nOn the other hand, though their content may have been relatively innocuous, some of the accounts had tens of thousands of followers and had been running for more than a year.\n\nCNN reviewed archived versions of the accounts, and saw no material explicitly about the midterm elections, but CNN was unable to review all of the accounts' posts because of the removals.\n\nThe website that posted the list of the accounts proclaimed, \"Citizens of the United States of America! Your intelligence agencies are powerless.\"\n\n\"Despite all their efforts, we have thousands of accounts registered on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit spreading political propaganda,\" they claimed, adding, \"Hundreds of your fellow citizens are our unintentional agents unaware of the fact that they actually act for the good of the Russian 'troll farm.'\"\n\nIf the message is indeed from the group, it is its most brazen attempt at claiming responsibility for a misinformation operation in the U.S.\n\nFacebook's statement on Tuesday night hinted that the group was indeed the IRA. CNN has not independently confirmed this. The FBI, which Facebook has said provided the tip that led to the accounts, did not comment when contacted by CNN on Tuesday night.\n\nBut a statement that the FBI released with other intelligence and law enforcement agencies on Monday warned, \"Americans should be aware that foreign actors -- and Russia in particular -- continue to try to influence public sentiment and voter perceptions through actions intended to sow discord. They can do this by spreading false information about political processes and candidates, lying about their own interference activities, disseminating propaganda on social media, and through other tactics.\"\n\nThat may be exactly what happened in this instance \u2014 a disinformation effort about disinformation efforts.\n\nWhatever the motivation behind the website, the last-minute election surprise may serve as a teaching moment for Silicon Valley and US intelligence \u2014 both of which touted their preparedness for this year's election after acknowledging widespread failures in 2016. After all, even if these accounts had no real impact, they still managed to go undetected until just before the election.\n\nEmails sent to the address on the website went unanswered Wednesday.

George Washington University Hospital early Thursday, Arberg noted: \"Tests showed that she fractured three ribs on her left side and she was admitted for observation and treatment.\"\n\nFalls are \"incredibly dangerous,\" said Dr. Adam Shiroff, director of the Penn Center for Chest Trauma and an associate professor of trauma surgery at Penn Medicine. \"Every trauma center across the country sees falls as an incredible problem, particularly in the elderly.\"\n\nHow common are broken bones in the elderly?\n\nRib fractures are among the most common bone breaks in older adults. In one study of older adults, 33% of rib fractures were caused by moderate trauma, such as a fall, though 40% of cases showed no such obvious trauma and so were probably caused by something else, such as a cough or a repetitive movement , perhaps swinging a golf club or a garden rake.\n\nThe danger lies in life-threatening complications, which can occur when rib bones move out of alignment, leading to punctures and damage to the lungs, critical blood vessels or other organs, according to the Mayo Clinic\n\n\"I would say dying from complications of rib fractures is twice that in the elderly population compared to the younger population,\" said Shiroff, who has not treated Ginsburg. \"It's not necessarily the broken rib that causes these patients to do poorly. It's the underlying pulmonary mechanics that is the problem.\"\n\nHe said a rib fracture is \"a broken bone, like anywhere else.\" However, you don't have to walk on a leg while it's broken, but \"every time you breathe, the broken ribs move, so it's literally like walking on a broken leg.\"\n\nWhat complications can result from broken ribs?\n\n\"People tend to breathe less with broken ribs, and that leads to multiple other problems, including a high risk of pneumonia, because they're not taking deep breaths,\" Shiroff said. There are also issues with adequate pain control, which is \"paramount.\" Narcotic painkillers may dull the aches, but they also decrease a patient's ability to breathe, so they are \"a double-edged sword,\" he added.\n\nCNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta also noted that \"the biggest issue in anyone with a rib fracture is the pain and the impact on lung function. All of these risks are dramatically increased in the elderly.\"\n\nIncreasingly, trauma centers are providing surgery to rib fracture patients, particularly if the person has a \" flail chest ,\" in which a portion of the rib cage is separated from the rest of the chest wall, Shiroff explained. In these cases, a patient requires an operation to stop the rib from moving and to allow the lungs and chest to function in a normal fashion, Shiroff said.\n\nResearch suggests that anatomical differences between young and elderly people, including osteoporosis (more fragile bones) and decreased muscle mass, are the cause of higher death rates among the elderly.\n\nNearly 19% of older adults who broke three or four ribs died of complications, one study found\n\n\"That's about right,\" Shiroff said. \"There's an old saying: Once you get over a couple of rib fractures, it's about a 10% risk of dying per rib.\" Still, he cautioned that this is \"older data, and that's before there was this aggressive push to fix these things early and not just rely on pain medicine for support.\"\n\nWhat treatment will Ginsburg receive?\n\n\"A patient like the justice, having three rib fractures, will likely be observed in the ICU,\" Shiroff said, adding that a younger patient with the same condition might not spend a single night in the hospital. \"So that's a profound difference and underscores the impact of being elderly.\"\n\nAfter close monitoring in the ICU, she will probably be moved to the hospital floor, where her condition will be observed as she starts getting up and moving about, he said. If her pain can be managed, she will probably be sent home or to inpatient rehab, depending on the seriousness of her fractures.\n\nBecause a second fall is a dangerous possibility, trauma centers \"make efforts to ensure that patients have homes that are safe,\" Shiroff said. \"A member of the health care team will actually go to the patient's home and evaluate them for things that may lead to further falls.\"\n\nRugs that aren't appropriately tacked down and coffee tables in between the bedroom and the bathroom are common issues. \"If that coffee table has been there for 30 years, why move it now?

Kavanaugh, and his new colleagues have kept a low profile dealing with a docket of under the radar cases since his narrow Senate confirmation last month.\n\nRead More", "\u062a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \"\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u064a\u0631\" \u0625\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0642\u0627\u0644\u062a 6 \u0645\u0648\u0638\u0641\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0645\u0632\u0627\u0639\u0645 \u0639\u0646 \u0642\u064a\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0635\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0647\u0645 \u064a\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0644\u0642\u0627 \u0628\u0625\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0623\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0631/\u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633 \u060c 08 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "A college country night at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, turned deadly when a gunman forced his way in and opened fire on people gathered there, killing 12 people.", "(CNN) Police have found the stolen SUV used in the kidnapping of 13-year-old Hania Aguilar, but the North Carolina teen is still missing.\n\nSurveillance video shows the wanted SUV minutes after the girl was abducted.\n\nThe vehicle was found just before 8 a.m. on Thursday less than 10 miles from the mobile home park from which Hania vanished Monday, authorities said.\n\nInvestigators asked the public to help find a green 2002/2003 Ford Expedition, which was caught on surveillance cameras near Aguilar's home minutes after she was abducted.

[The pressure] is there, it's not going to go away.

Jetblack promises same or next-day delivery with free returns.\n\nAt $50 a month, Jetblack is unlikely to have much appeal beyond wealthy shoppers in big cities willing to pay a premium for convenience. But pushing out Jetblack to the rest of the country is not Walmart's long-term goal.\n\nInstead, Walmart ( WMT ) is betting that Jetblack will give the company insights into \"conversational commerce\" \u2014 shopping through text messages, online chats, and voice commands \u2014 that could become the next wave of retail.\n\nGetting personal\n\nPersonalized shopping programs are the latest trend in retail. Jenny Fleiss, the CEO of Jetblack, co-founded Rent the Runway before launching Jetblack.\n\nBut Jetblack is the first company to develop out of Store No. 8 \u2014 Walmart's tech incubator. Store No. 8 is tasked with developing companies that will help Walmart stay ahead of shopping trends.\n\nThe incubator is the brainchild of Marc Lore, who founded Jet.com and moved over to Walmart when it bought his startup two years ago for $3.3 billion.\n\nJenny Fleiss, the co-founder of Rent the Runway, runs Jetblack.\n\nLore is high on Jetblack's potential. \"I couldn't be more excited about this one,\" he said last month at the company's annual investor day.\n\n'Conversational commerce'\n\nThe service relies on artificial intelligence and team of buyers to respond to members' text requests with a curated menu of choices pulled from Walmart.com, Jet.com, as well as other retailers like Pottery Barn.\n\nJetblack membership includes an extensive onboarding process, so the service knows which brands and sizes customers prefer.\n\nMembers can text Jetblack to ask for gift recommendations.\n\nWalmart predicts that shoppers may want to buy stuff by text or a simple voice command in the future, rather than browsing through thousands of choices online. The company believes shoppers may not need a separate device like an Amazon Echo either when they already have a smartphone in their pocket.\n\n\"People are not going to \u2014 10, 20 years from now \u2014 be using search the way they do today,\" Lore said last month.\n\nCowen retail analyst Oliver Chen shares that view. \"Search bars of today may become like cassette tapes,\" he predicted in a research report.\n\nTesting ground\n\nTo win in a text and voice-shopping future, Walmart will have to deliver accurate suggestions and master fetching products for customers on demand.\n\nWalmart is experimenting early, when conversational commerce is still in its infancy. Building up millions of conversations will help the company develop algorithms to automate service in the future. With automation, Walmart might be able to offer a cheaper version for its mid-market customer base.\n\nThe Jetblack pilot has already taught Walmart some valuable lessons about customer habits\n\n\"More and more families are going to be shopping by just texting,\" Fleiss said in June.\n\nFor example, Jetblack members prefer text over voice because the service can send them back pictures of products. In about a third of Jetblack's conversations members ask for product recommendations.\n\nLore said last month that Jetblack is getting better at handling those requests: 79% of the time, members take Jetblack's recommendations.\n\n'New interactions'\n\nInstead of going to a store and choosing the right product off a shelf, members are trusting Jetblack to do all the work for them. That's a big responsibility, and Jetblack can't afford to get it wrong.\n\nJetblack is being trusted for recommendations and has to manage members' high expectations, said Ron Adner , professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Darmouth University's Tuck School of Business.\n\nAnalysts also wonder if startups like Jetblack can mesh with the world's largest retailer.\n\n\"If you go to Jetblack, you really have to dig around to figure out it's a Walmart company,\" noted Evan Neufeld, vice president of intelligence at consulting firm Gartner L2.\n\nThat's by design. Companies that emerge from Store No. 8 are shaped by Walmart. A Walmart executive will sit on the board of each of them. But Lore said in October that Store No. 8 companies would be \"ring fenced\" from the larger operation.\n\nThat independence could make it difficult to integrate these companies into Walmart, where a much bigger market and set of demands are at stake.\n\n\"This underlines the question of whether and how Walmart will be able to harness the potential success of these startups in its core business,\" Adner said.", "\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0645\u0627 \u0632\u0627\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629.. \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f 6 \u0623\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0632\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634\u061f\n\n\u0623\u0646\u062c\u0644\u064a\u0646\u0627 \u062c\u0648\u0644\u064a \u062a\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0642\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0647\u0627\n\n\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0648\u062a\u0644\u0639\u0641\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0642\u0629.. \u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \"\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0629\" \u062a\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0623\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\n\n\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)\u2014\u0623\u0641\u0627\u062f\u062a \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 (\u0648\u0627\u0639)\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0645\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0646\u0641\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0641\u062e\u062e\u0629 \"\u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0646\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0639\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644\".\n\n\u0648\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0645\u0631\u0643\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0641\u062c\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0633\u0641\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0633\u0642\u0648\u0637 \u0639\u062f\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u064a\u062f \u0648\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062d \u0641\u064a \u0635\u0641\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0641\u0636\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0646 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062b \u0623\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0639\u0645 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0644\u0647\".\n\n\u0648\u0644\u0641\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u064a\u0629 \"\u0637\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b \u0648\u0628\u0627\u0634\u0631\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0629 \u0623\u0633\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0647\".", "Los Angeles (CNN Business) Google CEO announced a number of internal changes Thursday in response to global employee walkouts over the company's handling of sexual harassment.\n\nAmong the changes, the company will no longer force employees with sexual assault or harassment claims into arbitration.\n\nThe elimination of forced arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases is one of several sweeping changes Google employees called for with a coordinated protests at Google offices one week ago . Notably, the policy update does not apply to all discrimination claims.\n\n\"We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you,\" wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai in an email to staff , published in a blog post, explaining its policy updates.\n\nThe company hosted a town hall with employees shortly after the post published.\n\nThe walkout was sparked by outrage over a New York Times investigation published October 25 that detailed years of sexual harassment allegations and secret multimillion-dollar severance packages for executives accused of misconduct.\n\n\"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes,\" Pichai wrote.\n\nThe company also pledged to call out the number of sexual harassment claims and substantiated rates within its Internal Investigations report, according to a more detailed policy memo linked out in the blog post. However, the company does not plan to make this information public, despite the request to do so by the protest organizers.\n\nPichai said the company will update and expand its sexual harassment training, and employees are now required to complete training annually instead of every two years. It will also overhaul how it deals with employee concerns. Google said it will offer \"extra care and resources\" for staffers, including extended counseling and career support for those filing concerns.\n\nGoogle also spelled out the need to crack down on alcohol consumption, which is frequently noted in harassment complaints. The company specified \"harassment is never acceptable and alcohol is never an excuse.\" Leaders at the company are \"expected to create teams, events, offsites and environments in which excessive alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged,\" the memo said.\n\nHowever, not all changes demanded by employees have been addressed, including a commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity. Employees requested Google's chief diversity officer, Danielle Brown, report directly to Pichai, to signal how seriously the company sees diversity and inclusion. Workers also pushed Google to add an employee representative to the board. But the company did not address these requests in its policy updates.\n\nIn a statement Thursday afternoon, organizers said while they \"commend\" the progress, \"the response ignored several of the core demands \u2014 like elevating the diversity officer and employee representation on the board \u2014 and troublingly erased those focused on racism, discrimination, and the structural inequity built into the modern day Jim Crow class system that separates 'full time' employees from contract workers.\"\n\nSome Google's contract workers spoke out on Twitter following the announcement, stating they were \"excluded\" from the town hall that took place Thursday.\n\n\"This deliberate slight demonstrates the caste-like system deployed by Google, which fails to protect its workers and our colleagues,\" the Tech Workers Coalition tweeted", "(CNN) A mass shooting with 12 people dead is probably the last way that Geoff Dean wanted to end his 40 years with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDean is stepping down after seven years as sheriff just as a gunman went on a rampage Wednesday night at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\"It can't be any worse,\" Dean said of his final hours on the job.\n\nNear the end of a news conference later Thursday, Dean casually told reporters he was retiring at midnight Friday.\n\n\"But I will certainly be a part of the family.\"\n\nThat family included Ventura County sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, who was among those killed at the bar late Wednesday.\n\nHelus, 54, had been with the department for nearly three decades and was nearing his retirement, Dean said.\n\n\"They're mourning,\" he said of the sheriff's office, which has about 700 officers. \"They're sad. It's awful. Ron was a great guy. He was close to everybody. He was a hard worker, and our hearts are broken all over.\"\n\nThe deputy was married and had a son.\n\n\"He went in there to save people and made the ultimate sacrifice,\" Dean said of Helus.\n\nHelus usually spoke with his wife on the phone several times during his shifts, Dean said. The deputy was on the phone with her shortly before entering the bar.\n\n\"Hey, I have to go handle a call,\" Dean said Helus told his wife. \"I love you. I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nDean believes Helus and other officers saved lives by going into the packed bar.\n\n\"It could have been much, much worse,\" the sheriff said.\n\nA lifelong Californian, Dean was born in Los Angeles and raised in Simi Valley, according to the sheriff's office website.\n\nHe and his wife of 31 years, Marlene, have two children: Lindsey, 29, an attorney; and Andy 26, who's in marketing and sales.\n\n\"We've got to do something about the hate,\" Dean recalled telling members of a local synagogue after the mass shooting at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"And we've got to do something to just spread the love and reach out and help people and be patient with them and understand them because this will touch so many lives around our community.\"", "\"We welcome those who come here to exercise their First Amendment rights in a safe and peaceful manner; however, we prohibit them from breaking the law,\" the D.C. police said. \"Last night, a group of protestors broke the law by defacing private property at a Northwest, DC residence. MPD takes these violations seriously, and we will work to hold those accountable for their unlawful actions. There is currently an open criminal investigation regarding this matter.\"\n\nEarlier, Carlson told the Washington Post , \"It wasn't a protest. It was a threat.\" He said \"they were threatening me and my family and telling me to leave my own neighborhood in the city that I grew up in.\"\n\nCarlson told the Post that one of the individuals \"actually cracked the front door\" of his home.\n\nCarlson was at his Fox News office across town, preparing for his 8 p.m. talk show, when the disturbance occurred. His wife Susan was home alone.\n\nAccording to a police report provided by the Metropolitan Police Department, Susan said \"she heard loud banging and pounding on her front door.\"\n\nWhen she went to investigate, she \"saw a large group in front of her home. They had a bull horn and were chanting loudly. She retreated to a room in the rear of her home and summoned police.\"\n\nWhen police arrived on scene, they found about 20 people, according to the police report.\n\nThere was an anarchy symbol spray painted on the driveway. \"There were also signs left on the vehicles parked in the driveway as well as a sign left on the front door of the home,\" according to the police report.\n\nSome of the signs were seized as evidence. The police report describes the incident as a \"suspected hate crime\" and says the motivation was \"anti-political.\"\n\nCarlson, one of the top hosts on Fox, is a top target of progressive critics. They say Carlson supports white supremacy through his commentaries and programming choices -- a charge he flatly denies.\n\n\"The incident that took place at Tucker's home last night was reprehensible,\" Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace said in a statement on Thursday. \"The violent threats and intimidation tactics toward him and his family are completely unacceptable.\"\n\n\"We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view,\" the executives said. \"Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation. Those of us in the media and in politics bear a special obligation to all Americans, to find common ground.\"\n\nFigures on the left and right quickly denounced the Antifa group's action. Former Fox host Megyn Kelly tweeted: \"This has to stop... He does not deserve this. His family does not deserve this. It's stomach-turning.\"\n\n\"This is not okay,\" CNN host SE Cupp wrote. \"By the political left, the political right or the deranged. Don't do this.\"\n\n\"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert weighed in as well, saying \"Fighting Tucker Carlson's ideas is an American right. Targeting his home and terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice. Obviously don't do this, but also, take no pleasure in it happening. Feeding monsters just makes more monsters.\"\n\nOne of the leaders of Media Matters, a liberal media monitoring group that opposes Fox, also condemned the incident.\n\n\"This behavior is way over the line,\" senior fellow Matthew Gertz tweeted. \"Going to someone's home, breaking their door, and terrorizing their family is unacceptable. It's also extremely counterproductive if your interest is actually in reducing his influence.\"\n\nMax Boot, a conservative columnist and CNN commentator, said he agreed with Gertz.\n\n\"I think Tucker is a terrible influence on modern America but that doesn't justify harassing him at home,\" Boot tweeted. \"Go high, not low.\"", "New York (CNN Business) New Age Beverages recently announced it intends to launch a line of CBD-infused waters, teas and other drinks in the United States.\n\nThe company already makes Bob Marley-branded organic coffees and teas and Coco Libre coconut water and kombucha drinks.

is already in conversations with many retailers about selling its potential line of CBD drinks.\n\nBut the plan depends on Congress passing the Farm Bill, which would make it legal to produce hemp and

Thursday to begin his transition to the state's top office.\n\nThere's just one issue: Two days after the polls closed, the race is still undecided. CNN has not projected a winner.\n\nKemp currently leads Democrat Stacey Abrams, with 50.3% of the vote. But there are still ballots to count. If Kemp's share drops below 50%, the contest would automatically go to a run-off on December 4, even if he ends up as the top vote-getter.\n\nFor now, Kemp's lead stands at about 63,000 votes. The Secretary of State's office made public a spreadsheet with a county-by-county breakdown of the more than 21,000 outstanding provisional ballots. The Abrams campaign, which is staffing up for a legal fight, says there are additional ballots, many of them absentee, that have not yet been accounted for.\n\n\"Brian Kemp is 25,622 votes above the threshold for a runoff election. Twenty-five thousand votes of nearly 4 million cast are at issue in this race,\" Abrams campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said on Thursday. \"By (Kemp's) own admission, there are at least 25,000 outstanding votes, and hundreds if not thousands of more that we are learning about and discovering every day.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) LISBON -- Two years after a campaign marred by hacking, the Democratic National Committee's chief technology officer thinks they may have avoided a similar situation in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIn his first interview after the midterm elections at the Web Summit conference, Raffi Krikorian told CNN Business they \"didn't hear much\" on Election Day -- but said the DNC remains on alert for trouble.\n\n\"Remember, any sophisticated attack is not something we're going to detect today, it's something we're going to detect a few days or a few weeks or a few months from now,\" he said.\n\nA sophisticated hacker would figure out a way around the alerts and monitors the DNC has set up, he said. So now the DNC is in the middle of a post-mortem study.\n\n\"We'll do a bunch of checking against what the elected counts look like, if the voter file looks different than from a week ago, scouring of all our network traffic logs,\" Krikorian said.\n\nRead More", "London (CNN) Black-and-white televisions haven't yet gone the way of the dinosaur in the UK.\n\nMore than 7,000 households still use monochromatic television sets more than half a century after color transmissions were first broadcast across the UK, the licensing body, TV Licensing, said in a statement.\n\nLondon is home to the most black-and-white licenses in the country, at 1,768 , followed by 431 licenses in the West Midlands and 390 in Greater Manchester in the north of England, the body said.\n\nThe number of monochromatic licenses issued has been declining in recent years. There were 212,000 in 2000, but fewer than 10,000 in 2015.\n\n\"Over half of the UK's TVs now connect to the internet, so it's interesting that more than 7,000 households still choose to watch their favorite shows on a black and white telly,\" Jason Hill, spokesperson for TV Licensing, said in the statement.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl sospechoso estuvo en servicio activo con el Cuerpo de la Infanter\u00eda de Marina de EE UU. desde agosto de 2008 hasta marzo de 2013\n\nNo se conoce el motivo del atacante y tampoco se sabe de ninguna conexi\u00f3n entre Long y el bar de Borderline\n\nEsto es lo que sabemos sobre Ian David Long hasta el momento\n\n(CNN) - El hombre armado que mat\u00f3 a 12 personas en el Borderline Bar & Grill en Thousand Oaks, California, era un veterano de 28 a\u00f1os de la Infanter\u00eda de Marina que tuvo enfrentamientos previos con la ley, dijeron las autoridades.\n\n\n\nMIRA: Polic\u00eda revela el nombre del supuesto atacante del tiroteo en Thousand Oaks\n\nEsto es lo que sabemos sobre Ian David Long hasta el momento:\n\nEl cuerpo del atacante fue encontrado en el bar\n\nEl tirador est\u00e1 muerto y su cuerpo fue encontrado dentro de la barra, dijo la polic\u00eda.

When a decision is made, she will go wherever she wants to go. It is a free country; she is a free national. She can go wherever she wants to go. No one can object to that. If a free national of Pakistan wants to go somewhere, he/she has to get a visa and go. Nothing odd about that.\"\n\nViolent protests orchestrated by the Islamist movement Tehreek-e-Labbaik, or TLP, broke out in Islamabad and Lahore following the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nThe demonstrations were subdued through a deal between the Pakistani government and the TLP in which the government agreed not to oppose a review petition filed against the judgment.\n\nThe government also agreed not to oppose a TLP application to add Bibi to a list preventing her from leaving Pakistan, as well as to release everyone detained in connection with the protests.\n\nBibi's appeal drew Popes' support\n\nBibi, a mother of five from Punjab province, was sentenced in 2010 after she was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during an argument a year earlier with Muslim colleagues.\n\nThe workers had refused to drink from a bucket of water Bibi had touched because she was not Muslim. At the time, Bibi said the case was a matter of women who didn't like her \"taking revenge.\"\n\nUnder Pakistan's penal code, the offense of blasphemy is punishable by death or life imprisonment. Widely criticized by international human rights groups, the law has been used disproportionately against minority religious groups in the country and to go after journalists critical of the Pakistani religious establishment.\n\nBibi's case has attracted widespread outrage and support from Christians worldwide, particularly Catholics.\n\nWhen her family met with Pope Francis in February at the Vatican, the Pontiff reportedly described Bibi as a \"martyr,\" according to ACN President Alessandro Mondeduro.\n\nFrancis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also called for Bibi's release.\n\nIn her 2012 book, \"Get Me Out of Here,\" Bibi included a letter to her family urging them not to \"lose courage or faith in Jesus Christ.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - En uno de los muchos primeros de la noche de elecci\u00f3n: Colorado eligi\u00f3 a Jared Polis, que ser\u00e1 el primer gobernador abiertamente homosexual del pa\u00eds. \u00c9l tiene una pareja desde hace mucho tiempo: Marlon Reis.\n\nEl hecho de que no solo vaya haber un hombre gay en la mansi\u00f3n de la gobernaci\u00f3n, sino una pareja gay, no pas\u00f3 desapercibido entre los seguidores de Polis.\n\nLa gente enloqueci\u00f3 cuando Polis present\u00f3 a Reis como el \u201cprimer, primer caballero\u201d, durante su discurso de victoria.\n\n\u201cQuiero agradecer\u2026 a mi red personal de apoyo, primero y sobre todo, por supuesto, a mi extraordinaria pareja, y el primer \u2018primer caballero\u2019 de la historia de Colorado, Marlon Reis\u201d, dijo Polis ante una multitud entusiasta.\n\nPolis no dijo mucho m\u00e1s al final, pero el aplauso sigui\u00f3 por mucho m\u00e1s tiempo.\n\nPolis tambi\u00e9n fue el primer hombre abiertamente gay en ser elegido en la C\u00e1mara en 2008, antes de que el matrimonio entre parejas del mismo sexo fuera legalizado a nivel nacional.

At this point, an incorrect autopilot altitude setting -- which gave a target altitude of zero feet -- meant it \"pitched nose-down and then descended rapidly,\" investigators said.\n\nWhen the commander, one of four crew on board, realized what was happening, he swiftly disconnected the autopilot and regained control of the aircraft, which was descending at a maximum of 4,300 feet per minute.\n\nThe descent was so steep that the crew \"subsequently reported that they had become visual with the ground during the recovery,\" the report said.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is considering former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to replace fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump fired Sessions on Wednesday without immediately naming a replacement, instead installing Sessions' chief of staff Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. Both Christie and Bondi are longtime political allies of the President's and were initially considered contenders for the Justice Department perch during the transition.\n\nLabor Secretary Alexander Acosta also is under consideration, according to a senior Senate Republican aide and a source familiar with the process.\n\nGiven Trump's long-standing frustrations with Sessions, other potential contenders have cropped up in Trump-friendly circles in recent months, including Whitaker, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, former Judge John Michael Luttig, Judge Edith Jones, former Judge Janice Rogers Brown, retiring Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.\n\nIf nominated, Christie, a former US attorney, could face similar calls to the ones Sessions faced to recuse himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation given his role as a prominent 2016 campaign surrogate for Trump. But unlike Sessions, there is no indication he had contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign or transition.\n\nChristie attended a previously scheduled law enforcement roundtable on prison reform efforts at the White House on Thursday morning, an administration official and source familiar with the meeting said.\n\nChristie then met privately with the President's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to further discuss prison reform issues, an administration official who works on the prison reform effort said.\n\nKushner and Christie have long been reported to have bad blood stemming from Christie's role as US attorney in prosecuting Kushner's father on 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations.\n\nBut the administration official said Kushner and Christie have a good relationship.\n\n\"They've been working really closely on this for months,\" the administration official said. \"Despite the fact that people have suggested otherwise, the two have a really close and good working relationship, particularly as it relates to prison reform.\"\n\nThe official did not believe Christie met with Trump on Thursday.\n\nPrison reform has been a key agenda item for Kushner and Christie would likely be an important ally in that effort were he to be tapped for attorney general.\n\nWhile Christie has been a friend of Trump's since before the 2016 campaign, the former New Jersey governor has been critical of Trump's handling of the Mueller investigation and instead praised Mueller amid the President's public criticism of the special counsel.\n\n\"I've told him (Trump) many times that there's no way to make an investigation like this shorter, but there's lots of ways to make it longer, and he's executed on a number of those ways to make it longer,\" Christie said in May at the University of Chicago, while calling Mueller \"an honest ... hard-working guy.\"\n\nChristie has also rejected arguments by Trump's personal legal team that the President cannot obstruct justice, calling it \"an outrageous claim\" on ABC this summer.\n\nChristie has not responded to CNN requests for comment.\n\nFor her part, Bondi's second and final term as attorney general will end in January, but her spokesman declined to say whether she is under consideration for the top Justice Department job.\n\n\"As the attorney general has repeatedly said, she has not yet made a decision as to what she will do next,\" Bondi spokesman Whitney Ray said in an email.\n\nBondi could face significant hurdles to confirmation over a controversy surrounding the $25,000 contribution her political action committee received from Trump's foundation during her 2014 re-election bid. The donation came around the time Bondi's office was reviewing complaints about Trump University and Democrats leveled allegations of impropriety after her office declined to pursue an investigation into Trump University fraud allegations.\n\nA Florida ethics panel cleared Bondi of wrongdoing last year.\n\nMany Trump allies like Bondi, who appears frequently on Fox News, and she has long enjoyed a good relationship with the President.\n\nAcosta, however, has already been confirmed, is seen as less of a headache than some others under consideration and is aligned with the Federalist Society, which has deep ties to the White House and top Senate Republicans. The source familiar with the process described other names in the running, like Bondi, as \"unconfirmable.\"\n\nAcosta is receiving praise from notable Washington attorneys and GOP allies.\n\n\"Given Secretary Acosta's track record -- former Supreme Court clerk, former senior official at DOJ, former US attorney -- he would be a strong choice to be the next attorney general,\" said Matthew Heiman, former Justice Department national security attorney.\n\nCNN has reached out to Acosta for comment.\n\nThe White House has not responded to CNN requests for comment.\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, declined to name contenders for the attorney general job, but said several people are in contention for the post.\n\n\"There are many people in contention for that position just because there are many qualified people who would like to do it,\" Kellyanne Conway told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIt is not clear when Trump intends to nominate a candidate for attorney general. Whitaker can serve in the position as acting attorney general for 210 days, according to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.", "(CNN) As reboots go, \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\" features several notable upgrades, including Claire Foy as its star, and a revamp of its central character from an eccentric hacker into an almost-Batman-like vigilante. The result is a slick thriller that trades in some of the moody atmosphere that draped earlier versions for a more straightforward action vehicle.\n\nFoy -- miles away from her role in \"The Crown\" -- drops the tiara and picks up a taser as the latest Lisbeth Salander, the aforementioned hacker. The film comes seven years after the U.S. version of \"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\" which itself followed a trio of Swedish-language movies adapting the late Stieg Larsson's books.\n\nWorking here from another story written by David Lagercrantz, who assumed authorship of the series, the plot begins with a flashback to Lisbeth's dark youth and the life she escaped, before jumping to the present, where she's shown dispensing her own brand of justice.\n\nEnlisted to help an inventor (Stephen Merchant) who has created a dangerous computer weapon, Lisbeth suddenly finds herself in the crosshairs of a very bad, ruthless cabal. While she's not the kind to grow overly attached to people or possessions -- including, fortunately, her apartment -- she vows to \"take back what he stole from me,\" a decision with ominous consequences.\n\nDirected by Fede Alvarez (from a script he adapted with Jay Fasu), this \"Spider's Web\" is aptly named, inasmuch as there are several strands that unspool simultaneously before gradually coming together. Those include the journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Swedish actor Sverrir Gudnason), who seeks to assist Lisbeth; and an American national-security agent (Lakeith Stanfield), who journeys to Stockholm seeking to recover the stolen item for the U.S.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Back in April, officers in Thousand Oaks, California, responded to a disturbance at the home where Ian David Long lived.\n\nLong, a 28-year-old who served in Afghanistan with the Marines, was acting somewhat irate and a little irrationally, according to Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean\n\nA mental health specialist with the crisis team met with him and felt he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. But after speaking with him, they decided not to detain him under laws that allow for the temporary detention of people with psychiatric issues.\n\nSeven months later, officers swarmed his home again for a very different reason: a mass shooting.\n\nLong was identified by police on Thursday as the gunman who killed 12 people and injured more than a dozen more in a sudden burst of violence at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks. Authorities have no motive yet.\n\nAuthorities have identified a Facebook post believed to have been made by the shooter around the time of the attack, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn it, the writer says: \"I hope people call me insane... (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah.. I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening...\"\n\nWhen CNN read the post to a friend of Long's, who did not want to be publicly identified, the friend said, \"That does not sound like Ian to me at all. I don't know what was going through his head when he wrote this. It must have been terrible.\"\n\nShooter began firing outside\n\nSurvivors of the shooting said the gunman, dressed in black and wearing glasses, shot a security guard outside and then shot a young woman working at the counter just inside the door before opening fire on others.\n\nOne of the victims , Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus , was fatally shot when he entered the bar and tried to stop the rampaging gunman, Dean said.\n\nPolice found Long dead of what Dean said he believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot.\n\nOne handgun, a legally purchased .45-caliber Glock, was at the scene. The gunman used an extended magazine in the shooting, Dean said.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor to the bar\n\nOn Thursday morning, Dean said he did not know of any connection between Long and the Borderline bar.\n\nBut Long's friends told CNN he was there frequently.\n\nPolice identified Ian David Long as the gunman in the mass shooting.\n\n\"We would go to Borderline together. He really liked it,\" said one woman who has been friends with Long for five years and does not want her name made public.\n\n\"I would make fun of him, because he would drag me there. Sometimes we'd go there to have a drink, sit and talk, listen to music,\" she said.\n\nBorderline, a Western-themed establishment known to regularly host country, salsa and swing dancing nights, was hosting a college country night on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"There was a community there. He was a part of that community. The whole bar is line dancing. People do choreographed dances for hours, cowboy boots and hats in the middle of the suburbs of Thousand Oaks,\" the friend said.\n\nA person who was a friend of Long's until their early 20s and who did not want their name revealed publicly similarly said they used to go to Borderline together. The friend expressed shock that Long could be a killer.\n\n\"I don't know what the hell happened. He was always happy. I never thought this would ever come from him. We used to go snowboarding all the time. He was a good guy,\" the friend said.\n\nA third friend who did not want to be publicly identified said Long stopped communicating two years ago but said the shooting was unlike him.\n\n\"He wasn't unhinged, he wasn't violent. He was a sweet guy who served his country and was using his GI Bill to go to college and get a degree to help more people,\" the friend said. \"Out of our group of friends I thought the highest of him.\"\n\nTodd Stratton, who knew Long from high school, was at Borderline but didn't get a good enough look to recognize the shooter.\n\nHe said Long had anger issues in school but it was nothing that concerned him.\n\nHe was in the Marine Corps\n\nThe gunman was a corporal in the Marines from August 2008 to March 2013, according to Defense Department records.\n\nHe went to Afghanistan from November 2010 to June 2011.\n\nThomas Burke, a pastor who served with Long in the same US Marine Corps regiment, said Long's battalion arrived during intense fighting in Helmand province.\n\nBut Burke warned against too quickly blaming Long's actions on trauma experienced during war.\n\n\"PTSD doesn't create homicidal ideation,\" Burke said. \"We train a generation to be as violent as possible, then we expect them to come home and be OK. It's not mental illness. It's that we're doing something to a generation, and we're not responding to the needs they have.\"\n\nLong posted information about his military service on a special forces forum called ShadowSpear in March 2017.\n\nUnder the name \"doorkicker03,\" Long said he was an infantry machine gunner while in the Marine Corps for 4\u00bd years, and was an instructor in Okinawa in Japan.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Mass shooting at California bar Molly Esterline is hugged by David Crawford on the scene of a shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, on Thursday, November 8.

But the study identified that those three individual factors -- smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure -- are more likely to be linked to heart attacks in women, showing the need for more awareness efforts targeted at women on the issue of heart diseases.\n\nMillett's work is part of a broader bank of studies on gender differences in non-communicable diseases by the George Institute.\n\n\"This strengthens the need for people to remember to look at women and men when studying heart attacks,\" Millett said.\n\nBecause her latest work is an observational study that can't explain causes, Millett stressed the need for more research into why this gender difference exists.\n\nNearly half a million British people enrolled in the UK Biobank were studied. They were between the ages 40 and 69 and were recruited between 2006 and 2010. They were followed for an average of seven years by Millett's team. Of the 471,998 participants, none had a history of cardiovascular diseases. The researchers found that 5,081 of those people had their first heart attack during the course of the study, 28.8% of them women.\n\nHigh blood pressure was the leading factor; it raised a woman's risk of heart attack by 83% more than it raised the risk in a man. Smoking raised a woman's risk of heart attack 55% more, while Type 2 diabetes -- which is linked to a poor diet -- had a 47% greater impact on heart attacks among women compared with men.\n\nStudies have identified some risk factors affecting women at a higher rate than men. Millett's study examined the impact of three such risk factors and found that their disproportionate impact on women persisted across age.\n\nDeaths from heart attacks are lower among women than man at younger ages, according to the study, and previous research showed that women experience their first heart attack nine years later than men, on average.\n\nCombined with an aging population, this is likely to see \"women catching up with men\" in terms of heart attack rates, Millett explained. This would cause \"a subsequent significant additional burden on society and health resources,\" the authors of the study noted.\n\nThe study has some limitations. The UK Biobank project consists mainly of white participants, which makes it hard to generalize the findings to other groups. Millett also said that the participants examined were of slightly higher socioeconomic status than others in the UK.\n\n\"Regardless of your sex, risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking and diabetes increase the risk of a heart attack. These findings should not distract from a concerted effort to better detect and manage risk factors that can be changed,\" Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, wrote in an email.\n\nAccording to the British Heart Foundation, about 188,000 hospital visits each year are due to a heart attack. Every year, about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"What we want is for women to be more aware that heart attacks happen to women as well as men,\" said Millett. She believes there is a lack of awareness in women about heart diseases because men are more affected by them.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe study also highlights the need for doctors to be vigilant when their female patients are elderly, smoke, have diabetes or have high blood pressure. Doctors must ensure that women and men have equal access to health care programs addressing these conditions, researchers said.\n\nMillett added that awareness is crucial, as heart attack symptoms can differ for men and women. A few symptoms -- such as unusual tiredness, dizziness or cold sweats -- are more common in women than men, she explained.\n\n\"It's absolutely vital that everyone has equal access to the best advice and treatment regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status,\" Avkiran wrote. \"This is an important reminder that heart disease does not discriminate, so we must shift perceptions that it only affects men.\"", "(CNN) Rep.

The request at this late stage of the investigation came as something of a surprise to lawyers involved, given that the Mueller team has been focused for months on Stone and his activities before the 2016 election.\n\nAmong the questions Mueller has asked the President to provide written responses on are queries about Stone and his communications with then-candidate Trump, according to a source briefed on the matter.\n\nDespite the change in leadership at the Justice Department, the Trump legal team believes it won't affect its approach to the Mueller questions, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe President and his lawyers have been aiming to return answers to Mueller's questions later this month, according to one source familiar with the matter. No final decision on an in-person interview has been made.\n\nBut Trump's legal team and other lawyers representing witnesses in the investigation expect that the President's responses to Mueller could be one of the final pieces of the 18-month-long probe before the investigators present a report on their findings.\n\nTrump made clear once again in a news conference Wednesday he believes the investigation is a waste of time and money.\n\n\"It's a disgrace, it should have never been started because there was no crime,\" Trump said.\n\nEven after Mueller completes his work, Tuesday's midterm election results mean that House Democrats will also be in a position to expand investigations of Trump. That means Mueller will not be the end of Russia-related questions of Trump and his campaign.\n\nJUST WATCHED Former FBI Agent: Mueller may no longer be protected Replay More Videos ...

And at least one -- author and well-known conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi -- is still in discussions about potentially appearing for a second time before the Washington, DC, grand jury that Mueller has been using for the investigation.\n\nOver the last two months, Corsi has been talking to Mueller's investigators \"in a really constant basis,\" he said in a video he posted online on Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, Mueller's team is set to appear in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to defend the special counsel's authority as another one of Stone's former associates aims to quash a subpoena for grand jury testimony.\n\nStone has denied any wrongdoing and has said he didn't have any inside knowledge about plans by WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign stolen by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the election.\n\nStone insists he never shared anything about WikiLeaks with then-candidate Trump.\n\n\"I never discussed any of this with Donald Trump,\" Stone told CNN recently. \"It's one of the questions that Mr. Mueller wants the President to answer -- one of the written questions. I'm highly confident that his answer will be that he knew nothing about it. We just never discussed it.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Stone told CNN, \"I never visited Trump Tower after August of 2015 until the President-elect asked me to visit him after the election.\" Stone said he visited just one time around late November of 2016 or early December, and that this was his last visit to Trump Tower.\n\nThe conversation during that one visit was \"mostly congratulatory. It was innocuous. Nothing heavy.\"\n\nIn terms of phone calls in 2016 with Trump, he says they were \"occasional and in all cases initiated by him. And we never discussed WikiLeaks.\"\n\nAll signs point to an investigation that is winding down, though Mueller hasn't provided any timeline for completing his work.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roger Stone on his alleged role with Wikileaks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Roger Stone on his alleged role with Wikileaks 08:33\n\nElection's impact on Mueller\n\nEven with the Mueller probe seemingly nearing its end, the Russia meddling investigation and its impact is expected to reverberate for months.\n\nThe White House is seeking to hire as many as two dozen lawyers for the counsel's office, which will soon by led by Pat Cipollone, following the departure of Don McGahn, sources briefed on the search say. The legal firepower, the President's lawyers believe, will be needed as newly empowered Democrats launch a new round of probes, including pursuing parts of the Trump-Russia matter that Republican leaders had blocked.\n\nOne of the important questions the new White House legal team is expected to have to address is whether any of Mueller's findings can be shared with either Congress or the public given executive privilege concerns, which could block release of some or all of Mueller's work.\n\nUnder Justice Department regulations, Mueller is required to produce a \"confidential report\" at the end of his investigation, which includes \"the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.\"\n\nBut the regulations do not require that Mueller's report be released to the public, and with Whitaker taking over, it is not clear whether he will choose to release it at all, or in what form.\n\nOne of the sources familiar with the matter said the report will be detailed in part because Mueller's team wants to make sure it withstands public scrutiny. It is expected to include an analysis of the allegations, any information or statements made over the course of voluntary interviews, a legal explanation of why the evidence didn't meet the prosecution bar and an overall defense of the investigation.\n\nHow much the Mueller team has accomplished remains a subject of partisan debate. Critics of the President cite guilty pleas from top Trump campaign associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and his deputy Rick Gates, as well as Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser.\n\nSo far the Mueller team has brought charges against 35 people and entities, secured six guilty pleas, and prison sentences against three people.\n\nSupporters of the President argue that none of the guilty pleas, and the one court conviction, have had anything to do with the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is what Mueller is supposed to be investigating. The new acting-attorney general has questioned in the past whether there is any obstruction to investigate.\n\nSecond-guessing of Mueller\n\nEven inside the Justice Department, there's been second-guessing of some of the Mueller team's work.\n\nOne particular focus has the Mueller team's decision earlier this year to include a Russian company among entities and people charged related to operating an internet troll farm that played a central role in Russian interference efforts in 2016.\n\nSome Justice Department lawyers raised concerns about charging the company, for fear it could force the government to share information in discovery that could end up with the Russians.\n\nThose concerns have proven prescient in recent months as the company, Concord Management, hired US lawyers to fight the special counsel in court on a series of fronts. The Concord lawyers have won court permission to access to sensitive information used to bring the charges, though the judge has restricted what can be shared with foreign nationals.\n\n\"What a lot of people thought were vulnerabilities in the indictment are now coming to light,\" said one former Justice Department official.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes doubts were discussed among Justice Department lawyers, some of whom were consulted by the Mueller team before the charges were brought.\n\nA spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.\n\nSome DOJ lawyers have groused that the Mueller team should have taken a less risky course by focusing the indictment against the Russian nationals, without the companies and entities. That's because since the individuals wouldn't likely respond to the charges and subject themselves to US legal process.\n\nGiven the legal fight that has ensued, DOJ will have to handle the upcoming trial in the case and any other legal matters that arise from it, perhaps long after Mueller has wrapped up his inquiry.", "The Southern California city, where at least 12 people were killed in a shooting Wednesday night at a bar, is considered one of the safest cities in the nation.\n\n\"It's a residential community, very quiet, very conservative,\" Steve Moore, a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent, told CNN.\n\nViolent crime is so rare there that locals often joke police don't have much to do other than to give speeding tickets to drivers.\n\n\"We are consistently ranked one of the highest with respect to the lowest crime rate per capita; we're proud of that,\" Thousand Oaks mayor Andy Fox told CNN.\n\nLocals feel safe enough there to forgo some of the routine precautions other city dwellers take. They leave their purses in their cars, leave their doors unlocked and their drinks unattended in a bar.\n\nThis safe oasis, with its proximity to Los Angeles, has attracted Hollywood stars, who've moved to the area with their families to live a \"normal\" life. Will Smith, Wayne Gretzky, Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber and others have been spotted in the stands at high school football games there, cheering on family and friends.\n\nThe bar was loved by adults of all ages\n\nBut that sense of tranquility was shattered Wednesday with the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill. Considered something of a community unto itself, the regulars at Borderline include a healthy mix of young adults looking to dance and flirt and middle aged regulars hoping to show off their line dancing or swing dancing skills.\n\nThe place has a relaxed, open vibe. There is a bar in the middle, a dance floor on one side and pool tables on the other.\n\nWednesday night is college night, when Borderline attracts students from nearby schools such as Pepperdine and California Lutheran University. On nights when it gets packed -- and college nights often are -- big industrial-size fans spin in the corners to help keep everyone cool.\n\nMadeline Carr, news editor at the student paper the Pepperdine Graphic, knew some of those who were inside when the shooting started.\n\nShe told CNN the bar opens up to anyone over the age of 18 on Wednesdays and described it as a \"fun spot for dancing.\"\n\n\"Pepperdine's a pretty small community, a pretty sheltered community ... so it's one of these events that it's hard to rationalize it happening here,\" she continued.\n\nThe residents worry things will never be the same\n\nResident now fear that this tragic, deadly shooting will change everything about the city they love so much.\n\n\"We're a little community. We're the safe haven,\" resident Betty Harrah told CNN. Her son witnessed the shooting.\n\n\"It's tragic that we're all experiencing this.\"\n\nFox, Thousand Oak's mayor, said in this day and age, mass shootings like this can strike anywhere.\n\n\"The reality is that these types of incidents can happen really at any place, at any time, even in communities that are considered extremely safe,\" he said.", "(CNN) Four soft targets in two weeks: a grocery store in Kentucky, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, a yoga studio in Florida and now a college bar in Thousand Oaks, California .\n\nAny ruthless attack on people is shocking, but attacks on soft targets are particularly disturbing. Soft targets represent simple, daily life. People come and go. They expect to be safe as they pick up a cup of coffee, deposit their paychecks, fill prescriptions or grab a bite to eat. Their guards are down.\n\nThe death toll in the four recent incidents has been stunning, with 27 people slain:\n\n\u2022 Two shoppers gunned down October 24 in the parking lot and inside a Kroger in Jefferson, Kentucky.\n\n\u2022 Eleven people attending Shabbat services killed October 27 when an armed man walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue. Six people were wounded, including four responding police officers.\n\n\u2022 Two women, a physician and a college senior, shot to death November 2 inside a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Florida . The gunman wounded four other people.\n\n\u2022 And on Wednesday, 12 people killed and more than a dozen injured when a masked man opened fire inside a bar in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nThese places typically are safe, and they're supposed to be accessible. The ease of ingress and egress is key to their success, in some cases.\n\nToo often, bad people know this.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dad: I tracked his phone, it's still at the bar Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dad: I tracked his phone, it's still at the bar 02:05\n\nThe US State Department recently addressed these types of attacks on its blog, DipNote.\n\n\"Attacks on public spaces -- locations where civilians work, dine, shop, and vacation -- are tragic for the innocent lives lost as well as the violent assault on a country's daily way of life,\" the September post said\n\nWhile the blog post addressed terrorism (authorities have not classified any of the latest four attacks as terrorism yet) the strategy for protecting a soft target is complex, no matter who is targeting it.\n\n\"Restaurants, stadiums, and entertainment venues are designed to be open and accessible, leaving them vulnerable,\" according to the blog post. \"The types of places attacked vary, as do the types of attacks, which generally involve some combination of suicide bombers, gunmen, hostages, or low-tech tactics that turn knives or vehicles into murderous weapons.\"\n\nAmerica has faced the threat so many times -- at a theater in Aurora, California, at a concert in Las Vegas, at the Boston Marathon. Every school shooting is an attack on a soft target.\n\nJUST WATCHED Police: It's a horrific scene, blood everywhere Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: It's a horrific scene, blood everywhere 00:50\n\n\"It's not like trying to get into a government building or trying to get onto a plane. We've hardened those targets,\" CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said.\n\nA former FBI agent, Gagliano said he knows that there are some people out there who will demand security anywhere people gather to revel or conduct routine business. While he's not sold on the argument, he sees the merit in the debate, he said.\n\n\"Even if you had an armed guard, there ... action is faster than reaction. That armed guard, in all likelihood, would've been the first casualty,\" he said. \"Now, the counterargument is, yes, but that's a deterrent. I think we have to weigh that and look at it.\"\n\nLaw enforcement experts say there are ways to make oneself less of a target. There are active shooter trainings all over the country that instruct people to avoid, deny and defend\n\nThe training is about knowing where the exits are and planning an escape before anything goes awry. In the event of a shooting, people should barricade doors, turn off lights, silence phones and hide, preferably behind something bulletproof. If all else fails, fight like hell, experts say.\n\nJUST WATCHED Witness: I heard 18 to 20 rounds at a time Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Witness: I heard 18 to 20 rounds at a time 00:45\n\nBut that speaks only to what happens after the attack is underway. Prevention would be preferable, which is why the US Department of Homeland Security earlier this year published a guide to securing soft targets and crowded places\n\nIt calls on everyone -- business owners, first responders, government agencies and the general public -- to do what they can to protect their own patch.\n\nThere are resources to help understand what constitutes suspicious behavior and what behaviors might indicate a pathway to violence, as well as instructions on how businesses and houses of worship can identify threats and secure their venues. There are also resources for conducting proper bag checks at large venues, as well as ways businesses can stop the sales of precursor chemicals for explosives.\n\n\"Given the increased emphasis by terrorists and other extremist actors to leverage less sophisticated methods to inflict harm in public areas, it is vital that the public and private sectors collaborate to enhance security of locations such as transportation centers, parks, restaurants, shopping centers, special event venues, and similar facilities,\" DHS says.\n\n\"Securing these locations and venues is essential to preserving our way of life and sustaining the engine of our economy.\"", "Social media and smartphones have created an era of unprecedented levels of sharing: where you're going, what you're doing, who you're with, at all times of the day and night.\n\nFoursquare cofounder Dennis Crowley helped usher in that phenomenon.\n\nHe started Foursquare in 2009 as a social network that let you 'check in' at various locations to let your friends know where you were and earn points and badges. The idea behind the rewards was to get users to explore the world and have more fun.\n\nBut it didn't make for a great business model. After concerted efforts to monetize its assets , Foursquare has transformed itself into a \"location intelligence\" platform for consumers, businesses and developers.\n\nUsers search \u2014 and get recommendations \u2014 for places to eat, shop, drink or visit in 150 countries. Businesses pay to access data from Foursquare's technologies to measure foot traffic and better target ads. And app developers pay to use its location technology.\n\nThe company has partnered over the years with many brand-name companies, including Samsung, Airbnb, Uber and TripAdvisor.\n\nCNN asked Crowley, now the company's executive chairman, what gave him the idea for the company, the scariest part of his job and what makes him happy today.\n\nWhat was your inspiration for Foursquare?\n\nHarry Potter's Marauder's Map. In 2000, while reading one of the Harry Potter books, I was struck by the idea that having a Marauder's Map in New York City would be a great way to make the city easier to use. So before smartphones, apps or GPS, we invented the idea of a \"check in\" to allow people to share their location with others.\n\nYears later, we invented a technology called Pilgrim , which allows us to understand where a phone is located and how phones move in and out of different spaces, without the check-in. This piece of tech enables all sorts of cool experiences for consumers, like the smart mobile recommendations from Foursquare City Guide ; it's used by advertisers, in our product Foursquare Attribution ; and it's embedded into our R&D projects like Marsbot . It's also now relied on by other brands who want to engage with consumers as they move through the world.\n\nWhat's the scariest part of your job?\n\nHaving 250+ people looking up to you, expecting you to have all the answers.\n\nPro tip: The only way to get past this is build a strong team that feels confident they have great answers to many of these questions.\n\nWhat brings you the most joy?\n\nMy family. Seeing my kids and my brother's and sisters' kids all sharing toys together. Seeing my parents overwhelmed with grandkids running around their house. After all the time I spent heads-down building a company, this is truly the best.\n\nIf you could have dinner with any influential figure from any time period, who would it be?\n\nYou know that Apple television commercial from the late 1990s ( \"Here's to the Crazy Ones...\" )? I'd be honored to meet any of them. [Editor's note: Apple's Think Different ad campaign featured everyone from Albert Einstein to Martin Luther King, Jr. to Bob Dylan.]\n\nCrowley (left) walks with his chief financial officer, Rory Parness.\n\nIf I had to pick just one, and this may be a super cliche answer, but I'd choose Steve Jobs. He dreamed just as big and just as crazy as anyone in that ad, and he did so in a way that changed the way almost everyone on the planet connects with the people in their lives and the world they live in.\n\nWhat would you like to be remembered for?\n\nHelping people do the thing that they didn't think they'd be able to do. Sometimes the biggest hurdle in startups is \"just getting started\" and people need one last push, which ends up being the difference between \"not doing it\" and \"doing it.\"\n\nI love developing crazy ideas that challenge the way people think about the world.\" Dennis Crowley, cofounder of Foursquare\n\nI try to share this knowledge with entrepreneurs all the time. I love talking to people about their big ideas for the future. Knowing that I've helped inspire people to pursue their dreams (in the same way that other tech founders and entrepreneurs did for me) never gets old, and is always energizing.\n\nIf you weren't executive chairman of Foursquare, what would you be?\n\nI'd be a founder again because I love developing crazy ideas that challenge the way people think about the world \u2014 and impact how we'll all explore and connect in 5, 10, 15 years. I like to think I've done it three times already: with Dodgeball, with Foursquare, and with Kingston Stockade , a Division 4 soccer team we started in the Hudson Valley. [Editor's note: Dodgeball, a location-based social network, preceded Foursquare and was bought by Google in 2005.]\n\nWhat's the best piece of advice you ever received?\n\nFrom my dad: \"You can't eat newspapers!\" ... meaning that even if you have a super interesting, buzzworthy idea that gets lots of press and attention, that's an entirely different ballgame from figuring out how to turn it into a business.\n\nWhat's your advice to people searching for inspiration?\n\n\"Do what you love and the rest will come\" ... it really is good advice and I'm happy to pass it along. If you wake up every morning thinking of this one thing, and how the future would be just a little bit more awesome if this thing existed \u2014 then go do that thing, go build that thing.\n\nHow many hours of sleep do you get?\n\nI've lived through the period of Foursquare where all I did was work, eat and sleep. And I've lived through the part of Foursquare when I would wake up every night stressing.\n\nThese days work doesn't keep me up at night because we have such a great team. But it's the kids \u2014 we have two kids under 3 years old. Still, I probably get right around 8 hours a night (which is great!), but I also can't remember the last time I slept past 7 a.m.\n\nWhat's your favorite podcast?\n\nThe Daily . Every morning. At 20 to 30 minutes, the length perfectly matches my 25-minute walk to Foursquare headquarters in New York City. And I feel smarter after I listen to it.\n\nUpdated: This article has been updated to remove a reference to Foursquare's user count.", "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "Austin, Texas (CNN) \u2014 Miguel Vidal remembers the moment when he knew what he would serve at his new restaurant, even though it was still a dream.\n\nVidal grew up in San Antonio, Texas, and has worked in restaurants since he was 15 -- refining his technique and palate, training himself to eventually open his own restaurant.\n\n\"I went home, and my dad had made a brisket.

But it might be difficult for customers to do the same.\n\nFor my review, the device arrived packed in a large matte-black suitcase, escorted by a single professional security guard. The agent would not leave the delivery with a doorman or let them look inside -- and I had to show ID.\n\nThe device features a voice-controlled screen designed primarily for video chatting with Facebook friends and doubles as an Alexa speaker. It's Facebook's first stab at consumer hardware outside of Oculus headsets and has been in the works for a year and a half at the company's hardware lab.\n\nThe Portal+ is a pricey gadget with always-listening microphones and a camera made by a company known for privacy issues. The timing of the original announcement came less than two weeks after Facebook revealed a massive hack that impacted 30 million users.\n\nWe used two $349 Portal+ devices to make video calls, try on augmented reality filters, watch videos and listen to music. We didn't get to test the smaller, cheaper version \u2014 the $199 Portal (no plus) \u2014 that does many of the same tasks.\n\nThe hardware: Towering but sleek enough\n\nThe Portal+ is basically a 15-inch tablet mounted on a speaker. The display can rotate, so the device had to be tall enough to hold the screen on its side but still show the camera above and some speaker below. It makes for a bulky and heavy device that I had a hard time finding a home for. If you can get over the size, the shape and feel, the hardware is attractive but forgettable enough. It comes in black or white.\n\nThe screen quality is decent, but because it pulls in video chats from the users' phone cameras and wireless connections, you may get a low-resolution result on a big screen. Music sounds solid on the speaker, but audio on video calls is distant and flat.\n\nThere is a button that mutes the microphones and disables the camera when it's not in use. It also comes with a tiny plastic cap to place on top of the device to cover the camera, if you're as worried about your camera spying on you as Mark Zuckerberg is.\n\nThe interface: Simple with a split personality\n\nThere are two virtual personalties living inside the Portal+: Amazon's Alexa handles the majority of voice tasks, but Facebook created a second mini-assistant you activate by saying \"Hey Portal.\" It only controls basic functions like making video calls, changing the volume and opening apps. The voice sounds computerized and a few years behind current technology.\n\nLike the Echo and Google smart screen devices, the Portal+ keeps the screen interface easy for anyone to figure out. There are a two main views, one of your Messenger contacts and another of Portal apps. The pickings are slim and there's no app store yet, but you can also do the basics like listen to music, watch videos, and look at photos.\n\nThe screen is wide and would be good for watching TV shows or movies in landscape. However, many of the video apps it has at launch, such as the Food Network, don't take advantage of it. They're filled with square videos optimized for the social network's mobile app.\n\nYou can set up multiple Facebook accounts but will have to switch between them to get your own Messenger contacts. It can call anyone through their Messenger app, so they don't need to have a Portal of their own.\n\nThe highlight: Video calls that follow you around\n\nThe Portal+ has one neat trick. Its wide-angle lens can take in a huge view, but the software will zoom in and track a person or people. But during our tests, the tracking feature was a bit slow yet it was excellent at following you while you go about your life if you're not zipping around too fast. The technology could allow for longer, more casual chats than you might have when glued to a computer or phone.\n\nIt would be ideal for anyone who wants to broadcast activities, such as doing a cooking show for Facebook Live. However, Facebook doesn't allow live streaming from the device for privacy reasons.\n\nIt also has fun AR filters such as a werewolf, mouse, cat and glasses that sits on your head. The best filter is the one you barely notice: a light application of lipstick. It's easy to imagine more realistic overlays in the future that change your appearance so realistically, the other party will have no idea that's not what you look like.\n\nThe use case: Who is this for?\n\nThe oddest thing about the Portal+ isn't the interface or design. It's that Facebook thinks people will be comfortable having one of its always-listening microphones and cameras in the home, despite its string of recent privacy issues.\n\nThe Portal+ is new and will likely evolve as Facebook sees how people are using it. For now, it's an awkward mishmash of technology trends that despite any redeeming qualities -- and there are a few -- feels like a genuinely bizarre product for a company plagued by privacy concerns.", "(CNN) In another pick-up for House Democrats, Kim Schrier has defeated Republican Dino Rossi in the state of Washington's 8th Congressional District, CNN projects.\n\n\"Congress is broken, and people in the 8th District are ready for a community pediatrician to bring a dose of common sense to DC,\" Schrier said in a statement Wednesday.

Two children, the school's principal, and a teacher are still missing , according to the school authorities.\n\nThe group of 78 children were seized, along with their principal, a teacher and a driver, from the Presbyterian Secondary School. One other girl managed to escape from the kidnappers.\n\nThe kidnappers made the group of 46 girls and 32 boys trek through bushes and changed their hideout several times until they were released, Majum said.\n\n\"They said we should not come to school, as of now, because there is no peace in the country, and we cannot go to school since there is no peace in the country,\" Majum said.\n\nTheir abductors regularly assured them they would be returned safely to their parents, the student said.\n\n\"They told us not to worry and feel free with them. People with guns telling us not to be afraid, it was not normal, we were still afraid,\" she said.\n\nMajum said she was \"grateful\" her captors did not harm her during a joyful reunion with her parents, Mujum and Florence on Wednesday.\n\nThe students were given fruits and foodstuff to cook in the house where they were kept before their release, she added.\n\n\"We never lacked food. We ate guava, 'puff puff', 'akara', 'kwacha.' (local snacks) The boys gave us six bunches of plantain to cook our own food there.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) With the midterms behind us, the 2020 floodgates are about to open. You can expect senators, governors, members of Congress, mayors, movie stars, CEOs (and even a porn star's lawyer?) to start kicking the tires on a presidential run \u2014 and announce they're getting into the race.\n\nThe one thing we know about the likely candidates is that we don't know anything. It will be the most wide-open field in our lifetime.\n\nAfter working in the last three competitive Democratic presidential primaries and going through extensive planning and preparation for Hillary Clinton's 2016 run, I'd recommend that candidates consider these five things as they plan:\n\nOne: Know why you're doing this -- like, really know\n\nSet a stopwatch for 20 minutes, grab a piece of paper and answer the following questions in no more than three sentences each:\n\nWhy should you be president? Why should you be president at this point in time? What's wrong and what are you going to do about it? Who are you fighting for? Who are you fighting against?\n\nDid you know the answers? Are they clear and concise? Are they real ideas? Or just a bunch of rhetoric? If the answers to these questions come easily, you have a rationale for running. If not, I recommend figuring them out before you jump in the fray \u2014 or maybe it's not your time. And don't try to find any of this in a poll. This part has to come from you.\n\nTwo: It's not about you, it's what you stand for\n\nIf I'd written a column in November 2014 that read, \"In the 2016 primary, a 75-year-old congressman who spent most of his adult life in elected office will emerge as an anti-establishment crusader rallying millennials to his cause,\" you would have laughed at me. Yet that's exactly what happened.\n\nBernie Sanders , who had been a member of Congress for 25 years, emerged as an outsider in the race. It's not who you are, but what you stand for that matters. Bernie didn't attract young people because he was young. It was about his ideas.\n\nYour campaign is a vehicle for your supporters to create change and your message is a rallying cry for your cause. Talking about yourself \u2014 your accomplishments and the kind of leader you have been \u2014 is fine as part of a story that illuminates your values, but your message is ultimately about a diagnosis of what's wrong, a vision of who we are as a country and where we need to go. Many candidates fall into the trap of trying to sell themselves. Instead, sell what you stand for.\n\nAlso, ignore the polls right now. When I first arrived in Manchester, New Hampshire, to work for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential bid, one candidate was crushing everyone else in the polls. His name was Joe Lieberman, and we know how that turned out. The polls today are meaningless, so ignore them all. There are way too many unknowns and far too many potential candidates to read much into the data. Plus, your message has to come from you.\n\nThree: This is a change election\n\nThe Democratic primary electorate wants change. Some people think that change is represented by certain policy positions, or a particular ideological brand. Not so.\n\nVoters are shopping for a leader, not a litany. They want you to explain where we've been, where we are, and where we can go. They want to hear you explain what's wrong and how we can make it right. They want to know what you think \"America\" stands for as an idea.\n\nChange is about more than your flavor of Medicare for All or whether you're a \"New Democrat,\" old Democrat, Democratic Socialist, \"yellow dog Democrat,\" \"Blue Dog Democrat,\" or tabby cat Democrat.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama ran for a new kind of politics that transcended old divides. His positions were oftentimes more conservative than Hillary Clinton's (he opposed an individual mandate, for example), but you don't think of him that way, which is why you shouldn't get dragged down into litmus tests \u2014 stick to the \"vision thing.\"\n\nLastly, your vision of change must be bigger than a rebuttal of Trump's latest tweet. It must be about what America looks like without those tweets altogether. Speaking for yourself and avoiding the trap of litigating the race on Trump's terms will be your biggest challenge.\n\nFour: You are running a national campaign, headquartered in cyberspace\n\nYou will sink or swim based on the ability to mobilize fans, who will share your content and donate money. Period. That comes from having an original idea to sell and a top-notch digital operation to push your message out and mobilize supporters. You should also get in front of the press as much as you can. Both Trump and Sanders used cable news appearances in the 2016 race to build their social assets early in the process to great effect.\n\nGone are the days of sustaining a campaign on $2,700-per-plate chicken dinners at the Marriott. There will be too many candidates and not enough time to raise money the old-fashioned way. Candidates will need a large network of low-dollar donors to sustain them for the long haul.\n\nAlso gone are the days of winning one state and \"taking off.\" Yes, it's vital to build a ground game in the early states (and that includes some March states), but camping out in a single state and thinking that can catapult you onto the national stage is outdated. Without generating a fan base, you won't have the resources \u2014 money or message \u2014 to gain traction and sustain your work.\n\nWhen I was running Hillary's campaign in 2016, Sanders didn't build out his Iowa operation until very late in the game and quickly pulled the race to a virtual tie. Mitt Romney did not spend a significant amount of time in Iowa, and yet he came in a close second (so close that everyone believed he'd won on caucus night).\n\nDonald Trump's Iowa and New Hampshire operations were a mess, yet he came in second in the Iowa caucus and handily won the New Hampshire primary. You want the best people and the best operations you can in these states, but message travels nationally nowadays -- and it travels fastest via your fans.\n\nFive: You win with delegates\n\nEarly in the campaign, what matters is honing your message, building your base of fans and pulling off the strongest possible result in the early states. That foundation makes everything else possible. But what ultimately wins the contest is delegates -- and delegates don't always come in logical ways.\n\nSome candidates get so fixated on the first four states, which have less than 4% of the overall delegates, that they forget to plan and end up short come Super Tuesday. Others fall into the trap of thinking \"winning states\" is the same as \"winning delegates\" and it's more complicated than that.\n\nFirst, the media reports primary contests just like any other election, except they're not. When you see results come in on primary night, they're presented as they would be in any other election contest: Candidate A gets X percent, Candidate B gets Y percent. Then the press celebrates the \"winner.\" But these voting figures are often meaningless and the celebrations are almost always deceptive, because you win the primary with delegates, not votes \u2014 and the two are not as correlated as you might suspect.\n\nWhen I ran Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary campaign in Ohio, we won the state with 53% of the vote, to much fanfare. Obama, who won 44%, trailed by a margin of about 200,000 votes. But we only gained a net of seven delegates over Obama. Compare that to Kansas, where Obama gained a net of 14 delegates with a margin of about 17,000 votes. Clinton won a bigger state with a margin that was nearly 12 times the size, but she got half the delegates. The lesson: Votes do not equal delegates, especially when comparing caucuses and primaries.\n\nYou don't even have to win the most votes to get the most delegates. When I ran the Nevada caucus for Hillary in 2008, we \"won\" with 50.8% of the precinct delegates to Obama's 45.1%, but Obama actually won 13 unpledged delegates -- one more than Clinton's 12 -- because of how the delegates were proportioned by congressional district. Likewise, in 2016, Clinton and Sanders split the delegates in Wyoming evenly 7-7, despite Bernie \"winning\" the precinct caucuses 55.7% to 44.3%.\n\nLastly, don't forget the rule that requires Democratic primary candidates to secure at least 15% of the vote in order to win delegates. With such a big field, you'll see a lot of people stall out early because they won't score enough votes to win any.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nOnly three of eight candidates in the 2008 Democratic primary won any delegates at all -- and John Edwards ended up with less than 1%. Once someone has pulled ahead in the delegate count on Super Tuesday it's virtually impossible for others to catch up, not just because of money and momentum, but because the rules push underdogs out (although with online fundraising, candidates can choose to stay in long after they're not viable).\n\nSo never lose focus of what it really takes to win: getting the most delegates.\n\nWe say it every four years, but I don't think anyone would disagree -- this really is the most important presidential election in our history \u2014 and the playbook will look totally different this time around. But recent campaigns give us some clues as to what contributes to success: an authentic rationale for running, a message that rallies supporters, and fans who are mobilized both on the ground and online. Then, don't forget about delegates. That much we can be certain about; you'll have to figure the rest out as you go along. Good luck!", "(CNN) Somewhere around the age of 10, Linda Bogle-Mienzer became aware of her attraction to her own sex. For more than two decades, she kept it inside, fearful of what she saw as an environment of homophobia in her family and in her home country, Bermuda.\n\n\"Internally, it was destroying me and so I decided to come out,\" she said. \"When I was younger and struggling with my truth I couldn't look up and see anyone vocally out there that looked like me or felt like me. I believe that I needed to be that for others.\"\n\nBogle-Mienzer, now 52 years old, is a police officer by profession and community activist by passion. She's also one of just a handful of people who have married a partner of the same sex in Bermuda.\n\nTheir numbers may never increase, because Bermuda is the only country in the world to have first introduced, and then revoked the right for same-sex marriages.\n\nDivisive issue\n\nIt's been a back-and-forth issue since 2016 for the North Atlantic island of approximately 65,000 people.\n\nIn June of that year, then-Premier Michael Dunkley, who supports same-sex marriage, called a non-binding referendum on the issue.\n\nThe vote was deemed invalid because less than 50% of the electorate showed up, but of the 20,800 people who did, nearly 70% voted against same-sex marriage.\n\nDunkley said his intention for the referendum was to open up the conversation.\n\n\"I thought it was appropriate to allow people to get involved in the subject,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"I tried to break down the barriers of people saying, 'It's in the closet, leave it there.' That's why we had public meetings and that's why we went forward with the referendum to try and get people to talk about it,\" he said.\n\nLandmark case\n\nIn the July of that year, with same-sex marriage still illegal, Winston Godwin, 28, and Greg DeRoche, 31, applied to marry on the island, hoping to take their case to the country's Supreme Court.\n\n\"When I first moved back [from Canada] in 2016, I was so confused as to why people felt they need to have so much of a say in who I wanted to marry,\" Godwin said. \"I'm not trying to marry you. I'm not trying to turn the world on its head. I'm literally just trying to marry one person.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court heard their case and in May 2017 it legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nGreg Godwin-DeRoche (L) and Winston Godwin-DeRoche (R) fought for LGBT rights for Bermudians, but married in Canada.\n\nLaw change\n\nBut the socially conservative Progressive Labour Party was elected in July 2017 and pushed through a law eliminating same-sex unions and replacing them with domestic partnerships in November of that year.\n\nAs a British Overseas Territory, Bermuda creates its own laws, but all must be endorsed by the appointed British governor. The law change was debated in the UK Parliament and eventually ratified, taking effect in June 2018.\n\nPremier David Burt, leader of the Progressive Labour Party, defended the government's position. \"No matter what people want to say about what the referendum meant, the votes recognized that a vast majority of Bermudians were actually opposed to [same-sex marriage],\" he said.\n\n\"But the government balanced the need for same-sex couples to have legal rights and legal benefits against the construct of the thought of the public,\" he added. \"It's still my belief that we arrived at the most applicable solution.\"\n\nBermuda's Premier David Burt.\n\nBut the Supreme Court overturned the ban five months later, ruling it unconstitutional. The government is appealing the Supreme Court's decision this week. If the Court of Appeals rules that the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, the last resort for the Bermudian government would be to appeal to the UK's Privy Council.\n\nMinister of Home Affairs Walton Brown Jr. said it could be two years before a final decision comes down. In the meantime, same-sex couples on the island can't marry but can form domestic partnerships.\n\n\"[Same-sex marriage] visited Bermuda far too quickly,\" he said. \"The change came far too quickly for us to be able to absorb the change and all that it entails and so we have to move into that space where we are embracing of it ... At some point, I'm hoping that we will, and I think that's where we need to be.\"\n\nBermuda's Minister of Home Affairs, MP Walton Brown Jr., says he personally supports same-sex marriage.\n\nThe government has said that Bermuda is still far more progressive than most of the world. At the moment, 26 countries around the world have legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the Caribbean, it is legal only in territories within the jurisdiction of the US -- Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands -- or in the Dutch territories of Saba, Bonaire and St. Eustatius.\n\nMaking waves\n\nThe news of Bermuda revoking same-sex marriage made headlines around the world.\n\n\"Bermuda just banned marriage equality. I guess I'm canceling my trip. Anybody else?\" wrote comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres on Twitter at the time.\n\nBermuda just banned marriage equality. I guess I'm canceling my trip. Anybody else? https://t.co/c5bwUbyjZt pic.twitter.com/VpT5QQAFsq \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 7, 2018\n\nThe hashtag #boycottBermuda began trending on social media, encouraging people not to travel to the island until same-sex marriage is reintroduced.\n\nHannah Collins identifies as a queer Bermudian and said she was disappointed in but not surprised by the government's decision to appeal the court ruling.\n\n\"This is getting exhausting and this whole hot-potato thing is frustrating, but at the same time, I'm optimistic,\" she said. \"I think people are starting to feel more hopeful. I'm seeing more people not afraid of being themselves. I'm seeing so many people wanting to come out and support the LGBT community.\"\n\nCollins believes the negative press and the call to boycott Bermuda were misguided and represent a missed opportunity to educate people on the issue.\n\n\"It's hurtful when people equate the government making up these choices with the whole of Bermuda,\" she said. \"When the boycott Bermuda thing came up we were just like wait, hold on a minute. There are so many LGBT Bermudians who work in hospitality who directly benefit from that industry, to boycott Bermuda would be to hurt them.\"\n\nHannah Collins (L) and David Northcott (R) both advocate for same-sex marriage rights in Bermuda.\n\nHuman-rights activist David Northcott said the current government's reasoning that the country isn't ready just wasn't good enough.\n\n\"Was Bermuda ready when slavery was abolished? No. Was Bermuda ready when women were given the right to vote? No. Was Bermuda ready for equal marriage? No, but you don't take it away.\"\n\nLike Bogle-Mienzer, Northcott was one of the few in Bermuda to marry someone of the same sex during the short window of legality.\n\n\"I got married under duress because my partner is non-Bermudian and my partner and I weren't planning on getting married but we had no choice because we had a six-month window where it was now or never,\" he said.\n\nBut Bogle-Mienzer does see some positives in the situation.\n\n\"This issue has inadvertently opened up space for us to have a voice and I think that's progress,\" she said. \"Bermuda is in a progressive space and I think we just have to decide what side of history we want to be on.\"\n\n\n\nPhotography by Esan Swan", "Jason Coffman, father of a son who is missing after a mass shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, says he is hoping his son is alive and safe.", "Jason Coffman, father of a son who is missing after a mass shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, says he is hoping his son is alive and safe.", "Paris (CNN) The French government has backed down over apparent plans to pay tribute to Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain -- who collaborated with the Nazis in the deportation of Jews from France during World War II -- as part of commemorations to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron came under fire Wednesday after he said it was \"legitimate\" to honor P\u00e9tain's role as a \"great soldier\" in World War I.\n\nHours later, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said in a Facebook post that no tribute would be paid to P\u00e9tain in Saturday's ceremony.\n\n\"We had announced that we would honor the marshals of the Great War. Some have deduced that P\u00e9tain was one of them; this is not the case. If there was confusion, it was because we were not clear enough on that point,\" Griveaux said.\n\nMarshal Philippe P\u00e9tain (left) is pictured in a courtroom during his 1945 treason trial.\n\n\"In the words of the President, there was no question of a tribute, but of historical truth. P\u00e9tain served in 1914. He contributed to the victory of 1918.

On my left was a long steep drop toward a valley far below. In between, was a narrow path covered in jumbled rocks and me in the driver's seat of a nicely optioned Rolls-Royce with a total price of about $400,000.\n\nThis was nuts. If I'd been in a Jeep Wrangler or a Land Rover, maybe this would not have been such a big deal. But when Rolls-Royce told me they were going to let me drive the new Cullinan, the brand's first SUV, off-road, I figured I'd be taking it over a dirt road and maybe up and down a few little hills. I hadn't imagined I would be threading my way up a zigzagging pass cut into the side of a Wyoming mountain.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce Cullinan on Snow King Mountain in Wyoming. Prices start at $325,000, but climb quickly with options.\n\nThe Cullinan was handling this terrain surprisingly well, especially considering it was riding on the same tires used to drive on paved streets. The fact that the Cullinan has all-wheel-drive certainly helped. But it also has one especially important thing other Rolls-Royces do not: selectable driving modes. Well, at least one.\n\nThis sort of technology is commonplace in today's luxury cars. In a Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Audi, for instance, one can switch from \"Comfort\" to \"Sport\" or even \"Eco\" mode, depending on whether you're puttering through the middle of town or winging your car along a twisting road.\n\nIn the past, Rolls-Royce has resisted this trend. A Ghost or Dawn drives precisely the way a Rolls-Royce should drive at all times. To add a knob or a menu with different \"driving modes\" might suggest that there was something suboptimal about that. Some Rolls-Royce cars will automatically alter things like suspension firmness or steering response depending on how aggressively you're driving at any given moment, but the driver will never expend effort in that choice. The car does it automatically.\n\nRead More", "Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) With the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, Donald Trump gained a glimpse of what it's like to lose some -- albeit only some -- power.\n\nAnd, when bullies think they're losing control, they lash out in anger.\n\nThe President's reaction to tough questions from CNN's Jim Acosta about the Republican campaign and his immigration \"invasion\" rhetoric was classic bullying behavior: calling the chief White House correspondent a \"rude, terrible person\" shows how rattled Trump is about the results.\n\nJust because the President's outburst on Wednesday was in keeping with his portrayal of the media as \"enemies of the people\" does not mean it should be tolerated.\n\nTrump's decision to revoke Acosta's pass to the White House grounds is an outrageous ramping up of his campaign against a questioning, robust. free media.\n\nIn response to a man who treats his Presidency as if it's a series of a particularly bizarre reality-TV show, the entire White House press corps should walk out. Deny him coverage. Take him off the air. Cancel his series. Leave him to rage into Twitter's echo chamber, which is all he deserves.\n\nAs Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, said on Twitter: \"This is something I've never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996. Other presidents did not fear tough questioning.\"\n\nIn Britain, too, Prime Ministers are asked tough, sometimes very hardline questions. I have covered UK politics during the terms of four Prime Ministers, and I have never seen a response like this.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jim Acosta: We're going to keep doing our jobs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jim Acosta: We're going to keep doing our jobs 03:34\n\nOnce, Tony Blair was asked if he had \"blood on your hands\" after the suicide of the Iraq weapons inspector Dr. David Kelly. This was a far more controversial question than anything Trump faced on Wednesday, yet the then-Prime Minister merely stood in stony silence. What's more, the reporter who asked the question did not have his credentials revoked.\n\nAnd now, not only has Acosta's pass been withdrawn, but he now faces the false claim by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders that he \"placed his hands\" on the female intern who tried to remove the microphone as he tried to ask more questions.\n\nThis young woman should not be blamed for doing her job in what must be a tough environment. What is disgraceful is that Sanders should insinuate that Acosta has committed some sort of assault -- when footage of the incident clearly shows the intern placing her hands on his arm, and not the other way around.\n\nSanders has even circulated what to my eyes appears to be a doctored film of the interaction with Acosta's arm movement sped up, to make it look as though he has karate-chopped her forearm.\n\nSenior White House officials disseminating lies and smears on social media -- which are then lapped up by Trump supporters -- in revenge against a journalist asking questions evokes George Orwell's \"1984\": \"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.\"\n\nThis accusation of assault is outrageous on its own. It is an insult to real victims of harassment and assault. But from a White House whose President has in the past admitted \"grabbing\" women in a sexual manner, whose record on misogyny is so poor, and who only last month praised a Republican candidate for body-slamming a reporter, it is breathtakingly hypocritical.\n\nThis marks the lowest point in the Trump White House's campaign against the press, and it should no longer be indulged.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEste estudio a\u00fan no ha sido publicado en una revista cient\u00edfica y tiene que ser revisado por pares\n\nLas mujeres que reportaron dormir m\u00e1s de las 7 u 8 horas promedio tuvieron un riesgo ligeramente mayor de desarrollar c\u00e1ncer de seno\n\nUna de cada 100 mujeres que se consideraron madrugadoras desarrollaron c\u00e1ncer de mama, en comparaci\u00f3n con dos de cada 100 que se consideraron nocturnas\n\n(CNN) - Las mujeres que son naturalmente madrugadoras fueron menos propensas a desarrollar c\u00e1ncer de mama que las mujeres que son m\u00e1s nocturnas, dice un nuevo estudio.\n\nUna de cada 100 mujeres que se consideraron diurnas desarrollaron c\u00e1ncer de seno, en comparaci\u00f3n con dos de cada 100 que se identificaron como personas nocturnas.\n\nLos riesgos de c\u00e1ncer asociados al reloj corporal de una persona y a los patrones de sue\u00f1o han sido reportados previamente en otras investigaciones e investigadores de Gran Breta\u00f1a quer\u00edan explorar rasgos del sue\u00f1o con m\u00e1s detalle, as\u00ed como factores gen\u00e9ticos subyacentes.\n\nLas preferencias informadas sobre las ma\u00f1anas y las noches fueron registradas en el estudio con m\u00e1s de 180.000 mujeres, que fue liderado por la doctora Rebeca Richmond, investigadora en el Programa Integrado de Epidemiolog\u00eda del C\u00e1ncer y en la Unidad de Epidemiolog\u00eda de la Universidad de Bristol, y fueron presentadas este martes en la Conferencia sobre C\u00e1ncer del Instituto Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n del C\u00e1ncer en Glasgow.\n\nEl equipo de Richmond tambi\u00e9n analiz\u00f3 las variantes gen\u00e9ticas relacionadas con el hecho de que alguien fuera diurno o nocturno en m\u00e1s de 220.000 mujeres para establecer si esto podr\u00eda proporcionar un v\u00ednculo causal con el c\u00e1ncer de seno.\n\nEste tipo de modelo estad\u00edstico, llamado aleatorizaci\u00f3n mendeliana, mostr\u00f3 que las mujeres cuyos genes las hacen m\u00e1s propensas a ser madrugadoras fueron menos propensas a desarrollar c\u00e1ncer de seno hasta en un 48%, como se mostr\u00f3 a partir de las 220.000 participantes del estudio.\n\nEl segundo an\u00e1lisis, usando informaci\u00f3n autorreportada sobre el sue\u00f1o de 180.000 participantes, mostraba una tendencia similar en las mujeres diurnas, teniendo un 40% menos de riesgo de c\u00e1ncer de mama.

O'Ree was 14 years old, well ahead of making history himself.\n\nBefore he became the first black player in the National Hockey League, and even longer before he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, O'Ree was visiting New York. Back then, he was playing two sports. His baseball team had won a championship, and the reward was a trip to see the Empire State Building and Radio Music City Hall.\n\n\"I met Mr. Robinson after a game,\" O'Ree, now 83, told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. \"I shook hands with him down by the dugout. And (I) told Mr. Robinson that I not only played baseball but I played hockey, and he remarked that he didn't know that there were any black kids playing hockey.\"\n\nThe two would meet again in 1962. By then, it had been four years since O'Ree had broken the NHL color barrier. He was no longer in the league, but he had continued to play in the minors. O'Ree was in Los Angeles, playing for the Blades of the Western Hockey League.\n\nThe NAACP had a luncheon for Robinson in the city, and O'Ree received an invitation with his coach and two other players through the hockey club.\n\nAfter speaking with the media, Robinson was introduced to the players.\n\n\"Mr. Robinson turned around and looked me in the eye and pointed and said, 'Aren't you the young fella I met in Brooklyn?'\" O'Ree recalled. \"He remembered me from meeting in 1949.\"\n\nOn Monday, O'Ree will be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. He was elected in the builder category for his contributions to the game, and his induction comes 60 years after breaking the color barrier.\n\n\"I am very grateful and very honored to be selected to go into the Hall,\" he said. \"It is one of the highest awards in hockey, and I never dreamt of being in the Hall.\n\n\"But thanks to the work that I am doing now and a lot of the influence of people that wanted me to have the opportunity to get in made it possible for me.\"\n\nAfter a puck hit O'Ree in the eye he was told by a doctor that he'd never play hockey again.\n\nPlaying with one eye\n\nO'Ree was born October 15, 1935, in Fredericton, New Brunswick in Canada. He started skating at three years old, and he began playing organized hockey aged five. It was when he was 14 that O'Ree, a winger, decided he wanted to pursue playing in the NHL.\n\nBut becoming a pioneer in the sport almost didn't happen. While playing at the junior level for the Ontario Hockey Association's Kitchener Canucks in the 1955-1956 season, O'Ree took a puck to the face and was hospitalized for three days.\n\n\"None of the players back then wore any headgear, no facial gear, and I was in front of the net,\" O'Ree said. \"There was a slapshot. The puck came up and struck me in the right eye.\"\n\nO'Ree said he lost 97% of his vision in that eye, and the doctor told him that he would never play hockey again. It was a medical opinion that O'Ree did not accept.\n\n\"He didn't know the feeling that I felt inside,\" O'Ree said. \"When I got out of the hospital and found out that I could still see, I just told myself that I still have one eye and I was still going to pursue my dream.\"\n\nWillie O'Ree is honored on the ice during half-time of the 2018 NHL All-Star Game between the Atlantic Division and the Metropolitan Divison at Amalie Arena in January 2018.\n\nLearned he made history by reading the newspaper\n\nIn 1958, while O'Ree was playing for the Quebec Aces in the Quebec Hockey League, he received word that the Boston Bruins -- one of just six teams in the league at the time -- wanted to add him to their roster to replace an injured player for two games against the Montreal Canadiens.\n\n\"When I arrived in Montreal, I met the coach, Milt Schmidt, and the general manager, Lynn Patrick,\" O'Ree said. \"They sat me down and said, 'Willie, we brought you up because we think you are going to add a little something to the team.'\"\n\nO'Ree was no stranger to the Montreal fans because he had played against the Canadiens in exhibition games. \"But, this was a regular scheduled NHL game,\" he said. He had butterflies that day, which was January 18, but they didn't last.\n\n\"Once they dropped the puck and I got involved in the first shift, I just settled down and played my game,\" O'Ree said. \"We were very fortunate to beat the Canadiens that night. We shut them out 3-0, so that was another treat for me.\"\n\nWhile he understood the significance for himself of fulfilling a career goal, he didn't realize in that moment by stepping on the ice, he had become the first black player in NHL history.\n\n\"I didn't realize that I was breaking the color barrier until I read it in the paper the next morning,\" he admitted.\n\nJUST WATCHED Bellemare's unlikely journey to the NHL Replay More Videos ...

In his sport, he fought.\n\n\"I had to fight because I had to protect myself and basically just let these players know that I have the skills and the ability to play in the league at that time,\" O'Ree said. \"I wasn't going to leave the league because players on the opposition were trying to get me out of the game.\"\n\nHe said that in every game he played in, he heard name calling from opposing players and from fans in the stands. He said he \"let it in one ear and out the other\" and concentrated on just playing hockey.\n\n\"Besides being black and being blind in my right eye, I was faced with four other things: racism, prejudice, bigotry and ignorance,\" O'Ree said.\n\nIn all, O'Ree's career in the NHL was brief. In his two stints with Boston, first in 1958 and in the 1960-1961 season, he played in 45 games, scored four goals and had 10 assists. But he stayed in hockey much longer than that. The journeyman minor leaguer retired from the sport in 1979 at age 43.\n\nO'Ree has spent the past 20 years as an NHL ambassador. In 2008, he received the Order of Canada for his work growing the game around the world. And now, he's a hall of famer.\n\nWhen he was recalled by the Bruins on November 18, 1960, the media dubbed O'Ree as \"the Jackie Robinson of hockey.\" And while his story isn't as well known as Robinson's, O'Ree has left an indelible mark in the sport.\n\n\"I'm honored and very grateful that I am even in the same category as Mr. Robinson,\" O'Ree said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl posible vino fue hallado como parte de la excavaci\u00f3n de un sepulcro de la dinast\u00eda Han\n\nEl descubrimiento ocurri\u00f3 el 6 de noviembre en la provincia china de Henan, al oeste de Shanghai\n\n(CNN) \u2014 \u00a1Salud!\n\nArque\u00f3logos en China descubrieron una jarra de 2.000 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad que contiene un l\u00edquido con alcohol que se cree ser\u00eda vino.\n\nEl descubrimiento ocurri\u00f3 el 6 de noviembre en la provincia china de Henan, al oeste de Shanghai.\n\nShi Jiazhen, director del instituto de Arqueolog\u00eda y Reliquias Culturales en la ciudad de Luoyang, le dijo a la agencia de noticias china Xinhua que \"hay 3,5 litros del l\u00edquido en color amarillo transparente.

The Radio Television Digital News Association, which represents newsrooms across the country, called the revocation \"unconscionable.\"\n\nReporters and historians said it was hard to recall a similar episode.\n\n\"White House staff don't pull passes over personal pique, only over threats to the president,\" professor Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, told CNN.\n\nNo one is suggesting that Acosta threatened President Donald Trump. But right-wing websites and pro-Trump commentators alleged that Acosta mistreated a White House intern who tried to take a microphone away from him during the press conference.\n\nTrump's boosters used words like \"pushed\" and \"slammed.\" They screamed \"assault\" and \"abuse.\" Sanders cited this alleged \"inappropriate behavior\" to suspend Acosta's pass. But all of this is contradicted by the video, which shows Acosta holding onto the mic and saying \"pardon me, ma'am,\" when the intern tries to take it away.\n\n\"I was seated next to \u2066Acosta\u2069 at today's press conference and did not witness him 'placing his hands' on the young intern, as the White House alleges,\" Reuters correspondent Jeff Mason wrote on Twitter. \"He held on to the microphone as she reached for it.\"\n\nCNN's critics defend Acosta\n\nEven Chuck Ross of The Daily Caller, a website that harshly criticizes CNN, stood up for Acosta.\n\n\"Plenty to criticize Acosta about,\" Ross wrote, \"but he did not 'place his hands' on the intern. It's ridiculous for anyone to suggest he did.\"\n\nSanders defended her claim by posting a video on Twitter on Wednesday night. The same video was published about two hours earlier by Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large for the Infowars website.\n\nBoth Sanders and Watson used the clip to attack Acosta, but the 15-second video has been distorted to make Acosta look menacing.\n\nCNN said in a statement that Sanders \"lied\" on Wednesday night. \"She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened,\" CNN said. \"This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support.\"\n\nPress freedom groups also weighed in. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said Sanders' \"false description of the events leading up to it is insulting not only to the nation's journalists, but to its people.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association called the yanking of Acosta's pass \"out of line\" and \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"We urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action,\" the association added.\n\nThe White House News Photographers Association's president Whitney Shefte issued a statement expressing outrage that Sanders \"may have shared a manipulated video.\"\n\n\"As visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\" Shefte said. \"It's deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country's highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\"\n\nRevoke credentials? 'I wouldn't do that'\n\nSenior journalists represented by the association also spoke up.\n\nHallie Jackson , of NBC, wrote on Twitter that the press corps \"should stand up against this.\"\n\nPeter Baker, of The New York Times tweeted, \"This is something I've never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996.\" Baker wrote that he believes Trump called on Acosta at the presser because \"he wants the confrontation.\"\n\nFalse predicate to punish a reporter.

Because he wants the confrontation. https://t.co/Q78Nd88gPk \u2014 Peter Baker (@peterbakernyt) November 8, 2018\n\nElisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief of The Times, said, \"The president should not pick and choose who covers him, and he should certainly not force out a representative of one of the country's leading news organizations.\"\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Trump's campaign refused to give press credentials to reporters from several major news outlets, including the Washington Post and BuzzFeed.\n\nWhen the issue came to a head in June 2016, Trump told CNN in an interview that, if elected, he would not revoke credentials.

The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\n\"It is very important because it tells them if the plane is flying at a too-high angle of attack, which can lead to an aerodynamic wing stall (loss of lift),\" said aviation analyst and editor-in-chief of Airlineratings.com, Geoffrey Thomas.\n\nCNN's aviation correspondent Richard Quest said the aircraft receives information from the sensors and responds accordingly.\n\n\"The plane's computers were getting erroneous information from external sensors.

It does this by gathering data from the plane's pitot tube and the static port, which essentially compare differentials in the air pressure to arrive at the plane's speed and the altitude.\n\nAfter problems were reported with the air speed indicator, the AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nPassengers on that flight told CNN that the plane experienced a significant drop in altitude shortly after takeoff. \"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" passenger Robbi Gaharu said\n\nOnce in Jakarta, a Lion Air technician checked the plane again and gave it the green light to fly on its final flight, from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang.\n\nLion Air Group Managing Director Captain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi told CNN on Wednesday that Lion Air strictly follows Boeing's guidance for operating the 737 MAX 8s, as laid out in the maintenance manual book.\n\n\"Pilots write in the logbook about the problem they had in the flight, then our technicians fix it and write (what) they did in the logbook,\" said the managing director, adding that technical conversations between pilots and technicians regarding the aircraft are written and signed in a document called the Aircraft Flight and Maintenance Log.\n\nQuest says investigators will be looking at a combination of factors that could have caused the crash.\n\n\"A crash is always a series of events. Fundamentally the issue is going to be how those pilots flew the plane as the conditions arose,\" he said.\n\nWhat does Boeing and the FAA say?\n\nOn Wednesday, Boeing said it had issued an \"Operations Manual Bulletin\" advising airline operators how to address erroneous cockpit readings.\n\nA spokesperson for the aircraft manufacturer wouldn't disclose to CNN whether the directive was issued to operators of all Boeing aircraft, or just those who fly 737 MAX 8 planes, the same model as Flight 610.\n\nThe directive points operators \"to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an AOA sensor,\" the statement said.\n\nThe ill-fated Lion Air Flight 610's flight data recorder was recovered from the Java Sea on November 1.\n\nFollowing Boeing's bulletin, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday issued an airworthiness directive to Boeing 737 MAX 8 crews if they experience the same problems that brought down Lion Air Flight 610.\n\n\"These erroneous inputs can potentially make the horizontal stabilizers repeatedly pitch the nose of the airplane downward, making the aircraft difficult to control,\" the directive said.\n\nIt continued that, \"The FAA has alerted affected domestic carriers and foreign airworthiness authorities who oversee air carriers who use the 737 MAX.\"\n\nThe FAA directive does not acknowledge an issue with the entire fleet of 737 MAX 8 airplanes and there have been no reported comparable issues in the US.\n\nBoeing said it is involved in the ongoing investigation with KNKT and other government authorities into the Lion Air crash and \"continues to cooperate fully and provide technical assistance.\"", "\u064a\u064f\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646

Thompson threw royal protocol to the wind by wearing white sneakers to Buckingham Palace before reportedly asking Prince William for a kiss.\n\nThe outspoken actress and writer opted for a casual look Wednesday night as she was named a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). Thompson offset her footwear choice with a Stella McCartney suit.\n\nHer next attempt to break with tradition was less successful, however, as she was reportedly rebuffed by Prince William, who was conducting the ceremony.\n\n\"I love Prince William, I've known him since he was little, and we just sniggered at each other,\" she told reporters. \"I said, 'I can't kiss you, can I?' And he said, 'No don't!'\"\n\nShe's not the first celebrity to break with Buckingham Palace's dress code conventions. In 1992, designer Vivienne Westwood revealed she hadn't worn underwear under her skirt when receiving an OBE from the Queen.\n\nActress Emma Thompson leaves Buckingham Palace after receiving her damehood at an Investiture ceremony on November 7, 2018 in London. Thompson received the accolade in recognition of her services to drama.

At the 2014 Golden Globes she came onstage barefoot before tossing her Christian Louboutin heels behind her.\n\n\"I just want you to know, this red? It's my blood,\" she said, in a reference to the famous red-soled Louboutins.\n\nThompson has joked about her MBE since finding out about her royal honor in June.\n\nChristian Louboutin's 'rules for life'\n\n\"Yes. Dame Commander of the British Empire. I've become much more commanding since it happened,\" she said in an interview with Seth Meyers in September.\n\n\"I've also had every seat I sit on just made slightly taller. It's subtle, so people are lifting their heads slightly more toward me than they did before, but they're not quite sure why.\"\n\nThompson has a long history of supporting social justice projects, and is an avowed feminist and human rights advocate who demonstrated her awareness of the complicated history of Britain's imperial past.\n\n\"They send you a letter saying, 'Will you accept it?' You can choose not to. You can choose to say, 'Well, of course we don't have an empire anymore, thank God, because it was ghastly, colonial, racist, dreadful undertaking on every level,' and actually have some moral principle about it. Or you can be like me and think, 'Hmm, it's gonna be a really nice badge.'\"\n\nThompson was accompanied at the ceremony by her husband, Greg Wise, daughter Gaia and son Tindyebwa Agaba Wise.",

came to an abrupt and tragic end.\n\nFrom across the bar, Holden Harrah saw a bearded man walk in and shoot a woman who was behind the counter.\n\n\"I see that girl every single time I'm there,\" he told CNN, fighting back tears. \"I don't know her name, but (she) is someone I make small contact with and I say hi every time.\n\n\"I don't know if she's alive.\"\n\nA gunman opened fire Wednesday night at Borderline Bar & Grill, authorities said, killing at least 12 people and injuring others in a city described by its mayor as \"one of the safest\" in the country.\n\n\"This guy just came out of nowhere and came out with a gun and shot people in Thousand Oaks, California,\" Harrah said. \"And that's what's really blowing my mind, it's a really safe area.\n\n\"I'm just in shock with what I saw with my own two eyes.\"\n\nAn FBI agent talks to a potential witness early Thursday in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n'A tall, dark figure'\n\nTaylor Von Molt, 21, was dancing when she heard what sounded like a balloon popping.\n\n\"And I was confused because we didn't have any balloons at the time,\" she told CNN. \"And then I heard it a couple more times, and I turned around and I saw him.\n\n\"He had a black mask -- what looked like a bandana on the bottom of his face -- sunglasses, black hoodie, dark jeans,\" she said. \"And he's kind of bigger. But kind of more burly. Scary.\"\n\nVon Molt ran as gunshots rang out and tripped on her way to the exit. Others trying to escape kept running over her, but she was finally able to get up and sought refuge in a nearby apartment.\n\nWhen Matt Wennestrom first heard the gunshots, he turned and saw \"a tall, dark figure with a handgun opening fire on one of my closest friends.\"\n\n\"We saw him and we dropped down immediately, the group of five to six guys that I was with, and we covered the girls,\" Wennestrom said.\n\nThe group jumped up during a pause in the gunfire and began throwing stools through the bar's windows, he said.\n\nAs they were jumping out the window, he said, they heard the next round of gunshots.\n\nGunman 'was shooting everything'\n\nJohn Hedge told CNN's Brooke Baldwin he had been hanging out at the bar with his stepdad and was just about to call it a night.\n\n\"I just remember sitting there, just like any other night,\" Hedge said. \"You know, you play some pool and the Lakers game was on, and we were just having a good time.\"\n\nBut everything changed when he heard the first shots of gunfire.\n\n\"You think it's a joke and it takes a couple seconds to kick in, and then I see my stepdad on the ground, he's laying there and he's yelling at me, 'John, John, get down,' you know?\"\n\nHedge watched as the gunman opened fire on girls hiding behind the front desk, he said, before seeking refuge in the bathroom.\n\nHedge just managed to escape, and ran over the body of a security guard on his way out, he said.\n\n\"Those seven, eight steps to the front door -- they couldn't have taken any longer,\" Hedge said.\n\nTim Dominguez also saw how the horrific scene unfolded.\n\n\"I looked up and he was moving to the right. He shot the doorman, bouncer ... just a young man,\" Dominguez told CNN affiliate KABC, choking up. \"Then he shot the cashier, just a young girl.\"\n\nHe said the gunman said nothing at all.\n\nMinutes after the first shots were fired, people jumped out of windows, hid in bathrooms and \"dog-piled on top of each other.\"\n\nA student named Summer, who was also inside the bar, said the gunman \"was shooting everything, from the speakers to anything.\"\n\nCalifornia Lutheran University student Teylor Whittler, 19, told KABC that people were trying to hide in silence when men ran toward a back door of the bar and warned them the gunman was coming.\n\nAs she escaped through the door, she heard a second round of shots.\n\n\"I think everyone was in so much of a shock that it was sheer panic,\" Whittler said.\n\nA 'very sad scene'\n\nAnother witness told CNN she hid from the gunman in the bar's attic.\n\nLindsey, who asked to be identified only by her last name, saw the gunman walk in \"and immediately had this feeling of knowing what he was doing,\" she told CNN's Kate Bolduan.\n\nAt the sound of gunfire, Lindsey dropped to the floor and began making her way to the kitchen, she said.\n\n\"And I look over, some Borderline staff they were yelling at me to get up the ladder and go up into the attic, which I thought was brilliant,\" she said. \"I definitely owe them my life.\"\n\nPeople comfort each other near the shooting scene early Thursday in Thousand Oaks.\n\nPolice found Lindsey and the others holed up in the attic and knocked on the door, telling them it was OK to come out, she said. But she was so terrified she asked them over and over, \"Are you sure? Are you sure?\"\n\n\"It wasn't until I went outside and embraced my friends and my boyfriend that I knew we were safe.\"\n\nOn her way out of the bar, Lindsey said she saw something she never wants to remember.\n\n\"Very sad scene,\" she said. \"I tried to put my hands over my eyes, but even just keeping my head down and walking, it's kind of inevitable to see what had happened there.\"\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to attribute a witness' quotes correctly.", "Hong Kong (CNN) Toshiba is shedding thousands of jobs in its latest attempt to turn its business around.\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate said Thursday that it was laying off 7,000 staff, or about 5% of its total workforce, as part of a new, five-year strategy . Toshiba ( TOSBF ) will also sell its struggling natural gas business in the United States and liquidate its British nuclear power division.\n\nIts stock soared by more than 12% in Tokyo trading following the announcement. Investors were also buoyed by Toshiba's decision to buy back up to 40% of its own shares , and a pledge to increase dividend payouts.\n\nToshiba said it hopes to exit its American liquified natural gas business by March 2019 , but it didn't provide details of any possible buyers. It expects to take a 93 billion yen ($818 million) loss on the division.\n\nIt will start shutting down NuGen, its UK nuclear power operation, early next year after failing to find a buyer.\n\nToshiba said the job cuts will come through a mix of direct lay offs and by not replacing staff who have left.\n\nNew focus on chipmaking and energy storage\n\nAfter restructuring, Toshiba said its business will focus on areas such as energy storage and semiconductors for industries like autos and infrastructure.\n\nThe conglomerate has in recent years had to offload major assets in order to survive, including selling control of its highly regarded memory chip business to a group of investors including Apple ( AAPL ).\n\nAt the start of this year Toshiba ended its disastrous foray into American nuclear power by selling Westinghouse , its bankrupt US nuclear unit, for $4.6 billion to Canadian investment firm Brookfield Business Partners.", "If your day doesn't start until you've gotten up to speed on the latest headlines, then let us introduce you to your new favorite morning fix.

Jeff Sessions\n\nThe fact that President Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions wasn't a surprise (he'd strongly hinted at that for months). But no one expected it to come the day after the midterm elections. Sessions submitted to Trump an undated resignation letter -- \"at your request\" -- after being asked to by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Sessions was one of Trump's first and most loyal supporters. But the President quickly soured on him over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Still, Sessions implemented Trump's vision, rolling back Obama-era policies on immigration, police reform and civil rights.\n\nMatthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, takes over as acting attorney general. And that's already sparking controversy because Whitaker has spoken out in the past against the Russia investigation -- which he will now oversee. Democrats already want him to recuse himself. Many fear the President is effectively trying to end special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into his 2016 campaign's actions.\n\nJUST WATCHED Whitaker likes to talk about Mueller Replay More Videos ...

President Trump\n\nThe White House pulled the press pass of CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta after he angered President Trump by asking questions at a post-midterms news conference. Trump insulted Acosta and called him a \"terrible\" person. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders then falsely accused Acosta of \"placing his hands on\" a White House intern who tried to grab the microphone from him. (He didn't, saying, \"Pardon me, ma'am,\" as he held onto the mic; watch the video .) Acosta wasn't the only reporter Trump tangled with. He described as \"racist\" a question he got about calling himself a nationalist and yelled at reporter April Ryan to \"sit down\" as she tried to ask him a question. The White House Correspondents' Association called the White House's actions \"unacceptable,\" while CNN said it stands behind Acosta and called Trump's attacks \"disturbingly un-American.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump clashes with Acosta in testy exchange Replay More Videos ...

Chinese exports rose 16% in October, much more than analysts had predicted. It was also stronger than September's growth. This is significant because October was the first full month during which new US tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods were in effect. And those tariffs will rise from 10% to 25% at the end of the year, so it looks like companies are ramping up their exports to avoid the higher duties that are on the way.\n\nJUST WATCHED White House trade adviser: Ball's in China's court Replay More Videos ...

Conversely, after the election, the Republican caucus now tilts even more preponderantly toward districts that are more white, less affluent, and less well-educated than the national average. The result is a widening trench between the parties in the House that encapsulates the growing distance between a Democratic coalition centered on minorities, Millennials and college-educated white voters, most of them clustered in urban areas, and a competing GOP coalition that revolves around evangelical, rural and blue-collar whites who often live beyond it.\n\nWhere Democrats won\n\nSo far CNN has called 30 Republican-held House seats for the Democrats. Most of these seats are largely white, well-educated and affluent districts that for years represented a pillar of GOP strength in the House. Strikingly they included gains for Democrats not only in the urban centers or suburbs of big metropolitan areas that already bend toward the party from New Jersey, Philadelphia, Northern Virginia and Miami in the East, to Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis in the Midwest, to Denver and Tucson in the West. They also included Democratic pick ups in metro areas including Charleston (SC), Richmond, Dallas, Houston, Des Moines, Kansas City and Oklahoma City, where Republicans had, until now, resisted the general movement of white-collar communities toward the Democrats.\n\nAnalysis by CNN producer Aaron Kessler found that 24 of the 30 seats that CNN has called for Democrats, or exactly four-fifths, exceed the national average in education. Twenty-five of the 30 captured seats exceed the national median income. Just six of the 30 districts are more diverse than the national average (a number that largely reflects the concentration of minority voters into urban districts that Democrats already dominate.) In ten of the seats that Democrats captured, the immigrant share of the population exceeded the national average.\n\nDemocrats also lead in another seven Republican-held House seats where CNN has not made a final projection. The median income also exceeds the national average in five of those seven seats, as does the average education level in four of them. Four also contain more immigrants than the national average. These provisional Democratic gains include seats in such previous Republican suburban strongholds as Orange County, CA; Salt Lake City; and communities outside Atlanta, as well as Seattle and the northern exurbs of Los Angeles.\n\nWho Trump is losing for the GOP\n\nThe engine of this change is the unusual resistance Trump faces among white voters holding at least a four-year college degree, even as he demonstrates a powerful hold on white voters without such advanced education. Exit polls Tuesday night found that just 40% of college-educated white voters said they approved of Trump's job performance, while 59% disapproved. The numbers were essentially inverted among white voters without a college education: 61% approved while just 39% disapproved.\n\nDriven by those divergent reactions to the president, non-college educated whites gave Republicans a resounding 24 percentage point advantage in House races, according to the exit poll. (Support from those voters also keyed the GOP Senate gains Tuesday, particularly in the preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar states where Republican gains were concentrated.) But college-educated voters preferred Democrats by eight points, the poll found. That was a huge shift from both 2014 and 2010 midterm elections, when Republicans won them by margins of at least sixteen percentage points.\n\nThe new GOP\n\nThis harsh wind blew away much of the white-collar wing of the Republican House caucus (even before considering the potential additional losses from the seats CNN has not called yet). It has tilted the remaining caucus more toward the working-class, small town and rural places where President Trump is strongest.\n\nBefore the election, two-thirds of Republicans already represented districts in which the share of residents with a college degree lagged the national average. After Tuesday, that imbalance has broken even further: over three-fourths of the remaining House Republicans represent seats with fewer college graduates than average. (The figures for the post-election distribution of House Republicans is based only on the races CNN has already called.)\n\nLikewise, before the election, nearly three-fifths of Republicans represented districts in which the median income was lower than the national average; now, over two-thirds of House Republicans hold seats where the median income lags the national average.\n\nEven before the election, slightly less than one-in-five Republicans represented districts with a higher share of immigrants than the national average. After Tuesday's results, that figure has collapsed to less than one-in-ten. (Figures on the immigration presence are not available for House districts in Pennsylvania, which were redrawn this year under a ruling by the State Supreme Court.) Before the election, slightly less than one-in-five Republicans represented districts with more minorities than the national average; now that figure has fallen to less than one-in-six. Viewed from the other direction, fully 85 percent of House Republicans now represent districts that are more white than the national average.\n\nRepublicans also faced widespread losses in districts that voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump. Fifteen of the Democratic pick-ups that CNN has already called came from the 25 GOP-held seats that backed Clinton; another four of their provisional gains were in Clinton/Republican districts. That means Tuesday could cost Republicans about four-fifths of their members from split ticket districts.\n\nIn all of these ways, the election has stripped the GOP caucus of the Members most likely to resist Trump's belligerent tone and increasingly overt appeals to white racial resentment. Those remaining in the GOP caucus are even more concentrated in the parts of the country where his style and message are popular. In a self-reinforcing cycle, they are likely to welcome him continuing to redefine the party around his racially infused economic nationalism in a manner that further weakens the shrinking number of House Republicans who survived in well-educated districts on Tuesday.\n\nThe new Democrats\n\nAs the GOP caucus tilts further toward non-urban, Trump-friendly districts, the Democratic caucus is growing more racially and economically diverse -- or perhaps bi-modal. It revolves principally around two poles: urban districts with large minority populations, and a growing number of these white-collar suburban districts, some of which are also racially diverse. After the election, three-fifths of Democrats now represent districts where the minority share of the population exceeds the national average, and three-fifths also hold seats with more immigrants than the national average (again excluding Pennsylvania.) Three-fifths hold seats where the median income is greater than the national average, and just under three-fifths hold districts with more college graduates than average. (These figures also include only the districts CNN has already called.)\n\nWhile Democrats lost one seat in a Minnesota district that backed Trump in 2016 (and could lose a second one in the state that CNN still hasn't called), on Tuesday they also captured 16 seats in districts that Trump won. Among them were two Trump-won districts in Iowa, two in Michigan, two in New Jersey, two in Virginia and three in New York. That will leave them with at least 26 of those districts, depending on the final result in the Minnesota race that has not been called and another Trump-won GOP district that CNN hasn't called in Maine.\n\nBoth the affluent, white-collar Democratic seats, and their racially diverse districts, are heavily concentrated in major metropolitan areas. After Tuesday's thorough suburban repudiation, Republicans are increasingly centered in non-urban areas.\n\nThe seats Republicans now hold include dozens of rural and small town districts that they won in 2010 from \"blue dog\" Democrats who had held them for years, even as their voters had grown more reliably Republican in presidential elections. But the blue dogs could not survive the disillusionment in those places with President Barack Obama during his first mid-term election. Now a similar backlash against Trump during his first mid-term has swept away over two dozen suburban Republicans who had likewise been clinging to their seats, even as their voters had drifted more toward Democrats in presidential elections.\n\nThis parallel culling underscores the sense that the 2018 election represents the geographic bookend to 2010. The 2010 contest virtually erased the Democratic presence in small town and rural districts. The 2018 election severely diminished the GOP presence in major metropolitan areas from coast to coast. Together, these bookended repudiations of a first-term president have widened the trench between the two parties in the House-leaving them ever more clearly representing what America has been, and what it is becoming.", "And the impact was clear as the results poured in on Tuesday night: Trump proved uniquely helpful to Republicans in many statewide races -- namely Senate and gubernatorial contests -- in closely-watched states that he won in 2016. But he largely hurt Republicans running to hold onto seats in suburban America -- sections of the country that have grown more appalled by the President's rhetoric.\n\nThe result -- Democrats sweeping Republicans out of power in the House and expanding their hold on the Senate -- illustrated the rewards and limitations of his all-base, all-the-time strategy.\n\nHis nearly a dozen rallies in the final days of the campaign ensured his hardline immigration message would dominate, even if Republican candidates in key areas were running away from just that.\n\n\"He's like Journey who won't stop playing \"Don't Stop Believing,'\" said a top Republican operative working on House races. \"He only plays the same song to his base, every tweet is basically the same, he only trusts what got him the presidency in unique circumstances in 2016.\"\n\nThis source added: \"And it really, really hurt us when you don't have the most unlikeable person ever to run for president against him,\" referencing Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nBut on the Senate side, Trump appeared to be a boon to Republicans running to unseat Democratic incumbents in states he won in 2016.\n\n\"It could have been a lot worse and by all indications, it should have been a lot worse,\" said Rick Gorka, deputy communications director in at the Republican National Committee. \"But what we have is a pretty typical night in the House and a very not typical night in the Senate where we are knocking off incumbents.\"\n\nOver the final week of the campaign, Trump headlined 11 rallies in eight states. As the dust settles on Tuesday night's contests, Trump's winning percentage in statewide races in those states was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nThe president traveled to Florida, Indiana and Missouri twice in the final week, all states where Republicans notched high profile wins. Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Democratic mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida gubernatorial contest, while Gov. Rick Scott currently leads Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in the Senate contest. And the Republicans in Indiana and Missouri both ousted Democratic Senate incumbents.\n\nTrump also traveled to Tennessee, where Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn trounced Democrat Phil Bredesen and Georgia where Republican Brian Kemp is leading Democrat Stacey Abrams in the state's gubernatorial contest.\n\nTrump's only clear losses in top state-wide races were in West Virginia, where the President was unable to propel Republican Patrick Morrisey, a candidate even Republicans believed was underwhelming, past Democrat Joe Manchin, and Montana, where Democrat incumbent Sen. Jon Tester defeated Republican Matt Rosendale.\n\n\"We saw the candidates that I supported achieve tremendous success last night,\" Trump told reporters on Wednesday. \"This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave.\"\n\nHe added: \"History really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks in terms of getting some tremendous people over the finish line.\"\n\nThat, however, is where the good news ends for the President, because last night's election also ushered in an empowered opposition party in the House, with Democrats sweeping into the majority through clear victories in the nation's suburbs.\n\nBut when you broaden out his travel, it became clear that his success rate wasn't as stellar: He traveled to Wisconsin, where both the Republican gubernatorial and Senate candidate lost; Nevada, where Democrats won the governor's mansion and Senate seat; and Arizona, where the race remains neck-and-neck.\n\nWhile suburban wins by Democrats were expected -- especially outside liberal cities like Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Denver -- the party also rose deep Trump antipathy to suburban wins in red states with victories around Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Charleston, South Carolina and Dallas, Texas.\n\nAnd Trump's Twitter endorsements -- which were largely just a copy and paste job on gun, crime and immigration policy -- meant very little. The President endorsed Nevada's Danny Tarkanian, New York's Dan Donovan and Kansas' Kevin Yoder, all of whom lost. Trump, from Saturday to Tuesday, backed 33 candidates on Twitter -- 16 lost and 12 won.\n\nTrump did wait to gloat on Wednesday, slamming those Republican lawmakers by name who didn't \"embrace\" him during their campaigns.\n\n\"They did very poorly. I am not sure if I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it,\" Trump said about lawmakers like Mike Coffman in Colorado, Barbara Comstock in Virginia and Mia Love in Utah. (CNN has not projected a winner in Love's race)\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love. Too bad. Sorry Mia,\" he said. \"Those are some of the people that decided for their own reasons not to embrace, whether it is me or what we stand for, but what we stand for meant a lot of most people.\"\n\nThis reflected a growing sense inside the White House in the weeks leading up to the midterms, where top White House officials were keeping tabs on those Republicans who tried to distance themselves from the President.\n\nAsked what he learned from the results last night, Trump simply stated, \"I think people like me, I think they like the job that I am doing.\"\n\nUnmentioned by Trump, however, are those House candidates the President did campaign with who later lost, like Katie Arrington in Charleston, South Carolina, who lost to Democrat Joe Cunningham, making him the first Democrat to hold the seat since 1981.\n\nAnd in Republican circles, that desire by Trump to spurn those who didn't stand with him was worrying and got directly to his struggles with suburban women.\n\n\"This is why he struggles. He can't help himself,\" said a former White House official. Suburban women \"see it as childish and adolescent. They expect their children to act that way, not the President of the United States.\"\n\nWhat was striking on Wednesday was how both sides that lost on Tuesday -- Democrats who failed to hold or make ground in the Senate and Republicans who failed to keep the House -- partially blamed Trump's closing message on immigration, primarily though nativist comments about a caravan of migrants moving through Mexico and the need to end birthright citizenship, and his concert-like rallies in key states for their losses.\n\n\"They made it about us versus them, Democrat versus Republican, nationalizing these races and not necessarily about the records of either candidate,\" said a senior Democrat working on Senate race. \"It became just a D vs. a R. And these were heavily Trump states.\"\n\nThey added: \"That's what helps in Missouri, Indiana and Tennessee, but it hurts in the House. So that is why there is this dichotomy.\"\n\nThis became clear to Republicans on the ground in key swing House districts after Trump made much watched visits. For example, Republicans with knowledge of internal numbers said Trump had a negative impact on GOP incumbent Rep. John Culberson after his Houston rally for Sen. Ted Cruz in October. Culberson lost on Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats, for the most past, ignored Trump on the ground in key swing districts, instead choosing to focus on policy issues related to the President -- namely health care and taxes. But what Trump created, according to top Democrats, was wild uncertainty with his eye-catching rallies and frenetic messaging.\n\n\"One of the key pieces we had learned over the last two years of watching Trump is there is an opposite and equal reaction across the country whenever he does something,\" said Dan Sena, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"We call it shaking the snow globe. ... There was an opposite reaction in highly suburban areas, and we were there to capitalize on it.\"", "Washington (CNN) Jeff Sessions ' ouster as attorney general was a long time in the making, but his sudden departure Wednesday has sent Washington scrambling over what it means for special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as it nears its expected conclusion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Sessions' chief of staff Matt Whitaker, an outspoken skeptic of the Russia investigation, to acting attorney general. In that position Whitaker is expected to take the reins from Rod Rosenstein, deputy attorney general, and oversee Mueller's inquiry.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker will have say over key decisions, such as whether to subpoena the President, approve criminal charges of individuals and directions over the scope of the investigation as more information comes to light.\n\nWhitaker will also decide if the final report prepared by Mueller should be made public as well as which portions to redact.\n\nMany Democrats are calling for him to recuse himself since he has previously suggested limits to the inquiry.\n\n\"I'm very concerned,\" Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York during the Obama administration, said on CNN. It \"looks like you have someone who has prejudged the Mueller investigation ... there might be an undue restricting of the investigation.\"\n\nGiven Trump's frustration with Sessions for having recused himself from the Russia probe, a move that put Rosenstein in charge of it, Bharara added, \"You've got to believe the President got a different kind of understanding\" from Whitaker.\n\nEarly reactions from the White House were to downplay an abrupt ending of the special counsel's investigation.\n\nRudy Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys, said of the inquiry. \"It's gone on this long, I can't imagine he would end it now.\" Giuliani is one of the attorneys helping prepare the President's written answers to questions from Mueller's team.\n\nLimits on Mueller's investigation would not mean all criminal inquiries would end.\n\nMueller's team, including attorneys hired for the investigation as well as career FBI agents, have been working diligently behind the scenes. It's likely active criminal investigations would continue in another format even if the special counsel inquiry were shut down.\n\nOfficials could make referrals of ongoing investigations to other US attorney's offices. There could also be sealed complaints or indictments of numerous individuals that Mueller's team could rush to make public.\n\nCalled for limits on Mueller\n\nBut others were speculating that Whitaker, a former US attorney who has also dabbled in politics, would could impact the probe less directly by limiting its funding or scope based on his prior statements. Whitaker was the campaign chairman for Sam Clovis in 2014 when Clovis ran for state treasurer in Iowa, according to an archived press release on Clovis' website. Clovis, who was a member of Trump's campaign, was interviewed as part of Mueller's inquiry.\n\nWhitaker wrote in an op-ed on CNN.com last August before joining the Justice Department, that any inquiry that touched the President's finances would be off-limits. \"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel.\n\n\"If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition,\" he added.\n\nWhitaker told Don Lemon on CNN Tonight in July 2017 that a new attorney general wouldn't need to fire Mueller to revamp the inquiry but could take steps that \"reduces his budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\n\"So, I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment,\" Whitaker said, \"and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said Sessions' forced resignation was an attempt by Trump to take control of the investigation with some going so far as to suggest any changes would amount to obstruction.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Sessions' firing \"a blatant attempt\" by the President to undermine the Mueller inquiry. She also called for Whitaker to recuse himself \"given his record of threats to undermine and weaken the Russia investigation.\"\n\nWhitaker has already publicly said one area Mueller's team is scrutinizing is not illegal -- Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\n\"There is no criminal obstruction of justice charge to be had here,\" Whitaker said in a radio interview in June 2017. In the interview, which followed Comey's congressional testimony about his encounters with Trump, Whitaker said, \"There's no criminal case that could be substantiated on these facts no matter how good of a witness Jim Comey appears to be, and he was very impressive yesterday.\"\n\nDemocrats, who are poised to take control of the House, have indicated they will keep pressure on the Justice Department and are preparing in any event for a shutdown of the inquiry.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is expected to become the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January, said he is \"immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction.\"", "(CNN) A young family of three has been found dead next to a broken-down vehicle in a remote part of Australia's Northern Territory, according to police, who said a 12-year-old boy was still missing.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Northern Territory Police said a 19-year-old man and woman had been found, along with a three-year-old boy, next to the vehicle 350 kilometers (217 miles) northwest of Alice Springs in the Willowra district.\n\n\"(Police) identified that it wasn't a fatal motor vehicle accident as reported ...

Now a 69-year-old Dutchman wants the courts to make him officially 20 years younger, likening the change to identifying as transgender.\n\nEmile Ratelband has launched a legal bid to change his age by 20 years in order to improve his chances with women on dating applications like Tinder and help with job prospects, according to reports in Dutch media.\n\n\"You can change your name. You can change your gender. Why not your age? Nowhere are you so discriminated against as with your age,\" Dutch paper De Telegraaf quoted Ratelband as saying.\n\nOn Monday, he asked a court in his hometown of Arnhem, in the east of the country, for his date of birth to be changed from March 11, 1949 to March 11, 1969.\n\nHe told the court that he \"suffers\" as a 69-year-old and has been feeling \"20, 25 years younger\" than his official age, according to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.\n\nRead More", "Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by\n\nThis article was originally published in January 2016.\n\nCanadian photographer Michael H. Davies has been photographing his arctic community for years, but it was only a month ago that the broader public became familiar with his work.\n\nAround Christmas, a photo he'd taken of steaming tea freezing in mid-air at -40\u02daC was picked up by national and international media, and shared thousands of times on Facebook.\n\nBut personally, he's not sure what all the fuss is about.\n\n\"When we finally did get that shot, I didn't think anything special about it at all,\" says Davies, who moved from Toronto to Pangnirtung, Nunavut 10 years ago. \"As far as I'm concerned, [there are] lots of shots that I've gone through the same amount of effort and planning to get a result. It just happened that this is the perfect storm of coincidences that people really went crazy for it.\"\n\nHe thinks back to images of a sky hauntingly lit by the Northern Lights, or shots taken at the floe's edge (the point where ice meets open ocean) where the high sun \"turned everything into these crisp, warm feelings.\"\n\n\"It's the comparison between looking at something that's so cold and so empty,\" he says. \"You look at that photo and see that sun, you can almost feel the warmth inside.\"\n\nIn Pangnirtung, an Inuit hamlet with a population of 1550, 40 km south of the Arctic Circle, photography can be a challenge. Factors like battery-freezing temperatures, precarious thin ice, and the threat of bear attacks (\"We're the slowest thing out here, so if bear smells a human and they're interested in having a snack...\") mean even basic shoots require forethought and preparation.\n\n\"In the Arctic we joke about a place that's very, very beautiful, but as soon as you get off the plane, it's trying to kill you,\" he laughs.\n\nCheck out the video above for some of Davies' most memorable photos, and insight into the unique challenges and opportunities of arctic photography.", "Written by CNN Staff\n\nThis story is part of \" Smart Creativity ,\" a series exploring the intersection between high-concept design and advanced technology.\n\nWill.i.am wears a lot of hats: Grammy Award-winning musician; co-founder of the Black Eyed Peas; a judge on TV's \"The Voice;\" headphones entrepreneur.\n\nAnd now he's bringing his creativity and flair for innovation into a new dimension, incorporating virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) into a variety of interactive experiences.\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas performed at the Hammersmith Apollo in London in October.

They made it all right for you to go out clubbing in your bra.\"\n\nShotton has been with the brand since 1999, when she herself started out working in the first shop. Having studied fashion at Central Saint Martins, she grew with the company, moving into her current position in 2010.\n\nShe explains the role of underwear, and particularly lingerie, to women now and how the launch of this prominent exhibition at the V&A is indicative of society's wider attitudes.\n\n\"Only 25 years ago we didn't really talk about sex, people were quite prudish.

This article was originally published in April 2016.\n\nWhile other artists turn to the easel with paint or pastels, Cai Guo-Qiang prefers to make a statement with explosives.\n\nBorn in Quanzhou, China but based in New York, Cai has made a career from bending gunpowder to his will. His most well-known work arguably takes two divergent routes: aerial firework displays or vast gunpowder paintings made by detonating large trails of it on to paper, ignited live in front of a live audience. Transient or permanent, his oeuvre is always spectacular.\n\n\"The most powerful artwork is when there's fear,\" says Cai, speaking from Qatar where he has curated an exhibition of Chinese artists , commissioned by Sheikha Al Mayassa.\n\nWhen it comes to explosions, he hasn't always been in such control. Cai says he owes a debt to his grandmother, who came to the rescue during his first experiments with gunpowder. \"Once I ignited the fire [and] the entire canvas lit up,\" he recalls. \"She just put a rug in the living room over the fire. From a young age I've learned a lot from her.\" He says his next piece will be dedicated to her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 The documentary \"Sky Ladder\", Cai Guo-Qiang's most ambitious project to-date, is now on Netflix.

He transcends cultural boundaries by creating a dialogue between viewers and the world around them.\n\nWorking across various mediums including drawing, installation, video and performance art, his work is internationally renowned, with accolades including the Golden Lion at the 48th Venice Biennale in 1999, the 7th Hiroshima Art Prize in 2007, and the 20th Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2009. He was also Director of Visual and Special Effects for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n\"Throughout Chinese art history, some artists have been pursuing their own artistic language and how to use this language to convey and connect,\" he explains. Cai's is certainly unique, a medium he says he uses to explore Eastern philosophy, Maoist sentiment and contemporary social issues.\n\n\"People will look into Chinese political and social issues and artists have to show their society,\" he argues, \"but people have neglected the individual creativity, artistic attitude, concepts and the art itself.\"\n\nWith the artistic process front and center of Cai's work, you couldn't avoid it if you tried.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s he honed his craft, studying the work of some of the best shoe ateliers and factories, while cavorting with everyone from Bianca Jagger to David Hockney\n\nIt was in the 1990s the Manolo Blahnik that the fashion world knows and loves came to the fore.\n\nToday, despite his estimated net worth of over $200 million, he continues to be the sole designer at Manolo Blahnik and works alone without assistants or apprentices; he's responsible for the design of every one of the thousands of shoes that bear his name.\n\nSo how do you build a shoe empire? Watch the video above for Blahnik's 6 simple rules.", "By Stephy Chung , CNN Hong Kong Written by\n\nThis article was originally published in March 2016.\n\nLike any first-time homeowners, when Andy Knight and Michelle Tennant began looking for a place to settle in Hong Kong, they had a wish-list in mind.\n\nBetween them, their list of amenities included a home cinema, a gym, a large kitchen, a full-sized bathtub, plenty of storage space and the latest smart gadgets.\n\nIt was an ambitious checklist, given that the apartment they eventually settled on was a modest 309 square feet (28.7 meters).\n\nBut that didn't stop Knight and Tennant from dreaming big. \"We effectively did the math,\" explains Knight, of their apartment in Central district.\n\n\"The one-million Hong Kong dollars ($128,700 USD) we would have spent for an additional 90 square feet, didn't give us much size to play with. To get more bang for our buck, we decided to put that money towards a super-efficient refurbishment.\"\n\nConvertible spaces\n\nDream home crammed into 309-sqft transformer apartment\n\nThe couple tasked Hong Kong-based firm LAAB Architects to design a convertible 'transformer' apartment.\n\n\"It felt like mission impossible,\" recalls LAAB Design Director Otto Ng, of when he first heard the brief.\n\n\"It's very challenging to look at architecture that isn't static, but changes over time. Instead of living in a 309 square foot home, we wanted them to feel like they live in a 1000 square foot home.\"\n\nThe firm spent three months on the schematic design -- shuffling through 40 iterations of the layout in 3D -- before reaching a final concept. Five more months were spent on testing prototypes and the actual construction.\n\n\"We had to consider how to combine multiple functions that exist at different times of the day. For instance, the size of the bathtub, we noticed, is similar to the size of bed. By putting cushions on top of the bathtub, the area can be converted into a two-tiered seating arrangement for a home cinema.\"\n\nThe use of specific materials to fit each space was also taken into account. \"Because the bathtub turns into a bedroom and living room, we had to make sure the fabric of the sofa was waterproof, and that there was a ventilator above to dry the wet areas,\" Ng explains.\n\nMaximizing space\n\nDemand for convertible designs is becoming popular in cities with pricey property markets.\n\nAccording to Mercer's 22nd annual Cost of Living Survey , Hong Kong is now the world's most expensive city for expats. The global consulting firm's findings, released this week, cover 209 cities across five continents and compare factors such as housing costs.\n\nInvestment firm CBRE estimates that one square foot in Hong Kong\u200b costs on average $1,416 USD, \u200bpositioning the city as the world's most expensive residential location ahead of London and New York.\n\nIn Knight and Tennant's convertible apartment, floorboards automatically lift for extra storage, cupboards drop down from the ceiling, a chopping board folds over the kitchen sink to create more counter space, and walls slide to divide rooms.\n\nThe apartment is equipped with smart technology, with locks and lights fully app-controlled.\n\nThe comforts extend to the couple's three cats, a playful ladder, walkway installed around the perimeter of the ceiling, a hidden litter box under the sink that has a separate ventilation system to keep the air smelling fresh, and a pullout drawer with feeding dishes.\n\nTennant explains that one of the challenges of living in such an apartment, is its jigsaw puzzle-style complexity. \"If you move one thing, you can't do anything else. So the design appeals to a niche market.\"\n\n\"But I'm surprised it hasn't caught on more,\" Tennant adds.\n\n\"There's so much potential in these tiny apartments. Now it's obvious what you can do with a smaller space. It doesn't feel boxed in. Every nook and cranny in our space is utilized.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Bush took over, Souza returned to freelancing. Years later he began covering a young senator from Illinois, who would one day assume the highest office in the land.\n\nSince that day in January 2009, Souza has barely left President Obama's side.\n\nHe's toured the world capturing official engagements and private moments. It's arguable that beyond the President's family, there are few who can claim to have had such access during his two terms.\n\n\"I don't think there's really anyone else in the White House that has that kind of exposure to him,\" Souza admits. \"I mean, they may know him, the National Security team. They know him from the situation room, and the tense meetings in the Oval Office. But they don't see him interact with his daughter after work, or on a Saturday.\n\n\"From a documentary standpoint, I'm the only person that sees him in all these different roles.\"\n\nSocial media changes the game\n\nWhether that's photographing the beloved Bo aboard Air Force One or Jacob Philadelphia, a young African American comparing his hair to Obama's, Souza has been there.\n\nAnd the public have never been far behind.\n\n\"I happened to be the person in this job when all these social media tools came into existence,\" he says. \"I mean, Instagram did not exist before this administration.\"\n\nSouza's job has transformed immeasurably since his time with Reagan, actively encouraged by the White House to jump on Flickr, Instagram and other platforms, giving him \"a chance [to show] some of my documentary photos to the public now, instead of waiting post-presidency.\" (The White House Instagram account has 2.6 million followers , while on Flickr Souza and his team have posted over 6,000 images .)\n\nEarlier this year Souza estimated he would take approximately two million images by the end of Obama's presidency. So when the administration's second term concludes, how will he look back on his work?\n\n\"I've got to say there's so much happening, every day, that it's hard to take time to reflect on things,\" he says.\n\n\"I think any photographer that goes back through their pictures -- whether it's five years later or 15 years later -- brings a different perspective to it.

But economists say China isn't completely out of the woods yet, with those tariffs set to increase from 10% to 25% at the end of this year.\n\nThe surge in October could reflect people looking to beat the December tariff increase, and was helped by the fall in the value of the yuan against the dollar this year.\n\n4.

They are different because different situations inspire and require very different answers.\"\n\nBangkok rising\n\nIn line with that philosophy, MahaNakhon -- Scheeren's pixelated vision of a luxury mixed-use tower situated in Bangkok's business district -- looks little like the rest of his repertoire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 \u2013 Mahanakhon, Bangkok \"I don't have this sense of letting go or parting so much, when I design a building,\" says Scheeren. \"I never design it for myself to begin with. I design it for the people that will ultimately own it, or inhabit it or work in it, or live in it.\" Credit: Iwan Baan\n\nBased on the shape of an extruded square, the building's central tower rises up and connects a large number of small-scale geometric extrusions to create the image of an unfinished building, or a Jenga game in progress.\n\n\"MahaNakhon is a vision of a tower that is very much about process, about becoming, about developing,\" Scheeren says of the building.\n\nThe architect himself lived in Bangkok in the late 1990s, an experience he says connected him deeply to the city's fabric and people.\n\nThe Interlace, Singapore Credit: world architecture festival\n\nDuring that time, he spent six months mapping the city's \"visions of the future\" -- some 250 unfinished towers that would never be actualized largely due to the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the country's political instability.\n\n\"Bangkok revealed itself as a place co-existing simultaneously between a presence of an incredibly strong past, and yet a commitment to a very futuristic and fearless relationship to urbanity,\" he recalls.\n\nThis contradictory mix of tradition and modernity has given Bangkok an eclectic skyline that hosts some of the craziest architecture on the planet according to Scheeren.\n\n\"It has a robot building, an elephant building, pyramids buildings, UFOs...all of that juxtaposed with traditional Thai temples, colors and textures.\"\n\nCapturing intensity with space\n\nMahaNakhon itself has withstood two revolutions, a coup and nationwide flooding in recent years but it will become the city's tallest skyscraper upon its completion later this year -- \"a testament of strength\" according to Scheeren.\n\nBut while the building may tower above this sprawling metropolis, Scheeren says the design's distinct fa\u00e7ade and use of space is intended to strike an ongoing dialogue with the city and capture its intensity.\n\nThe MahaNakhon Credit: MahaNakhon by Buro Ole Scheeren Group\n\n\"The intensity of the traffic, the noise, the spaces of the colors, it's important to capture the river...it's also the smaller scale alleys, the small grain of city,\" he says.\n\nIt's play with space is also used to provide relief to what Scheeren believes are the building's most important component -- its inhabitants.\n\n\"I believe in the interest of space and also the power of space to do something to the people that inhabit it,\" Scheeren says.\n\n\"By revealing the people that are in the tower, you are suddenly connected back to the urban life of the city, the public realm...the public inhabitance is a very strong theme in a way.\"", "(CNN) \u2014 Luxury hotels and resorts conjure images of carefree travel , designer furnishings, lavish restaurants and the well-to-do milling about in grand fashion. But all that can change in rapid time, leaving decay and squalor in its place.\n\nWar, weather, financial foul-ups and manmade catastrophes have all contributed to many of these former pleasure palaces being left to ruin.\n\nHere are 10 of the most celebrated abandoned hotels in destinations around the world:\n\n1. Sheraton Rarotonga, Cook Islands\n\nThis sprawling almost-resort along the coast road on Rarotonga, one of the Cook Islands, is still shown on Google Maps even though it has never hosted a single guest.\n\nCalled the \"Heartbreak Hotel\" by islanders, the project nearly bankrupted the tiny Pacific nation.\n\nThe 200 rooms were tiled, plumbed, wired and fitted with air-conditioning. Some were carpeted and furnished -- but now the only residents are a few squatters and local gangs.\n\nConstruction began in the late 1980s but, when it was almost complete, the backers pulled out amid allegations of misappropriated funds.\n\nRelated content Abandoned luxury hotels that you can't afford to miss\n\n2. Sofitel Heiva, Huahine, French Polynesia\n\nParts of the Sofitel Heiva are on the brink of collapse. courtesy roderick eime\n\nIdeally located on a secluded spit of land on the French Polynesian island of Huahine, the over-water bungalows here still appear alluring and the botanic garden-like grounds are still meticulously maintained.\n\nCloser inspection reveals a totally derelict property, battered by the elements and stripped of all fittings, with gaping holes in the bungalow roofs and many of them in danger of collapse.\n\nIt's been more than a decade since the last guest checked out and the former Sofitel stands as a somber monument to the dramatic downturn in this onetime holiday paradise.\n\nIt was reported in February 2018 that Californian investment group Mega 5 is interested in redeveloping the site as a new hotel complex.\n\n3. Lee Plaza, Detroit, Michigan\n\nThe city of Detroit is slowly rebuilding itself after filing for bankruptcy five years ago, but even so, many of the beleaguered metropolis's great buildings are still crumbling into dust.\n\nAlready the grand Statler, Tuller and Madison-Lenox hotels are gone, leaving the Lee Plaza, a stately 1929 art-deco high-rise, the sole unoccupied survivor of heritage status.\n\nClosed for more than two decades, the Charles Noble-designed 15-floor structure has deteriorated badly despite a preservation order and inclusion on the US National Register of Historic Places\n\nImages from inside reveal its former grandeur and serve as a tragic indictment of this once great city's spectacular fall from prominence.\n\nThere is hope for the building yet, however: There have been several redevelopment proposals and, in September 2018, crews were spotted installing plexiglass windows at the plaza.\n\nLocation: 2240 West Grand Boulevard, Detroit, Michigan 42\u00b021\u203234\u2033N 83\u00b06\u20326\u2033W\n\nRelated content Going to Detroit? 10 things to know before you visit\n\n4. Ryugyong Hotel, Pyongyang, North Korea\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel dominates the Pyongyang skyline. Getty Images/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nIs this hotel the world's greatest construction folly? Many say yes.\n\nBegun in 1987 as a monument to North Korea's eternal leader, Kim Il-sung, what was conceived as an attempt to create the world's tallest hotel has turned into the secretive Stalinist state's greatest visible embarrassment.\n\nThe 330-meter, 3,000-room, 105-story pyramid-shaped tower has yet to welcome a single guest.\n\nA new LED display was added to the exterior of the skyscraper was added in 2018, but there is still no news of long-term plans for the building.\n\nRelated content How to visit the Korean Demilitarized Zone\n\n5. Hotel Renakse, Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n\nThis historic hotel is a well-known landmark opposite the Royal Palace on the waterfront at the Tonle Sap and Mekong junction.\n\nIt began as part of the Royal Court of Justice and, in 1979, housed the first post-Khmer Rouge government. The century-old French colonial-style hotel is owned by the Cambodian People's Party -- or was.\n\nIn a controversial transaction that broke the leaseholder's contract, it was sold in 2008 to a private development company with ties to the ruling party.\n\nPhnom Penh residents and other concerned persons launched a petition to save it from demolition, but its future remains uncertain.\n\n6. Varosha, Famagusta, Cyprus\n\nThe empty apartment blocks and beaches of Varosha. LAURA BOUSHNAK/AFP GETTY IMAGES\n\nThe once flourishing resort district of Varosha in the Cypriot city of Famagusta was once frequented by the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and Brigitte Bardot.\n\nSome regarded it as the most famous seaside resort in the world.\n\nWhen Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, Varosha saw bloody fighting on its streets and, since partition of the island, the once hedonistic enclave is now a forbidden, fenced-off no man's land.\n\nNot one, but dozens of hotels are slowly falling apart as the urge to resettle this region has long diminished.\n\nThe Argo, Grecian, Asterias, Florida and King George are just some of the luxury hotels that will probably never see another guest.\n\n7. Igloo City, Alaska\n\nIf you're driving out along the George Parks Highway in Alaska, keep your eyes peeled for the bizarre Igloo Hotel near Cantwell.\n\nAt first glance you might think it was some forgotten Cold War installation or spaceship, but it was started in the 1970s and contravened so many building codes it couldn't ever be opened.\n\nIt's served variously as a souvenir stand and gas station over the years but is now all but derelict.\n\nOpen to vandals, wild animals and the savage Alaskan elements, enter at your own risk.\n\n8. El Hotel del Salto, Colombia\n\nEl Hotel del Salto: A polluted river and ghostly rumors. courtesy Cesar Alejandro Uribe T. (CAUT)\n\nOverlooking the stunning Tequendama Falls on the Bogota River 30 kilometers southwest of the Colombian capital, this hotel sat empty and forlorn for two decades.\n\nScenic beauty regardless, the river powering the falls is one of the most polluted in the world and, coupled with the hotel's \"most haunted\" reputation, soon put overnight guests off.\n\nThe popularity of the falls for suicides also helped to doom this ornate little hotel.\n\nBuilt as a mansion in 1928 for the Colombian elite, it will never host another guest even if they did want to stay -- it's become a Museum of Biodiversity and Culture.\n\n9. Hotel Polissya, Pripyat, Ukraine\n\nThis then 10-year-old, eight-storey hotel, along with the entire city of 50,000 residents, was hurriedly evacuated in April 1986 after the catastrophic explosion of the nearby Chernobyl nuclear reactor.\n\nOne of the tallest structures in the abandoned city, Hotel Polissya serves as a prominent and sad reminder of that fateful day.\n\nThe new wave of disaster tourists make a beeline for the building for a rooftop view over the desolate urban wasteland.\n\nThe hotel, along with a ghostly amusement park, high school and stadium, make of Pripyat an altogether unsettling experience.\n\n10. Unknown hotel, Vientiane, Laos\n\nJust as many abandoned hotels are famous for their once lavish accouterments and celebrity guests, others are notable for their anonymity.\n\nThis forlorn, riverside pension still has a couple of ground level occupants but is largely abandoned.\n\nClearly of French colonial origin, it probably dates from the 1920s or 1930s -- no definitive written or other record remains to confirm it.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

de la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller\n\nAl despedir a Sessions, Trump anunci\u00f3 que Matt Whitaker, secretario general de Sessions en el Departamento de Justicia, ocupar\u00eda el cargo de forma interina\n\nWashington (CNN) - Un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de que los votantes eligieran un gobierno dividido al entregar la C\u00e1mara de Representantes de nuevo al Partido Dem\u00f3crata, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, hizo ese tipo de movimiento de Yo-hago-lo-que-se-siente-bien-cuando-se-siente-bien que se ha convertido en su sello en los \u00faltimos tres a\u00f1os de su vida pol\u00edtica: destituy\u00f3 a Jeff Sessions.\n\nY al hacerlo, Trump parece haber recuperado el control operacional de la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial Robert Mueller en la interferencia rusa en las elecciones de 2016 y la posibilidad de colusi\u00f3n entre la campa\u00f1a de Trump y una potencia extranjera.\n\nAl despedir a Sessions - por medio de un tuit, naturalmente - Trump anunci\u00f3 que Matt Whitaker, secretario de Sessions en el Departamento de Justicia, ser\u00eda el secretario de Justicia interino, un cargo que puede ocupar durante aproximadamente 200 d\u00edas ya que no ha sido confirmado previamente por el Senado.\n\nPero incluso tener a Whitaker en el cargo durante los pr\u00f3ximos 100 d\u00edas podr\u00eda ser suficiente para Trump. Whitaker ha sido un abierto cr\u00edtico de la amplitud de la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller e incluso reflexion\u00f3 sobre esta cadena de eventos en 2017 en una entrevista con CNN:\n\n\"Puedo ver un escenario en el que Jeff Sessions es reemplazado, se retrasa el nombramiento y ese secretario de Justicia no despide a Bob Mueller, sino que simplemente reduce su presupuesto a algo tan m\u00ednimo que sus investigaciones pr\u00e1cticamente se detienen\".\n\nConsiderando los pasados comentarios de Whitaker, los dem\u00f3cratas inmediatamente lo urgieron a declararse no apto para vigilar la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller. Lo que, um, no ha ocurrido.\n\nTrump se deshizo de Sessions porque nunca pudo perdonar que el exsenador por Alabama se declarara no apto en la investigaci\u00f3n rusa, una decisi\u00f3n que puso al secretario de Justicia adjunto, el general Rod Rosenstein, a cargo de la investigaci\u00f3n y, en la mente de Trump, llev\u00f3 al nombramiento de Mueller.\n\nY Trump pudo simplemente haber promovido a Rosenstein al puesto de Sessions pero prefiri\u00f3 a Whitaker sobre \u00e9l. El que Rosenstein haya expresado repetidamente su apoyo a Sessions, a Mueller y a la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial no es una coincidencia en cuanto a que no haya sido considerado para el cargo.\n\nNo me crean a m\u00ed sobre las intenciones de Trump en relaci\u00f3n a la investigaci\u00f3n rusa. Cr\u00e9anle al propio Trump. Esto es lo que \u00e9l dijo acerca de la investigaci\u00f3n - y su papel en ella - durante una conferencia de prensa este mi\u00e9rcoles:\n\n\"Yo me alejo de eso. Pero, \u00bfsabes lo que hago? Simplemente dejo que avance. Ellos est\u00e1n desperdiciando mucho dinero, pero yo dejo que avance, porque no quiero hacerlo. Pero tienes raz\u00f3n, yo podr\u00eda terminarla ahora mismo. Yo podr\u00eda decir: 'esa investigaci\u00f3n se acab\u00f3'\".\n\nAjem. Cof.\n\nSiniestro, \u00bfno? Especialmente cuando uno considera que, de acuerdo con el reporte, Trump ya sab\u00eda que Sessions se iba cuando dio la conferencia de prensa. (El secretario general de la Casa Blanca John Kelly despidi\u00f3 a Sessions el mi\u00e9rcoles por la ma\u00f1ana).\n\nAs\u00ed que, Trump se ha referido a la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller como una cacer\u00eda de brujas y como una farsa m\u00e1s de 160 veces desde que comenz\u00f3 el segundo trimestre del a\u00f1o. Ha dicho que se trata de un desperdicio de dinero y ha buscado desacreditar no solo a Mueller, sino a los investigadores que \u00e9l ha contratado para trabajar en la oficina del fiscal especial. Y se deshizo del sujeto que apoyaba la investigaci\u00f3n, descart\u00f3 a otro sujeto que tambi\u00e9n respaldaba la investigaci\u00f3n y eligi\u00f3 como secretario de Justicia interino a un sujeto que ha dicho todo tipo de cosas negativas sobre la investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl punto: Todas las luces est\u00e1n en rojo.

Hide Caption 196 of 197", "(CNN) Ten years ago, on a rain-soaked afternoon in S\u00e3o Paulo, Lewis Hamilton claimed the first of his five world titles to become the youngest Formula One champion in history.\n\nIn 2008, the Brazilian Grand Prix was the 18th and final race of the season and, in theory, should have been a victory procession for the Briton who needed only to finish fifth.\n\nIt turned out to be anything but and is now remembered as an enthralling, nail-biting title decider.\n\n\"I just got a chill up my spine because it was an amazing experience,\" Hamilton later told CNN as he reflected on that first title win.\n\nA late tropical deluge delayed the start of the race and set the scene for an outcome so dramatic, even Hollywood's best script writers would have struggled to imagine it.\n\nFrom last-lap drama to internet conspiracy theories, it was the race that produced everything.\n\n\"Unquestionably the most dramatic (of Hamilton's wins), he didn't know he was world champion until the last quarter of a mile,\" F1 author Maurice Hamilton tells CNN.\n\n\"It was arguably one of the most dramatic finales to any world championship ... I can never remember one as dramatic as that. Up until the last lap you didn't know which way it was going to go.\n\n\"It's in the top two or three of the most amazing grands prix I've seen.\"\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\n\nHamilton boasted a seven-point lead over Ferrari's Felipe Massa heading into the race at Interlagos, but memories of the previous year's capitulation were very much still at the forefront of his mind.\n\nJust 12 months earlier, Hamilton again led the drivers' championship going into the final race -- four points ahead of McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso and seven ahead of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nAfter the McLaren pair almost took each other out on lap one, Hamilton went on to suffer car problems and the \"Iceman\" was able to snatch the title in his first season at Ferrari.\n\n\"The events in 2007 made him (Lewis) very nervous, no question,\" said Maurice Hamilton.\n\n\"They should have won that championship and because Hamilton and Alonso were at each others' throats, they finished joint second and Kimi came through the middle and took it.\n\n\"The team were very nervous. I'm sure it would have been playing on his mind, he did admit on the last lap he was a complete bag of nerves and driving on adrenaline.\"\n\nTwo torrential downpours tested the drivers to their limits.\n\nIn 2008, Massa qualified on pole with Hamilton fourth and the opening 63 laps passed largely without incident for the two main protagonists.\n\nAs the skies cleared and the track dried, every driver in the field switched to dry tires.\n\nHamilton bounced between fourth and fifth, both positions good enough to win him the title, while a faultless Massa led throughout.\n\nJust as it was looking like Hamilton would cruise through the final eight laps, black rainclouds again began to loom menacingly overhead.\n\nThe rain was light at first, little more than a few spots, but just two laps later it was coming down hard enough to convince McLaren that Hamilton needed to pit for the wet-weather tires.\n\nBy lap 66, every car had pitted to make the same changes -- except two.\n\nToyota had decided to keep its two drivers, Timo Glock and Jarno Trulli, on dry tires and kept their fingers crossed the rain held off enough for them to not lose the time gained from choosing not to pit.\n\nThe decision initially proved a success for Toyota as Glock rose from seventh to fourth and left Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel fighting it out for fifth.\n\nThe young German -- at that time driving for Toro Rosso -- was all over the back of Hamilton's McLaren.\n\n'I only prayed'\n\nLewis Hamilton crosses the line in fifth place to win the title.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, Polish driver Robert Kubica unlapped himself on the inside of the final turn on lap 68.\n\nShaken by the surprise overtake, Hamilton took a wide path that allowed Sebastian Vettel past. All of a sudden, the 2008 world championship was in Massa's hands.\n\n\"Well I never give up, so I kept pushing,\" Lewis Hamilton told CNN soon after the race. \"Right until I got to the line and up until the second to last lap I was world champion pretty much.\n\n\"But it's never over until it's over and then I lost position. I only prayed that I could get it back and I couldn't catch this guy (Vettel) and I got to turn 10 of 12 on the last lap and I hadn't overtaken him.\"\n\nOn the final lap, with time and track rapidly running out, it seemed all of Hamilton's prayers were answered. The heavens opened, making is almost impossible for Glock to find any grip on dry tires.\n\nOut in front, almost 30 seconds ahead of the unfolding drama, Massa had taken the checkered flag with a flawless drive on home soil.\n\nHis Ferrari garage celebrated wildly, as did tens of thousands of fans in the grandstand who thought they were celebrating the first Brazilian world champion since Ayrton Senna.\n\nBut on the 71st and final lap, with the track now sodden after the torrential downpour, Glock had slowed so much both Vettel and Hamilton had been able to make up a 15-second deficit.\n\n\"He (Lewis) didn't know what was going on,\" Maurice Hamilton said. \"The team were shouting at him that he had to try and catch Glock and he didn't know what they were talking about.\n\n\"He had been trying to get past Vettel, that was his focus. All this is panning out in front of him and he's trying to keep the car on the road because it's wet.\"\n\nWith just one corner remaining, Hamilton edged his way past on the inside of Glock, who by this point was struggling to just keep the car on the track.\n\n\"I wasn't close enough to get him (Vettel) by turn 12,\" Lewis Hamilton recalled.\n\n\"It just so happened that it was wet, another guy was going very slow and I managed to get past him,\" he said, pausing briefly as if to relive that moment.\n\nConspiracy theories\n\nThe realization of what had happened gradually permeated through a jubilant Ferrari garage, causing one mechanic -- in now infamous television scenes -- to smash his head against the wall in anger.\n\nAs the sad reality finally set in for the team, the crowd and Massa's family, the McLaren garage spilled out onto the pit lane to celebrate with Hamilton.\n\n\"It was hugely dramatic and could have gone either way,\" Maurice Hamilton says. \"If the shower of rain had come a minute later, he wouldn't have been world champion, Massa would have won and he wouldn't have passed Timo Glock.\n\n\"It hinges on details like that ... there has been nothing like that since, even in his fights with (Nico) Rosberg and the others there's never been anything as dramatic as that.\n\n\"I don't think many world champions will tell you they had a finale like that.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, a confused Glock swatted away questions in the mixed zone suggesting he had deliberately allowed Hamilton to pass.\n\nThe pair had been friends coming through the ranks in GP2 and that only served to fuel conspiracy theories that Glock moved aside for Hamilton to win the title, though they are allegations the German has refuted on several occasions.\n\n\"It's all over us again ... it's 10 years ago and it seems it's bigger than ever.

It was quite emotional on the podium, it must have been very, very tough to take.\n\n\"You don't often see that and it was a tremendous display of sportsmanship considering the terrible disappointment ... and of course he would never get his chance again.\"\n\nIndeed that would be the closest Massa ever got to winning a world title and he retired from the sport in 2017, the same year Hamilton collected the fourth of his five championship wins.\n\nThe 33-year-old has never been pushed so close in any of his subsequent victories, and fans may be left waiting a while longer to witness another grand prix as dramatic as Brazil 2008.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

There are no other threats to the area.\n\n\"It would be premature to speculate on the motivation,\" Delacourt said, adding that the FBI is still working to \"paint a picture of the frame of mind of the subject.\"\n\nAuthorities also identified the victims, and notified their families.

have probably never heard of fascia, or if you have, it may be in the context of \"blasting\" it to treat cellulite. But talking about fascia has become trendy recently, and not only in the context of looking better in your swimsuit.\n\nA Google search returns more than 79 million hits for the term, and there is even a conference, now in its fifth year, that is entirely devoted to fascia research.\n\nWhat is fascia?\n\nAccording to Stedman's Medical Dictionary, fascia is \"a sheet of fibrous tissue that envelops the body beneath the skin; it also encloses muscles and groups of muscles and separates their several layers or groups.\"\n\nBut this definition is incomplete. Fascia can actually be classified into four types, each with different properties, functions and characteristics. The superficial fascia surrounds the body and includes subcutaneous fat; the deep fascia surrounds the musculoskeletal system; the meningeal fascia surrounds the nervous system; the visceral fascia surrounds body cavities and organs.\n\nIn mainstream medicine, fascia is rarely considered in isolation as the cause of chronic pain disorders. One exception is plantar fasciitis, a painful and relatively common condition in which the fascia that is responsible for maintaining the arch in your foot is inflamed. The inflammation is directly attributed to a stiffening and a decrease in the flexibility of the fascia, according to orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine physician Dr. Shabi Khan.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic references fascia when describing myofascial pain syndrome (\"myo\" is short for muscle), but according to Khan, there is \"little sophisticated knowledge in terms of the functionality or treatment of problems with the fascia,\" and \"when compared with the muscle and tendon structure, fascia has a much less dynamic role.\" He does note that fascia, like most connective tissue in the body, stiffens with age, overuse and injury. The direct role of fascial changes in causing pain and structural changes in conditions such as chronic lower back pain, headaches and cellulite is less clear.\n\nSome body work practitioners including massage therapists, osteopaths, Rolfers, craniosacral therapists and physical therapists claim that fascial restrictions (essentially tightening) -- caused by injury, inflammation, trauma, disuse, overuse, misuse or abuse -- play an important role in contributing to the pain associated with a wide array of conditions including migraines, fibromyalgia, headaches, lower back pain and women's health issues.\n\nFascia specialists claim that treating these fascial restrictions with a variety of methods, including proprietary bodywork methods and/or specialized tools, is an important aspect of overcoming these chronic and painful conditions.\n\nBut what does the science say? Is fascia really that important, and if it is, is there anything we can do to \"fix\" the fascia and get rid of the pain?\n\nIs fascia real science?\n\nDespite the growing interest, the science of fascia, its clinical relevance and how best to treat it (assuming it is clinically relevant) remains controversial, and there is very limited high-quality research to evaluate and support it.\n\nAfter interviewing nearly a dozen experts including medical doctors specializing in anatomy, pathology and orthopedic surgery, and bodywork experts including massage therapists and a physical therapist, I have come to the conclusion that there are two major challenges to fascia research and scientific validation.\n\nFirst, there are major issues with the definition of fascia. Many in traditional medicine consider fascia as simply the tough, fibrous connective tissue surrounding muscle tissue and separating soft tissue areas (including fat) throughout the body. But those who focus on treating it have a broader definition that includes a more dynamic component of fascia (not just the less flexible fibrous tissue), called the extracellular matrix, which is made up of fluid, proteins and carbohydrates.\n\nLending support to this broader definition, pathologist Dr. Neil Theise published a study this year in which he described newly discovered features of the interstitium: fluid-filled spaces within and between all tissues in your body. Thiese believes that interstitium is a component of fascia, and since it is fluid, it can be manipulated.\n\n\"Traditional medicine was wrong to dismiss that idea\" that fascia is more than merely connective tissue, Theise said. \"Nomenclature is an issue: If you focus on the connective tissue, you call it 'fascia'; if you focus on the fluid, it's 'interstitium.' We have a lot of talking and work to do across disciplines to sort this out.\"\n\nThough many fascia manipulation advocates claim that lengthening the restricted fascia is the key to successful treatment, Tom Myers, a prolific author, practitioner and educator of fascial and myofascial anatomy and treatment for more than 40 years, has changed his position over the past decade and now admits that the fibrous component of fascia is actually very difficult to lengthen through manual therapy. He still believes in the clinical relevance and treatment of fascia, but he admits that skin, nerves and muscle are also involved.\n\nAre fascia treatments proven?\n\nMyers' approach to treating fascial restrictions evolved from the work of Ida Rolf, a pioneering female scientist in the 1920s who developed a method of treating fascia called Structural Integration (commonly referred to today as Rolfing.) According to the official Rolfing website, the method works \"to release, realign and balance the whole body, thus potentially resolving discomfort, reducing compensations and alleviating pain.\" Myers claims that this type of treatment, performed over a number of sessions, improves the movement between layers of fascia surrounding structures including tendons, nerves, muscle and ligaments.\n\nPhysical therapist Valerie McGraw, who has worked closely for 28 years with John Barnes, the creator of the Myofascial Release Approach (MFR), supports the concept of modifying the fluid component of fascia. According to the official MFR website , \"Myofascial Release is a safe and very effective hands-on technique that involves applying gentle sustained pressure into the Myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion.\"\n\nMcGraw describes improvements in the fascial fluid as one of the benefits of their manual technique that differs from others, she says, in that it reaches deeper into the tissue and manually engages it for three to five minutes or more before moving on, rather than sliding on the surface like other forms of bodywork. In a way, it is similar to yoga in that the pressure in a specific region is held for longer, just like yoga poses can be held for longer periods instead of the rapid movement of weight lifting or running.\n\nMcGraw also explained that myofascial release practitioners incorporate numerous treatment methods including elongation stretching, a form of cupping (using a sustained pull for three to five minutes or more), and self-treatment utilizing simple pressure tools such as a small air-filled ball and a foam roller into their treatment plans.\n\nThough manual therapies like Myofascial Release and Rolfing are probably not modifying the length of the fibrous component of the fascia, they might be affecting the flexibility of fascia, which could provide the purported beneficial effects. In fact, a very small 2017 study in healthy men using dynamic ultrasound imaging found that myofascial release decreased the stiffness of the fascia in the lower back, and another study found 20% greater stiffness of the lower back fascia in subjects with chronic lower back pain. Another study evaluated two sessions of fascial manipulation added to standard care after hip surgery and found a modest improvement in the flexibility in the hip joint. There are other case reports of the benefits of various fascial treatment methods , but overall evidence of the effectiveness of treatment is limited.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnother major issue with putting so much emphasis on fascia and how to treat it effectively is that it is highly unlikely that fascia ever works or can be treated in isolation from other tissues. Muscles, tendons, ligaments and nerves play an essential and more clearly established role in many chronic pain conditions. The complex interaction and interconnection of all the tissues involved presents a significant challenge to defining and isolating the relevance of fascia.\n\nWhat's the bottom line? If a bodywork practitioner or specialized tool claims to be treating your fascia to relieve your chronic pain (or help you get rid of cellulite), you may indeed get the hoped-for results, but it's a lot more complicated than just fixing the fascia.", "(CNN) More Americans are turning to forms of complementary medicine such as yoga, meditation and chiropractors, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health , part of the National Institutes of Health, says in reportsreleased Thursdaythat more than 30% of US adults and about 12% of children use \"healthcare approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practices.\"\n\nComplementary medicine is when these practices are used alongside conventional medicine.\n\n\"Many people turn to complementary health approaches, such as yoga and meditation, in order to help with symptom management, such as pain. As well, they turn to these approaches for a general sense of wellbeing,\" Richard Nahin , the lead epidemiologist at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and co-author of the reports, wrote in an email.\n\nThe reports, which were compiled using data from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health Interview Survey , looked at the use of yoga, meditation and chiropractors between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe practice of yoga rose from 3.1% of the overall child population in 2012 to 8.4% in 2017 and from 9.5% to 14.3% in adults, equating to about 4.9 million children and 35.2 million adults doing yoga in 2017.\n\nMeditation use went up from 0.6% of children in 2012 to 5.4% in 2017 and from 4.1% of adults in 2012 to 14.2% of adults in 2017.\n\nThe use of chiropractors in children stayed essentially the same -- about 3.5% of children visited chiropractors in both years. There was a small difference for adults, from 9.1% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2017.\n\nMore females are doing yoga in both age groups in 2017: 11.3% of girls, compared with 5.6% of boys, and 19.8% of women, compared with 8.6% of men.\n\nMeditation and chiropractors were more popular with adult women surveyed, but in children, the rates of use between boys and girls were similar.\n\nAmong children, those between 12 and 17, were the most likely to either meditate or visit a chiropractor.\n\nFor adults, yoga was found to be most popular with 18- to 44-year-olds, and meditation and chiropractors were used most by those in the 45-to-64 age group.\n\nRacially, white non-Hispanics were the most likely to use all three methods in both age groups.\n\nThough the patterns of use were the same as in previous years for children, according to the report, there were changes in adult usage.\n\n\"The popularity of meditation surpassed that of seeing a chiropractor to become the second most-used approach among those examined in 2017,\" the report said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAll three methods of complementary medicine appear to have health benefits, Nahin said. Yoga may improve general well-being, and evidence is increasing that it helps with some aspects of wellness, including mental health and stress management. It can also helps relieve lower back and neck pain.\n\nHe also noted that research suggests that meditation can help with medical problems, including symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and that the spinal manipulation of chiropractic research could help low back pain as well as problems such as whiplash-associated disorders.", "\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, tried to process the pop they just heard.\n\nThe pops kept coming and many in the place dived to the floor, searching for a way out. Some people moved to put themselves between the shooter and his potential targets.\n\nTeylor Whittler, a California Lutheran University student, said there was little screaming, just gunfire and a stampede of people.\n\n\"There were at least 50 people that all tried getting up at once and run out the back door. I ended up getting caught in the ground and stumbled over by multiple people,\" Whittler told CNN affiliate KABC . \"Everyone just yelled, 'Run, he's coming!'\"\n\nThe gunman, a US Marines veteran, arrived at the bar on Wednesday night with a pistol, officials said. He shot an unarmed security guard outside the bar, then went in and continued shooting, injuring other security workers, employees and patrons, Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said. Ian David Long , killed 12 people before apparently taking his own life.\n\n\"It's a horrific scene in there,\" the sheriff told reporters at a media briefing. \"There is blood everywhere and the suspect is part of that.\"\n\nSlain sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus was planning to retire next year.\n\nThe casualties included a veteran sheriff's deputy who was nearby talking to his wife on the phone when the call came over the radio for an active shooter.\n\n\"(The deputy said), 'Hey, I have to handle a call. I love you, I'll talk to you later,' \" the sheriff said.\n\nSgt. Ron Helus rushed into the bar as gunshots continued; he was killed.\n\nInvestigators believe Long, 28, used a legally purchased .45-caliber Glock 21 with an extended magazine during the shooting, and they're trying to figure out why he did it.\n\n\"We have no idea what the motive was at this point,\" Dean said Thursday afternoon.\n\nAuthorities have identified a Facebook post believed to have been made by the shooter around the time of the attack, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation.\n\nIn it, the writer says: \"I hope people call me insane... (laughing emojis).. wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony? Yeah.. I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. or 'keep you in my thoughts'... every time... and wonder why these keep happening...\"\n\nWhen CNN read the post to a friend of Long's, who did not want to be publicly identified, the friend said, \"That does not sound like Ian to me at all. I don't know what was going through his head when he wrote this. It must have been terrible.\"\n\nDance floor packed when shooting inside started\n\nThe shooting broke out during the Western-style bar's weekly line dancing and college night open to people 18 and older. People dropped to the floor and hid behind barstools in stunned silence, witnesses said. Others jumped over chairs and broke windows to get out.\n\nSarah Rose DeSon told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\u02da\" that her friend Cody Coffman saved her life. DeSon said she was paralyzed by fear as she saw the gunman pointing his gun.\n\nCoffman told her to get down.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do and I just followed him. I dropped down and I hid with him,\" she said, until he got her to run when the shooter moved away from them. She fled out the front door, but her friend died inside.\n\nTaylor Von Molt, 21, said she was dancing when she \"heard what I thought was a balloon pop.\"\n\n\"I heard it a couple more times, and I turned around and I saw him (the gunman),\" she said. \"He had ... what looked like a bandanna on the bottom on his face, sunglasses, black hoodie, dark jeans.\"\n\nAbout 21 others were injured, many trying to escape, the sheriff's office said.\n\nSix off-duty law enforcement officers were in the bar when the shooting happened, Dean said. Officials said they were unharmed.\n\nA woman whose daughter was at the bar said one of those officers \"stood in front of her daughter, protecting her life with his own,\" Ventura County sheriff's Senior Deputy Julie Novak told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS\n\nWhittler told KABC that several men were in position to block the shooter \"ready to take a bullet for every single one of us.\"\n\nWitnesses described a man clothed in black and wearing glasses as he walked onto the dance floor filled with people and began shooting.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Mass shooting at California bar Molly Esterline is hugged by David Crawford on the scene of a shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California, on Thursday, November 8.

He wrote he had been an infantry machine gunner, had served in Afghanistan and was an instructor in Okinawa, Japan.\n\nDeputy killed after rushing inside\n\nHelus, the slain sheriff's deputy, arrived at the bar three minutes after 911 calls came in, along with two California Highway Patrol officers, Dean said.\n\nHelus went in because gunshots still were being fired, and he was shot multiple times, Dean said.\n\nA Highway Patrol officer pulled Helus out and waited for reinforcements. When more officers arrived, they found the gunman dead inside, Dean said.\n\nHelus died at a hospital, police said.

Chinese exports.\n\nThey leaped almost 16% in October compared with the same month a year earlier. That was significantly higher than analysts had forecast and even stronger than last month's growth\n\nThe performance is surprising because October was the first full month during which new US tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods were in effect. Economists and Chinese government officials said recently that they expected export growth to slow in the final months of the year.\n\nOne reason for the surge is companies are eager to avoid even higher duties in a few months' time: The US tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods that kicked in on September 24 are set to rise from 10% to 25% at the end of the year.\n\nThis \"encourages exporters to rush through orders to the United States,\" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research firm Oxford Economics, wrote in a client note Thursday. But he added that it's \"obviously not the whole story.\"\n\nThe downward slide in China's currency is also playing a role. The yuan has slumped almost 10% against the dollar since February as investors have become more concerned about the health of China's economy and the potential impact of the escalating trade war.\n\nThe United States imposed 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods on September 24.\n\nA weaker currency makes Chinese goods more competitive compared with those of rival exporters and offsets some of the impact of the US tariffs.\n\nChina was also helped in October by strong exports to big markets such as the European Union and Japan.\n\n\"Global demand may be holding up better than feared,\" Kuijs said.\n\nEconomists are still predicting that the good times for China's huge export industry won't last.\n\nInvestment bank ANZ said Thursday that it expects the real difficulties to start after the US tariffs on the $200 billion of Chinese goods rise to 25% at the end of the year.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he's prepared to expand the tariffs to effectively cover all Chinese exports to the United States, which topped $500 billion last year.", "(CNN) The husband of a former Texas deputy has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after he fatally choked a man outside a Denny's restaurant.\n\nTerry Thompson was convicted of murder Monday and sentenced Wednesday in the death of 24-year-old John Hernandez, CNN affiliate KTRK reported.\n\nThe young father was left unconscious last year after Thompson confronted him for urinating outside the restaurant and an altercation ensued, the Harris County sheriff's office said. He was taken off life support three days later.\n\nA 52-second cell phone video showed Hernandez kicking and gasping for air as Thompson restrained him in a chokehold while Thompson's wife, an off-duty deputy, pinned Hernandez's left arm to the ground.\n\nThe couple was indicted on murder charges nearly two weeks after the incident. Thompson's wife, former Harris County Deputy Chauna Thompson, was fired months later.\n\nThe case sparked a series of protests and authorities faced allegations that Thompson received preferential treatment from his wife's law enforcement colleagues. This week's verdict and sentence came months after Thompson's previous trial ended in a mistrial.\n\nHarris County District Attorney Kim Ogg described Thompson's sentence as appropriate, saying it would bring solace to the Hernandez family and the community.\n\nJohn Hernandez\n\n\"I think this is another lesson that things are never resolved successfully through violence and when they are, people would pay the price just as Terry Thompson did,\" Ogg told reporters outside the courtroom.\n\nScott Courtney, Thompson's attorney, said it was not the outcome he wanted.\n\n\"I never quarrel with the jury's decision, and I don't. They heard the evidence and they came to a just verdict and we accept that,\" Courtney told KTRK.\n\nChauna Thompson's trial is set for April, Ogg said.\n\nThe deadly fight\n\nIt was just after 11 p.m. on the night before Memorial Day when Terry Thompson verbally confronted Hernandez for urinating outside the Northeast Harris County restaurant, the sheriff's office said.\n\nCourtney claimed Hernandez rushed to Thompson and struck him in the face.\n\nAs Thompson brought Hernandez to the ground, a man walked outside the restaurant and started recording the incident. The video shows Thompson on top of Hernandez, telling him, \"Do you want me to hit you again? Do you want me to hit you again?\"\n\nVideo shows Terry Thompson with his arm around John Hernandez's neck.\n\nThen two unknown people try to block the bystander from recording more of the scene. At one point a woman screams, \"It's illegal to record.\" Several seconds later the recording stops.\n\nUnder Texas law, individuals are allowed to videotape others without their permission in public spaces with the exception of dressing rooms and bathrooms, but only if it's not for sexual purposes.\n\nCourtney said Thompson was acting in self-defense.\n\nWhen Hernandez stopped resisting, the Thompsons \"noticed that he was not breathing,\" a statement from the sheriff's office said.\n\nBefore he was taken to the hospital, the statement says, Chauna Thompson performed CPR on Hernandez.", "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Tesla has chosen a new leader for its board of directors after Elon Musk was forced to step down.\n\nThe electric car company said late Wednesday that Musk will be succeeded by Robyn Denholm, the chief financial officer of Australian telecommunications company Telstra.\n\nDenholm, who is already a member of Tesla's ( TLSA ) board, will begin working at the company full time after her six-month notice period with Telstra is over.\n\n\"To ensure a smooth transition during the remainder of Robyn's time at Telstra ( TLSYY ), Elon will be a resource to Robyn and provide any support that she requests in her role as chair,\" Tesla said in a statement.\n\nMusk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine in a deal to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year.He remains CEO of the company he co-founded.\n\nRobyn Denholm has been an independent director at Tesla since 2014.\n\nTesla also agreed to appoint two new independent directors to its board and establish a committee to oversee Musk's communications.\n\nThe settlement was in response to the SEC's lawsuit against Musk . The regulator claimed Musk misled investors when he tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, causing the company's stock to soar. He hadn't secured the funding, the SEC said.\n\nUnder the settlement, Musk can't seek reelection as chairman for three years, though he is permitted to remain a board member.\n\nThe appointment of Denholm, an executive with deep experience in corporate finance, comes as Tesla faces intense pressure to fix its balance sheet. Analysts want to see Tesla become consistently profitable , instead of posting sporadic profits every few years\n\nAs head of Tesla's audit committee since 2014, Denholm has had to deal with Tesla's rocky finances for years, but as chair of the board, she'll have more clout.\n\nIn a statement, she said she believes in Tesla's mission and looks forward \"to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nExperience in operations and finance\n\nDenholm was promoted to chief financial officer at Telstra just last month.\n\nShe first joined the Australian telecoms company as chief operating officer in January 2017. During her time in that role, she was part of a team that oversaw a dramatic cost cutting program that included shedding 8,000 jobs.\n\nABB ( Prior to Telstra, she served as a non-executive director and member of the finance and audit committee for Swiss conglomerateABB ( ABB ).\n\nShe made her mark in Silicon Valley as vice president and chief financial officer with Juniper Networks ( JNPR ), a networking equipment and software security company, where she worked for nearly a decade. She also previously worked with Sun Microsystems, the computer and software company now owned by Oracle ( ORCL ).", "(CNN) Uganda is vaccinating against the Ebola virus spreading in neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the outbreak fueled by conflict has left at least 189 people dead.\n\nNo cases have been reported in Uganda so far, but health care workers in high-risk districts bordering the Congo are getting vaccinated as a precaution, health officials said.\n\n\"In vaccinating frontline health workers against Ebola, even before Uganda detects a single case, health authorities are being cautious having learned bitter lessons from previous outbreaks,\" the World Health Organization said.\n\nWhile the vaccine is not available for public use and is considered experimental, it's being handed out under a compassionate use program, the WHO said. The vaccine was given to more than 16,000 volunteers in Africa, Europe and the United States in 2015, and was found to be effective against the Ebola virus.\n\nUganda shares a border with Congo, and both nations experience a robust movement of people between them as a result of trade and the region's high population.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

early every week to be first in line by 6 a.m. for a medical consultation at a government-run hospital in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nAlthough the hospital wasn't far, it was a long wait at the overcrowded clinic full of other medically uninsured South Africans.\n\n\"I don't have medical insurance, and so I couldn't afford everything that was going on. All the tests needed. You can get them quicker if you do it privately,\" Borg explained. \"At the public hospital, there are always between 20 to 30 people waiting ahead of you.\"\n\nIt took six months to get a diagnosis, and by that time, she needed surgery.\n\nThankfully, the 74-year-old recalls, a friend had advised her to ask about a project run by surgeons that help breast cancer patients get their surgery quicker on the public health system: Project Flamingo.\n\nWithin two weeks, Borg was scheduled for surgery. She had a double mastectomy in September, 2018.\n\nDr Liana Roodt operating on a patient and assisted by Dr Michael Brombacher.\n\n\"They saw that the [surgery] list was too long, so they formed Project Flamingo,\" Borg said. \"They gave up their own time on a Saturday to do these operations.\"\n\nBreast cancer is often detected at a late stage, with one study finding that the time to diagnosis in Cape Town was on average 8\u00bd months. Waiting times for a mastectomy after diagnosis can be up to four months in South Africa.\n\nProject Flamingo , founded by surgeon Dr. Liana Roodt, aimed to fix this after Roodt routinely experienced this in her clinic at Groote Schuur, a state-funded teaching hospital in Cape Town.\n\nBorg, who also went through cervical cancer when she was 31, now volunteers at the charity to make sure women don't experience the same challenges she did in getting treatment early.\n\nAn agonizing wait\n\nFor eight years, Roodt has been dedicating her free time and recruiting other surgical volunteers and nurses to get a backlog of vital life-saving surgery scheduled -- for free.\n\n\"So many operations need to be done quickly,\" Roodt said. \"But people were waiting three or four months after diagnosis before they could actually get their surgery done.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Breast cancer: Know the facts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Breast cancer: Know the facts 01:19\n\nMany operating rooms across the country were empty on weekends and public holidays, so in 2010, Roodt started raising funds to schedule and pay for the necessary facilities and nurses on those days.\n\n\"I just wrote an email to everybody in my email inbox,\" she recalled, confessing that she didn't know how to proceed at the beginning.\n\nA few survivors of breast cancer responded right away, and some of her colleagues offered to help kick-start her vision by volunteering their own free time to perform surgeries. Roodt admitted that it took \"quite a few years to gain momentum.\"\n\n500 free surgeries\n\nGetting the right permissions and regulations in place took an astonishing three years, Roodt said.\n\nEven so, more than 500 women have benefited from mastectomies after Roodt and other surgeons began devoting their time freely.\n\nHer \"catchup\" surgeries reduced the backlog at Groote Schuur from a 12-week wait to between two and four weeks.\n\nThe project has spread to nearby Tygerberg hospital, another public health institute in Parow, Cape Town, where Borg had her surgery.\n\nTheatre sisters (nurses) on a break between surgeries.\n\nThanks to Roodt's determination, Project Flamingo has managed to recruit about 10 regular surgical professionals, 10 anesthetists and 10 volunteers who make up 15 staff members devoting their time to each hospital.\n\n\"We've had enough people willing to donate their time. ... Finding nursing time is a challenge, so we pay nursing staff,\" Roodt said.\n\nTo make the process fair, Roodt and her team do not select the patients to benefit; instead, they're chosen from those already on the hospitals' systems.\n\n\"At least six to 15 surgeries are performed a month,\" Roodt said. \"Some of the patients have paid a small fee depending on their income. This is in agreement with the billing policy of the Department of Health to cover their hospital admission. We take care of the expensive part: the surgery.\"\n\nLack of options\n\nrecent report from a group of surgeons in South Africa suggested that the number of specialist breast centers nationwide needs to be increased to cope with demand.\n\n\"The standard we are saying is that you should not wait more than 30 days between going to see a doctor and getting a [breast cancer] diagnosis and we think that is possible,\" said Dr. Sarah Rayne, a surgeon and co-author of the 2017 report.\n\n\"Even in Johannesburg, where you have one of the best centers with the best outcomes, they fail to reach that target more than 60% of the time.\"\n\nRayne says the problem goes beyond timely operations.\n\n\"More than 87% of our [South African] patients require chemotherapy. It means that by operating alone you won't cure that person of cancer. Chemotherapy is only available in five or six centers in the whole country,\" Rayne said.\n\nRadiation equipment is also scarce. \"I think in the whole of Africa, more than half of them [radiotherapy machines] are in South Africa,\" Rayne said.\n\nThere are more machines in the US than the whole of Africa based on the data collected by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe other challenge is the health system itself.\n\n\"In South Africa, more than 65% of the population exist on less than 1,000 rand ($72) a month,\" Rayne said.\n\n\"Only 13% have private health care. Meanwhile, 70% of the doctors in South Africa only work in the private health system.\"\n\nThe problem is amplified in rural areas. \"The health clinic may not be staffed very well because the specialists don't live in that area.\"\n\n\"Doctors have left the provincial hospitals because there's persistent prolonged shortages of staff caused by austerity measures put in place by the provincial government,\" Mvuyisi Mzukwa, a chairman for the KwaZulu-Natal coastal branch of the South African Medical Association, told CNN in an earlier interview\n\nBut this is not a problem that's unique to South Africa. It's echoed across the continent.\n\nDr Liana Roodt in-between surgeries.\n\nDoctors going overseas\n\nSouth Africa has about six surgeons per 100,000 people. The ratio in the United States is 36.\n\nWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the A 2018 report by NOIPolls, a local polling company and advocacy group Nigeria HealthWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, but only 35,000 practice in the country.\n\nMany doctors have emigrated to practice in the UK and US, the report notes.\n\nIn Ghana, Dr. Verna Vanderpuye, a consultant clinical oncologist at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, says it is hard to find the competency. \"The quality of cancer surgeries is also very important,\" she said, suggesting that surgical skills are limited in rural areas.\n\nBoth Rayne and Vanderpuye admit that persuading patients to have a mastectomy is also difficult.\n\n\"For young women, there's the fact that when they have a mastectomy, they only have one breast, and some, they lose their spouses and their position in the society,\" Vanderpuye said.\n\nIn a 2018 study , she found that a fear of mastectomy was the primary reason Ghanaian women present with advance stages of the disease.\n\nFear of treatment was also among the reasons why some women in South Africa had advanced breast cancer.\n\nAmy MacFarlane, a final year medical student closes a wound after operation.\n\nFeeling like a woman\n\n\"In an ideal setting, psychological support, counseling and even practical things like bereavement counseling are super important but seen as a luxury right now,\" Roodt said.\n\nIn South Africa, Project Flamingo started distributing pampering packs to patients that included bathroom essentials, magazines and beauty treats, all for free.\n\nSo far, 4,500 packs have been given away by Roodt and her colleagues and friends.\n\n\"We were trying to show that even though being in hospital can be a daunting experience and you see us running around the wards, we actually do care. ... This diagnosis does not mean you lose your feminist spirit, even though it feels like it,\" Roodt said.\n\nThey can still feel like a woman despite what they are going through, she adds.\n\nMichelle Rennie survived breast cancer 18 years ago, at the age of 46, and is now a director for Project Flamingo, sourcing products for the pamper packs.\n\n\"These pamper packs have helped to build a community,\" Rennie said.\n\n\"We give them to each newly diagnosed woman,\" she added.\n\nTo combat the loneliness that many cancer patients experience, the project also connects survivors like Borg and Rennie with new patients who offer mentorship and support throughout treatment.\n\nProject Flamingo theater nurses on a break.\n\nFor Borg, this kind of relationship building is important. \"Only if you have been through this can you understand what these people are doing,\" Borg said. \"I had a wonderful husband that went with me every day and sat with me every day, but there was a woman next to me with no one.\"\n\nAlthough Roodt has now joined private practice, she still devotes her unpaid time to the project, seeing patients at Groote Shuur.\n\nShe has expanded the project to cover other cancers and complications from cancer, such as colorectal cancer.\n\n\"Many [colorectal cancer patients] develop stomas and have to walk around with a poo bag attached onto their stomachs. But some of those stomas can be reversed after a period of time,\" she said.\n\n\"Imagine having a poo bag attached for two to five years and dealing with a stoma when you are living in a shack with no electricity and no running water,\" Roodt said. \"It's a complete nightmare. It's not good enough to just take care of the cancer but the quality of life is terrible.\"\n\n\"There is a part of me that is hopeful of there not being a need for Project Flamingo,\" she said. \"For a health-care system that is equal and fairer.\"\n\nThat is a \"pipe dream\" for now, she realizes, and so the project will continue to run for as long as it is needed.\n\nOn the unexpected success of the project, Roodt added: \"The amazing thing is the power of human stories. It's people telling their stories and humanity responding to it.\"", "Written by CNN Staff\n\nWhen it came to depicting the timeless beauty of England's historic homes, interior designer David Mlinaric faced a tricky question: \"Where shall I begin?\"\n\nIn his new book \"Great English Interiors,\" produced with photographer and long-time collaborator Derry Moore, the designer looks at five centuries of England's finest interior designs, from the lavish dining room at Waddesdon Manor -- inspired by Louis XIV's state apartments at Versailles -- to a white stone hall built for Britain's first prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 12 \u2013 Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire The dining room in Waddesdon Manor was inspired by Louis XIV's state apartments at Versailles.

Comprising two courtyards around a central banquet hall, the building's interiors feature surfaces of wood, stone and plaster that are free from artificial coloration.\n\nSt George's Chapel: Where Harry and Meghan got married\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries were a coming-age-period for English architecture, marked by a substantial building boom, according to Moore. When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries and halted the construction of new churches, the wealthy upper classes started building grand mansions instead.\n\nThese buildings were symbolic of their owners' power, as well as of history and tradition.\n\nA room in the Chatsworth House shows a mix of 17th century shell and 19th century decoration.

Trump had been tormenting Sessions on Twitter for months.\n\nHe immediately replaced him with an acting attorney general, Matthew Whitaker, who is on record, including in an outspoken CNN opinion piece , expressing fierce opposition to the Russia investigation.\n\n\"It's a break the glass moment,\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Wednesday night.\n\n\"Our democracy is under attack. It's a kind of a slow-motion 'Saturday Night Massacre,' as occurred under President Nixon.\"\n\nWhitaker, who served Sessions at the Justice Department as his chief of staff, now has the power to oversee Mueller, who is seen as moving toward the end of his investigation. Whitaker could narrow the range of the special counsel's mandate or limit funds for his work. It's possible he could also control whether any final report is made public. And he could lay the groundwork to dismiss Mueller.\n\nWhitaker's elevation also wrested control of the Russia probe away from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has shielded Mueller, and is viewed in Washington as a nonpolitical career official acting with integrity.\n\nChanging the subject\n\nIt's not Trump's style to admit mistakes. So he turned the traditional grim post-midterms presidential news conference into a sideshow while waging a base-pleasing war on the press with a fulminating display at a post-election news conference.\n\nNot for Trump the gloom and self-recrimination of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama when they bemoaned a midterm \"thumpin' \" and a \"shellacking.\" Rather than express guilt about lawmakers who lost their jobs, Trump openly bid good riddance to Republicans who had spurned his \"embrace.\"\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia,\" Trump said, of a Utah lawmaker whose race is yet to be called.\n\nFollowing a playbook that had helped him quickly forget business failures in his previous life, he simply declared victory -- hailing an increased GOP majority in the Senate as an \"incredible day\" that he had been instrumental in building -- and moved on.\n\nIt's not unusual for Cabinet officials to pay the price for their boss's failure at the polls. There was an ironic precedent to the toppling of Sessions. Twelve years ago, as Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi was setting the terms for a new political alignment after winning the House -- just as she was Wednesday -- Bush forced out his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nThe President has every right to dismiss any of his Cabinet officials. But his open denunciations of the Mueller probe and months of attacks on the special counsel mean that Trump's critics are deeply skeptical of his motives.\n\nDangerous ground for Mueller\n\nThe swift succession of events appeared to leave Mueller on dangerous new ground.\n\n\"You can't sound too many alarm bells about what has been going on,\" Preet Bharara, former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nFrom the outside, Trump's move against Sessions looked very much like the latest in a sequence of steps, starting with the firing of FBI chief James Comey last year, to undermine the Russia investigation.\n\nWith that in mind, some legal experts questioned whether the backstory of what happened could eventually be perceived as more evidence of corrupt intent, which would be needed to support any finding by Mueller that the President had obstructed justice.\n\nTrump has repeatedly demanded loyalty and protection from his subordinates and Whitaker may soon begin to feel the same kind of heat.\n\nThe President's move presented an immediate challenge to Pelosi, who he had praised earlier Wednesday for her likely return to the speaker's chair, and offered to open a new era of deal making between Washington power players.\n\nShe said it was impossible to see the firing of Sessions as \"anything other than another blatant attempt\" to undermine and end the Mueller investigation.\n\nBut as she also called for Whitaker to recuse himself, Pelosi knows, just like Trump, that there are two months before Democrats have the means to check the President's power.\n\nIt could be that Trump is calculating that he has a window to do as much as he possibly can to stifle Mueller's room to maneuver, under the cover of the sympathetic outgoing Republican-led House and the GOP Senate.\n\n\"The moment of precariousness is, I think, especially significant now because we are in the lame duck phase,\" said Bharara.\n\n\"You have an opportunity to do something very damaging to that investigation.\"\n\nTrump may also have been emboldened by the replenishment of his power offered by strong support from his political base, which turned out in droves to push his acolytes over the line in key Senate races in red states.\n\nAnd his task of confirming a new attorney general becomes even easier in a Senate that has more Republicans and is even more in his debt.\n\nTrump was not content Wednesday with casting a new cloud over Mueller.\n\nHe threatened openly to weaponize one part of the federal government, the Republican-led Senate, against another, the new House that takes office next year, if the pain of oversight becomes too acute.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better,\" Trump said at his news conference.\n\nSuch a move would surely amount to an abuse of presidential authority in the unlikely event that Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a student of the separation of powers, would go along.\n\nStill, the President's comment represented a warning that he would try to strong-arm the newly Trumpian Senate into following his will, much as he did to parts of the Republican-led House, including the Intelligence Committee.\n\nIt is far from the first time Trump has vowed to wield presidential power to further his political goals. On the campaign trail he vowed to wipe out the constitutionally guaranteed birthright citizenship with an executive order.\n\nAnd using his powers as commander in chief, Trump sent thousands of troops to the southern border to meet a yet to emerge threat from a migrant caravan that was at the center of his searing campaign message.\n\nBut if his move against Sessions, was, as it appears, meant to hike pressure on Mueller, it could just as easily backfire since it seems almost certain the new Democratic-led Judiciary Committee will look into the dismissal early in its tenure.", "Es probable una expansi\u00f3n de Medicaid en varios de los 18 estados que hasta ahora no lo expandieron\n\n(CNN) - La atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica result\u00f3 importante, pero aparentemente no fue crucial, en las elecciones intermedias, en las que los votantes les dieron a los dem\u00f3cratas el control de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, dejaron a los republicanos a cargo del Senado y dijeron s\u00ed a la expansi\u00f3n de Medicaid en al menos tres estados controlados por largo tiempo por republicanos.\n\nAl hacerse cargo de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, es poco probable que los dem\u00f3cratas puedan impulsar muchas iniciativas sobre pol\u00edticas de salud, ya que los republicanos siguen controlando el Senado y la Casa Blanca.

LePage no se present\u00f3 de nuevo.\n\nEn las encuestas a boca de urna, como en muchos sondeos anteriores en 2018, los votantes dijeron que la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica, en particular la protecci\u00f3n de las personas con condiciones preexistentes, era su principal problema.

La senadora Claire McCaskill (dem\u00f3crata de Montana) fue derrotada por el fiscal general del Partido Republicano, Josh Hawley, quien es uno de los demandantes en un caso judicial clave que busca declarar inconstitucional a la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible. La senadora Heidi Heitkamp (dem\u00f3crata de Dakota del Norte) y el senador Joe Donnelly (dem\u00f3crata de Indiana), quienes tambi\u00e9n hicieron de la atenci\u00f3n de salud un tema de campa\u00f1a, fueron derrotados.\n\nNo obstante, el senador Joe Manchin (dem\u00f3crata de West Virginia) venci\u00f3 al republicano Patrick Morrisey, el procurador general del estado que tambi\u00e9n es un demandante en la causa que busca cambiar ACA.\n\nLa representante Nancy Pelosi (dem\u00f3crata de California), l\u00edder de los dem\u00f3cratas en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, quien estar\u00eda primera en la lista para asumir como vocera, dijo a un grupo de partidarios reunidos en Washington que su grupo har\u00eda que la asistencia m\u00e9dica fuera un tema legislativo clave.\n\nLEE: 7 lecciones que nos dejan las elecciones intermedias en EE.UU.\n\n\"Se trata de frenar el asalto de los republicanos y del l\u00edder de la mayor\u00eda del Senado, Mitch McConnell, al Medicare, al Medicaid, a la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible, y a la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica de 130 millones de estadounidenses que viven con condiciones m\u00e9dicas preexistentes\", enfatiz\u00f3.

Investigators believe Bulger was attacked by more than one person. At least one inmate involved in the beating has ties to organized crime in Massachusetts, the official said.\n\nJoe Rojas, president of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 506 at the Federal Correctional Complex in Coleman, Florida -- where Bulger was previously housed -- said prison officials \"dropped the ball\" by transferring him to the notoriously violent Hazelton facility and mixing him with the general population.\n\n\"It's like sending somebody to death row,\" Rojas, who was not involved in the decision to transfer Bulger, told CNN.\n\nAt the end of his violent life, feared former mob boss Bulger was an 89-year-old lifer confined to a wheelchair and suffering from a heart condition and other ailments, according to US Bureau of Prisons records and interviews with union officials.\n\nRecords indicate adjustment in care requirements before transfer\n\nBOP records obtained by CNN state that Bulger suffered from high blood pressure, aortic stenosis and prostate and bladder problems.\n\nA previous request made by officials at Coleman to transfer Bulger was denied in April. Records show the request was coded to indicate Bulger required a higher level of medical care, or Care Level 4 , for inmates who are severely impaired and may require daily nursing care.\n\nIt's not clear why the April transfer request was denied. In October, however, a transfer request was approved and coded to indicate he no longer needed to be in a medical facility.\n\nThe records show Bulger's \"medical/physical treatment\" was completed and that he was to be transferred to the general population at Hazelton under Care Level 2 , a lower medical classification for inmates who are stable outpatients that require at least quarterly clinician evaluation.\n\nRojas said if Bulger was dropped to Care Level 2, that would be strange.\n\n\"I don't care who you are, you can't justify dropping him ... to a 2. ... He's always going to be (at least) a Care Level 3 because of his age and he's in a wheelchair\" with heart problems, Rojas said.\n\n\"The only way you drop him to a Care Level 2 is to get rid of him,\" Rojas said. \"Their intent was to get rid of him, probably because he was a crusty old man and a pain in the ass.\"\n\nRojas said he does not believe it was anyone's intent at BOP to get Bulger killed, but the transfer had the effect of \"sending him to die at Hazelton.\"\n\n\"There's no conspiracy to try to get him killed,\" Rojas said. \"Nobody wants to get another inmate killed.\"\n\nRojas said Coleman had appeared to be a good fit for Bulger in two ways: First, Coleman is well prepared to care for inmates with medical needs. Second, the Coleman facility is what's known as a \"closed yard,\" considered a safer type of prison, and houses higher-profile prisoners such as Bulger, informants and former gang members.\n\nApart from its reputation for violence, he said, Hazelton houses current gang members and mafia figures.\n\n\"We all know that you can't put somebody like (Bulger) -- high profile -- there,\" Rojas said. \"It's like throwing meat to a bunch of sharks.\"\n\nFormer warden also questions move\n\nCameron Lindsay, a former warden at five Bureau of Prisons facilities who said he had no direct knowledge of the case, also questioned the timing of Bulger's transfer.\n\n\"The BOP intentionally designated and transferred Bulger with the belief in mind that he could walk the line at Hazelton, meaning he could be placed in the general population there,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"This is astounding given the fact that Bulger is a super high publicity case, as he's one of America's most infamous criminals.\"\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons said it doesn't disclose the reasons for specific inmate transfers.\n\n\"Per BOP policy, the designation process includes a review (that includes) whether there exists any known safety threat from other inmates,\" the prisons bureau statement said.\n\n\"There were no known threats to Mr. Bulger from other inmates upon designation to the Hazelton facility.\"\n\nThe bureau website lists factors considered when designating inmates to correctional institutions, including security, population, and medical needs.\n\n\"It was really odd that he was general population (at Hazelton) given his notoriety and who he was. I was pretty surprised,\" said Richard Heldreth, President of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 420, which represents staff at Hazelton.\n\nLindsay said, \"I don't think that any nefarious plot was afoot. That would be terribly inconsistent with what I know about the Bureau of Prisons. I think it's more -- I'm going to guess it's an issue of complacency. Somebody was asleep at the switch.\"\n\nTwo other prisoners were stabbed to death in fights with fellow inmates this year at US Penitentiary Hazelton -- one in April, and one on September 17, according to a letter sent by members of Congress to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nWith Bulger's death, three Hazelton inmates have now been killed there in seven months. Few details have been released and prison officials have not disclosed whether they believe factors such as increased staffing would have made a difference.\n\nRecords show Bulger got in trouble at Coleman this year\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons records obtained by CNN show the former South Boston mobster was less than a stellar prisoner.\n\nIn March -- one month before the first attempted transfer -- Bulger was found guilty of \"conduct which disrupts -- most like threatening staff,\" according to the records.\n\nRojas said Bulger was sentenced to 30 days in a special housing unit in March after threatening a nurse in February with the warning, \"Your day of reckoning is coming.\"\n\nBulger also had been found guilty in 2015 of masturbating in front of male staff, the records show.\n\nBulger was housed at Coleman since 2014 and accumulated just the two infractions, Rojas said.\n\nAt Coleman, Bulger had \"butlers,\" or younger prisoners who would bring him lunch and do other tasks for him, according to Rojas. Bulger would compensate these men by giving them commissary stamps, and by other means.\n\nThe ex-mobster was generally \"harmless at Coleman,\" Rojas said.\n\nRojas said transfers to tougher prisons generally follow repeated infractions for offenses such as stabbings or fighting.\n\nBulger laid to rest on Thursday\n\nA private funeral Mass was held for Bulger on Thursday at St. Monica-St. Augustine Church in South Boston, according to a statement from the Catholic archdiocese. His burial was also private.\n\n\"Out of respect for the family and those who were hurt, it was a private service just for the immediate family,\" Father James A. Flavin, the pastor, said in the statement.\n\n\"The Church is a spiritual home for any person or family seeking God's Wisdom and peace in a time of crisis and grief. The Church is certainly aware of the deep pain that innocent victims of crime and violence live with every day.\"\n\nFlavin, in his homily, said: \"We pray that everyone is able to feel the peaceful presence of God and His son Jesus in the midst of chaos and pain.\"\n\nBulger, who eluded federal authorities for more than 16 years before his arrest in June 2011, was serving the rest of his life in prison for a litany of crimes that included his role in 11 murders.\n\nHe was sentenced in November 2013 to two life terms plus five years as architect of a criminal enterprise that, in the words of a federal judge, committed \"unfathomable\" acts that terrorized a city.\n\nThe US Penitentiary Hazelton is a high-security facility housing 1,270 male offenders at Federal Correctional Complex Hazelton.\n\nOne of the two suspects in the brutal beating was identified as Fotios \"Freddy\" Geas, a Mafia hit man from Massachusetts, The New York Times has reported, citing unnamed sources. It said Geas was moved to solitary confinement after the killing.\n\nGeas, 51, is serving a life sentence at the same prison for the 2003 murder of a crime boss and another man he believed was an FBI informant.", "Washington, DC (CNN Business) Car companies are betting on bikes and scooters to protect themselves from disruption.\n\nFord announced Thursday it's acquiring the scooter-sharing startup Spin, becoming the latest automaker to invest in electric scooters and bikes.\n\nFord plans an aggressive expansion into over 100 cities in the next 18 months, according to Sunny Madra, vice president of Ford X, its group that develops new mobility services. Ford sees scooters as an affordable, accessible way to move around cities without polluting, congesting traffic or struggling to park.\n\n\"We're finding a really compelling need. The struggle is real as urban populations grow,\" Marci Klevorn, president of mobility at Ford, told CNN Business.\n\nSan Francisco-based Spin launched a dockless bikesharing service just over a year ago, and pivoted to a scooter sharing business, which proved more profitable. It now operates in 13 cities and college campuses, and launches in Detroit Thursday. But it hasn't kept pace with rivals Bird and Lime, which have rapidly expanded, raised hundreds of millions of dollars and sometimes rankled cities with aggressive tactics.\n\nSpin CEO Derrick Ko said joining Ford will allow it to play the long game, rather than rushing to expand to secure another funding round.\n\nFor Ford, the acquisition may protect it from a wave of new mobility options that threaten its core business of cars and trucks. It's not the only automaker taking notice.\n\nEarlier this week, GM said it will sell electric bikes next year . Daimler will launch a scooter-sharing pilot in a Southern European city this year, and expand into Germany next year, according to a spokesman. And last week Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his company might make an electric bike.\n\n\"Automakers are seeing that rideshare, bikeshare and scootershare are taking the short trips, from zero to five miles,\" Horace Dediu, a tech analyst who hosts a popular mobility conference , told CNN Business. \"It's important for them to get ahead of this game.\"\n\nBird and Lime have said they've completed 10 million rides each in the first year of operation, growing far faster than Uber and Lyft did.\n\nNow car companies, scooter startups and analysts are trying to figure out how big the market is for micromobilty, a catch-all term for lightweight, electric transportation options like bikes and scooters.\n\nNearly half of all vehicle trips in the United States are under three miles, according to the US government's National Household Travel survey. Short trips are ideal for micromobility, according to experts, whether it's an electric bike, scooter, or a new option that hasn't arrived yet.\n\nNinebot, which supplies the scooters for Spin, Bird and Lime, plans to unveil an electric moped and a tiny electric car next year, according to Ninebot CEO Gao Lufeng.\n\n\"Consumers are demanding more personalized options,\" Lufeng said through an interpreter. \"There's a lot more room for imagination.\"", "(CNN) Britain's Prince Charles has spoken for the first time about what sort of king he will be, promising not to meddle in controversial affairs once he takes on the role of the monarch.\n\nIn a BBC documentary celebrating his 70th birthday, the heir to the British throne says he will swerve the kind of issues that have brought him criticism in the past.\n\n\"You know I've tried to make sure whatever I've done has been nonparty political, but I think it's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir,\" said Charles, who turns 70 on November 14.\n\n\"But the idea somehow that I'm going to go on exactly the same way if I have to succeed is complete nonsense because the two ... the two situations are completely different. You only have to look at Shakespeare plays, 'Henry V' or 'Henry IV, Part 1 and 2,' to see the change that can take place -- because if you become the sovereign, then you play the role in the way that it is expected,\" he said.\n\n\"So, clearly ... I won't be able to do the same things I've done you know as heir, so of course you operate within the ... the constitutional parameters. But it's a different function.\"\n\nCharles inspects insects with students as he launches a new charity last year in London's Hyde Park.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) \u2014 Bottoms up!\n\nChinese archaeologists have uncovered a 2,000-year-old bronze pot that contains an alcoholic liquid believed to be wine.\n\nThe discovery occurred on November 6 in China's Henan province, west of Shanghai.\n\nShi Jiazhen, who is head of the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in the province's city of Luoyang, tells China's Xinhua news agency that \"there are 3.5 liters of the liquid in the color of transparent yellow.

Tampoco las capitales. La tendencia entre 2017 y 2018 la han marcado ciudades diferentes \u2014incluso poco conocidas\u2014 que despertaron la curiosidad de los viajeros en seis naciones de Latinoam\u00e9rica y cuyas b\u00fasquedas frente al a\u00f1o pasado crecieron muy por encima del promedio. Adem\u00e1s de registrar una fluctuaci\u00f3n de precios muy favorable para los pasajeros.\n\nEl primer informe de Viajala, un metabuscador de vuelos y hoteles gratuito que compara sitios de viajes a nivel global, analiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 47 millones de b\u00fasquedas para identificar los destinos en crecimiento que est\u00e1n generando tendencias en Am\u00e9rica Latina. Cabe aclarar que estos lugares no son los que acumulan el mayor volumen de viajeros ni de b\u00fasquedas \u2013pues esos corresponden a las capitales y los lugares de siempre que todos conocemos, seg\u00fan el cofundador y presidente ejecutivo de Viajala Thomas Allier\u2013 sino aquellos con un aumento significativo en el inter\u00e9s de los viajeros plasmado en las b\u00fasquedas y que adem\u00e1s ofrecen una disminuci\u00f3n o poco aumento de tarifas.\n\nEntonces, \u00bfcu\u00e1les son los destinos nacionales con la medalla de oro en cada pa\u00eds evaluado?\n\nArgentina: Tucum\u00e1n, con un aumento del 1261% en todas las b\u00fasquedas y una disminuci\u00f3n de precios del 9,8%\n\nBrasil: Sao Luis, con un crecimiento del 106% en b\u00fasquedas y un aumento en la tarifa del 3%.\n\nColombia: Pereira, con un aumento del 41,02% de las b\u00fasquedas y una variaci\u00f3n en el precio de -2,22%.\n\nChile: Valdivia, con un aumento del 16,5% y una disminuci\u00f3n de la tarifa del 12,7%.\n\nM\u00e9xico: Culiac\u00e1n, con un crecimiento del 48,7% en las b\u00fasquedas y una disminuci\u00f3n del -0,95%\n\nPer\u00fa: Piura, con un crecimiento de 84,1% y variaci\u00f3n del precio de -1,4%\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 estos lugares se est\u00e1n imponiendo? Viajala explica que factores como la apertura de rutas a\u00e9reas, el ingreso de aerol\u00edneas de bajo costo o el desarrollo tur\u00edstico de un lugar fueron clave para que las ciudades poco tradicionales lideraran el ranking. \u201cLa disminuci\u00f3n de tarifas traduce que el destino se est\u00e1 volviendo m\u00e1s atractivo y por lo tanto hay m\u00e1s competencias en las rutas: m\u00e1s oferta significa tambi\u00e9n precios m\u00e1s bajos\u201d, explic\u00f3 a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Thomas Allier.\n\nEl hecho de identificar las tendencias en cada pa\u00eds tambi\u00e9n habla de las din\u00e1micas propias de su turismo. Seg\u00fan Allier, M\u00e9xico es el pa\u00eds \u201cque m\u00e1s turismo receptivo tiene\u201d, mientras Brasil se destaca por contar con el mayor mercado interno de pasajeros. Pero, Colombia es el que est\u00e1 creciendo m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido\u201d. En ese sentido, el informe que se repetir\u00e1 cada a\u00f1o pretende \u201cadvertir c\u00f3mo se van modificando las preferencias de cada pa\u00eds y c\u00f3mo la coyuntura de la industria impacta en las decisiones que se toman a la hora de viajar\u201d.\n\nAhora, cuando se trata de destinos internacionales, la tendencia latinoamericana fue un poco m\u00e1s tradicional y apunt\u00f3 en su mayor\u00eda a las capitales, con un predominio a otros lugares de la regi\u00f3n. \u00bfQu\u00e9 destinos internacionales lideraron en cada pa\u00eds?\n\nArgentina: Londres (Gran Breta\u00f1a), con un aumento del 260% en b\u00fasquedas y un incremento de precios del 29,3%\n\nBrasil: Lisboa (Portugal), con un crecimiento del 436% en b\u00fasquedas y un aumento en la tarifa del 4,7%.\n\nColombia: Canc\u00fan (M\u00e9xico), con un aumento del 77,7% de las b\u00fasquedas y una variaci\u00f3n en el precio de -5%.\n\nChile: Cuzco (Per\u00fa), con un aumento del 138,6% y una disminuci\u00f3n de la tarifa del 6,9%.\n\nM\u00e9xico: La Habana (Cuba), con un crecimiento del 130,7% en las b\u00fasquedas y una disminuci\u00f3n del -1,6%\n\nPer\u00fa: Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia), con un crecimiento de 195,6% y variaci\u00f3n del precio de -11,3%\n\nSin embargo, las b\u00fasquedas no significan necesariamente que los latinoamericanos est\u00e9n viajando m\u00e1s, aunque s\u00ed demuestran que hay al menos una planificaci\u00f3n a la hora de hacerlo. Aunque el crecimiento del metabuscador Viajala ha sido importante, seg\u00fan Allier, las coyunturas en cada pa\u00eds afectan el turismo de sus ciudadanos. Por ejemplo, la huelga de los pilotos de Avianca en Colombia afect\u00f3 la industria porque disminuy\u00f3 la oferta, indic\u00f3 Allier, mientras que Argentina y Brasil han sido \"s\u00faper afectados por la devaluaci\u00f3n de sus monedas y eso disminuye el poder de compra que tienen y hace que tambi\u00e9n viajen menos\". Pero considera que la perspectiva para 2019 es alentadora.\n\nConsejos para conseguir los viajes m\u00e1s baratos\n\nAllier comparti\u00f3 tres consejos para que las personas puedan ahorrar durante sus viajes y todos se centran en la planeaci\u00f3n. El primero, que dijo \u00e9l \u201cno aplica en este momento\u201d es viajar en febrero y en septiembre cuando los precios de los boletos tienden a disminuir y se puede ahorrar hasta un 25%. El siguiente dato es viajar de martes a martes porque la mayor\u00eda de las personas \u2014y con ellas la demanda\u2014 suele ser los viernes, fines de semana y lunes. Y lo \u00faltimo es anticiparse, pues los boletos a\u00e9reos m\u00e1s econ\u00f3micos se consiguen hasta con tres meses de adelanto, despu\u00e9s empiezan a encarecerse.", "(CNN) Matthew Whitaker, the acting US attorney general, was on the advisory board of a Florida company that was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission and served with a $26 million judgment earlier this year for what court documents called \"a scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe company, World Patent Marketing, promised to help inventors get patents.\n\nWhitaker was named as an advisory board member in October 2014 and Federal Election Commission filings showed the company's owner donated $2,600 to Whitaker's campaign when he was running for the US Senate. A payment record also shows Whitaker was paid at least $9,375 by the company from October 2014 to February 2016, and was due to be paid an additional $7,500 in 2016 and 2017, but it is unclear whether he received that money.\n\nAccording to a World Patent Marketing press release announcing Whitaker's position on the board, Whitaker was quoted as saying, \"World Patent Marketing has become a trusted partner to many inventors that believe in the American Dream,\" and \"I have always admired World Patent Marketing and its innovative products and dynamic leadership team.\"\n\nIn May, the company agreed to a settlement with the FTC amid allegations that World Patent Marketing used unfair tactics, including threats of legal action, when customers complained about the company or its services. The court banned the company from the invention promotion business; in addition, the judge ordered the $26 million judgment to be partially suspended as long as the company's owner Scott Cooper paid about $975,000.

Al igual que en conferencias anteriores, mostr\u00f3 desprecio por los reporteros un minuto, quej\u00e1ndose de que sus interlocutores \"saltaban de sus asientos grit\u00e1ndome preguntas\", y luego sugiri\u00f3 que estaba disfrutando la discusi\u00f3n.\n\n\"\u00bfMantenemos esto por un rato?\" pregunt\u00f3, una hora despu\u00e9s de comenzada la sesi\u00f3n, lo que llev\u00f3 a algunos reporteros a decir \"\u00a1s\u00ed!\".\n\nCuando el reportero de un medio japon\u00e9s hizo una pregunta, Trump dijo: \"env\u00edale saludos a Shinzo\", refiri\u00e9ndose al primer ministro de Jap\u00f3n, Shinzo Abe.\n\nLa conferencia de prensa puso en evidencia los diferentes estilos de los diferentes corresponsales de la Casa Blanca. Algunos, como April Ryan, intentaron hacer preguntas sin que se les pidiera expl\u00edcitamente.\n\n\"Si\u00e9ntate, por favor\", le dijo Trump a ella. \"Si\u00e9ntate. No te llam\u00e9, no te llam\u00e9, no te llam\u00e9\".\n\nRyan estaba tratando de preguntar acerca de las preocupaciones de supresi\u00f3n de votantes. En respuesta, Trump dijo falsamente que las encuestas de CNN eran una forma de supresi\u00f3n.\n\nCon frecuencia, Trump condena las llamadas \"encuestas de supresi\u00f3n\", aludiendo a una teor\u00eda de la conspiraci\u00f3n que afirma que los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n distorsionan los resultados de las encuestas para desalentar a la gente que vota. Volvi\u00f3 a plantear la idea m\u00e1s tarde en la conferencia de prensa, a pesar de la falta de pruebas.\n\nTrump le dio la palabra a Acosta al principio de la rueda de prensa. Acosta se ha vuelto popular y tambi\u00e9n criticado por sus preguntas inquisitivas sobre la Casa Blanca de Trump.\n\n\"Gracias, se\u00f1or presidente\", dijo Acosta cuando Trump lo llam\u00f3. \"Quiero cuestionar una de las declaraciones que hizo al final de la campa\u00f1a\".\n\nTrump se apoy\u00f3 en el micr\u00f3fono: \"Aqu\u00ed vamos\".\n\nAcosta mencion\u00f3 a los migrantes que viajan desde Am\u00e9rica Central hacia la frontera sur de EE.UU., y el anuncio racista de la campa\u00f1a Trump, transmitido la semana pasada y que se refiere a ellos.\n\n\"Como sabe, se\u00f1or presidente, la caravana no es una invasi\u00f3n\", dijo Acosta. \"Es un grupo de migrantes que se desplazan desde Centroam\u00e9rica hacia la frontera con Estados Unidos\u2013\"\n\nTrump, sarc\u00e1sticamente, respondi\u00f3: \"Gracias por decirme eso, lo aprecio\".\n\nAcosta: \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la caracteriz\u00f3 como tal?\"\n\n\"Porque la considero una invasi\u00f3n. T\u00fa y yo tenemos una diferencia de opini\u00f3n\", dijo Trump.\n\n\"\u00bfPero cree haber demonizado a los inmigrantes?\", le pregunto Acosta.\n\n\"No, en absoluto. Quiero que venganal pa\u00eds. Pero tienen que venir legalmente\".\n\nEso es lo que los inmigrantes intentan hacer: dicen que tienen la intenci\u00f3n de pedir asilo.\n\nAcosta se\u00f1al\u00f3 el anuncio enga\u00f1oso y dijo: \"Sin embargo, est\u00e1n a cientos de miles de kil\u00f3metros de distancia. Est\u00e1n a cientos y cientos de kil\u00f3metros de distancia. Eso no es una invasi\u00f3n\".\n\n\"\u00bfSabes qu\u00e9? Creo que deber\u00edas\", comenz\u00f3 a decir Trump, se\u00f1alando a Acosta. \"Honestamente, creo que deber\u00edas dejarme dirigir el pa\u00eds. T\u00fa diriges CNN. Y si lo hicieras bien, tu audiencia ser\u00eda mucho mayor\".\n\n\"Est\u00e1 bien, es suficiente\", dijo Trump mientras Acosta trataba de hacer otra pregunta.\n\nUna empleada de la Casa Blanca se apresur\u00f3 a tomar el micr\u00f3fono y llevarlo al siguiente reportero que eligi\u00f3 Trump, Peter Alexander de NBC.\n\n\"Si pudiera hacer otra pregunta, \u00bfest\u00e1 preocupado\u2013?\"\n\nAcosta intent\u00f3 se\u00f1alar que otros reporteros tambi\u00e9n hab\u00edan hecho m\u00faltiples preguntas.\n\n\"Es suficiente\", dijo Trump.\n\nLa empleada de la Casa Blanca trat\u00f3 de agarrar el micr\u00f3fono de Acosta, pero \u00e9l se aferr\u00f3.\n\n\"Perd\u00f3neme, se\u00f1ora\", dijo, mientras miraba hacia Trump, luego sali\u00f3 del encuadre de la c\u00e1mara.\n\n\"Peter, vamos\", dijo Trump, tratando de hacer que Alexander comenzara.\n\n\"Si puedo preguntar, en la investigaci\u00f3n sobre Rusia\", dijo Acosta, \"\u00bfle preocupa que pueda enfrentar cargos...?\".\n\n\"No me preocupa nada de la investigaci\u00f3n rusa porque es un fraude\", dijo Trump, \"Es suficiente, baja el micr\u00f3fono\".\n\nTrump se alej\u00f3 del podio por un momento, indicando que hab\u00eda terminado, mientras que Acosta volvi\u00f3 a hacer la pregunta y luego solt\u00f3 el micr\u00f3fono.\n\nMientras Alexander comenz\u00f3 a formular su pregunta, Trump dijo: \"Te digo una cosa, CNN deber\u00eda sentirse avergonzada de tenerte trabajando para ellos\". Se\u00f1al\u00f3 a Acosta. \"Eres una persona grosera y terrible. No deber\u00edas trabajar para CNN\".\n\nLuego se volvi\u00f3 hacia Alexander: \"Adelante\". Pero regres\u00f3 con Acosta: \"Eres una persona muy grosera, la forma en la que tratas a Sarah Huckabee Sanders es horrible. La forma en que tratas a otras personas es horrible. No deber\u00edas tratar a la gente de esa manera\".\n\n\"Adelante\", le dijo Trump a Alexander, quien habl\u00f3 en defensa de Acosta: \"Viaj\u00e9 con \u00e9l y lo he observado, es un reportero diligente que trabaja muy duro como el resto de nosotros\".\n\n\"Bueno, tampoco soy un gran fan tuyo, para ser honesto\", dijo Trump, provocando risas en la habitaci\u00f3n. El presidente suele despreciar a NBC casi tan a menudo como a CNN.\n\n\"Entonces d\u00e9jeme hacerle una pregunta\", dijo Alexander, sin perder un segundo.\n\nAcosta se levant\u00f3 y habl\u00f3. Sus comentarios no fueron totalmente audibles en la televisi\u00f3n en vivo, pero se pudo escuchar a Acosta preguntando acerca de los peligros de los ataques de Trump contra los medios, como el uso del t\u00e9rmino \"enemigo del pueblo\".\n\n\"Cuando reportas noticias falsas, que es lo que hace CNN, muchas veces, eres el enemigo del pueblo\", dijo Trump, volvi\u00e9ndose hacia Alexander.\n\nLa rueda de prensa dur\u00f3 1 hora y 26 minutos.\n\nEn las redes sociales, varias personas agradecieron a Acosta por tratar de pedirle cuentas al presidente por sus palabras y hechos.\n\nPero otros condenaron al corresponsal. Algunos partidarios de Trump dijeron que sus credenciales deber\u00edan ser revocadas.", "(CNN) Two Committee to Protect Journalists staffers have been released from detention in Tanzania and have left the country, the organization announced Thursday.\n\nAngela Quintal and Muthoki Mumo were permitted to return to their hotel in Dar es Salaam after being taken to an unknown location and subjected to \"several hours of questioning,\" according to a news release.

We think it's going fine.\"\n\nTrump had been asked about the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as Tuesday's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Thursday meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\n\"We're very happy with how it's going with North Korea. We think it's going fine. We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nSouth Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told lawmakers in Seoul Tuesday that she was told the North Koreans asked the US to postpone the talks, citing their busy schedules. A senior US official told CNN the North Korean delegation called Tuesday to postpone the meeting, but did not offer a clear explanation.\n\nAnother source familiar with the US-North Korea talks and familiar with North Korean thinking said Pyongyang canceled because it came to the conclusion that it wasn't going to get anywhere with working level talks -- either through the Washington's special representative for North Korea, Stephen E. Biegun, or through Pompeo himself.\n\n'A standoff'\n\nUS military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments say the two sides are locked in a standoff over who will make concessions first, that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\n\"It doesn't bode well for the negotiations, which were already not proceeding well,\" said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\nA former CIA deputy division chief for Korea, Klingner pointed to North Korea's recent threat to restart \"building up nuclear forces\" if the US didn't ease sanctions, the fact that Pyongyang has yet to meet Pompeo's Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, and that the two countries still haven't agreed on the definition of basic terms such as \"denuclearlization\" -- five months after Trump's historic summit with Kim.\n\n\"Clearly the two sides remain very far apart,\" Klingner said.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang said that North Korea is \"getting really angry\" over the lack of any offer of sanctions relief from the US and that their stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nNorth Korea's state media outlet KCNA said November 2: \"We gave all things possible to the US, things it hardly deserves, by taking proactive and good-will measures, what remains to be done is the US corresponding reply. Unless there is any reply, the DPRK will not move even 1 mm, how costly it may be.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED US cancels military exercise with South Korea Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US cancels military exercise with South Korea 01:34\n\nThe US has suspended and canceled military exercises with South Korea in the interests of diplomacy. And Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford hinted Monday that if there's progress in US-North Korea talks, it could lead to a potential change in the US military presence on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 troops are currently stationed -- a long-held goal for Pyongyang.\n\n\"Frankly the more successful we are on the diplomatic track the more uncomfortable we'll be in the military space,\" Dunford said at an event at Duke University, \"because over time, this negotiation will take a form where we're going to have to start making some changes to the military posture on the peninsula and we're prepared to do that in support of Secretary Pompeo.\"\n\nCNN military and diplomatic analyst John Kirby noted that Dunford \"tried to reflect the basic fact that US military force posture on the peninsula is both a cause of the tension and a result. It is necessary because it's necessary, not just because it's always been there.\"\n\n\"As such, the military plays a key role in the diplomatic process, as bulwark and as bargaining chip,\" Kirby noted. \"Had Dunford not admitted some sort of change in force posture might ensue from successful talks, he might have condemned those very talks to failure.\"\n\n'Largely cosmetic'\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece ... we haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nThe official added that one of the concerns right now is that making sure the rest of the world, and particularly South Korea, maintain full pressure on Pyongyang. \"I think it is a concern that South Korea gets ahead of that,\" the official said.\n\nIt's a problem, not just because Trump's summit with Kim opened the door for other world leaders to meet with the North Koreans, eroding Pyongyang's diplomatic isolation, but South Korea, along with China and Russia, have been pushing for the US to ease sanctions on the DPRK.\n\nIn the meantime, Pyongyang's threats over the weekend to restart its nuclear program have also increased tensions, according to the sources familiar with the exchanges between the US and North Korea. They also say that personal friction between negotiators has been a problem.\n\nThe US side sees the North Korean general charged with leading negotiations, Kim Yong Chol, as \"difficult and old-fashioned\" in negotiations and would prefer\u200e to work with someone else.\n\nA US defense official told CNN that part of the problem is that in the US view, Kim Yong Chol remains a hardliner and may be increasingly difficult for the US to deal with.\n\n'Early next year'\n\nOn Wednesday, State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino claimed that the canceled meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol was simply a \"scheduling issue.\"\n\n\"This is purely a matter of scheduling,\" Palladino said repeatedly when asked about the delay at the press briefing Wednesday. \"Schedules change,\" he said. \"Schedules change all of the time, in fact.\"\n\nPressed by reporters whether talks with Pyongyang had reached an impasse over differing demands from both Washington and Pyongyang, Palladino said the talks were in \"a pretty good place\" and scheduling of meetings would not be driven by \"artificial timelines,\" and the two sides \"will continue to make progress.\"\n\nThe deputy spokesman said the State Department was confident that inspectors would be allowed to examine North Korea's nuclear facilities.\n\nTwo other senior US defense officials say Washington's assessment remains that Kim is still aiming for denuclearization, but some of the slow roll is due to his need to bring his own \"elites\" into line.\n\nThese officials say this has continued to be an issue for the North Korean leader, which may account for Trump's public patience. The officials also say North Korea is likely to make some initial denuclearization declarations that won't be accurate or truthful, but the US thinks it can work around that.\n\nTrump also said he would meet with Kim \"sometime next year, sometime early next year\" and said Pompeo's trip schedule had changed because \"of trips that are being made. We're going to make it on another date.\" Neither the National Security Council nor the State Department was able to offer an explanation for the other trips Trump referred to.", "La jueza dispuso la suspensi\u00f3n del proceso hasta que el expresidente Correa sea detenido o se entregue voluntariamente\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El expresidente de Ecuador Rafael Correa fue llamado a juicio por la justicia de su pa\u00eds este mi\u00e9rcoles como supuesto autor de secuestro.\n\nDurante la audiencia preparatoria de juicio que dur\u00f3 tres horas en la Corte Nacional de Justicia la jueza penal Daniela Camacho acogi\u00f3 el pedido de la Fiscal\u00eda y dict\u00f3 auto de llamamiento a juicio en contra de Correa y tres procesados m\u00e1s en calidad de autores del delito de secuestro al activista pol\u00edtico y opositor Fernando Balda.

Follow him on Twitter @eliehonig. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Given President Donald Trump's prolonged campaign to degrade Attorney General Jeff Sessions as \"weak,\" \"beleaguered\" and \"scared stiff and Missing in Action,\" it seemed inevitable that Trump would fire Sessions shortly after midterms. Few expected, however, that Trump would drop the ax on Sessions before the voting machines even had a chance to cool. Trump's Wednesday Afternoon Massacre poses a serious, even existential, threat to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation.\n\nNow that Trump has dismissed Sessions, two big questions emerge: Who takes over supervision of Mueller's investigation, and what relevance could the President's dismissal of Sessions have on potential obstruction of justice charges?\n\nFirst, how does the dismissal of Sessions impact Mueller? Under the special counsel regulations, Muelle r ordinarily would report to the attorney general. However, Sessions recused himself from the investigation -- a move Trump later called \"very unfair to the President\" -- leaving Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge. Now, however, Trump has named Matthew Whitaker, Sessions' former chief of staff, as acting attorney general.\n\nIt appears that Whitaker will supplant Rosenstein as Mueller's direct supervisor on the Russia investigation. If you need a glimpse into Whitaker's likely view of Mueller's work, look no further than an opinion piece that Whitaker himself authored for CNN in August 2017, titled \"Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far.\"\n\nIn fairness to Whitaker, his article is more than a year old, and he wrote it before the convictions of high-level campaign and White House officials including Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and others, and before the indictment of Russian intelligence officials for hacking Hillary Clinton's campaign and other Democratic entities. It is possible, though not particularly likely, that Mueller's string of successes has changed Whitaker's mind about the legitimacy of the special counsel's work.\n\nExactly how much control will Whitaker have over Mueller? The short answer is -- a lot. The special counsel regulations empower the attorney general to request an explanation \"for any investigative or prosecutorial step\" and to veto any such proposed step if he \"conclude[s] that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.\" Translation: the attorney general can stop Mueller from pursuing essentially anything -- any subpoena, indictment, guilty plea -- if he decides it's not the right way to go.\n\nThere has been no public indication that Rosenstein has hindered or limited Mueller's work thus far in any significant manner. In fact, given the string of charges and convictions obtained by Mueller against high-profile targets, it seems that he and Rosenstein largely have been on the same page. Now, with Whitaker in charge, that could change dramatically.\n\nUnder the special counsel regulations, Mueller also must provide the attorney general with \"a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.\" The attorney general, in turn, can decide whether and to what extent to provide the special counsel's findings to Congress and to the public.\n\nOn the one hand, Whitaker's ascendance makes it less likely that Congress or the public will ever see a summary written report from Mueller. On the other hand, now that the Democrats have re-taken control of the House of Representatives, they are in position to bring pressure -- and perhaps compulsory process through subpoenas -- to ensure that Mueller's report sees the light of day.\n\nMueller very likely has been expecting Sessions or Rosenstein, or both, to be replaced atop the Department of Justice. In anticipation of such a move, and to protect his own work thus far, Mueller already may have obtained sealed indictments against high-profile or sensitive targets. For example, If Mueller has gathered sufficient evidence to charge Roger Stone with criminally conspiring with Russian hackers through Wikileaks, then Mueller rightly might be concerned about whether a new boss would refuse to authorize those politically sensitive charges.\n\nAnticipating this, Mueller may already have presented evidence to a grand jury in secret (grand juries always operate in secret); obtained a grand jury vote to indict; and then filed the signed indictments with a court, \"under seal\" -- meaning outside the public view. If worse comes to worse, and Mueller feels that his work is being threatened or stifled, Mueller (or a successor if he is fired) could go to the court seeking to unseal those indictments, which already are technically on the books.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe final question is whether and how Trump's dismissal of Sessions plays into the ongoing investigation by Mueller of potential obstruction of justice. Much to Trump's dismay, Mueller has been investigating Trump for obstruction for months now, likely focusing on Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, Trump's efforts to pressure Sessions to reverse his own recusal and Trump's efforts to fire Mueller himself.\n\nWednesday's firing of Sessions, and his replacement by a successor who is openly hostile to Mueller's work, adds a new chapter and potentially more evidence to Mueller's case against Trump for obstruction. The paradox, of course, is that if Mueller is no longer around, or if his work is limited or suppressed by Whitaker, then those charges may never see daylight.\n\nWhile Sessions' departure has long been expected, the aftershocks threaten to destabilize and derail Mueller and his ongoing work. While Mueller has worked hard thus far to keep his investigation grounded solely on the facts and the law, political forces have begun to intervene in a potentially explosive manner.", "Story highlights Whitaker was campaign chairman for Sam Clovis, a Mueller probe witness\n\nWhitaker and Clovis are both rooted in Iowa politics\n\nWashingto (CNN) New Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, whose appointment means he will supervise special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, has a personal tie to one of the witnesses in the probe: Whitaker was the campaign chairman for Sam Clovis in 2014 when Clovis ran for state treasurer in Iowa.\n\nClovis, the 2016 Trump campaign national co-chairman, said in a May radio interview that he has been interviewed by the special counsel's team and had testified before the Mueller grand jury.\n\nClovis was also listed an unnamed \"campaign supervisor\" in the indictment of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, according to The Washington Post.\n\nBoth Whitaker and Clovis are rooted in Iowa politics, and both ran for the 2014 Republican Senate nomination. A 2014 press release announcing Whitaker's hiring said the pair became \"great friends\" during Clovis' US Senate bid that preceded his run for state treasurer.\n\nIt was Clovis, no stranger to TV and radio himself, who encouraged Whitaker to get a regular commentary gig on cable television to get President Donald Trump's attention, according to friends who Whitaker told at the time. Whitaker was hired as a CNN legal commentator last year for several months, before leaving the role in September 2017 to head to the Justice Department as chief of staff to now-former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Voters in three deep-red states went around their elected representatives to approve Medicaid expansion at the ballot box Tuesday.\n\nIdaho , Nebraska and Utah residents all supported measures that extend Medicaid to residents with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line.\n\nThe grassroots efforts will provide coverage to hundreds of thousands of people and could take effect as early as the spring.\n\nDemocratic victories in several gubernatorial races also raise the likelihood of Medicaid expansion in additional states.\n\nMaine's newly elected Democratic governor Janet Mills is expected to push through Medicaid expansion that was approved last year by voters in a first-of-its-kind ballot measure that was blocked by outgoing Republican Gov. Paul LePage. Mills will have the support of both state houses since Democrats also won control of Maine's Senate.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) On Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump took a victory lap via an almost-90-minute news conference that came fewer than 24 hours after his party lost control of the House but strengthened its Senate majority.\n\nTrump seemed entirely unconcerned with his party's loss of one of the chambers of Congress -- instead he focused on reading out the names of Republican House members who refused to embrace him (and lost) and sparring with reporters. I went through the transcript of the whole thing and pulled out the best lines. They're below.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. \"It was a big day yesterday. Incredible day.\"\n\n2. \"The media coverage set a new record and a new standard.\"\n\nHe doesn't mean this as a compliment. Also, a new record for what? Negativity? How is that even quantifiable?\n\n3. \"This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave they talked about.\"\n\nDemocrats won control of the House. And are likely to gain more than 30 seats . I don't know how we define a \"wave,\" but I tend to think a 30+ seat gain that flips control of the House would meet most people's criteria.\n\n4. \"This election marks the largest Senate gains for a president's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962.\"\n\nCorrect! Democrats gained three seats in Kennedy's first midterm election, the same number Trump looks on track to have gained . Republicans gained two Senate seats in 1970 in Richard Nixon's first midterm and one seat in George W. Bush's 2002 midterm.\n\n5. \"We also had a slew of historic wins in the governors' races -- the governors' races were incredible -- against very well-funded, talented and skilled Democrat candidates, and people that worked very, very hard -- respectfully -- for those candidates, like Oprah Winfrey, who I like.\"\n\nThat sentence took a turn at the end there, no? Why did Trump mention Oprah? Because she campaigned with Stacey Abrams in Georgia?\n\n6. \"By expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings -- that was a factor, I think maybe a very big factor, the way that was handled.\"\n\nIt might have been a factor but, at least according to the exit polls , not in the way Trump is suggesting. Forty three percent of people said they supported Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court while 47% opposed it. Now, among those who supported the Kavanaugh confirmation, 87% voted for Republicans for the House. So, Trump could be right that Kavanaugh fired up the GOP base. But he's not right to say that voters \"clearly rebuked\" Senate Democrats for voting against Kavanaugh. ( All except Joe Manchin, of course .)\n\n7. \"You had some that decided to, 'Let's stay away. Let's stay away.' They did very poorly. I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it.\"\n\nThus begins the throw-Republican-members-who-refused-to-embrace-Trump-under-the-bus portion of the President's remarks.\n\n8. \"But Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"\n\n[narrator voice] He's not sorry at all.\n\n9. \"I think she could have won that race, but she didn't want to have any embrace.\"\n\nTrump is talking about soon-to-be former Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) here. And, no, Comstock would not have won by welcoming the \"embrace\" of Trump. She would have almost certainly lost by more\n\n10. \"Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace. Erik Paulsen didn't want the embrace.\"\n\n\"The embrace.\" It's a thing.\n\n11. \"We've had tremendous support, and tremendous support in the Republican Party, among the biggest support in the history of the party. I've actually heard at 93%, it's a record, but I won't say that, because who knows?\"\n\nThis is the essence of Trump's verbal gymnastics. He floats the idea, then he affirms the idea, then he says that other people say it but he doesn't really know. What a world.\n\n12. \"Hopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs.\"\n\nTrump here offers a least a rhetorical olive branch to Democrats. And he's right that on infrastructure and lowering prescription drug costs, he and Democrats could well find common purpose.\n\n13. \"You know, I keep hearing about investigations, fatigue, like from the time -- almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they've been giving us this investigation fatigue. Been a long time, they've got nothing, zero. You know why? Cause there is nothing.\"\n\nWait, who is the \"they\" here? Democrats? If Trump is talking about the Russia investigation, that runs through his Justice Department. And the probe is being run by Robert Mueller, a Republican. So....\n\n14. \"But they can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate, and a lot of very questionable things were done, between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place.\"\n\nYes, this is a threat, aimed at Democrats if they step up their oversight role of Trump's White House after winning the House. Straight out.\n\n15. \"So we can look at us, they can look at us, then we can look at them and it'll go back and forth. And it'll probably be very good for me politically. I could see it being extremely good politically, because I think I'm better at that game than they are actually.\"\n\nHe said the quiet part out loud.\n\n16.\"You can't do them simultaneously, by the way. Just think, if somebody said 'Oh, you can do them,' no you can't. Cause if they're doing that, we're not doing the other, just so you understand.\"\n\nI really and truly don't understand.\n\n17. \"We want crystal clean water, we want beautiful perfect air. Air and water has to be perfect.\"\n\nPerfect air is the best air. Many people are saying that.\n\n18. \"So environmental is very important to me.\"\n\nEnvironmental. So important.\n\n19. \"I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary. A wall is necessary.\"\n\nI have a VERY hard time believing that Democrats tell Trump that the southern border wall is necessary.\n\n20. \"We're building the wall. We've started.\"\n\nTuesday night ends the wall-building until at least after the 2020 election. There is a 0% chance House Democrats will back significant federal spending on a border wall.\n\n21. \"I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time.\"\n\nThis was Trump's answer on whether he would fire Jeff Sessions as attorney general. News emerged later that day that Sessions was fired -- by chief of staff John Kelly -- something Trump likely knew as he was speaking to media.\n\n22. \"As I've told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them.\"\n\nTo sum up, these are Trump's reasons for not releasing his tax returns: a) they're under audit and b) they are too complex for any normal person to understand. On the first reason, nothing bars someone from releasing tax returns under audit. On the second, maybe he should trust the American public's intelligence a little more?\n\n23. \"They're done by -- among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms, the accountants are a very, very large, powerful firm from the standpoint of respect.\"\n\nTo which I ask: Why is it germane to the question of whether or not the President will release his tax returns that they are handled by \"a very, very large, powerful firm\"?\n\n24. \"But it's big, and it's complex and it's probably feet-high. It's a very complex instrument. And I think that people wouldn't understand it.\"\n\nSo, Donald Trump is saying his taxes are a very complicated, feet-high instrument. Also, big. Okey dokey!\n\n25. \"Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit.\"\n\nExcept that Richard Nixon did exactly that in 1973.\n\n26. \"And I think I know more -- and I think I know more than they know.\"\n\nWhat's Trump talking about here? Does it really even matter?\n\n27. \"I'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation because it's a hoax.\"\n\n28. \"You're a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible and the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.\"\n\n29.\" You aren't -- you aren't the best.\"\n\nJust the President of the United States telling NBC White House reporter Peter Alexander he's not great. Totally normal stuff!\n\n30. \"When you report fake news -- which CNN does a lot -- you are the enemy of the people.\"\n\nALWAYS remember this: When Trump says \"fake news,\" you should hear it as, \"news that isn't good for me.\" Which, of course, doesn't make it fake\n\n31. \"We won a lot of elections last night, we did very well last night, and I think it's going to have a very positive impact.\"\n\nThis is Trump's response to a question about whether he was dividing the country with his rhetoric. And yes, his answer makes no sense. Unless you consider that, to him, winning is everything -- and justifies all things.\n\n32. \"This is a investigation where many, many millions of dollars has been spent, and there's no collusion. It was supposed to be on collusion. There's no collusion. And I think it's -- I think it's very bad for our country, I will tell you. I think it's a shame.\"\n\nHours after giving this answer, Trump fired Sessions and named Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general . Whitaker, who has been openly critical of Mueller's investigation in the past, is now expected to oversee the probe. Which all makes perfect sense.\n\n33. \"Sit down. I didn't call you. I didn't call you. I didn't call you.\"\n\nIn which the President of the United States tells American Urban Radio Networks' April Ryan to sit down. (Ryan is also a CNN contributor.)\n\n34. \"I don't understand what you're saying. What?\"\n\nThat's Donald Trump telling Nadia Bilbassy-Charters , the Washington correspondent for Al Arabiya TV, that he can't understand what she is saying.\n\n35. \"Well, I think the results that I've learned -- and maybe confirm -- I think people like me. I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly.\"\n\nDemocrats won control of the House.\n\n36. \"I could fire everybody right now.\"\n\nDonald Trump on the Russia investigation -- just hours before he informed the world, via tweet, that he had fired the attorney general. Not ominous at all!\n\n37. \"I stay away from it. But you know what I do? I let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money, but I let it go on, because I don't want to do that. But you're right; I could end it right now. I could say, 'That investigation is over.'\"\n\nHe really couldn't. But like I said, not at all ominous!\n\n38. \"It's -- it's really -- it's a disgrace, frankly. And it's an embarrassment to our country. It's an embarrassment to the people of our country. And it's too bad.\"\n\nTo be clear: Donald Trump is talking about a special counsel probe being run out of the Justice Department that is trying to get to the bottom of an active measures campaign by Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.\n\n39. \"Just going to push. I've been pushing. I've done a very good job, too. They're very happy with me.\"\n\nThis is Trump's answer on how he plans to make good on his pledge as a candidate to be a anti-abortion president. Yes, really.\n\n40. \"And we have been working very hard on China and Russia and everybody else looking into our elections or meddling with our elections.\"\n\nThis directly contradicts Trump's repeated undermining of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Directly.\n\n41. \"I actually had a very good meeting in Russia that you people didn't agree with, but that's OK, it doesn't much matter obviously\"\n\nIn that meeting, Trump said that both America and Russia were to blame for any alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. In doing so, he sided with Russian president Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence community\n\n42. \"That was President Obama's regime. That was during President Obama, right? That -- that was not during me.\"\n\nTrump seems here to not be willing to acknowledge that Putin annexed Crimea, not Obama. Yes, it happened while Obama was president. But that's about the extent of the role Obama played in all of it.\n\n43. \"To be honest -- I'll be honest, I thought it was a -- I thought it was a very close to complete victory.\"\n\nDemocrats won control of the House.\n\n44. \"But if you look at it from the standpoint of gridlock, I really believe there's going to be much less gridlock because of the way this is going, than any other way\"\n\n[nods head slowly but steadily]\n\n45. \"I'm surprised at a lot of people. They start off, they're young people, they're there for two years, and they're old by the time they leave.\"\n\nTruer words have never been uttered.\n\n46. \"I mean, we have many people lined up for every single position. Any position -- everybody wants to work in this White House.\"\n\nThis is not true. The White House struggled for months to fill the communications director job because no one at that level within the GOP wanted the job. Trump eventually hired former Fox News executive Bill Shine for the position.\n\n47. \" I would love to see unity and peace and love and any other word you want to use.\"\n\n\"What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?\" -- Elvis Costello\n\n48. \"Nothing surprises me in politics.\"\n\nSame.\n\n49. \"I'd be very good at a low tone.\"\n\nYup. Low tone. The best.\n\n50- 51. \"I would love to do very -- very even-toned.\"\n\n\"I would love to have a very even, modest, boring tone. I would be very honored by that.\"\n\nAn amazing couplet. Shakespearean, almost.\n\n52. \"I -- I don't -- I really don't understand you.\"\n\nThe President of the United States to a Japanese reporter.\n\n53. \"I think I am a great moral leader and I love our country.\"\n\nAnd humble, to boot!\n\n54. \"Now, what's bad for them is being in the majority, I'm just going to blame them. You understand, I'm going to blame them. They're the majority. Honestly, it makes it much simpler for me.\"\n\nHe said the quiet part out loud. Again.\n\n55. \"I -- look, now that the election's over, the election's over. Now everybody is in love.\"\n\nNo words.\n\n56. \"You know what, when you get bored, would you please tell me? Seriously. Tell me.\"\n\nThis is a deep insight into Trump. He wants to make sure he is still entertaining reporters. Because being boring is death to him. And because he loves to spar with reporters.\n\n57. \"That's such a racist question.\"\n\nThe President's response to this question, from PBS' Yamiche Alcindor, who is African-American : \"On the campaign trail you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists. Now people are also saying....\"\n\n58. \"Why do I have among the highest poll numbers with African-Americans?\"\n\n59. \"In Jeff Flake's case, it's me, pure and simple. I retired him. I'm very proud of it. I did the country a great service.\"\n\nThat's a Republican senator Donald Trump is talking about.\n\n60. \"I don't know who Lil Jon is. I don't -- I really don't.\"\n\n61. \"No, I don't, no. Do I regret it?\"\n\n62. \"They said they couldn't be beaten. They said Heidi could not be beat. 'Please don't do it,' they couldn't -- this was a year out.\"\n\nNo one -- and I mean no one -- though a Democratic senator in North Dakota couldn't be beaten. Heitkamp was one of the most vulnerable senators from the first day of the 2018 election.\n\n63. \"And I'll tell you something. When you look at the races that we won in Florida, which we weren't expected to win, and Georgia, which we weren't expected to win, and Ohio, which we weren't expected to win, and won -- I mean, you look at some of them, the number of votes that we got is incredible.\"\n\nThe question Trump was asked here was: \"So what do you say to women, Mr. President?\"\n\n64. \"So I do fight back.\"\n\nThis feels like a good place to end it.", "Washington (CNN) Washington is swirling with speculation about who President Donald Trump will choose to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions after the President ousted his first attorney general Wednesday afternoon.\n\nGOP Senate control will likely smooth the path for Trump to replace Sessions with a preferred name, and CNN reported ahead of the midterm elections that several prominent conservative legal figures were in contention to follow an expected Sessions removal.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump said Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, would be the acting attorney general, with a nominee to come \"at a later date.\"\n\nThe following names have cropped up as potential Justice Department leaders: Whitaker, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas, former Judge John Michael Luttig, Judge Edith Jones, former Judge Janice Rogers Brown, outgoing GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nMatthew Whitaker\n\nNamed by Trump on Wednesday as the acting head of the Justice Department, Whitaker was previously Sessions' chief of staff. A CNN report in September, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's fate was openly uncertain, said Justice Department officials had prepared for Whitaker to take over for Rosenstein as the Justice Department's number two.\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that Whitaker spoke with Trump at the time about replacing Rosenstein and that Whitaker told people his understanding was that he could become the next deputy attorney general.\n\nWhitaker is a former CNN legal commentator and former US attorney who directed the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014. In a CNN op-ed written last year, Whitaker argued that special counsel Robert Mueller was \"dangerously close to crossing\" a red line following reports that Mueller was looking into Trump's finances as part of his investigation.\n\nNoel Francisco\n\nAt the same time Whitaker was considered as a replacement for Rosenstein, CNN reported that Justice Department officials had begun planning for Solicitor General Noel Francisco to step in as acting attorney general to oversee the special counsel probe.\n\nAs solicitor general, Francisco is already one of the top authorities within the Justice Department and has regularly defended the Trump administration before the Supreme Court. Francisco came to the administration from the law firm Jones Day, where he worked with recently departed White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\nJohn Ratcliffe\n\nRatcliffe was among those floated as a replacement for Sessions ahead of the midterm elections. Ratcliffe is a former federal prosecutor, and he won re-election on Tuesday by an overwhelming margin.\n\nHis congressional biography touts his conservative bona fides and experience as a prosecutor, naming terror convictions in particular.\n\nHe is a member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Ethics committees.\n\nJohn Michael Luttig\n\nLuttig is a former federal appellate judge and Justice Department official who left the government to work as general counsel at Boeing.\n\nBefore he left for Boeing during the George W. Bush administration, Luttig had been a finalist for vacancies on the Supreme Court, and he denied at the time that he was stepping down because of \"the Supreme Court process.\" Luttig clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, the conservative judicial icon who died in 2016.\n\nA source close to Luttig said he had been considered for the role of FBI director after Trump fired James Comey.\n\nEdith Jones\n\nJudge Edith Jones sits on the 5th US Circuit of Court of Appeals, and CNN previously reported that she might be in play as a replacement for Sessions.\n\nJones, who like Luttig was once considered a potential Supreme Court nominee under Bush, courted controversy five years ago from civil rights groups after she was alleged to have said that she believes some ethnic groups are more prone to violence than others.\n\nJanice Rogers Brown\n\nJanice Rogers Brown has also emerged as a possible candidate.\n\nBrown, a former California Supreme Court associate justice and former US circuit judge, retired from the bench in August 2017 and moved back to California. A source close to her indicated that she would not be interested in the attorney general job and did not want to return to Washington.\n\nTrey Gowdy\n\nA Republican source told CNN that Gowdy, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, was being floated as a potential replacement for Sessions.\n\nThe outgoing conservative representative and former prosecutor became widely known during the Obama administration as he pursued an extended investigation into a 2012 deadly attack on a US mission in Benghazi, Libya. But he also repeatedly came to the defense of the Justice Department under Sessions' tenure as attorney general as Trump railed against Sessions and the special counsel investigation. At the same time, he has pressed the department for access to information and clashed with current and former top officials.\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nGraham has wavered as much or more than anyone in his public opinion of Trump. Graham lashed out against him repeatedly during Trump's presidential bid, but following Trump's win, Graham emerged as one of his top allies. Following an emotional rebuke of his Democratic colleagues during the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, Graham's positive position among Trump's supporters has only ascended further.\n\nBut, as with Gowdy, he repeatedly defended Sessions from Trump and called for Mueller's independence. He has also publicly denied any interest in leaving the Senate for a position in Trump's Cabinet, and he responded to the news of Sessions' ouster by reaffirming his desire to remain in the Senate.\n\n\"As to me, I will be part of a larger Republican majority in the United States Senate -- working with the President and my Republican and Democratic colleagues -- to make America safer and more prosperous,\" Graham tweeted.", "Washington (CNN) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was confident Wednesday she would be elected speaker, one day after Democrats won back the House majority since losing it eight years ago.\n\nPelosi, the heavy favorite for the speakership despite dissension within the caucus, also pushed back on President Donald Trump's tweet saying that Pelosi deserved to be speaker.\n\n\"I don't think anybody deserves anything,\" she said at a news conference. \"What you have done in the past speaks to your credentials, but it's about what you can do, and I think I'm the best person to go forward to unify, to negotiate.\"\n\nPelosi pointed to past deals she's negotiated in Congress, saying \"the only one we didn't win wasn't a negotiation -- it was the GOP tax scam.\"\n\n\"So, I think that my case is being the best person for how we go forward,\" she said. \"And I'm not going to answer any questions on that subject.\"\n\nPelosi is expected to win the speaker nomination during the caucus elections later this month, when she'll only need support from a majority of Democratic members. But in January, she must shore up support from most of the caucus to win the full House vote on the floor, which traditionally has a threshold of 218 votes but could be won with fewer.\n\nSo far, CNN has projected Democrats have a 223-seat majority, with 12 races still uncalled.\n\nWhile many Democrats laud her leadership, a small but vocal contingency of members say it's time for a new generation of leaders, and several have already pledged to vote against her for speaker.\n\nRep. Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, was on a 90-minute conference call with about 11 Pelosi detractors Wednesday night. Afterward, Vela told CNN there are at least 12 rock-solid no votes for Pelosi on the floor.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind: If we get 229 (seats), she will never get 218\" votes to become speaker, Vela said.\n\nPelosi allies and aides dispute Vela's math and believe she will ultimately get the votes -- especially since there's no viable alternative. The candidate who unsuccessfully ran against her in 2016, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, told CNN on Tuesday that he's not planning on running for speaker, though he hasn't fully shut the door. Ryan told CNN other candidates may emerge.\n\nVela said discussions among Pelosi critics would continue over the next several days to figure out a way forward.\n\nPelosi officially announced her bid in a letter to colleagues on Wednesday, reiterating that she'd prioritize health care, the economy and oversight.\n\n\"My vision for the next two years is to restore the House to the role it should have as a strong and independent voice for the American people, and maximize the ability and the creativity of our entire Caucus. In that spirit, I am writing to respectfully request your support for Speaker, and do so with confidence and humility. Thank you for your consideration,\" the letter said.\n\nPelosi allies say Tuesday night's results prove attacks against her are ineffective, and she could still become speaker even without the support of the minority who oppose her. She holds powerful leverage as a fundraising juggernaut and key decider in committee assignments.\n\nTo help assuage concerns in the caucus, Pelosi also pitched herself before the election as a \"transitional\" leader who would operate as a short-term speaker to help navigate the caucus as it decided its next leaders -- though it's unclear how long she plans to hold the reins.\n\nThe highest-ranking female elected official in American history, Pelosi previously served as speaker for two terms in 2007-2011. During that time, she helped shepherd through the economic stimulus package, the banking overhaul bill, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Affordable Care Act to passage.\n\nEven in the minority, Pelosi has remained the leader of House Democrats and the most powerful woman in Congress. She largely kept the caucus together, with practically no defections on major votes.\n\nAfter she praised the number of women who were elected Tuesday night, Pelosi was reminded by a reporter that some of those women have said they won't support her.\n\n\"What I say to those women: Congratulations on your election,\" she said. \"Welcome.\"\n\nOthers run to reclaim past posts\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House as minority leader, announced Wednesday he'll run for majority leader during the caucus elections, set for later this month.\"As Majority Leader in the 116th Congress, I will continue to engage with Members across the Caucus to ensure your voices are heard as we pursue our agenda,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues.\n\nHoyer has been in Congress for nearly 38 years, longer than any other current Democratic leader in the House. Of that time, he's been the second-highest ranking Democrat after Pelosi for 16 years and in lower-level Democratic leadership positions even longer.\n\nHoyer has also been active in outlining his vision for a Democratic-controlled House.\n\nAssistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn, the No. 3 ranked Democrat and highest ranked African-American member in the House, announced he'll run for majority whip.\n\n\"As the only member of leadership from a red state and a largely rural district, I am uniquely positioned to help bring our caucus together, to marry strong progressive values with pragmatic solutions that can cross our ideological, geographic and cultural divides,\" wrote the congressman from South Carolina.\n\nPelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn all held the top three posts during the last Democratic majority, a fact that has some Democrats flustered and calling for a new generation of leadership.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Clyburn was the only one with a challenger. Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado announced she's also running for majority whip.\n\nSome of the younger rising stars in the caucus are running for lower-level leadership posts. With Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn all aiming to move up one spot in the majority leadership ranks, that leaves open the assistant Democratic leader spot, currently held by Clyburn and set to become the No. 4 ranked position under the majority.\n\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the House Democratic campaign arm that helped win back the majority, announced Wednesday he's running for assistant Democratic leader. Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Cheri Bustos of Illinois are also running for that post.\n\nThe No. 5 ranked position is chair of the Democratic caucus, currently being competed for by Reps. Barbara Lee and Linda Sanchez -- both of California. Rep. Pete Aguilar of California and Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts are vying for vice chair.", "Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Often when presidents lose the House of Representatives or the Senate in the midterms, they sound somber when they speak to the press.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton stepped in front of the cameras in 1994 and promised to work across the aisle with the new Republican Congress on issues like welfare reform. In 2006, after Democrats regained control of Congress in the aftermath of a disastrous war, President George W. Bush admitted that it was a \"thumping.\" Four years later, President Barack Obama called the 2010 midterms, where Republicans retook control of the House, a \"shellacking.\"\n\nNot President Trump. Today he did what so many said he shouldn't do. After losing the House to the Democrats, the President announced on Twitter that he had replaced Attorney General Jeff Sessions with now-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has notably not been sympathetic to the Russia investigation. This was the act of someone digging in for a fight, not preparing to reach out to the other side.\n\nThe firing was announced a few hours after his press conference, during which he portrayed the election as a victory for himself and the GOP. (Though John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, informed Sessions of his dismissal earlier in the day.) He stressed the limited number of times that the party of the President gained seats in the Senate. While acknowledging the undeniable reality that Democrats gained control of the House, his preferred topic was the Senate, where the Republicans expanded their majority. In short, he took credit for the victories and separated himself from the defeats.\n\nThe playbook remained exactly the same. Although he started with some nods to bipartisanship, congratulating Nancy Pelosi on her victory, he quickly threatened Democrats. Diving deeper into his familiar script, he went after the news media and took shots at reporters like CNN's Jim Acosta for being \"rude.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Congressman-elect Joe Cunningham thought it was a \"good omen\" on Election Day Eve that his 8-month-old son slept through the entire night. It was the first time he'd done so.\n\nThe young Democrat flipped a historically Republican South Carolina seat in a race that has garnered much national attention: earlier this year incumbent GOP Rep. Mark Sanford lost his primary to Trump-supporting conservative Katie Arrington. Sanford refused to endorse her (or Cunningham) in the general election, and then the national Republicans swooped in at the last minute, with more than $80,000 in ads in the final days to help Arrington's campaign.\n\nCunningham's win attracted its own amount of widespread interest from high-profile Democrats. An aide to former Vice President Joe Biden said Biden called Cunningham to congratulate him Wednesday.\n\nAs the power in the House shifts to Democrats, leaders from within Cunningham's party have signaled that investigating the Trump White House and administration will be a top priority. But Cunningham is not as interested in oversight.\n\n\"We should be focusing on issues that affect people's lives, like making health care more affordable and fixing our infrastructure,\" he told CNN in a phone interview on Wednesday. \"We should let the special counsel finish his investigation first.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Congressman-elect Joe Cunningham thought it was a \"good omen\" on Election Day Eve that his 8-month-old son slept through the entire night.

Its founder and president, Jim Gilchrist, has -- in coordination with Shannon McGauley's Texas Minutemen -- published on the Minuteman Project website an \"URGENT CALL FOR TEXAS BORDER OBSERVATION DUTY\" to cover the 2,000-mile border from San Diego to Brownsville, Texas. The group had over a thousand militia members show up to patrol 23 miles of the border in Arizona in 2005 , drawing national media coverage.\n\nThe governors of the border states do not have to sit idly by while groups like the Minutemen deploy to the border with high-powered assault rifles, aerial drones, and night-vision goggles. These governors have legal tools in their arsenal to prevent this. Every state that borders Mexico, including Texas (and 48 of all 50 states), has a provision in its state constitution that requires the military to be at all times subordinate to the civil authority. That means private, unregulated and unauthorized militias -- operating wholly outside public accountability -- are prohibited by state law. In addition, both Texas and Arizona have criminal statutes barring private armed militias, while California and New Mexico ban private paramilitary activity.\n\nJUST WATCHED GOP lawmaker: 15,000 troops is an overreaction Replay More Videos ...

They can send letters warning the leaders and organizers of these militia groups, such as Gilchrist and McGauley, that their members will be requested to cease and desist any military deployments in their states, and if the members persist, they will face legal action. And the governors can make it clear that state law enforcement authorities will enforce the criminal laws that prohibit armed private militia activity.\n\nAccording to US Army documents obtained by Newsweek , the military has expressed its concern internally about the presence of unauthorized militias along the border, noting the presence of an estimated 200 unregulated armed militia members operating under the guise of citizen patrols supporting CBP between points of entry.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The next Congress will include seven newly elected scientists, including a nuclear engineer and a biochemist.\n\nTheir supporters say these new scientist-legislators, all of them Democrats, will bring a fact-based approach to public policy and impact such issues as nuclear disarmament and climate change.\n\n\"They bring a real wealth of experience that's really lacking in Congress today,\" said Shaughnessy Naughton, president of 314 Action, a political action committee devoted to electing more public officials with backgrounds in science and related fields. \"There are more reality show people in Congress, including our president, than there are chemists and physicists.\"\n\nThe committee endorsed 13 candidates for Congress this year who had some kind of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) background.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) Both President Donald Trump and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi spoke Wednesday about their desire to work across the aisle on bipartisan policy initiatives in the new Congress. But with the country more deeply divided than ever along partisan lines, it's likely that gridlock, rather than cooperation, will be the dominant theme of the next two years with Democrats newly in control of the House pitted against the Republican-held Senate.\n\nHere's how five key domestic policy questions are expected to play out in a divided Washington:\n\nTax cuts\n\nTrump promised middle class tax cuts in the days before the election.\n\nThe big question now is whether he might be able to get Democrats, who bitterly opposed the 2017 tax reform bill that included hefty cuts for corporations and the wealthy, to join in.\n\nThe President on Wednesday opened the door to working with Democrats if they come up with an idea to help cut taxes for the middle class even if it means potentially raising the corporate tax rate -- now set at 21%.\n\n\"I would absolutely pursue something even if that means some adjustment to make it possible,\" Trump said at a press conference, without defining specifically how much of a calibration he'd be willing to make. When asked, he clarified it as \"a little bit of an adjustment.\"\n\nBut Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, cast doubt Wednesday on the President's pitch that an adjustment would provide sufficient relief to the middle class. And Democrats have pledged they will adhere to a strict policy of pay-as-you-go on new policy measures to avoid adding to a ballooning national debt.\n\nAlternatively, Trump could focus on finding small fixes that even Democrats would go along with, but that he could still claim count as a tax cut -- even if they're nowhere near the 10% he promised last month, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nThat includes maneuvers that would raise tax-free contribution levels for retirement plans or health savings accounts, both steps that have been included in bipartisan legislation introduced this year.\n\nA more likely scenario would be making small tax changes -- such the paid family leave credit -- through a budget bill later this year, allowing Republican leaders to use the House-Senate reconciliation process to sneak additional tax cuts in.\n\n\"The only strategic move for them is to go through the budget process, which only requires 51 votes,\" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. \"It's a rather aggressive play, but it's perfectly fine to do and strategically wise.\"\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care took center stage in the midterm elections, so it's expected Congress will look to tackle perennially thorny issues such as drug prices and health insurance over the next year as both parties look ahead to the next election cycle.\n\nOne area where there might be action: Drug prices . Democrats and Republicans agree that prices are too high.\n\nBoth Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become speaker in January, mentioned drug prices in remarks immediately after the election.\n\n\"I think that we could find common ground in reducing the cost of prescription drugs, if the President is serious about his saying that he wants to do that. He has pulled his punch on it so far,\" Pelosi said on PBS Monday night.\n\nBut the two parties have different ideas of how to combat the problem.\n\nRepublicans favor boosting competition and increase price transparency, said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a consulting firm. Democrats, on the other hand, will focus on pressuring drug makers to reduce their prices if they take over one or both chambers.\n\n\"Democrats are not shy about digging into pricing,\" Mendelson said.\n\nWhen it comes to health insurance, Democratic House lawmakers are also expected to introduce bills that would expand Medicare to cover more Americans. There are various versions of this single-payer legislation floating around, though Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-all bill that he rolled out last fall is the most prominent. But Trump would almost certainly veto any version of the legislation, which he's equated with socialism\n\nPoverty programs\n\nFirst up is passing the farm bill. The House and the Senate each approved a version, but the effort remains mired in conference committee. One big sticking point: The current Republican-backed House bill would require more food stamp recipients to work, while the Senate wouldn't.\n\nRepublicans are likely to push to approve a compromise bill before the party hands over the baton. Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson, ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, told reporters Wednesday that he would focus on passing the legislation during the lame-duck session, according to Reuters.\n\nAfter that, Democrats may look to increase funding for affordable housing, child care and job training, said Melissa Boteach, senior vice president of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the left-leaning Center for American Progress.\n\nLooming over any legislation is the growing federal deficit, which Republicans have renewed interest in. There will be a strong push to find ways to pay for any changes, said Robert Doar, a fellow in poverty studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nRepublicans will point to the strong economy and low unemployment rate as justification for adding work requirements to more programs\n\nReplacing NAFTA\n\nTrump and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts are due to sign a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement -- known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA -- in late November, before the Mexican presidency changes hands.\n\nBut Congress still needs to ratify the agreement -- and legislative procedure makes it almost impossible for them to vote on it before the end of the year unless majorities in both chambers are willing to alter the requirements laid out by the fast-track authority that applies to trade deals.\n\nWhile Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said in early October that Republicans would try to push it through during the lame duck session, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has knocked down the idea. He told Bloomberg News that the bill won't come up before the end of the year.\n\nEven under the current rules, it's possible that Congress could skip some steps and vote as early as New Year's Eve. But that would mean lawmakers would have to vote on the legislation on the very day Trump sends it to Congress, without any time for the committee meetings that would normally take place.\n\nIt would also likely mean that Congress would vote on the agreement before an economic impact study is published by the US International Trade Commission -- which has up to 105 days to complete it after Trump signs the deal.\n\n\"I don't see how procedurally, or politically, they can pull off a lame duck vote on NAFTA 2.0.\" said Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, a consumer advocacy group, and author of a book on the fast-tack authority.\n\nAnd Trump's own negotiators have already expressed hope that Democrats would get on board with his deal, in part due to improved labor standards and environmental protections that have been worked in\n\nHe might have an ally in Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, who's set to take over the House Ways in Means Committee next year.\n\nNeal, who voted against the original NAFTA, has said that \"the bar for supporting a new NAFTA will be high\" and that Democrats will prioritize making sure Congress can enforce new standards on environmental protections and worker rights included in the deal.\n\nTrump's trade war with China\n\nThe Constitution gives authority over trade to Congress, but over the years it has delegated some of that power to the president -- which is how Trump has been able to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nThe next Congress could attempt to slow Trump's protectionist trade policies, which are hurting some steel and aluminum manufacturers as well as farmers, a key constituency for both parties\n\nRepublican lawmakers have already attempted, though unsuccessfully, to take some of this power back. Legislation introduced in June by Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker would limit the President's power to impose tariffs in the interest of national security -- which Trump invoked to put duties on steel and aluminum imports.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would not bring the bill up for a vote. Even Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, whose state of Ohio is home to some steel producers, strongly opposed the measure. Even if a bill passed both chambers, Trump would have the opportunity to veto it.\n\nThere has been less talk of revoking the President's power to impose tariffs on countries that engage in unfair trade practices, which Trump used to put duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans share concern over China's alleged intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers.", "En Espa\u00f1a, este mi\u00e9rcoles fueron desalojadas parte de las estaciones de trenes de las ciudades de Madrid y Barcelona ante el aviso de un objeto sospechoso en el equipaje de una pasajera que hizo el trayecto Barcelona-Madrid.

They suggest it's possible that an alien artifact, built by extraterrestrial intelligence, has flown through our solar system.\n\nThis speculation, while of potentially enormous import, is almost certainly wrong. However, the idea is sufficiently interesting that it is worth understanding what is being proposed.\n\nIn 2017, newspapers reported the observation of a visitor to the solar system called Oumuamua, an unusual object that was hot dog-like in shape and estimated to be about a half-mile long and 80 meters wide. It dove in from interstellar space before buzzing by the sun and then rocketing outward past Mars.\n\nWhen Oumuamua was initially observed, it was thought to be an asteroid. However, once the object's velocity and trajectory were determined, that possibility was ruled out. Instead, it appeared to be more like a comet, in which case it would make a single pass through the solar system and leave, never to return.\n\nOumuamua approached the sun from above the plane of the solar system, dove below the sun's southern pole and then used the sun's gravitational field to slingshot itself back above the plane of the solar system as it headed off into deep space . While its trajectory seemed comet-like, there was no evidence of the typical tail one sees in comets.\n\nSo, regardless of the improbable assertion of extra-terrestrial involvement, this is an interesting thing. An object without a tail, moving with sufficient velocity that it must have come from interstellar space, entered and will leave the solar system. In science, it is generally true that where there is one example of something, there are many. And so researchers were very excited at the prospect that Oumuamua could lead to a new branch of astronomy.\n\nScientists monitored the body, noting how its brightness and its velocity changed. The varying brightness can give some information on the object's shape and the manner in which it is rotating, while the velocity is expected to follow the law of gravity, which is very strict. It's that last measurement that has caused this recent hubbub.\n\nGive an astronomer an object's position, velocity and trajectory, and he or she can predict far into the future where it will be and how fast it will be going. There's only one problem: The predictions for Oumuamua's velocity and ongoing measurements disagree.\n\nIt appears to be leaving the solar system more quickly than expected based on gravity. This is another way of saying that is that it is experiencing a small and unexplained acceleration away from the Sun.\n\nNow, this acceleration is very small indeed; the effect of gravity is about 200,000 times bigger. In addition, it's being reported that this unexplained effect is changing in a very specific way. As the distance between Oumuamua and the sun increases, the unanticipated acceleration decreases as the square of that distance.\n\nThere is a very pedestrian explanation for this non-gravitational behavior: The object is \"outgassing,\" which means various forms of ice are melting and puffing off into space. Basically, it's the same principle as a rocket ship. Near the sun, there would be lots of melting and lots of puffing.\n\nFurther from the sun, the melting would slow and that would result in less unexplained acceleration. This is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the object's movement through space -- except, of course, that there has been no observation of a comet-like tail, which is caused by exactly this sort of melting of ice. That doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, but it hasn't been seen and that means that astronomers cannot assume it is there.\n\nThis brings us to the most recent conjecture, made by two physicists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysical Research . There is another possible source of the acceleration called \"radiation pressure,\" which is a force that comes from light from the sun bouncing off Oumuamua. That force is clearly related to the amount of light bouncing off the object and thus it should depend on the distance Oumuamua is from the sun.\n\nThe Harvard researchers embraced the radiation pressure hypothesis and then calculated the mass and other properties that Oumuamua must have, consistent with all known measurements. They concluded that the object might be a solar sail of extraterrestrial origins, which is a possible technology that is being considered for humans to send probes to other stars. It's not a completely far-fetched idea.\n\nThe researchers went on to imagine a number of scenarios , including that Oumuamua was space debris from an extraterrestrial civilization or, even more provocative, that it was a fully operational probe that entered the solar system, did a survey, and is moving on. If that were true, then astronomers named Oumuamua very aptly, as the word means \"scout\" in Hawaiian.\n\nIs this explanation likely? No, of course not. Is this hypothesis the result of hopeless crackpottery? No, that's not true either. Both the authors of the paper establishing the unexplained acceleration and the authors exploring the light sail idea are respected scientists with unblemished research histories and no hint of scientific misconduct or otherwise suspicious behavior.\n\nSo, what could it be? Well, I suppose the extraterrestrial origin is possible, but very unlikely. To better appreciate the scientific method, one should return to the original paper that reported the object's unexplained acceleration. It makes very strong claims that something in addition to gravity is going on, so we can be pretty certain about that.\n\nFurther, the paper proposes some plausible explanations for how outgassing might be the explanation, even though no outgassing was observed. And, on a more cautionary note, if you dig a bit deeper it says that while the way in which the acceleration changes relative to the object's distance from the sun is consistent with either the outgassing or radiation pressure hypothesis, they cannot rule out other behaviors. That would mean that astronomers need to rethink the entire situation.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

The motion of Oumuamua is a perfect example of how it applies. It is almost certain that this mystery has an ordinary explanation, but it is at least physically possible that the probe explanation is true.\n\nBut, until I see extraordinary evidence, I'd bet against it.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - La Polic\u00eda de la provincia de Buenos Aires le confirm\u00f3 a CNN que investiga a un hombre por la muerte de su hija de un a\u00f1o tras aparentemente hab\u00e9rsela olvidado en la parte trasera de su veh\u00edculo.\n\nEl hecho ocurri\u00f3 el martes al mediod\u00eda, hora local, en Ceraso y avenida La Plata, en la localidad bonaerense de Santos Lugares.\n\nIgnacio Correa, secretario de la Fiscal\u00eda General de San Martin, le dijo a CNN que el imputado de 39 a\u00f1os \u2014y de quien se pidi\u00f3 reserva de su identidad\u2014 habr\u00eda dejado a su hija de un a\u00f1o en la parte trasera de su veh\u00edculo entre las 9 y las 16 horas y cuando regres\u00f3 la encontr\u00f3 muerta.\n\nLa causa est\u00e1 catalogada como homicidio culposo y la Dra.

In 2017, Paul Gosar voted yes for an amendment proposed by Arizona's Trent Franks, which (had it not failed) would have allowed the US government to evaluate Islamic teachings as \"unorthodox\" and survey Muslim religious leaders. Also in 2017, Jeff Duncan posted (then deleted) an image of a white man, labeled \"Europe,\" with a hangman's noose around his neck tied to the trunk of a small tree labeled \"Islam.\" Mark Harris has used slurs to describe Muslims and, preaching as a pastor, called the Islamic faith \"dangerous\" and the work of Satan.\n\nWitnessing at once Muslim-Americans writing political history -- paving the way for new representation of a large group -- and a string of unashamed Islamophobes being elected into power by the American people was a bittersweet tug of war.\n\nWhile watching Islamophobes tighten their grip on power was disappointing, watching Muslims get elected into Congress was a huge and overdue win the for the American Muslim community that has for so long sought representation. Everyday American Muslims can now look to their branches of government and know that someone is vouching for their rights instead of trying to strip them in the name of \"patriotism.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Steve King erupts at comparison to suspect Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Steve King erupts at comparison to suspect 01:13\n\nYesterday's win could also signify a cultural shift for those who staunchly believed that Islam and democracy are incompatible. Having visible Muslims in office who celebrate their faith and background while also espousing the leadership qualities and understanding of the Constitution that should be demonstrated by American leaders overturns the false yet popular belief that Islam and Western democracy are at odds with one another.\n\nBut, perhaps most importantly, the election of Muslims into Congress could result in real policy change or, at the least, representation of the American Muslim community's views on policy, which are often otherwise overlooked.\n\nOne of Tlaib's initiatives, the Justice For All Civil Rights Act , aims to \"drastically expand US civil rights protections to cover discriminatory impacts.\" One of Omar's outstanding visions is one for a \" just immigration system \" that treats immigrants as potential citizens instead of criminals. For a community that was hit with three versions of a Muslim ban aimed at \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" and, more recently, threatened with the revoking of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, these kinds of policies signify tangible hope.\n\nFor more opinion...

Wade. But they are, at a minimum, signs of what's to come should the landmark Supreme Court case get overturned.\n\n\"In a world after Roe, the voters will finally get to decide what abortion policy they support,\" said anti-abortion activist Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America , in a written statement. \"In this election, we saw people getting ready for the day in which Roe becomes a footnote in history.\"\n\nWhat the laws say\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2, which passed with 61% of votes, amends the state's Constitution \"to declare and otherwise affirm that it is the public policy of the state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children ... and to provide that the constitution of this state does not protect the right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.\"\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1, which passed more narrowly with 52% of votes, states that \"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\"\n\nOregonians shot down Measure 106, which would have prohibited the use of public funds to pay for abortions except in cases in which there's a federal requirement or when the procedure is deemed \"medically necessary.\" Only 37% of voters voted for the measure, while 63% came out in opposition.\n\nWhat advocates say\n\nAnti-abortion activists were quick to applaud voters who came out against abortion and using taxpayer dollars -- like Medicaid -- to pay for abortions.\n\n\"West Virginians value life and reject abortion on demand,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List , a national anti-abortion group that launched a campaign to support the state's measure. \"Amendment 1 could spare the lives of 1,500 unborn West Virginians every year.\"\n\nAlthough the West Virginia amendment \"won't have an immediate impact,\" Julie Warden, a spokeswoman for the Vote No campaign, warned in an emailed statement that \"it is ominous for low-income women who already face insurmountable barriers to healthcare.\"\n\nShe added that options are being considered \"to ensure every West Virginian can get safe abortion care,\" no matter the amount they earn.\n\nThe Alabama amendment too \"has no immediate effect,\" said Kelly Krause, spokeswoman for the legal advocacy group Center for Reproductive Rights , but \"it sets the stage for Alabama to criminalize abortion without exception should Roe be overturned. By giving the same rights to a fetus as a person, this measure could have far-reaching consequences for contraception and in-vitro-fertilization as well. For example, emergency contraception like Plan B could be banned and couples undergoing fertility treatments could be forced to pay for the upkeep of their frozen embryos forever.\"\n\nDr. Brandi Shah, a family medicine physician in Alabama who's on the faculty of Physicians for Reproductive Health , called the amendments \"back door bans against abortion\" and warned what this could mean in if the protection of Roe v. Wade is lost.\n\n\"In Alabama, at a state level, a person's right to health care -- in this case abortion -- has been lost,\" she said in a written statement. \"The right to make life-changing decisions about pregnancy has been taken away from pregnant people even in extenuating cases of rape, incest, or risk to the life of a woman.\"\n\nThe passage of the two measures left Dr. Willie Parker, an ob/gyn, abortion provider and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, \"heartbroken for my patients and the people of Alabama and West Virginia.\"\n\n\"Abortion is health care, health care is a right,\" he said in a news release, \"and a right is not a right if every patient can't afford to access it.\"\n\nBeyond the bills\n\nThe hot-button issue of abortion extended beyond ballot measures; it helped drive support and interpretation of candidates. In this regard, both sides of the debate chose to declare victory.\n\nA representative from Americans United for Life pointed in a statement to election results in three states -- North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana -- as a positive sign.\n\n\"Voters swept Democratic senators out of office who voted against pro-life Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh,\" said Steven Aden, the anti-abortion group's chief legal officer and general counsel. \"The net result is now a strong pro-life majority in the Senate,\" which he hopes will lead to the confirmation of more anti-abortion federal judges and the passage of bills like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban late-term abortions nationwide.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood declared Tuesday's election results \"a huge victory for reproductive health and rights\" in a news release. \"Voters around the country flipped the U.S. House of Representatives to a pro-reproductive health majority, and key reproductive health champions were elected statewide,\" including the governors-elect in Michigan, Kansas and New Mexico.\n\nNewly elected officials in the mix means both sides are preparing for what's to come.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThose on the anti-abortion side vow that they will not be complacent, especially as they \"face the reality of a now pro-abortion led House of Representatives that is determined to thwart President Trump's pro-life policy agenda,\" said Dannenfelser, of the Susan B. Anthony List.\n\nAnd an abortion rights voting project, even as it celebrates its \"prochoice champions,\" sums up the new reality its side is facing. It's a reality in which state amendments, like the ones passed in Alabama and West Virginia, could change the battlefield.", "Washington (CNN) Democratic congressional leaders reacted to the news of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' firing on Wednesday by warning that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential Russia collusion must be safeguarded from interference.\n\nThey also called for the new acting attorney general, who has been openly critical of Mueller and the investigation, to recuse himself from oversight of the inquiry.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said on Twitter , \"It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions' firing as anything other than another blatant attempt\" by President Donald Trump \"to undermine\" and \"end\" the Mueller probe.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said at a news conference in Washington that \"protecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount\" and it \"would create a constitutional crisis if this were a prelude to ending or greatly limiting the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nBoth called for the recusal of Matthew Whitaker, who Trump announced on Twitter will become the new acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, who was Sessions' chief of staff, is expected to take charge of the Russia investigation from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Whitaker argued in a CNN op-ed last year that Mueller was \"dangerously close to crossing\" a red line following reports that the special counsel could be examining financial records tied to the Trump Organization. In the same op-ed, Whitaker called for the investigation to be limited in its scope.\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\" he wrote. \"If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\"\n\nIn a statement released after his news conference Wednesday, Schumer also called on Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the investigation.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said in the statement.\n\nPelosi made a similar statement on Twitter , saying, \"Given his record of threats to undermine & weaken the Russia investigation, Matthew Whitaker should recuse himself from any involvement in Mueller's investigation. Congress must take immediate action to protect the rule of law and integrity of the investigation. #FollowTheFacts.\"\n\nSessions resigned his position as attorney general in a letter to the President, writing, \"At your request, I am submitting my resignation.\"\n\nMueller is investigating potential links or coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign associates and the Russian government. The President has consistently denied that there was any collusion and has attacked the inquiry as a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nA senior GOP congressional aide reaffirmed the previous position for GOP leadership that Trump should not fire Mueller.\n\n\"He would be playing with fire,\" the aide said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who is poised to become the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee when Democrats take control of Congress, said in a statement that \"The firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions fits a clear pattern of interference from President Donald Trump in the work of the Department of Justice and the ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\"\n\nHe added, \"We are immediately issuing multiple letters to key officials demanding that they preserve all relevant documents related to this action to make sure that the investigation and any evidence remains safe from improper interference or destruction.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who is expected to take over the gavel on the House Intelligence Committee, vowed that Democrats will \"protect the rule of law.\"\n\n\"President Trump just removed Jeff Sessions. He wants an Attorney General to serve his interest, not the public,\" Schiff tweeted . \"Mueller's investigation and the independence of the DOJ must be protected. Whitaker and any nominee must commit to doing both. We will protect the rule of law.\"\n\nSchumer said at his news conference that he hopes \"if there is a constitutional crisis that our Republican colleagues would join us in thwarting the President from creating that crisis.\"\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said he finds the timing of Sessions' departure \"very suspect.\" He went on to say, \"Our paramount view is that any attorney general, whether this one or another one, should not be able to interfere with the Mueller investigation in any way.

A source close to the President told CNN that the idea of Whitaker ending or suppressing the Russia probe is not an option as of now.\n\nTrump's dismissal of Sessions has raised yet more questions over how much influence the President will have over Mueller's probe, which has been a source of pain since it began in spring 2017. Trump has complained repeatedly about Mueller's investigation, calling it a \"witch hunt,\" and slammed Sessions in public repeatedly for recusing himself from the Russia probe, a step that helped lead to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointing Mueller.\n\nIn a CNN op-ed written last year, Whitaker argued that Mueller is \"dangerously close to crossing\" a red line following reports that Mueller was looking into Trump's finances.\n\nHe argued that Mueller does not have \"broad, far-reaching powers in this investigation,\" but that the investigation's limits are clearly defined by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's May 2017 letter appointing Mueller\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\" he wrote then. \"If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition.\"\n\nBack in 2017, Whitaker also told CNN's Don Lemon that he could see a scenario where Sessions is replaced with an attorney general who \"reduces (Mueller's) budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nTrump announced on Twitter Wednesday that Whitaker would fill the role of attorney general while he finds a permanent replacement to be \"nominated at a later date.\"\n\nSessions recused himself from the Russia investigation after it emerged that he had failed at his Senate confirmation hearing to disclose two pre-election meetings with Russia's ambassador to Washington at a time when Moscow was accused of interfering in the presidential race. The recusal was harshly criticized by Trump and led to the deterioration of their relationship.\n\nWhitaker was a CNN legal commentator and former US attorney who directed the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative ethics watchdog group. He ran in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate in 2014.\n\nWhitaker had taken a firm stance against Hillary Clinton while at the group.\n\nHe argued in 2016 that \"there was a strong case\" to bring against Clinton in the FBI's investigation.\n\nOn the day that then-FBI Director James Comey said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges against Clinton into her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, Whitaker penned an op-ed in USA Today arguing that she should be prosecuted.\n\n\"Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,\" Comey said at a news conference in July 2016.\n\n\"I disagree,\" Whitaker wrote hours after. \"I believe myself to have been a reasonable prosecutor, and when the facts and evidence show a criminal violation has been committed, the individuals involved should not dictate whether the case is prosecuted.\"\n\nWhitaker has a personal tie to one of the witnesses in the Mueller investigation: Whitaker was the campaign chairman for Sam Clovis in 2014 when Clovis ran for state treasurer in Iowa, according to an archived press release on Clovis' website.\n\nClovis, who worked on the Trump campaign, said in a May radio interview that he has been interviewed by Mueller's team and had testified before the grand jury. Clovis was also listed an unnamed \"campaign supervisor\" in the indictment of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos, according to The Washington Post.\n\nHere are other comments Whitaker made on CNN regarding the Mueller investigation:\n\n\"CNN Tonight\" in July 2017: \"Really, I think ultimately what the President's going to start doing is putting pressure on Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of this investigation as acting attorney general, and really try to get Rod to cut ... the budget of Bob Mueller and do something a little more stagecraft-y than the blunt instrument of firing the attorney general and trying to replace him.\"\n\n\"CNN Tonight\" in July 2017: \"First of all, Bob Mueller was the FBI director when I was US attorney. I have a lot of respect, and I would be surprised if he is ultimately worried at all about this, and in fact I don't even think he pays attention to what's going on in the daily back and forth whether Jeff Sessions has the confidence of the President. Bob Mueller's going to continue to do his investigation.\"\n\n\"CNN Tonight\" in August 2017: \"If Bob Mueller and his small US attorney's office, as I've heard it described today, does go beyond the 2016 election and get into Trump Organization finances unrelated to the 2016 election, and really unrelated to Russian coordination if it even exists, I think that would be crossing a red line and I think that's when the deputy attorney general, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, Rod Rosenstein, who I served with in the Bush administration -- he needs to step in and pull the reins back on Bob Mueller if he starts to go outside of those bounds of his delegation of authority.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Some customers even had their vehicles repossessed because of the needless charges.\n\nMembers of Wells Fargo's executive risk management committee were alerted in April and July 2012 to \"critical issues\" about the insurance program known as collateral protection insurance, or CPI, a complaint unsealed by a judge on Monday alleges.\n\n\"Although senior Wells Fargo executives had long known that the CPI scheme harmed customers, Wells Fargo only shut it down in September 2016,\" the class action lawsuit brought by customers said.\n\nThe executives who were allegedly informed of Wells Fargo's flawed insurance program include David Julian, the bank's former chief auditor.\n\nWells Fargo ( WFC ) announced last month that Julian had taken a leave of absence . The bank gave few details about the sudden change, other than to say the move was linked to \"ongoing reviews\" by regulators into the bank's retail sales practices.\n\nReached by phone on Wednesday, Julian declined to comment on the allegations or to detail why he is on a leave of absence.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that other executives informed of the auto insurance problems include former chief administrative officer Pat Callahan, former general counsel James Strother and former chief risk officer Michael Loughlin. Those executives, all of whom retired over the past three years, could not be reached for comment.\n\nKenneth Zimmerman, former head of deposit products at Wells Fargo, was also named in the lawsuit. Zimmerman took a leave of absence in early 2016 and left in July 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal. Zimmerman could not be reached for comment.\n\nNews of the unsealed complaint was first reported by Reuters\n\nIn a statement, Wells Fargo pointed out that the bank ended the insurance program in September 2016.\n\n\"Since then, we have been reviewing customer accounts and developing a remediation plan -- which we hope to finalize very soon -- to provide impacted customers with the compensation they deserve,\" the bank said.\n\nUp to 20,000 cars repossessed\n\nWells Fargo set aside $241 million in the third quarter to go towards refunding customers who were harmed by the insurance program.\n\nThe bank has faced a series of scandals over allegedly abusing customers and even employees. Wells Fargo has admitted to opening millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers' knowledge. And Wells Fargo has said it charged homebuyers mortgage fees they didn't deserve. Earlier this week, Wells Fargo identified another 145 customers who lost their homes due to a computer glitch.\n\nThe auto insurance class action lawsuit was brought by more than a dozen borrowers who were charged for insurance after obtaining car loans through Wells Fargo.\n\nWells Fargo has said that up to 570,000 auto loan borrowers were charged for car insurance without their knowledge. As many as 20,000 of those customers may have defaulted on their car loans or had their vehicles repossessed in part due to these unnecessary insurance costs.\n\nSamir Hanef, a clinical social worker from North Carolina, said his Honda Civic was repossessed even though he kept up with his car loan payments each month.", "(CNN) You can add Nevada to the list of states that don't levy a \"pink tax\" on feminine hygiene products.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in that state amended the tax act of 1955 and removed the sales and storage tax on tampons and sanitary pads.\n\nNine states and the District of Columbia exempt feminine hygiene products from sales taxes. Five other states don't have general sales taxes.\n\nOver the last few years, the issue of exempting feminine hygiene products has been a tax policy discussion in several states\n\nProponents of removing the tax say these items are a necessity, not a luxury. In Nevada, opponents of the measure said that exempting these products from taxation could result in less revenue for local governments and school districts.\n\nThe amount spent in taxes per box of feminine hygiene products may not seem like much, but it adds up.\n\nAccording to the state's fiscal note , as of July 2017 there were approximately 867,000 females between the ages of 12 and 55 living in Nevada.\n\nAssuming all of them spent $7 to $10 per month on feminine hygiene products, purchases would \"generate total taxable sales\" of $72.8 million to $104.0 million each year, the fiscal note said.\n\nDropping the sales tax of 6.86% on these products would result in an annual loss of $4.96 million to $7.11 million in tax revenue, the fiscal note said.\n\nGroceries, candy and soda are already exempt from sales taxes in Nevada, the Tax Foundation, a think tank, reported.\n\nIn Nevada, the change will become effective January 1, 2019, and expire December 31, 2028, the fiscal note states.\n\nCNN reached out to the office of the Secretary of State for further comment.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n\"Eres una persona muy grosera, la forma en la que tratas a Sarah Huckabee Sanders es horrible.

Look, this is about Russia.\"\n\nThe President is absolutely correct. Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\n\nAccording to a CNN article, Mueller's investigators could be looking into financial records relating to the Trump Organization that are unrelated to the 2016 election.

Seg\u00fan una fuente del gobierno, el secretario de Justicia no recibi\u00f3 ninguna llamada telef\u00f3nica de Trump: fue Kelly quien le comunic\u00f3 el mensaje en la ma\u00f1ana del mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nTrump public\u00f3 en su cuenta de Twitter que estaba complacido de anunciar que Matthew G. Whitaker asumir\u00e1 como el secretario de Justicia interino, mientras se postula un reemplazo permanente a futuro. El presidente tambi\u00e9n le agradeci\u00f3 a Sessions \"por su servicio\".\n\n....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nSe espera que Whitaker encargue de la investigaci\u00f3n sobre la trama rusa y del fiscal especial Robert Mueller, quien era supervisado por el vicesecretario Rod Rosenstein. Sin embargo, CNN ha informado previamente que puede inhibirse en el tema de Rusia por escritos y apariciones en televisi\u00f3n anteriores.\n\nTodav\u00eda no hay informaci\u00f3n de cu\u00e1ndo ser\u00e1 juramentado Whitaker y de si Mueller supo de la decisi\u00f3n con antelaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa medida representa un abrupto final de lo que fue un mandato turbulento para Sessions, originalmente uno de los primeros y m\u00e1s leales partidarios de Trump cuando fungi\u00f3 como senador republicano de Alabama. Sessions fue una figura clave para ejecutar la visi\u00f3n que Trump quiere a Estados Unidos y revirti\u00f3 significativamente las pol\u00edticas del gobierno de Barack Obama sobre inmigraci\u00f3n, reforma policial y derechos civiles.\n\nSessions fue uno de los que llev\u00f3 a cabo gran parte del enfoque de mano dura de la administraci\u00f3n de Trump contra la inmigraci\u00f3n y elogi\u00f3 constantemente las fuertes palabras del presidente sobre el crimen. A pesar de que continuaba implementando la agenda de Trump, su relaci\u00f3n con el mandatario permaneci\u00f3 tensa durante meses debido a la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller sobre Rusia.\n\nTrump no respondi\u00f3 una pregunta directa sobre Sessions durante su conferencia de prensa este mi\u00e9rcoles, y dijo que, en general, est\u00e1 \"extremadamente\" satisfecho con su gabinete.\n\nSessions se encuentra a\u00fan en el Departamento de Justicia y se espera que salga al final del d\u00eda, seg\u00fan el funcionario del gobierno.\n\nLa discordia por la investigaci\u00f3n sobre Rusia\n\nLas tensiones entre Sessions y Trump empezaron en marzo del a\u00f1o pasado, cuando el secretario se inhibi\u00f3 de participar en las investigaciones sobre la trama rusa durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2016. Una situaci\u00f3n que molest\u00f3 al presidente y sobre la que dijo era \"muy injusta\" porque Sessions hab\u00eda \"aceptado\" el trabajo para despu\u00e9s inhibirse. CNN inform\u00f3 en su momento que Trump estaba frustrado con la decisi\u00f3n de Sessions.\n\nMeses despu\u00e9s, en junio de 2017, Sessions ofreci\u00f3 su renuncia tras tener acaloradas discusiones con Trump a ra\u00edz de su determinaci\u00f3n. Desde entonces, Trump ha criticado reiteradamente a Sessions, diciendo incluso que se arrepiente de haberlo nombrado secretario de Justicia. Lo ha calificado entre otras cosas, \"asediado\", \"idiota\" y \"VERGONZOSO\".\n\nIncluso, el mandatario se quej\u00f3 en privado de que Sessions no lo ha defendido adecuadamente, seg\u00fan le dijeron a CNN varias fuentes el a\u00f1o pasado. Sin embargo, el entonces secretario defendi\u00f3 su decisi\u00f3n y continu\u00f3 ofreciendo se\u00f1ales p\u00fablicas de que no intentaba renunciar de cara a las cr\u00edticas.\n\nEn agosto pasado, Trump tuite\u00f3 que Sessions \"deber\u00eda detener\" la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller, planteando preguntas sobre si el presidente estaba intentando obstruir la justicia. El abogado de Trump Rudy Giuliani le dijo a Dana Bash de CNN que Trump simplemente \"estaba \"expres\u00e1ndole su opini\u00f3n sobre su medio favorito\".", "\"At your request I am submitting my resignation,\" Sessions wrote in a letter to White House chief of staff John Kelly.\n\nMatthew Whitaker will take over as acting attorney general, the President said.\n\nWhitaker is expected to take charge of the Russia investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Whitaker has been openly critical of Mueller and the investigation and Democrats immediately called on him to recuse himself, just as Sessions had.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States. He will serve our Country well ...We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date,\" Trump tweeted\n\nJUST WATCHED Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired 01:52\n\nThe move is an abrupt end to what had been a tumultuous tenure for Sessions, originally one of Trump's earliest and most loyal surrogates as an Alabama Republican senator. He was a key figure in implementing Trump's vision for America and significantly rolled back Obama-era policies on immigration, police reform and civil rights.\n\nSessions was an enforcer of much of the Trump administration's hardline approach on immigration and regularly praised the President's tough words on crime. But even as he continued to carry out the Trump agenda, his relationship with the President remained strained and fraught for months due to the ongoing Mueller investigation.\n\nSessions received the request to resign from Kelly, not the President, on Wednesday morning, an administration official said. It is not clear whether Mueller was told ahead of time.\n\nSessions believed that Rosenstein has handled the investigation properly after it was dropped \"right in his lap,\" according to a source familiar with Sessions' thinking.\n\n\"[Rosenstein is] a professional, he's tried to do the right thing and he's handled it as well as anybody could,\" the source said of Sessions' views on the matter.\n\nHowever, the source said that Sessions himself has been frustrated that Mueller's investigation has not yet concluded, but DOJ officials have \"tried to do the right thing every day and not be involved in arguing the case in the media.\"\n\nIn a statement, Whitaker said he will lead a \"fair\" department with high ethical standards.\n\n\"It is a true honor that the President has confidence in my ability to lead the Department of Justice as Acting Attorney General. I am committed to leading a fair Department with the highest ethical standards, that upholds the rule of law, and seeks justice for all Americans,\" he said.\n\nTrump constantly criticized Sessions\n\nSessions' ouster came a day after the midterm elections saw Republicans hold onto control of the Senate -- which would confirm Trump's eventual permanent choice to head the Justice Department -- and just weeks after Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations, tax fraud and bank fraud and Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort was found guilty of eight charges including tax fraud and bank fraud.\n\nSessions was aware that Cohen was facing bank fraud and tax violations but had been walled off from the campaign finance aspects of the investigation into Trump's former lawyer, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN.\n\nTrump's distaste for Sessions was well known -- and publicly reinforced by the President himself on a regular basis -- after the attorney general recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 campaign early in Trump's term.\n\nThe President mocked Sessions in August as \" scared stiff and Missing in Action .\" Later the same month as Trump continued to rail against him, Sessions issued a statement firing back at Trump and declaring, \"While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action.\"\n\nJust days later, Trump knocked the Sessions-led Justice Department for indicting two Trump-supporting Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm elections. Both lawmakers won their re-election bids Tuesday.\n\nBut Sessions hung on, and although there was no formal reconciliation, the President allowed him to stay, even despite the unwillingness of White House spokespeople to publicly confirm, for days, that Trump had confidence in the attorney general.\n\nIn early August, Trump tweeted that Sessions \"should stop\" Mueller's investigation, raising questions as to whether the President was attempting to obstruct justice. Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was merely \"expressing his opinion on his favorite medium.\"\n\nSessions, for his part, consistently maintained that his recusal decision was made in consultation with career ethics officials at the Justice Department and was in the works from the time he was sworn in.\n\nDemocrats demand continued independence for Mueller\n\nTop Democrats immediately called for Mueller's investigation to be allowed to proceed.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said.\n\nFormer Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder declared interference with the special counsel \"a red line.\"\n\n\"Anyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable. This is a red line. We are a nation of laws and norms not subject to the self interested actions of one man,\" Holder tweeted.\n\nAnyone who attempts to interfere with or obstruct the Mueller inquiry must be held accountable. This is a red line. We are a nation of laws and norms not subject to the self interested actions of one man. \u2014 Eric Holder (@EricHolder) November 7, 2018\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler tweeted a vow for accountability. Nadler is poised to chair the House Judiciary Committee next year.\n\n\"Americans must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind @realDonaldTrump removing Jeff Sessions from @TheJusticeDept. Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation?

When the next Congress arrives in Washington, Democrats will be wielding the House gavels with a mandate to grind President Donald Trump's agenda to a halt.\n\n\"Remember this feeling, know the power to win,\" House Minority Leader -- and potentially House speaker in waiting -- Nancy Pelosi told an audience that cheered \"speaker, speaker, speaker\" for her as she took the stage. \"Thanks to you we owned the ground. Thanks to you tomorrow will be a new day in America.\"\n\nAcross the aisle, Republicans working on House races who had projected confidence throughout the 2018 cycle dropped the pretense early in the night.\n\nAsked what they planned to drink to mark the end of the campaign, one Republican working on House races deadpanned: \"Paint thinners.\"\n\nIt was a rare triumphant night for the Democratic Party, which has been hell-bent on taking back the House since Trump won the presidency and Republicans began hacking away at his predecessor's legacy. It was driven largely by a revolt against Trump in the suburbs, where Democrats picked up race after race Tuesday night on their march to the majority.\n\nA turbo-charged ground game was key, but the reality of why Democrats won the House is more complicated: Unlike the more centrally organized Senate and governor's races, the party's tactics for reclaiming the chamber were mostly handed up from the grassroots, which backed hyper-local, moderate candidates in districts that voted for Trump, while leaning on first-time candidates, most of them women and military veterans, in swing seat races.\n\nTheir new capacity, though, comes with a slew of unresolved and potentially divisive strategic questions. On the campaign trail, Democrats promised to both run down corruption in the White House -- using the majority's subpoena power -- while working to protect and expand a health care system Republicans remain committed to dismantling.\n\nBut striking a balance that satisfies the party's \"resistance\" base, its vocal crop of progressive insurgents and the entrenched powerbrokers threatens to bedevil, and potentially handcuff, the next speaker, whether it's a seasoned operator like Pelosi or a new leader on a short honeymoon.\n\nOn the Republican side, losses in the suburbs of Washington, Philadelphia and Denver were expected, but the real Republican hand-wringing began when seats began to fall in Dallas, Kansas City and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nSome operatives blamed historical norms -- the party out of presidential power usually picks up seats in the first midterm after losing the White House -- while others pointed to Trump's insistence on mostly ignoring the economy in favor of scare tactics on immigration. The 11th-hour chatter about ending birthright citizenship by executive order, they groused, wasn't winning over any cautious moderates.\n\nOthers cited the unease created by the national focus on 14 pipe bombs sent to prominent Democrats and CNN over five days and the killing of 11 congregants at a synagogue in suburban Pittsburgh late last month.\n\n\"That's when the momentum was blunted and shifts in polling began to occur,\" said a top Republican operative working on the midterms. \"Rightly or wrongly, the media labeled Trump as culpable for what occurred and that buried Republicans in suburbs where the professional class is fed up with that strain in our country.\"\n\nIt was particularly potent, the operative concluded, in Virginia, Illinois and South Florida, all home to some of Democrats' biggest House wins.\n\nBy contrast, the midterms for Democrats -- from start to finish and with limited interruptions -- were almost entirely about health care.\n\nDemocrats ran 752,000 ads, or 53% of its total for the year, on health care, according to data from CMAG. That number went up in the final month of the campaign, too, with a staggering 58% of all Democratic campaign spots focused on that singular issue.\n\nRepublican messaging was scattershot, according to CMAG, with taxes the focus of a third of GOP ads, but there was far less primacy -- health care and immigration were also about 20%. And in the final month of the campaign, Republicans actually scaled back on health care messaging, only making the issue the focus of 31% of their ads.\n\nBut even as Trump's messaging complicated House races, it proved potent in the Senate.\n\nThe forces that alienated suburban voters -- Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination and Trump's racist rhetoric on immigration, in particular -- fueled a GOP surge in states Trump won in 2016, and where he campaigned for Republican candidates in the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\nDemocrats thought getting former Gov. Phil Bredesen, their best-known and most popular possible recruit, into Tennessee's Senate race would make it competitive. But Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn ran away with the race by more than 10 percentage points.\n\nThey thought Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill both stood strong chances of holding onto their seats in states Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016. Both were easily dispatched. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was easily ousted in North Dakota.\n\nThe party was once again bedeviled by Florida, where Republican Gov. Rick Scott led Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in a race Democrats thought they had steered to a narrow victory. The real heartbreaker for liberals in Florida and around the country, though, came in the governor's race, where former Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum, who was vying to become the state's first black governor.\n\nDeSantis closely aligned himself with Trump; Gillum ran on progressive populism. It looked to many like a preview of the 2020 presidential race. And DeSantis won it.\n\nMost ominous for Democrats: Trump proved to be a potent force whose popularity with conservatives is durable.\n\nTrump blanketed the country in 2018, traveling to 23 states for 43 rallies. And in the final six days of the 2018 midterms, Trump headlined 11 rallies in eight states. He visited Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, West Virginia and Montana.\n\nRepublicans notched major statewide victories in all but West Virginia and Montana.\n\nBut Trump's impact on races, especially in the House, was not universally positive. Many House races that Democrats won on Tuesday night came in the suburbs of America's largest cities, where Trump's rhetoric and style are deeply unpopular.\n\n\"It is a double-edged sword,\" one Republican official said of the presidential visits.\n\nFor newly empowered Democrats, there is also a piper to pay.\n\n\"It's a totally different game. What we get to do is go from two years of defense to finally getting to go on offense,\" Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, the powerful activist network formed after Trump's election, said on Tuesday night.\n\nThe group will soon roll out a fresh guide to help its members navigate the new balance of power and pressure Democratic allies in Congress to follow through on their campaign promises.\n\n\"Democrats will need some encouragement, some friendly encouragement from the folks that put them in office,\" he said.\n\nEthan Todras-Whitehill, executive director of Swing Left, which raised more than $10 million from over 73,000 grassroots donors for House candidates, said he believes the lessons of 2018 can change the way Democrats run campaigns. But only if the party continues to directly engage and even challenge its hyper-charged new activist class.\n\n\"The people who are listening to Swing Left and Indivisible are probably pretty likely voters in the first place,\" Todras-Whitehill said. \"You have the 15% of the country that's really upset about Trump and wants to do something about it. You don't ask those people to vote. You ask them to do more.\"\n\nDemocrats were skittish on Tuesday night, seeing every loss as a sign of 2016 redux, where they were heartbroken by the results in state after state and, eventually, a Clinton loss.\n\nThose feelings were not helped at the Democratic party when \"Fight Song\" -- the anthem synonymous with Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign -- briefly played as worried Democrats ambled into the ballroom.\n\n\"It,\" a Democratic aide said as he walked away from the night's playlist, \"has been handled.\"\n\nAnd later that night -- as Democrats toasted to Beyonce's \"Run the World\" after winning the House -- it actually had been.", "CNN said in a statement that Acosta has the network's full support.\n\nThe revocation of his pass \"was done in retaliation for his challenging questions at today's press conference,\" the statement said. \"In an explanation, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders lied. She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened. This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better. Jim Acosta has our full support.\"\n\nIn the 7 p.m. hour on Wednesday, Acosta was stopped at the White House's Pennsylvania Avenue gate where reporters usually enter.

It immediately stirred concerns within the White House press corps.\n\nPeter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, said on Twitter: \"This is something I've never seen since I started covering the White House in 1996. Other presidents did not fear tough questioning.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), which advocates for the press corps, issued a statement soon after Acosta was denied entry, calling the revocation of his access \"unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Journalists may use a range of approaches to carry out their jobs and the WHCA does not police the tone or frequency of the questions its members ask of powerful senior government officials, including the President,\" the association said. \"Such interactions, however uncomfortable they may appear to be, help define the strength of our national institutions. We urge the White House to immediately reverse this weak and misguided action.\"\n\nElisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, said that \"the president should not pick and choose who covers him, and he should certainly not force out a representative of one of the country's leading news organizations, one that tens of millions of Americans depend on for their news.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump clashes with media after the election Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump clashes with media after the election 01:17\n\nAcosta has been one of the most aggressive reporters on the Trump beat, winning him huge numbers of fans but also huge numbers of critics.\n\nDuring Wednesday's news conference, many people on social media thanked Acosta for trying to hold the president accountable for his words and deeds.\n\nBut others condemned the correspondent. Some Trump boosters said Acosta's credentials should be revoked. And pro-Trump media outlets ran stories alleging that the reporter had mistreated the White House aide who tried to take a microphone away from him at the news conference.\n\nSanders repeated this assertion in her statement.\n\n\"President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration,\" she said. \"We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.

In fact at one point @Acosta tells her politely 'pardon me, mam' as she's yanking on his arm.\"\n\nAcosta also tweeted that Sanders' description of the incident was a \"lie.\"\n\nAt the news conference, Trump snapped at the press corps, called reporters \"rude\" for asking questions, and made baseless claims about political polling.\n\n\"Such a hostile media. It's so sad,\" he said, keeping up his years-long campaign against the people who cover him.\n\nTrump's most contentious exchange was with Acosta. Immediately afterward, CNN said in a statement: \"This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.\"\n\nPresident Trump's treatment of the press at Wednesday's news conference varied from one minute to the next.\n\n\"While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it,\" CNN added. \"A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.\"\n\nThe news conference was shown live on CNN and all the other cable news channels and broadcast networks. Media critics and Democrats said Trump's combative streak \u2014 telling reporters to \"sit down\" and insulting some of them \u2014 might be part of a strategy to deflect attention from Democratic victories in the midterms.\n\n\"Trump wants to make the story him vs the media not him getting his ass kicked in the House. This press conference is playing right into that narrative,\" former Obama aide Tommy Vietor tweeted.\n\nAcosta was one of the first reporters Trump called on. \"Thank you, Mr. President,\" he said. \"I want to challenge you on one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign.\"\n\nTrump leaned into the mic and said, \"Here we go\" \u2014 seemingly relishing the confrontation.\n\nAcosta brought up the migrants traveling from Central America toward the US southern border, and the racist ad referring to them that the Trump campaign released last week.\n\n\"As you know, Mr. President, the caravan is not an invasion,\" Acosta said. \"It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the US--\"\n\nTrump, sarcastically, replied, \"Thank you for telling me that, I appreciate it.\"\n\nAcosta: \"Why did you characterize it as such?\"\n\n\"Because I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion.\"\n\n\"But do you think that you demonized immigrants?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. I want them to come into the country. But they have to come in legally.\"\n\nThat's what the migrants are trying to do \u2014 they say they intend to seek asylum.\n\nAcosta called out the misleading ad and said: \"They're hundreds of miles away, though. They're hundreds and hundreds of miles away. That's not an invasion.\"\n\n\"You know what? I think you should,\" Trump started to say, pointing at Acosta. \"Honestly, I think you should let me run the country. You run CNN. And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\"\n\n\"Okay, that's enough,\" Trump said as Acosta tried to ask another question.\n\nA White House staffer hurried over to grab the mic and carry it to the next reporter Trump chose, NBC's Peter Alexander.\n\n\"If I may ask one other question, are you worried--\"\n\nAcosta tried to point out that other reporters had also asked multiple questions.\n\n\"That's enough,\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House staffer tried to grab the mic from Acosta, but he held onto it.\n\nJUST WATCHED Jim Acosta: We're going to keep doing our jobs Replay More Videos ...

You shouldn't be working for CNN.\"\n\nThen he turned to Alexander: \"Go ahead.\" But he turned his focus back to Acosta: \"You are a very rude person, the way that you treat Sarah Huckabee Sanders is horrible. The way that you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Trump said to Alexander. The NBC journalist then spoke up in Acosta's defense: \"I've traveled with him and watched him, he is a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us.\"\n\n\"Well I'm not a big fan of yours either, to be honest,\" Trump said, prompting laughs in the room. He disparages NBC almost as often as CNN.\n\n\"So let me ask you a question,\" Alexander said, not missing a beat.\n\nAcosta stood back up and spoke. His comments were not totally audible on live TV, but Acosta could be heard asking about the dangers of Trump's anti-media attacks, like the use of the term \"enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"When you report fake news, which CNN does, a lot, you are the enemy of the people,\" Trump said, turning back to Alexander.\n\nTrump's press conference at the White House on Wednesday. The event was shown live on CNN and all the other cable news channels and broadcast networks.\n\nThe press conference lasted 1 hour and 26 minutes.\n\nTrump's treatment of the press varied from one minute to the next. As at prior news conferences, he showed contempt for reporters one minute, complaining about questioners \"jumping out of their seats screaming questions at me,\" then suggested he was enjoying the back and forth.\n\n\"Should we keep this going for a little while?\" he asked, one hour into the session, prompting some of the reporters to say \"yes!\"\n\nWhen a reporter from a Japanese news outlet asked a question, Trump said, \"Say hello to Shinzo,\" referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nThe news conference threw into stark relief the different styles of different White House correspondents. Some, like April Ryan, tried to ask questions without being explicitly called on.\n\n\"Sit down please,\" Trump said to her. \"Sit down. I didn't call you, I didn't call you, I didn't call you.\"\n\nApril Ryan asks questions during an exchange with Trump.\n\nRyan was trying to ask about voter suppression concerns. In response, Trump falsely said that CNN's polls were a form of suppression.\n\nTrump frequently condemns so-called \"suppression polls,\" alluding to a conspiracy theory that claims news outlets distort polling results to discourage people from voting. He brought up the idea again later in the news conference, despite a lack of evidence for the idea.\n\nToward the end of the event, Yamiche Alcindor, a correspondent for PBS \"NewsHour,\" asked Trump about the widely shared view that his rhetoric has emboldened white nationalists.\n\n\"That's a racist question,\" Trump said repeatedly in response.\n\nYamiche Alcindor of PBS \"NewsHour\" asking President Trump a question.\n\nSocial media lit up with outrage about Trump's dismissiveness. Alcindor, who is black, moved on.\n\nShe tweeted later: \"I followed up the president calling my question \"racist\" with a policy question about his proposed middle class tax cut because that's what journalists do. We press on. We focus on the privilege of asking questions for a living. We do the work.\"\n\nHere is the full White House statement:\n\n\"President Trump believes in a free press and expects and welcomes tough questions of him and his Administration. We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern. This conduct is absolutely unacceptable. It is also completely disrespectful to the reporter's colleagues not to allow them an opportunity to ask a question. President Trump has given the press more access than any President in history. Contrary to CNN's assertions, there is no greater demonstration of the President's support for a free press than the event he held today. Only they would attack the President for not being supportive of a free press in the midst of him taking 68 questions from 35 different reporters over the course of an hour and a half -- including several from the reporter in question.

Packard trustee chair in law and a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California. He is the author of \"Fair Not Flat: How to Make the Tax System Better and Simpler\" and founder of the People's Tax Page. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Yes, now that the Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives, they get to serve as committee chairs and that gives them the power of issuing subpoenas all by themselves. And, yes, Democrats can subpoena President Trump's tax returns, as they almost certainly will, and should -- there is much of potential interest in those returns, materially connected to Trump's possible conflicts of interest, foreign entanglements, and more.\n\nEdward J. McCaffery\n\nAnd, yes, Trump can oppose the subpoenas, and fight them in court, and it will be up to non-elected judges to decide the issue in the end. Meanwhile, our reality-TV-world of politics will breathlessly cover the twists and turns of the tale, as they already have begun to do.\n\nBut the Democrats got a much more important power on Election Day, one directly connected to the present and future well-being of all Americans. The US Constitution, in its so-called Origination Clause, provides that any law for raising revenue -- taxes -- must begin in the House. House Democrats, who won their majority largely by hewing to pocketbook issues such as healthcare and taxes, can do some real governance by using their power to tax to propose actual tax legislation.\n\nWhat might this look like? Without getting into the weeds, there are two broad approaches to take. One, Democrats can propose a real, and fiscally responsible, middle class tax cut -- one that gives real benefits to working Americans and is paid for by asking for some payments from the wealthiest, who can now, like Jared Kushner , avoid all taxes.\n\nTwo, the Democrats can propose legislation that actually shuts down loopholes that the rich, like Kushner and his father-in-law, use to dodge paying taxes.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)-

"(CNN) It would drive up the price of your barbecue but a global \"meat tax\" could save 220,000 lives and cut health care bills by $41 billion each year, according to a new study.\n\nThe numbers are based on evidence that links meat consumption to increased risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes.\n\nThree years ago, the World Health Organization declared red meat such as beef, lamb and pork to be carcinogenic when eaten in processed forms, including sausages, bacon and beef jerky.\n\nHealth officials have also declared that unprocessed red meat like steak and burgers are \"probably\" carcinogenic. Other carcinogens such as cigarettes and alcohol are regulated in order to reduce cases of chronic disease.\n\nThe price of bacon and sausages would increase dramatically with a meat tax\n\nA team of researchers led by Dr. Marco Springmann, from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University, estimated the rate of tax that would be necessary to offset health care costs related to red meat consumption.", "(CNN) With a frantic woman sobbing at one point in the background, worried neighbors of a 13-year-old North Carolina girl called 911 Monday morning to report the child had been taken by a man who stole an SUV.\n\nInvestigators in the case released the 911 call Wednesday and put out photos of the vehicle gleaned from surveillance video.\n\nThe stolen SUV is believed to have been used in the abduction of Hania Noelia Aguilar from outside her home in Lumberton, authorities said.\n\nSurveillance video shows the wanted SUV minutes after the girl was abducted.\n\nThe emergency call was made by a neighbor after a relative ran over to get help, authorities said.\n\nA Spanish-speaking woman and man told the 911 operator that the driver of the green Ford Expedition had turned on the SUV engine in preparation for taking children to school. A man then stole the SUV with a child inside, the callers said, according to a translator.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Democratic Sen. Jon Tester will win a third term in the Senate, CNN projects, outlasting millions of outside spending and an intense focus on the race from President Donald Trump.\n\nTester was widely seen early in the cycle as a vulnerable Democrat due to the fact Trump won the state by 20 points just two years ago. But Tester's unique brand as a farmer from Big Sandy and personal connection to the state provided a contrast to Republican Matt Rosendale, whose ties to the state were constantly in question.\n\nTester, like other Democrats running in red states, routinely pledged throughout the campaign to work with Trump when needed, even running TV ads touting his work with Trump.\n\n\"Washington is a mess but that is not stopping me from getting bills signed into law by President Trump,\" Tester said in his first campaign ad\n\nThat relationship with Trump frayed, though, after Tester led the charge against Ronny L. Jackson, the former White House physician who Trump picked to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversaw Jackson's confirmation, accused Jackson of handing out prescriptions \"like candy\" on foreign trips, accusations that eventually sunk his nomination.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The world's oldest figurative painting has been found in a cave, along with other phases showing a progression of human artwork, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature .\n\nThe figurative painting is of wild cattle, part of a large panel with three large animal paintings. The pigment comes from iron oxide, or ocher, which gives the painting its reddish-orange hue.\n\nUranium dating of small samples of the limestone crust over the art dates to 40,000 years ago. The paintings were found in Borneo's East Kalimantan province, where limestone caves contain thousands of rock art images. This particular painting, as well as many others, was found in the Lubang Jeriji Sal\u00e9h cave.\n\nForty thousand years ago, Borneo was not an island but a part of continental Asia when the sea levels were lower, the researchers said.\n\nThe cave also contains hand stencils in the first ocher phase, a second phase of hand stencils in a mulberry color along with intricate motifs and humans, and a third phase of human figures, boats and geometric designs. The red-orange and purple pigments have an identical mineral composition, the researchers said, so they believe all of it was originally purple and shifted over time.\n\nComposition of mulberry-colored hand stencils from 20,000 years ago.\n\n\"We think the first phase of paintings focusing on red large animal paintings and hand stencils started between 40,000 and 52,000 years ago and possible lasted until the [ice age] 20,000 years ago,\" Maxime Aubert, study author and associate professor at Griffith University in Australia, wrote in an email. \"Then a second phase of rock art developed focusing on depicting the human world. We don't know if these are from two different groups of humans or if it represents the evolution of a particular culture.\"\n\nThe ice age artists in caves\n\nThis research team also discovered 35,000-year-old figurative animal cave art and 40,000-year-old hand stencils in Sulawesi, which lies between Asia and Australia.\n\nFigurative art is a hallmark of this period in human history. \"Figurative art developed in Southeast Asia at the same time as in Europe,\" Aubert said. \"The art also changes at about the same time. Initially humans made figurative painting of large animals and they later start depicting the human world.\"\n\nSo what does this tell us about humans living in the area at the time? Although humans arrived in Southeast Asia between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago, there has been no art discovered that dates to that time. In Europe, the art appears at the same time modern humans arrived there.\n\nComposition of mulberry-colored hand stencils superimposed over older reddish/orange hand stencils. The two styles are separated by at least 20,000 years.\n\nThis creates many theories. Perhaps the art just hasn't been found or dated yet, or there were different waves of human migration -- or the dates of the earliest arrivals of humans in Southeast Asia and Australia are wrong, Aubert said. Populations also could have boomed later, between 40,000 and 50,000 years ago.\n\nOr maybe the art itself was \"exported,\" so to speak, traveling from place to place and beginning at different stages as humans learned art. This could account for the phases of art as well, from depicting animals to humans. Though human figures in rock art are common, they are rare in early art, Aubert said.\n\nClimate could also be a factor, with the increase of art revealing times when the conditions were more favorable for humans, Aubert said. All of these are possible, but for right now, the artists themselves remain a mystery.\n\nThe treacherous trek to a cave\n\nAlthough the paintings were found in 1994, researchers weren't able to date them until now.\n\nThe paintings were high on the cave walls and ceiling, contrasting with the black drawings in the more accessible areas of the cave, Aubert said.\n\nHuman figures dated at least 13,600 years ago.\n\nThe discovery of calcite on top of the paintings was crucial because the researchers date when it formed, as opposed to the actual pigments. Calcite forms when rainwater seeps through limestone, dissolving a small amount of uranium. Uranium decays over time, creating the element thorium, and measuring the ratio of one element to the other reveals the age of the coating, Aubert said.\n\nReaching the cave art itself was treacherous, requiring the researchers to travel by canoe up a river, followed by walking for four days through dense jungle before hiking up a mountain. They travel light, sleeping in hammocks and staying in the cave for about two months. Their main water source is what drips from stalagmites, Aubert said.\n\nThe cave opens to an untouched valley ringing with the sounds of orangutans and bird calls, and the scent of durian fruit is heavy in the air. Tiger prints appear on the forest floor, as does the occasional cobra.\n\nIt is unknown whether there are human remains in the cave itself.\n\nHuman figures from 13,600 years ago.\n\n\"We are planning archaeological excavation in those caves in order to find more information about these unknown artists,\" Aubert said. That excavation will happen next year. \"We also want to date more rock art in order to refine the minimum and maximum ages for each styles and also find out how long they lasted.\"\n\nThe researchers will carry out those followup investigations in Borneo and Sulawesi.\n\nBut the cave art itself is a hugely important part of understanding ancient humans.\n\n\"It's an intimate window into the past,\" Aubert said. \"Exactly, most of what we know about our deep past is from archaeological excavation and usually we found things that people left behind -- essentially their trash. Rock art was made for a purpose and we can see how people lived a long time ago in a way that archaeology can't provide.

Yet the Chuck Jones/Dr. Seuss holiday classic is a model of storytelling economy, whereas the new version, \"Dr. Seuss' The Grinch,\" captures sparks of that magic while straining to treble its size -- like the Grinch's small heart, only here for theatrical purposes.\n\nIn that regard, this \"Grinch,\" which features Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of the title character, has a good deal in common with \"The Lorax,\" another Illumination Entertainment adaptation of a Seuss staple, which felt similarly labored in fleshing out its story.\n\nTo its credit, a few of the new elements in \"The Grinch\" are pretty nifty, perhaps most notably an expanded visual representation of Whoville, the idyllic town whose Christmas festivities become the object of the Grinch's ire. The other major additions are both new -- little Cindy Lou Who, in this telling way more than two, is now the concerned daughter of a single mom struggling to make ends meet -- and very old, providing the Grinch an origin story that vaguely echoes why young Ebenezer Scrooge was so hostile to the holidays.\n\nOther tacked-on elements are colorful, if fairly broad and garishly comedic, from an overweight reindeer who becomes part of the Grinch's plot to an ebullient Whoville resident Bricklebaum (Kenan Thompson) whose wholesale embrace of Christmas cheer represents everything that the Grinch isn't.\n\nMuch of that feels like filler, perhaps inevitably, as the Grinch builds up to the idea of stealing the Whos' Christmas; devises an elaborate plan to execute his scheme; and finally, comes to recognize the true spirit of the season, which, as Cindy Lou's mom (Rashida Jones) tells her, is about more than mere \"stuff.\"\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - El presidente Donald Trump y Jim Acosta, de CNN, tuvieron un intercambio tenso durante la conferencia de prensa de la ma\u00f1ana siguiente a las elecciones intermedias.\n\n\n\nAcosta, un objetivo frecuente de los ataques de Trump a los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, cuestion\u00f3 si el presidente cree que demoniz\u00f3 a los inmigrantes cuando calific\u00f3 de \"invasi\u00f3n\" a la caravana de migrantes.\n\nCuando la secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Sanders, intent\u00f3 poner fin a las preguntas de Acosta, Trump llam\u00f3 a Acosta una \"persona grosera y terrible\", y luego llam\u00f3 a un reportero de NBC News \"noticias falsas\" cuando defendi\u00f3 a Acosta.\n\nLEE: CNN llama \u201cantiestadounidenses\u201d los ataques de Trump a la prensa tras conferencia beligerante\n\n\"Los continuos ataques de este presidente a la prensa han ido demasiado lejos.

But it's also a totally meaningless number.\n\nFirst, there is obviously no national Senate election. Only a third of Senate seats are up for grabs in any US election. Second, the Constitution was written to give rural states more voice in the Senate. When it was written, by the way, senators weren't even elected; they were selected by state legislatures. Nationwide direct election of senators was not enacted until 1913, with the 17th Amendment.\n\nAbout 2 million more people voted this year in the hotly contested Texas Senate race, which Cruz won, than in California's, even though California has a much larger population than Texas.\n\nSpeaking of California, its primary system meant that two Democrats faced off on Election Day, so presumably de Le\u00f3n's 2.8-plus-million votes are in the Democratic column, along with California winner Dianne Feinstein's more than 3.3 million votes.\n\nIf turnout in California had been higher, the disparity between Republican and Democratic votes in Senate races would have been even higher.\n\nWe should point out here that the statewide races in California were not particularly competitive, and the turnout rate of 39% announced by the secretary of state there Wednesday morning is far lower than the national and eye-popping (for a midterm) 49% turnout rate currently projected in House races nationwide.\n\nIt is smarter to look at House popular vote totals, since every House member is up for election every year. It is, essentially, a national election. And Democrats performed very well, picking up the House majority and outperforming Republicans.\n\nBut if popular votes were what mattered in US politics, two of the last three Presidents, both Donald Trump and George W. Bush, would not have been elected.\n\nIt's more instructive for 2020 and future elections to consider Trump's over 50% approval rating in a slew of key states he won in 2016, like Florida and Ohio, and his slide in places like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nThat's because the US is often described as a democracy, but it's far from a direct democracy. And states wield great power, regardless of what a straight majority of US voters vote for.", "Lisbon, Portugal (CNN Business) Europe's Web Summit this week was buzzing with tiny startups hoping for the big break that would turn them into the rock stars of tech who crowded the conference's main stage.\n\nBut after a year many would like to forget, the big questions hanging over the future of the industry also loomed large at the conference. Facebook's data scandal , Europe's new sweeping privacy rules , waves of misinformation, slumping stock prices and record antitrust fines have left the industry feeling badly bruised.\n\nAbout 70,000 people attended the summit in Lisbon, Portugal, with a lot on their minds. The tech industry is facing more challenges than ever before \u2014 from regulation and hacking, to questions about funding and the trade war between the world's two biggest economies.\n\n\"I definitely think the era of technology companies thinking it was good to move fast and break things is over,\" said Brad Smith, Microsoft's ( MSFT ) president and chief legal officer.\n\n'Why can't we regulate some code'\n\nUber, Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOGL ), Amazon ( AMZN ) and others have found themselves under intense scrutiny over data privacy, competition, safety and tax.\n\nVera Jourova, the European Union's top official for justice, consumers and gender equality, said that after years of clashes with European regulators, Big Tech now seems more willing to work with the authorities.\n\n\"I think they started to understand the law must be applied online and that they don't operate in vacuum,\" she told CNN Business in an interview.\n\nThe global tech conference in Lisbon attracted 70,000 people.\n\nBut while there may be a growing realization that more regulation in Europe is inevitable, some believe that officials elsewhere, especially in the United States, need to challenge the idea that the internet cannot be regulated.\n\n\"When you go to a doctor, do you feel safe? When you sit on an airplane, do you feel safe? Yes, you do. Because of regulation,\" said Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, during a panel debate at the conference.\n\n\"If we can regulate nuclear power, why can't we regulate some code?\" he added. Wylie's revelations about his former company's use of Facebook data sparked global outrage about privacy.\n\n'More cumbersome to use'\n\nThe scandal sparked global outrage and fueled growing concern among internet users about the privacy of their data. Consumers are beginning to challenge the idea that companies should be able to use their data as they like in exchange for providing free services.\n\nThat leaves Big Tech to figure out how to strike the right balance between privacy and security.\n\n\"We could require two factor authentication and biometric identification every time you read an email,\" said Tamar Yehoshua, Google's vice president for product management. \"This would make accounts virtually impervious to hackers, but it would also make technology more cumbersome to use.\"\n\n'We need to curb the radicalized behavior'\n\nJourova said the idea that tech companies are just \"pipes\" for other people's content is dying.\n\n\"From the majority of the [top] people from the big companies, I hear 'we are responsible, we see that something wrong is happening, we are part of the problems, so we recognize that we must be part of the solution,'\" she said.\n\nBut even if they understand they have the responsibility to act, many companies are struggling to find the answers.\n\n\"We absolutely need to curb the radicalized behavior, I think any reasonable person agrees that is not healthy,\" Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, told CNN Business in an interview. \"The question is how we actually enforce that to scale, and I think that's the challenge every platform is struggling with right now.\"\n\n'We can't find the answers ... without women'\n\nAnd companies are facing problems that go beyond their products. Thousands of Google employees walked out last week in protest of the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations. They are calling for sweeping changes following a New York Times investigation into million-dollar severance packages for executives accused of misconduct.\n\nOne of those who walked out was Jacquelline Fuller, the president of the company's charitable arm. In a speech at the conference, she said Google needed to do a \"better job at creating a safe and inclusive workplace.\"\n\nThe MeToo campaign, and calls for equal pay and a more inclusive tech sector, were also high on the agenda. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president for environment, highlighted the need for more access to education for girls.\n\nGoogle's vice president for product management Tamar Yehoshua speaks at the Web Summit.\n\n\"We can't find the answers we need without women involved,\" she said.\n\n'It's not just accepting a check'\n\nThe funding that fuels the innovation in the tech industry poses yet another challenge.\n\nSaudi Arabia has become one of the biggest tech investors, as it tries to diversify its economy way from oil. SoftBank's Vision Fund, backed by $45 billion in Saudi government money, has invested billions into startups including WeWork, Slack, DoorDash, and most recently smart window maker View\n\nBut the uproar over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month means the recipients of Saudi cash now face some uncomfortable questions.\n\nTwitch CEO Emmett Shear said startups must recognize that accepting money from certain investors has consequences.\n\n\"It's not just accepting a check,\" Shear told CNN Business in an interview. \"You're going to be in business with these people, and you should think hard about that.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Also, 1631 would have exempted some large industrial facilities like factories and paper plants, which helped win support from organized labor.\n\nRead More", "Tony talks to a longtime Lower East Side resident who expresses frustration in the rising cost of living in a neighborhood once home to broke and aspiring artists and musicians.

The motion said the deal was done to \"siphon value away from the company on favorable terms,\" conducted \"at what appears to be discounted prices.\"\n\nA spokesman for ESL defended all the deals with Sears, saying that Lampert did everything he could to help Sears stem losses and return to profitability.\n\n\"We have every confidence that all transactions involving ESL and Eddie Lampert are valid and enforceable, based on fair and reasonable terms,\" said the spokesman. \"Any legal claims that attempt to challenge these transactions will have no merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously against any asserted claims.\"\n\nAll the deals were approved by independent members of the Sears board of directors, he added.\n\nSears declined to comment on the creditors' filing, and Seritage did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLampert was the majority shareholder of Kmart and a major investor in Sears when he brought the two companies together to form Sears Holdings in 2005.\n\nThe company has struggled almost continually since then, and has not reported a profit since 2010. Lampert served as CEO from 2012 until Sears filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 15, though he remains its chairman.\n\nOver the years ESL made at least $2.6 billion in loans to Sears Holdings, according to the bankruptcy filing.

Richard Neal and he's about to become a household name.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in the minority, Democrats will return to Washington in January ready to unleash the full weight of their oversight capabilities on the Trump administration, and Neal will be smack dab in the middle of the action.\n\nAt 69, the soft-spoken former mayor from Springfield, Massachusetts, who has built a reputation as a business-friendly Democrat, wonk and behind-the-scenes negotiator will be cast into one of the most visible and partisan roles on Capitol Hill: the man who will ask for President Donald Trump's long-awaited tax returns.\n\nExpected to take the helm of the influential House Ways and Means Committee, Neal would be one of only two members in Congress who can request the returns and the only Democrat, making him a central figure in the party's pursuit to hold Trump's administration and the President himself accountable.\n\nBut Neal told CNN in an interview Wednesday that he still hopes Trump will release his returns voluntarily, even though he suspects it will prompt a legal fight.\n\n\"I think the President has an opportunity here to defuse this and just release the forms as every other candidate for President has done,\" Neal said. \"Even if the request is made, I don't expect that afternoon we're going to see those tax forms. So I think we'll do what we have to do, and then see where the road takes us and the path that we travel.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to disclose his personal tax records is unprecedented in the modern presidency, a point Democrats have been making since the throes of the 2016 election.\n\nBut still, it is an unusual job for a man who colleagues say would rather be seeped in the intricacies of tax reform or crafting an agreement with Trump on infrastructure pay-fors than partisan flame-throwing.\n\nThat is part of the reason Democratic leaders believe Neal is the man for the job.\n\n\"He listens to others, which is a very important skill. He is not perceived as a ranter and raver,\" said Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. \"He is low key. But, anybody who mistakes his being low key for not being tough as they come, will make a huge mistake.\"\n\nHow it is going to work\n\nOnce Democrats assume the majority in January, Neal says he will plan to request Trump's returns from the President. The timeline, he says, is still uncertain as there are careful legal considerations he and Democrats will have to work through. His hope: That Trump will hand the returns without a fight and his committee can then move on to other work like infrastructure, taxes and protecting protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut, Trump hasn't been forthcoming about his plans.\n\n\"I don't care. They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want,\" Trump said Monday on the campaign trail about Democrats asking for his tax records.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he would consider disclosing his tax returns if he wasn't under audit.\n\n\"But when you're under audit, and I'm under very continuous audit because there are so many companies and it is a very big company, far more than you would even understand ...\" Trump said during a White House press conference. \"But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind, I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit.\"\n\nTechnically, Democrats argue, it isn't up to the President to decide.\n\nIf Trump won't hand over his returns voluntarily, Neal will turn to an obscure section of IRS code that he says gives Democrats the legal authority to obtain the records they want in the majority.\n\nUnder that statute, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee Chairman can request those tax returns. Then, if the chairmen of Ways and Means or Senate Finance wanted to make them public, the committee would have to vote.\n\nBut, using an obscure IRS code has political risks for Democrats and could force Democrats into a protracted legal battle with the President and his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin.\n\n\"The first issue is they would have to win the House, which they haven't done yet,\" Mnuchin told the Times before the election. \"If they win the House and there is a request, we will work with our general counsel and the IRS general counsel on any requests.\"\n\nMnuchin will also have to weigh the political costs of turning over the returns, realizing that handing them over to Democrats could be seen in Trump's eyes as the ultimate betrayal.\n\nNeal isn't the only Democrat looking for the tax returns. Texas Democrat Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a senior member of the tax-writing committee, said his party would \"immediately\" request the President's tax returns under a law in the tax code that allows lawmakers to review documents.\n\n\"I'm confident that this President who's had no oversight, only overlook, will feel that he's above the law on this also,\" Doggett said on a conference call with reporters. \"While we may not get those returns immediately, we ought to. And we ought to be asking for them immediately, aware that the President will be resistant to oversight.\"\n\nFor Neal, asking for Trump's tax returns are important, but he wants to ensure that he is able to ask for them and not let the dispute define his committee over the next two years.\n\n\"I don't think that the opening position of the most prominent committee in Congress ought to be weighed down by one dispute that we have,\" Neal said.\n\nAn unlikely soldier\n\nNeal got his start in politics in the early 1970s working in city government, first as the assistant to the mayor of Springfield and then as a member of the City Council. One of his most prized accomplishments over the years was rebuilding the train and bus station in downtown Springfield, a testament to the kind of old-school lawmaker colleagues say prizes the institution, deal-making and sending money back home, over the partisan rancor of the day.\n\nNeal's partial to earmarks, is a prolific fundraiser for Democrats and is often seen as someone who can work closely with members on the other side of the aisle.\n\nRaymond La Raja, a professor of political science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told CNN that chairing Ways and Means is a job a pragmatist like Neal is prepared for even if he may not be the vision of the attack dog the Democratic base may have had in mind.\n\n\"Congressman Neal is a throwback to the days when members felt a loyalty to the institution of Congress,\" La Raja said. \"That means they cared about how it worked and the importance of relationships. This style puts him at odds with many in both parties but it is essential to have leaders who support Congress as a Member, not as a partisan. The risk is that Democratic partisans will see him as too soft on Trump and the Republicans. He has spine but his style is not the way the most passionate in his party would like to see him use his gavel.\"\n\nRemarkably little nationally has been written about the 15-term congressman, a result colleagues say of the fact Neal has focused more on getting work done then appearing on camera to talk about it.\n\n\"He is not flashy so he doesn't get a lot of attention,\" Former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank told CNN. \"He is thoughtful, intelligent, very serious ... he is as thoughtful of a member of Congress as I served with.\"\n\nIn 2017 as the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Neal got to test drive the role of Democratic bulldog. He became the counterweight to the GOP's tax bill, railing against legislation on the House floor and shepherding Democrats through a marathon markup in the committee.\n\n\"This is not about simplification. ... It was going to be on a postcard, you are going to need to carry a billboard around with you to understand what is in this actual bill,\" Neal declared on the House floor just hours before the vote,

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "If you're still in election mode and itching to talk politics at the office today, tread carefully.\n\nPolitics and religion used to be considered taboo when it came to acceptable topics of conversation on the job. But that's starting to change, and some employers aren't shying away from talking politics at work.\n\nIf you broach the topic of politics at work, keep in mind:\n\n\"Politics is just as important to your day-to-day activities and it's important to us as a company and citizens. Why would you take that off the table?,\" asked Manny Medina, CEO of software company Outreach, based in Seattle.\n\nSome companies are welcoming civic engagement in the workplace, and inviting their employees to get more involved.\n\nMedina gave Election Day off to his roughly 300 workers. \"I wanted people to take the day off for themselves and their families to vote and talk to each other and the neighbors about the political views,\" he said.\n\nEmployees who still wanted to come into the office had lunch together and held small group discussions.\n\nEmployees at Phone2Action, a software company for advocacy campaigns located right outside Washington, DC, were greeted with Bloody Marys, mimosas and breakfast on Tuesday. The TVs in the lobby remained tuned to Election Day coverage. They also got a breakfast Wednesday morning to digest the results.\n\n\"Employers don't give enough credit to employees,\" said Ximena Hartsock, the company's president and cofounder. \"They do know how to talk to each other. They know they have to work together and don't want to offend.\"\n\nPhone2Action employees from both sides of the aisle sat and watched the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the office together in September.\n\nPolitics is just as important to your day-to-day activities and it's important to us a company and citizens. Why would you take that off the table?\" Manny Medina, CEO of Outreach\n\n\"It was great to see everyone watching it,\" said Hartsock. She expects political talk in the office to become more common.\n\n\"We have a very different generation of workers with Millennials and Generation Z. They are more vocal. They choose their workplaces, not just based on the paycheck but they want to be in places that align with their values.\"\n\nBut increased political discussions can be challenging for employers and employees trying to maintain an environment where workers feel safe and productive.\n\nMedina emphasized that it's important to create a workplace that values different opinions. \"It's not the topic we should ban, it's the lack of respect.\"\n\nFollowing a few simple guidelines can help workers navigate the heated topic, while maintaining professionalism and respect for coworkers.\n\nWhat is and isn't protected\n\nIf you want to discuss politics in the office and work in the private sector, the First Amendment won't protect you.\n\n\"The right to talk politics at work is not guaranteed by the Constitution,\" said Jay Zweig, an employment lawyer at Bryan, Cave, Leighton, Paisner.\n\nCompanies can ban political speech in the office \u2014 within certain limits.\n\nIf a worker is talking about the terms and conditions of employment (like wages and workplace improvement and conditions) that is protected under the National Labor Relations Act. There are also state laws that protect workers against retaliation or intimidation related to their political beliefs, according to Zweig.\n\nEmployees at Phone2Action enjoyed breakfast on Election Day and the following day.\n\nEstablish a policy\n\nEmployers should create policies around political speech in the office that focus on being respectful and prohibit harassment, discrimination and retaliation, Zweig recommended.\n\nThe terms of these policies should also be straightforward and clear and all employees should be made aware of them, recommended Tom Spiggle, an employment lawyer at The Spiggle Law Firm.\n\n\"It should be a well spelled-out policy that they enforce evenly,\" he said.\n\nAsk yourself: Is it worth it?\n\nWhen you take a political stance, people are going to form an opinion about you, said Kerry Hannon, an expert on career transitions and author of \"Love Your Job: The New Rules for Career Happiness.\"\n\n\"Whether they disagree or not, you risk someone changing how they view you, even if they don't consciously do it.\"\n\nWorkplace conflicts or a difference of opinions can have repercussions in the workplace beyond disagreements.\n\nThe fallout can be more subtle, like not being asked to join a team project.\n\n\"If political tensions have come up and you have different views, they might not want to work with you 10 hours a day,\" said Hannon.\n\nDon't be dismissive\n\nEven if you wholeheartedly disagree with a coworker's political stance, be respectful.\n\n\"Don't demonize someone for having a different view than you,\" said employment attorney Brian Heller at Schwartz Perry & Heller in New York. \"No one believes their viewpoint is harmful to others.\"\n\nPrepare an exit strategy\n\nIf you walk into the kitchen and find yourself in the middle of a political exchange you want nothing to do with, be ready with a natural way to sidestep.\n\n\"Say something like, 'oh, that's interesting, or 'I try to stay out of politics and don't even like discussing it and am so focused on my work right now,'\" said Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of \"Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant.\"\n\nClaiming to have a meeting or be on deadline can also help you exit quickly.\n\nCheck your extracurricular activities\n\nHow you spend your time out of the office can also affect your employment.\n\n\"The employer can say the activities or views are not consistent with our company core values,\" said Zweig.\n\nHowever, some states have passed laws that protect workers from getting fired for outside work activities.\n\nBe extra careful when typing or tweeting\n\nWhen passions are running high, people tend to be less cautious with their speech when they're posting on social media or typing.\n\n\"People will type things or tweet things that they wouldn't say in person,\" said Zweig, and a social media posting can lead to termination.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nTrump dijo que el hecho de que los dem\u00f3cratas no hubieran obtenido una mayor\u00eda en el Senado se debi\u00f3 en parte a la forma en que manejaron las audiencias de confirmaci\u00f3n del Senado para Brett Kavanaugh\n\nTrump dijo que hubo una \"cobertura medi\u00e1tica muy hostil, por decirlo suavemente\"\n\n(CNN) - El presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, dio inicio a su conferencia de prensa posterior a las elecciones intermedias hablando del \u00e9xito de su partido y su mano en las victorias republicanas de la noche anterior.\n\n\n\nMIRA: 7 lecciones que nos dejan las elecciones intermedias en EE.UU.\n\n\"Anoche, el partido republicano desafi\u00f3 la historia al expandir nuestra mayor\u00eda republicana\", dijo, y agreg\u00f3 que el partido republicano \"super\u00f3 las expectativas en la C\u00e1mara\".\n\nLos republicanos, dijo, \"superaron dram\u00e1ticamente la precedencia hist\u00f3rica\", a pesar de lo que calific\u00f3 de \"desventaja de recaudaci\u00f3n de fondos muy dram\u00e1tica\" y \"cobertura medi\u00e1tica muy hostil, por decirlo suavemente\".\n\nAl referirse a su multitud de m\u00edtines antes de los concursos del martes, Trump se jact\u00f3: \"De los 11 candidatos con los que hicimos campa\u00f1a la semana pasada, nueve ganaron anoche\".\n\nLuego recit\u00f3 una lista de estad\u00edsticas hist\u00f3ricas de medio t\u00e9rmino y carreras espec\u00edficas.\n\n(Trump est\u00e1 declarando victorias en carreras en las que CNN a\u00fan no ha declarado, algunas todav\u00eda est\u00e1n demasiado apretadas para dar un resultado definitivo).\n\nLa rueda de prensa fue un encuentro caldeado con la prensa.

Col. Jamie Davis told CNN, \"we are not calling it 'Operation Faithful Patriot,' we are calling it 'border support.'\"\n\nDavis said he could not provide a reason why the change had been made.\n\nSeparately, a US defense official said the Pentagon decided the mission should not have been designated a named operation because it was supporting US border authorities.\n\nHowever, that official also said it couldn't be denied that the phrase 'Operation Faithful Patriot' had potential political overtones.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the name change and that the decision was made by Defense Secretary James Mattis's office, which issued the order on Election Day, according to officials.\n\nLast week when Mattis was questioned on the decision to send troops to the border, he said, \"We don't do stunts.\"\n\n\"My first reaction was this was a public affairs unforced error. The public attention on the name of the operation had long subsided and deciding two weeks later they were not going to name it was unnecessary and brought undue attention to the fact that they named it in the first place,\" said CNN military analyst John Kirby.\n\nTypically, there are protocols in place that outline a deliberation process that decides whether an operation will be named. Ultimately, the final decision is made by the secretary of defense who also gets a vote on what the name will be.\n\nBut in this case, it is not clear whether the naming convention was followed or if key officials, including Mattis, were appropriately consulted.\n\nKirby did note however that the military has named support operations at the border in the past meaning there was nothing inherently wrong with the designation in the first place.\n\nIn 2006, President George W. Bush announced the initiation of \"Operation Jump Start,\" a plan to use armed National Guard troops to assist the Border Patrol.\n\n\"When you have a named operation it comes with funding protocols and the process is deliberate,\" Kirby said, adding that in this case, the decision remove the name is not going to change the way troops are resourced or paid.\n\nBut the decision to drop the name \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" just hours after polls closed has only fueled questions about the Pentagon's efforts to publicize the controversial deployment during an election in which the President made immigration a top issue and cast the caravan of migrants as a threat.\n\nAt least one defense official acknowledged Wednesday that the name of the operation carried potential political undertones but the role politics played in Mattis' decision to drop the moniker all together remains unclear.\n\nWhat is clear however is that there was mixed-messaging about the role of troops deployed to the border from the Pentagon and Trump ahead of the election.\n\nAs Trump ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric leading up to Tuesday's midterms by insisting he was sending US troops to stop the migrants reaching the US, top military officials emphasized the point that American soldiers would not be coming into direct contact with the migrants.\n\nOn Monday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said US troops will not \"be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States\" but are offering logistical support to Customs and Border Patrol, which currently consists primarily of \"putting up concertina wire and reinforcing the points of entry.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Pentagon has made an effort to be transparent about what troops are actually doing at the border, posting hundreds of photos and videos in the last week of unarmed American troops moving supplies and stringing concertina wire -- images that reinforced Dunford's comments.\n\nRoughly 30 public affairs personnel from five military units have been deployed to three states along the border, according to defense officials. A US defense official told CNN Tuesday that number is \"absolutely\" in line with what would be generally expected.\n\nKirby agreed with that assessment saying \"it is very normal an very typical for the military to want to document for the public and want to be transparent.\"\n\n\"They want to make sure the American public has a contextual perspective of what the troops are and are not doing,\" said Kirby, a former spokesperson for the Pentagon and State Department.\n\nBut the stark contrast between the Pentagon's messaging and Trump's fear-mongering rhetoric ahead of Tuesday's election has been difficult to ignore.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump sought to capitalize on the optics of the situation at the border ahead of the midterms with rhetoric implying US troops were deployed to help ward off a foreign invasion.\n\n\"You saw that barbed wire going up. That barbed wire -- yes sir, we have barbed wire going up. Because you know what? We're not letting these people invade our country,\" Trump said in Georgia on Sunday, referencing images of US troops laying concertina wire.\n\nPrior to Tuesday's election, CNN military analyst retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said the Pentagon's public relations effort reflected a conscious effort by military leaders to clearly illustrate the role US soldiers are playing at the border.\n\n\"Both Dunford and Mattis hoped to flood the zone with images of what soldiers are actually doing at the border to show that US troops are not there to physically prevent migrants from crossing the border,\" he said, adding there is little evidence to back up Trump's assertion the caravan poses a grave national security threat.\n\nBut those efforts have had little impact on Trump's rhetoric, even after Tuesday's elections.\n\nAt a post-election news conference on Wednesday, Trump lashed out at questions about his comments on immigrants and reiterated that he still considers the situation at the border to be an \"invasion.\"\n\nHe also said he doesn't regret pushing out the caravan ad that stirred controversy last week, which several television networks, including Fox News, refused to air or pulled from air.", "(CNN) A long-running dispute between scouts has now ended up in a Manhattan court.\n\nThe Girl Scouts of the USA has filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America after it announced that it would drop \"boy\" from the name of a program in 2019.

The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nThere are two questions that world leaders will have woken up asking themselves on Wednesday morning: 1) how long will President Trump last and 2) is his version of America here to stay?\n\nThese are the very same questions they have been asking ever since he came to power two years ago.\n\nBut almost before they could interpret what the midterm results mean for them , the US President had his own answer.\n\nAt 6:21 a.m. on the US East Coast, he tweeted\n\n\"Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!\"\n\nThe read on this, for those world leaders, will have been easy: Trump's zest for hyperbole hasn't been dimmed by his setback in the House of Representatives. This is the case, in large measure no doubt, because he sees wins in the Senate as validation of himself.\n\nIndeed, the very nature of his statement only serves to underline how his often brash tweets -- the trademark of his presidency -- have set a global trend among many leaders for Twitter diplomacy.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas took to Twitter to be among the first of America's allies to interpret what the midterm results meant, tweeting that it is a \"misconception to now bet on a course correction from Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Foreign Minister, however, did hint at a course correction from Germany: \"the case remains the US is still our most important partner outside Europe. To maintain this partnership, we need to remeasure and realign our relationship with the US.\"\n\nIn light of this, the answer to the second question seems to be that yes, this version of America is here to stay. Trump, and the desire by many for his divisive rhetoric, is the new normal. Which leaves the first question, how long will he last, two or six more years, unanswered.\n\nDespite this, the midterms did provide valuable clues as to what dealing with Trump after the midterms will be like.\n\nIn his typical attempt to set the news agenda in a single tweet style that we've all become so accustomed to, Trump glossed over a political realty that will catch up with him as soon as the new candidates are sworn in. And is something world leaders will be keenly aware of.\n\nJUST WATCHED Conway deflects question on Trump's tone Replay More Videos ...

It's about restoring the constitution and its checks and balances to the Trump administration.\"\n\nBy this, she means that Trump will face fights at home that will dwarf challenges he faced until now, leaving him less time to gallivant around the globe, glad-handing autocrats and investing in relationships that bump his poll ratings temporarily.\n\nPelosi appeared to put taking on Trump's domestic issues and health-care reforms at the top of her list of priorities, talking about \"stopping the GOP and Mitch McConnell on the Medicare Medicaid and affordable care act.\" The new Democrat-controlled House could deluge Trump in a host of distractions that will concern his allies and enable his enemies.\n\nHouse Democrats will have subpoena power, the power to call for congressional investigations (into issues, for example, like Trump's tax returns). The House will have the power to scrutinize his money dealings, question his relationship with the Kremlin and much more.\n\nChina, a trade partner and economic foe, tried to walk the middle ground when reacting to the midterm results. A government official said it will \"maintain the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.\"\n\nTrade with China is a rare issue of bipartisan consensus in the US these days, so it seems unlikely there will be any change of course here.\n\nRussian malfeasance is another topic garnering bipartisan consensus -- although not the President's handling of it, nor his handling of his relationship with President Putin.\n\nJUST WATCHED 2006: George W.

Certainly, Pompeo and his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, have faced abrupt about-turns from the White House, as a result of trying to fit around Trump's needs before.\n\nThere could be a lot more of this to come. Iran, for one, could be a beneficiary.\n\nOutside of his Gulf partners and Israel, Trump is poles apart from his traditional allies over his policy of pulling out of the multinational nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions.\n\nHe may well have less and less time to devote to shoring up support for sanctions, while Iran will have no greater priority that trying to shift global opinion in its favor.\n\nSo does all of that add up to two more years, or six?\n\nOn that, eyes will be on Nancy Pelosi.\n\nMess up taking on the President, mire the country in an even swampier DC political logjam where more muck sticks to Democrats than Republicans, and Trump's enemies could look forward to six years of making hay. Meanwhile, the country's allies will have given up on their hope of going back to the old relationship.", "Ryanair says it has sacked six employees for allegedly staging a photo of themselves sleeping on the floor at Malaga Airport in Spain in October.\n\nSource: CNN", "Washington (CNN) Roger Stone's allies are springing to his defense -- in front of a grand jury -- as special counsel Robert Mueller's team continues its investigation into Stone.\n\nTwo of Stone's associates, filmmaker David Lugo and attorney Tyler Nixon, said they have testified in recent weeks in front of Mueller's grand jury. In interviews with CNN and other media outlets, both men have said they witnessed New York radio host and political activist Randy Credico refer to himself as Stone's intermediary to WikiLeaks.\n\nStone, a longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, has been under scrutiny over whether he had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks would release hacked material during the 2016 presidential campaign and whether he shared any of that material with members of the Trump campaign. Roughly a dozen of Stone's current and former associates have been contacted by Mueller's team for interviews or to testify before the grand jury. An attorney for Stone said Stone still has not been contacted.\n\nAs investigators have examined Stone's potential contact with WikiLeaks, they've faced conflicting accounts. After proclaiming he was in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016, Stone amended his story to say he actually used a back channel: Credico. Credico has denied that he acted as a go-between.\n\nLugo and Nixon took to the pages of The Washington Post last month to bolster Stone's version of events, saying that Credico acknowledged being the source of Stone's election year proclamations about WikiLeaks.\n\nIt appears that Mueller's investigators decided to follow up.\n\nBoth Nixon and Lugo were questioned about whether there was an effort to intimidate Credico -- a charge both men denied. They also offered testimony that could reinforce Stone's claim that Credico served as his intermediary.\n\nCredico has said he was speaking sardonically when he referred to himself as a back channel because he knew Stone was referring to him as such.\n\n\"It changes nothing,\" Martin Stolar, Credico's attorney said of the testimony from Lugo and Nixon. \"Randy's statements that he's publicly made before are statements that he stands by.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stone has spoken truthfully on this matter from day one,\" said Grant Smith, an attorney for Stone. \"Yet everyone was assigning greater credibility to Mr. Credico than to Mr. Stone. For reasons known to Mr. Credico... it has been Mr. Credico who was attempting to downplay his involvement.\"\n\nLugo told CNN that he appeared before the grand jury for about half an hour and handed over copies of his communications with Credico.\n\nHe said he recounted for the grand jury an interaction with Credico in May 2017. At the time, Credico was helping Lugo arrange an interview with Stone, Lugo said. During the encounter, Lugo said Credico seemed out of sorts.\n\n\"He said the heat was on,\" Lugo said. \"He said. 'I'm the one who connected Roger with the WikiLeaks stuff.'\"\n\nIn one message, Credico wrote, \"I knew Rodger (sic) was going to name me sooner or later and so I told you that I'm the so-called back Channel,\" according to a copy of the message provided by Lugo.\n\nAs part of the investigation into Stone, Mueller's team has obtained copies of seemingly threatening messages that Stone has sent to Credico, who has participated in multiple interviews with Mueller's team and testified before the grand jury. Stone said he was not trying to intimidate Credico\n\nWhen Lugo was asked about whether there was some kind of harassment campaign targeting Credico, he said Credico was the one sending the menacing messages.\n\n\"I've never tried intimidating Randy \u2014 ever,\" Lugo told CNN. \"He's trying to intimidate me.\"\n\nLugo said he handed over months of \"threatening\" messages from Credico, which he believes were an effort to keep him quiet after Credico acknowledged his backchannel role in Lugo's presence.\n\nIn one series of messages that Lugo shared with CNN, Credico said he planned to talk about Lugo on an upcoming podcast, adding, \"I'm going to bury you champ.\"\n\nIn the messages, Lugo said he was prepared to sue Credico for defaming him and his business.\n\nIn an interview with the right-wing Daily Caller , Nixon said he was asked whether Stone ever tried to intimidate Credico. He said he never witnessed an intimidation effort.\n\nNixon didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. But in the Daily Caller interview, he recounted a dinner that he, Credico and Stone had in New York in November 2017. The dinner came after Stone told the House Intelligence Committee that Credico was his back channel to WikiLeaks.\n\n\"It was clear from the conversation,\" Nixon told the Daily Caller, that \"Stone had not invented this or thrown Credico in this as a decoy.\"\n\nNixon told the grand jury that Credico appeared upset that he would be revealed as Stone's source because it might upset Credico's left-leaning friends.\n\nBy Nixon's recollection, Credico said at the time: \"I can't admit this. I can't say this.\"", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)-- \u062a\u0639\u0647\u062f

Having reprised the fear-mongering, race-baiting and deceit that propelled him to the Oval Office, Trump in 2018 showed he will continue to lie and deceive and disrupt. If you expected a reprieve from the chaos, forget about it.\n\nA president like no other, whose personality is the subject of constant alarm, Trump has been reliably divisive and reckless since he began seeking the Oval Office. This consistency tells us to expect more of the same. If Trump was this bad in 2018 when his name wasn't on the ballot, what can we expect in 2020 when he's actually running for something?\n\nAlthough Republicans lost the House of Representatives, the forecasted blue wave that washed them out of power was not a tsunami, and the President is likely to conclude that his days of rage on the campaign trail helped the GOP gain seats in the Senate. House Democrats may now be empowered to confront him, but Trump will almost certainly try to divide the country further with appeals to fear and tribalism.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Trump added extra energy to his usual arm-waving, rubber-faced wild man act as he raced around the country like a deranged rock star on a manic Appeal to Fear Concert Tour. Bigotry, fear-mongering and falsehoods were once again his go-to themes. He also shifted his attack on the free press, blaming journalists for the political violence he helped stoke with rage-filled rhetoric.\n\n\"You know, you're creating violence with your question,\" Trump told a reporter at the end of the campaign. With this classic example of Trump-speak, the President equated civil inquiry with incitements delivered by the most powerful person on Earth. He later undermined public confidence in the election by warning of voter fraud . It was a false alarm clearly intended to delegitimize the results.\n\nTrump will be able to say that his anger and negativity worked well in Senate races in North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri, where GOP candidates ousted Democrats . But elsewhere even victorious Republicans, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, did not perform like the favorites they were. A regular president would find these outcomes sobering, but Trump is not a regular president. He could sift the results and conclude that with a little more demagoguery he might have done better.\n\nNear the end of his barnstorming tour Trump told a crowd that news coverage of his visit to a Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 worshippers had been killed by a gunman presented a false picture of a mass protest that arose in the nearby streets. \"They want to stoke resentment,\" said the President . \"It has to stop,\" he said.\n\nIn blaming the press, Trump performed two of his favorite tricks. The first involved turning the truth inside out to deflect attention. The synagogue suspect's online postings show he was motivated by the kind of anti-immigrant hatred Trump has made central to his own political identity. Like Trump, he reportedly called asylum seekers \"invaders.\" Trump's second trick in this case showed him applying a gross misinterpretation to a news event to make people afraid.\n\nJUST WATCHED Conway deflects question on Trump's tone Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Conway deflects question on Trump's tone 02:04\n\nThe synagogue killings occurred as the President's messages about a large group of asylum-seekers walking toward America from the south reached a hate-filled fevered pitch. With no evidence he suggested the walkers included criminals and terrorists and that billionaire philanthropist-investor George Soros funded their walk.\n\nSoros is the Jewish boogeyman of right-wing fanatics , and his image is routinely evoked as a dog whistle to anti-Semites. The day before the synagogue massacre, Trump smiled when some visitors at the White House called out Soros' name, and he joined in when other chanted, \"Lock him up!\"\n\nFalsehoods and distortions are Trump's hallmarks, and according to the fact-checkers at The Washington Post he has averaged 10 per day since getting elected. As the 2018 race heated up he tripled his average and on just one day, while campaigning in Texas for Cruz, he issued 83 false and misleading statements. Among the whoppers he issued again and again were claims that his 2017 tax cut was the biggest in history (it wasn't) and that the wall he promised to build on the border with Mexico is under construction (it's not).\n\nMany are inclined to dismiss Trump's distortions as somehow spontaneous or unplanned; they are anything but. For example, his team had signs printed and distributed at his rallies, one of which read, \"Finish the wall\" -- reinforcing his claim that something was being built and need only be completed. In reality , some fences are being repaired and extended, but no new wall is being constructed along a boundary that stretches roughly 2,000 miles. However, the signs waved by his supporters and the chants of \"Finish the wall!\" set just the right conditions for people to catch the contagion of fear and rage. It was political theater out of the demagogue's handbook, and Trump plays it like a master.\n\nIf Trump were an ordinary president whose proposals were offered as serious notions, the status of the wall might matter. In fact, from the moment Trump first promised to build the wall it has been more a symbol of his worldview than a workable policy proposal. \"The Wall\" gave him a solid image to evoke as he stoked an irrational fear of undocumented immigrants. Although these undocumented immigrants are much more law-abiding overall than are American citizens , Trump cited violent crimes committed by some to spread fear and anger. Then he promised to humiliate Mexico by forcing it to pay for the construction. \"I will build a great wall on our southern border\" was his pitch in 2016, \"and I'll have Mexico pay for it.\"\n\nAt the close of the 2018 campaign, Trump doubled down on this fear-mongering tactic with a TV ad focused on an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing police officers and threatened to kill more. Besides being inflammatory and racist in the view of CNN executives and others , the ad was based on false claims that Democrats were responsible for the killer in question coming into the United States. In fact, he was deported under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and permitted back into the country by Clinton's Republican successor, President George W. Bush.\n\nAlthough the ad was based on false claims, Trump's son Donald Jr. complained about \"fake news\" outlets (CNN, and later NBC and even Fox) refusing to broadcast it. As is his habit, the President continued to insult the mainstream press throughout the 2018 campaign to discredit any source of information that might contradict his claims.\n\nTrump added a final racist tinge to his 2018 campaigning when he called Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum a \"thief.\" His divisiveness on multiple fronts made it easy to see that Trump is playing the same game he has always played. His us-vs.-them message combined with scapegoating and histrionics are the essence of Trump. So too was his effort, in the end, to make the election a referendum on him as a personality.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch Trump and Obama face off Replay More Videos ...

These studies are not needed by anyone considering the coming two years in American politics.\n\nAs White House aides began to warn the President about potential midterms losses in the days before, Trump seemed to be open to the idea that his recklessly divisive behavior may be a problem. \"I would like to have a much softer tone,\" he told a reporter. \"I feel to a certain extent I have no choice. But maybe I do and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint.\"\n\nMissing from Trump's self-reflection is any acknowledgment that he had many opportunities to demonstrate a more balanced personality and, even when he tried, couldn't pull it off . After a counterprotester was killed during a weekend of neo-Nazi rallies last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, he made a mild public statement but then followed it with a rambling press conference where he declared there were \"good people\" among the white supremacists.\n\nFor more opinion...

At 72, having practiced this kind of rhetoric for decades, he cannot be expected to change. He will continue to create scapegoats and enemies and demand that his lies be accepted. And since Trump only knows to double his bets, he'll make the election of 2020 even more of an agony.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEntre los capturados estaba Ra\u00fal Becerra Velarde, exdirector de la Polic\u00eda Nacional peruana\n\n14 personas fueron capturadas en un operativo contra una organizaci\u00f3n de tr\u00e1fico de menores\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - La Fiscal\u00eda de Per\u00fa llev\u00f3 a cabo la madrugada de este martes un operativo que desarticul\u00f3 la organizaci\u00f3n criminal \u2018Los Desalmados del Tr\u00e1fico Humano\u2019, dedicada a la venta de menores.

When it happens, they tell us, it will probably have a greater impact on humanity than anything else currently happening in the world.\n\nAnd yet, like with most people, it is probably something you haven't spent much time thinking about. After all, it is human nature to avoid being consumed by hypotheticals until they are staring us squarely in the face.\n\nSuch is the case with a highly lethal flu pandemic. And when it comes, it will affect every human alive today.\n\nPandemic flu is apolitical and does not discriminate between rich and poor. Geographical boundaries are meaningless, and it can circle the globe within hours. In terms of potential impact on mankind, the only thing that comes close is climate change. And, like climate change, pandemic flu is so vast, it can be challenging to wrap your head around it.\n\nWhen most people hear \"flu,\" they typically think of seasonal flu. No doubt, seasonal flu can be deadly, especially for the very young and old, as well as those with compromised immune systems.\n\nFor most people, however, the seasonal flu virus, which mutates just a little bit every year, is not particularly severe because our immune systems have already probably seen a similar flu virus and thus know how to fight it. It's called native immunity or protection, and almost all of us have some degree of it.\n\nBabies are more vulnerable because they haven't been exposed to the seasonal flu and older people because their immune systems may not be functioning as well.\n\nPandemic flu is a different animal, and you should understand the difference.\n\nPan\u02c8demik/: pan means \"all\"; demic (or demographic) means \"people.\" It is well-named, because pandemic flu spreads easily throughout the world. Unlike seasonal flu, pandemics occur when a completely new or novel virus emerges. This sort of virus can emerge directly from animal reservoirs or be the result of a dramatic series of mutations -- so-called reassortment events -- in previously circulating viruses.\n\nIn either case, the result is something mankind has never seen before: a pathogen that can spread easily from person to defenseless person, our immune systems never primed to launch any sort of defense.\n\nOur only hope\n\nWith pandemic flu, we cannot solely rely on our bodies' ability to fight. A vaccine is our only real hope.\n\nThat fact is part of the reason the number 24 was stuck in my head as I served as an executive producer on the CNN original film \"Unseen Enemy.\" I have become convinced that if we can develop and deploy a pandemic flu vaccine just 24 weeks faster than is currently projected, the impact could change the course of human history.\n\nTwenty-four weeks faster could mean the difference between 20,000 people dying in the next flu pandemic or more than 20 million people dying.\n\nIn the 20th century alone, we experienced serious flu pandemics. The Spanish Flu of 1918 was an unprecedented catastrophe. Experts' best estimates (before there was more formal census and record-keeping) were that 20% to 40% of the world became ill and more than 50 million people died.\n\nIn the United States alone, approximately 675,000 people died in just the eight months between September 1918 and April 1919. Some people died the same day they became ill, and others died within a few days from complications of the flu, such as pneumonia or meningitis.\n\nForty years later, the Asian flu of 1958 and 1959 had a global death toll as high as 2 million and an estimated 70,000 of those in the US alone.\n\nEarly in 1968, the year before I was born, the Hong Kong flu began. By September, it made its way around the world, including the United States, and became widespread by December. It is believed that the number of those infected peaked during the fall, when kids were at school, transmitting the virus more freely.\n\nStill, as many as a million people died, 34,000 in the US alone between September 1968 and March 1969.\n\nWe are overdue\n\nWe have learned a lot over the past 100 years and are better prepared because of it. In the developed world, at least, we have the ability to ease suffering with antivirals, breathing machines and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.\n\nExperts can also more quickly characterize pathogens causing outbreaks. Although it took several years to identify the virus causing AIDS, for example, it took only a few weeks to identify the SARS virus.\n\nWe are also much faster at developing vaccines. According to research compiled by the science publication Mosaic , a typhoid vaccine was first tested in 1896 but only developed into a safe and effective vaccine nearly a hundred years later, in 1994. It took just 12 years, however, to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine (2003 to 2015).\n\nMost important, our production capabilities have increased tremendously around the world. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, we had the ability to make only 350 million doses of flu vaccine, but now, in theory, we could make 5.4 billion doses of flu vaccine if we harnessed and aligned manufacturing facilities all over the world.\n\n24 weeks faster?\n\nWould it ever be possible, however, to create and distribute a vaccine 24 weeks faster -- in six weeks instead of 30 weeks -- and save more than 20 million lives?\n\nFor starters, the way we typically make flu vaccine is still pretty antiquated and hasn't changed much in nearly 70 years.\n\nWe rely largely on hens' eggs to incubate and replicate the virus, which is too slow of a process to respond rapidly to pandemic flu.\n\nRichard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, told me that recent scientific advances, however, are fully transforming the speed at which vaccines can be developed and approved.\n\nGenomic techniques can be used to map the DNA or RNA of a new pathogen, genetically to engineer and mass-produce the same DNA or RNA and then inject it into the human body, leading to the production of antibodies to fight the virus. This method results in a new type of vaccine, a DNA vaccine.\n\nFaster development and production is one critical step to shortening the vaccine process by 24 weeks.\n\nAnother is more robust surveillance systems everywhere in the world. As we were reminded with Ebola and Zika, an infection anywhere can be an infection everywhere.\n\nThe first time an ill patient shows up at a hospital anywhere on the planet with a novel virus, the clock starts ticking.\n\nImproved surveillance means that hospital staff has to be astute enough to recognize that the patient doesn't fit the normal patterns we were taught in medical school and start to investigate further.\n\nAfter that, there has to be speedy and accurate identification of the virus, purification and sequencing of the genetic material and then immediate sharing of the knowledge (via the cloud) enabling researchers everywhere to get to work on the development of new vaccines. After this genetically engineered vaccine is developed, it would have to be manufactured in the billions and then distributed to every city in the world.\n\nTo make this a reality, it will take unprecedented partnerships between governments, even those at odds with each other.

You think 'I can add pronouns .' Then you think 'I can do more and more over time.' That's the rain drop that is going to become a huge, new ocean.\"\n\nHere are some small steps to make a workplace feel more welcoming to people of all backgrounds.\n\nDiversify your images\n\nEven something as seemingly small as an image on a company website can say a lot to employees.\n\nWithin the office, portraits of white male CEOs may line the halls . Or, on the website, photos may only show workers who fit a certain type.\n\nThese images surround employees, sending silent messages about who is valued at the company and who isn't.\n\nIt sounds obvious, but we hadn't been as intentional on our website and on our hiring website. Does that look like an inclusive group of people where someone who's thinking about applying could see someone who looks like them? That turns out to make a big difference.\" Josh Silverman, Etsy CEO\n\n\"It sounds obvious, but we hadn't been as intentional on our website and on our hiring website,\" Etsy CEO Josh Silverman says. \"Does that look like an inclusive group of people where someone who's thinking about applying could see someone who looks like them? That turns out to make a big difference.\"\n\nAsk these same questions about the company's social media use, says Lacey McLaughlin, CEO and cofounder of Flerish, a leadership development tool. The images and messages don't only affect followers and potential customers; they also send a signal to employees and job candidates.\n\n\"Does everyone look the same?\" McLaughlin says. \"Are we engaging in the types of activities that we see people doing out in the community? Are they diverse? If they're not diverse, what message is that sending?\"\n\nPublish your numbers\n\nBeing transparent about the process toward inclusion \u2014 both where the company is and where it's going \u2014 keeps employees in the loop.\n\nWhen Etsy published its most recent diversity and inclusion stats in August, the report also noted how those numbers changed since the previous year.\n\nMaking numbers like this public creates accountability, both within the company itself and also in the competitive field.\n\n\"Progress is baby steps,\" Masure says. \"We see that companies who do good stuff inspire other companies.\"\n\nShare your pronouns\n\nMasure recommends a very simple change, one that means a lot to members of the LGBTQ community: normalize pronoun usage for everyone, not just those who use \"they\" and \"them.\"\n\nAdd pronouns to email signatures. Ask for them in meetings. Update the \"team\" or \"people\" sections of the company website to include preferred pronouns alongside names and bios.\n\n\"That sends a huge signal that the company cares about inclusion,\" Masure says. \"It sends a big, big flag that something good is happening.\"\n\nShow up\n\nSometimes, the simplest thing to do is show up. When recruiting new talent, company leaders should reach outside their own networks to find people from other backgrounds. Dedicate time to researching which job fairs to attend and which employees to send.\n\n\"You're going out to a college recruiting event or you have an opportunity for a marketing and branding event \u2014 who is representing your organization?\" McLaughlin says. \"Who are you putting on stage? How does that align with what you're trying to do?\"\n\nSilverman says Etsy recruiters make a point to visit historically black colleges and universities.\n\n\"People appreciate the effort, the fact that we're making an investment in getting ourselves out there,\" he says. \"It makes a difference.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa campa\u00f1a de Scott ha declarado la victoria y cree que los resultados no cambiar\u00e1n\n\n(CNN) - \"Estamos procediendo a un recuento\", dijo el senador Bill Nelson en una breve declaraci\u00f3n esta ma\u00f1ana.

There were more than 150 statewide measures on ballots this midterm election , and several involved health-related issues such as taxes on feminine hygiene products, Medicaid expansion, abortion access and legalizing the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana. Based on the preliminary vote results, here's what some voters went for and what they rejected.\n\nAbortion\n\nAlabama's Amendment 2 adds language to the state Constitution to give a fetus the same rights as a human who has been born.\n\nAbortion rights supporters worry that the amendment could be used to criminalize some forms of in-vitro fertilization and contraception. There are also concerns that should the US Supreme Court end Roe v. Wade, this amendment would be a \"trigger ban,\" meaning abortion would be outlawed in some states.\n\nThis \"personhood\" ballot measure doesn't have exemptions like in other states' laws that carve out the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or danger to the life of the mother.\n\nWest Virginia's Amendment 1 narrowly passed . Also known as the No Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment, it explicitly states that its Constitution has nothing in it that \"secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\" Unlike Alabama's law, it has an exception for rape, incest, fetal anomaly or threats to the woman's life. It also restricts Medicaid funding for abortions.\n\nMarijuana\n\nAdult recreational users of weed will be able to use it legally in another state.\n\nAccording to preliminary results, more than 54% of voters i n Michigan said yes to the initiative that imposes a 10-ounce limit for Michigan residents, creates a state licensing system, will allow for retail sales subject to a 10% tax and changes several weed-related violations to civil infractions.\n\nThat makes 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Washington -- plus the District of Columbia that allow for recreational use.\n\nOther states' weed-related initiatives focused on medical marijuana; prior to the election, 31 states and the District of Columbia had laws that legalize or decriminalize it.\n\nMissouri had three medical marijuana initiatives on the ballot this year. Voters gave a definite yes to Amendment 2 , which legalizes medical marijuana, taxes it at 4% and guarantees that the money will be spent on health care services for veterans. Amendment 3 and Proposition C , which would also have legalized medical use but would have spent the tax revenue differently, failed.\n\nHealth care\n\nmostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase. Voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska mostly Republican-dominated states, voted yes to expand Medicaid eligibility to people under 65 whose income is 138% of the federal poverty level. In Utah, that expansion is going to be funded in part by a sales tax increase.\n\ndoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion. Montana voters appear to be rejecting Medicaid expansion, but they are still counting votes on this initiative. Montana's I-185 would have also raised taxes on tobacco products to help fund the expansion and other health care programs. The tobacco industry has spent millions in the state to fight the initiative since it would havedoubled the cigarette tax to pay for the state's portion of Medicaid expansion.\n\nOther health care initiatives were on the ballot in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada.\n\nauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Voters gave a resounding yes to California's Proposition 4 , which willauthorize $1.5 billion in bonds for children's hospitals. It was a closer vote, but they also said yes to Proposition 11 , which requires people who work on ambulances to stay on call during breaks and require employers to give EMTs and paramedics additional training and some paid mental health services.\n\nCalifornia voters rejected Proposition 8 , which would have required dialysis clinics to refund patients for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care.\n\nthe number of patients assigned to It appears that voters rejected Question 1 in Massachusetts that would have limitedthe number of patients assigned to registered nurses working in a hospital. The state has restrictions for intensive care units but not for any other part of the hospital.\n\nVoters seem to have said yes to Nevada's Question 4 , which requires the state legislature to remove taxes on durable medical equipment, oxygen equipment and mobility devices that are prescribed by a licensed provider. And early results are in favor of Nevada's Question 2 that removes sales tax from feminine hygiene products.\n\nOther health matters\n\nIn Massachusetts, preliminary voting results with Question 3 seem to suggest voters said yes to keeping a law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public places like restaurants, stores, hotels and hospitals. There's no federal law that provides such protections for people who identify as transgender.\n\nSome of the other ballot initiatives involved tax collection.\n\nMaine's Question 1 would have created a payroll tax and non-wage income tax that would fund a home health care program, but preliminary results show that it failed.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nrejected eliminated the option for a felony charge for the possession or use of drugs, would require the state to spend on programs that would include helping people get into drug treatment and rehabilitation programs, would create sentencing programs that involve drug rehab, and would prohibit courts from sending a person to prison for non-criminal probation violations.

Los dem\u00f3cratas limpiaron los suburbios, utilizando una brecha de g\u00e9nero masiva entre las mujeres para recuperar la mayor\u00eda que perdieron en 2010. En el Senado, la geograf\u00eda era el destino; el mapa estaba fuertemente inclinado hacia estados amigos de los republicanos donde el presidente Donald Trump segu\u00eda siendo popular, y el Partido Republicano obtuvo una serie de victorias en esos estados. Las carreras de los gobernadores produjeron una decisi\u00f3n dividida; los dem\u00f3cratas ganaron en Michigan, Illinois y, algo sorprendente, Kansas; los republicanos, sin embargo, ganaron los dos grandes premios en el mapa en Florida y Ohio.\n\nTodav\u00eda estamos revisando los datos y hay una serie de carreras que a\u00fan no est\u00e1n definidas. Pero sabemos mucho. Y aqu\u00ed est\u00e1n mis grandes conclusiones de otra noche incre\u00edble en la democracia estadounidense:\n\n1. El a\u00f1o de la mujer\n\nLos dem\u00f3cratas de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes hicieron una apuesta MASIVA a las mujeres en su plan para recuperar la mayor\u00eda. Docenas y docenas de candidatas dem\u00f3cratas se lanzaron a las carreras en todo el pa\u00eds. Los dem\u00f3cratas adaptaron gran parte de sus mensajes para enfocarse en los servicios de salud, los impuestos y las mujeres votantes, especialmente en los suburbios. Esa fue claramente la apuesta correcta. Las mujeres conformaron el 52% del electorado general, seg\u00fan las encuestas preliminares de salida, y se decidieron mayormente por los candidatos dem\u00f3cratas en lugar de los republicano. Seg\u00fan Dave Wasserman, del Cook Political Report, ahora habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s de 100 mujeres en la C\u00e1mara en 2019 por primera vez en la historia.\n\nSi esperas con ansias el 2020, los resultados del martes sugieren que una candidata dem\u00f3crata contra el presidente Donald Trump puede tener una gran ventaja.\n\nMIRA: Mujeres y comunidad LGBT hacen historia en las elecciones intermedias de EE.UU.\n\n2. Un refer\u00e9ndum de Trump\n\nEn los \u00faltimos d\u00edas de la campa\u00f1a, Trump cambi\u00f3 de opini\u00f3n varias veces sobre si esta elecci\u00f3n fue un refer\u00e9ndum sobre sus primeros dos a\u00f1os en el cargo. A veces, reconoci\u00f3 que era, al decirle a audiencias audaces que un voto para [poner aqu\u00ed nombre de republicano] era efectivamente un voto para \u00e9l. En otros casos, Trump trat\u00f3 de notar que su nombre no estaba en la boleta electoral y que no pod\u00eda ser considerado responsable por lo que le sucedi\u00f3 a los republicanos.\n\nEl sondeo de boca de urna sugiere que dos tercios de los votantes dijeron que su voto del martes fue para Trump, y m\u00e1s dijeron que vinieron a votar para mostrar oposici\u00f3n en lugar de apoyar al presidente; casi 4 de cada 10 votantes dijeron que su voto era una se\u00f1al de oposici\u00f3n a Trump.\n\nEso, por cierto, no es exclusivo de Trump. Las elecciones de medio t\u00e9rmino son casi siempre referendos sobre el presidente y su partido. Y casi siempre son referendos negativos. (A los estadounidenses les gusta el gobierno dividido). Es por eso que el partido del presidente no ha perdido esca\u00f1os en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes en solo tres ex\u00e1menes parciales desde la Guerra Civil. (\u00bfQu\u00e9 a\u00f1os fueron esos? 1934, 1998 y 2002).\n\nLas decisiones divididas (los dem\u00f3cratas ganan la mayor\u00eda de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, los republicanos mantienen el control del Senado) encajan en una elecci\u00f3n sobre Trump, el presidente m\u00e1s polarizador en la pol\u00edtica moderna. Los aliados de Trump insistir\u00e1n en que sin \u00e9l, los republicanos habr\u00edan perdido el Senado y la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. Los detractores de Trump, incluidos algunos republicanos, argumentar\u00e1n que Trump les cost\u00f3 cualquier oportunidad de mantener el control de la C\u00e1mara.\n\nMIRA: El triunfo dem\u00f3crata en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes servir\u00e1 de contrapeso de Trump\n\n3. Mitch McConnell sigue siendo el hombre m\u00e1s inteligente en la pol\u00edtica del Senado\n\nDurante un tiempo durante el verano, se habl\u00f3 de que los dem\u00f3cratas podr\u00edan ganar el Senado. McConnell nunca entr\u00f3 en p\u00e1nico, mantuvo a Trump a bordo y entreg\u00f3 la mercanc\u00eda, otra vez, el martes por la noche. Las victorias en Florida, Indiana, Dakota del Norte, junto con los republicanos que ocupan sus propios asientos en peligro en Tennessee y Texas, no solo mantuvieron al Senado en manos del Partido Republicano sino que ampliaron la mayor\u00eda del partido, d\u00e1ndoles un margen de maniobra en los duros votos en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os.\n\nEste fue un mapa (26 esca\u00f1os dem\u00f3cratas en comparaci\u00f3n con nueve para los republicanos) que los republicanos deber\u00edan haber capitalizado. Y aunque no dominaron \u2013Joe Manchin gan\u00f3 en Virginia Occidental\u2013 se hicieron con un ambiente nacional que claramente favorec\u00eda a los dem\u00f3cratas. Eso parec\u00eda poco probable hace tan solo un mes.\n\nMIRA: Trump tuitea sobre la \"gran victoria\" en las elecciones intermedias de EE.UU.\n\n4. Sherrod Brown es alguien que los dem\u00f3cratas deber\u00edan escuchar m\u00e1s\n\nEl senador dem\u00f3crata de Ohio lleg\u00f3 a un tercer mandato el martes por la noche contra un oponente cre\u00edble, el representante Jim Renacci, en un estado que Trump gan\u00f3 por ocho puntos hace dos a\u00f1os. Eso no atraer\u00e1 tanta atenci\u00f3n, pues nadie pens\u00f3 que Brown perder\u00eda, pero deber\u00eda hacerlo cuando el partido se enfoque en 2020. Recuerda que Trump es el presidente debido a los 80.000 votos en Wisconsin, Michigan y Pennsylvania. El Medio Oeste es, literalmente, donde construy\u00f3 su camino hacia la Casa Blanca y hacia donde mirar\u00e1 nuevamente en 2020.\n\n\"Dejen que nuestro pa\u00eds \u2013los ciudadanos de nuestra naci\u00f3n, nuestro Partido Dem\u00f3crata, mis colegas oficiales electos de todo el pa\u00eds\u2013 dejen que todos miren hacia el coraz\u00f3n, hacia el medio oeste industrial, hacia nuestro estado de los Grandes Lagos\", dijo Brown en su discurso de la victoria. \"Y le mostraremos a Estados Unidos c\u00f3mo celebramos el trabajo organizado y todos los trabajadores: la camarera en Dayton, el oficinista en Toledo, la enfermera en Columbus, el minero en Coshocton. Ese es el mensaje que sali\u00f3 de Ohio en 2018, y eso es todo. El modelo para nuestra naci\u00f3n en 2020 \".\n\nMIRA: Elecciones intermedias en EE.UU.: el Senado, bajo control republicano; la C\u00e1mara, dem\u00f3crata\n\n5. La carrera de 2020 comenz\u00f3 anoche\n\nHablando de 2020 y Brown, las f\u00e1ciles reelecciones de la senadora Kirsten Gillibrand y la senadora Amy Klobuchar casi seguramente servir\u00e1n de trampol\u00edn para las candidaturas presidenciales de 2020. Klobuchar ten\u00eda m\u00e1s 5 millones de d\u00f3lares en el banco a mediados de octubre, mientras que Gillibrand ten\u00eda 10,6 millones. Todo ese dinero podr\u00eda ser transferido directamente a una candidatura presidencial.\n\nEs probable que Klobuchar se posicione como alguien, como Brown, que ha demostrado su capacidad para postularse y ganar en el Medio Oeste, con una coalici\u00f3n que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los dem\u00f3cratas. Es probable que Gillibrand se defina como una guerrera liberal para las mujeres en el Senado y como alguien, que es de Nueva York, que sabe c\u00f3mo estar cara a cara con el actual presidente.\n\nMe sorprender\u00eda mucho si alguno de ellos NO se postula para presidente.\n\nMIRA: Senador latino retiene esca\u00f1o en Senado en EE.UU.\n\n6. Todas las grandes estrellas nacientes de los dem\u00f3cratas fueron eliminadas\n\nR\u00e1pido, nombra a los tres dem\u00f3cratas que se postularon para puestos estatales que los dem\u00f3cratas que no viv\u00edan en sus estados conoc\u00edan o se interesaban por sus resultados: Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams y Beto O'Rourke, \u00bfverdad? Bueno, Gillum perdi\u00f3 por poco. Abrams est\u00e1 perdiendo menos estrechamente. Y O'Rourke super\u00f3 a los dem\u00f3cratas en el pasado en Texas, pero igual perdi\u00f3.\n\nEso deja fuera a las tres mayores estrellas potenciales que salen de esta elecci\u00f3n para los dem\u00f3cratas. S\u00ed, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez gan\u00f3, pero todos sab\u00edamos que iba a hacerlo despu\u00e9s de vencer a Joe Crowley en una primaria en un distrito abrumadoramente dem\u00f3crata en la ciudad de Nueva York.\n\nLa pol\u00edtica aborrece el vac\u00edo, por lo que otros dem\u00f3cratas estrella en ascenso llenar\u00e1n el vac\u00edo dejado por las p\u00e9rdidas de Gillum, Abrams y O'Rourke. (Y vigila a O'Rourke. Podr\u00edas verlo tratando de usar su estrecha derrota como una forma de postularse para presidente en 2020).\n\n7. Los republicanos ganaron las carreras a gobernadores m\u00e1s grandes del pa\u00eds\n\nSi le preguntaras a los dem\u00f3cratas que iban a la noche del martes qu\u00e9 carrera de gobernadores quer\u00edan ganar m\u00e1s, probablemente nombrar\u00edan a Florida primero y luego a Ohio.

Bill Nelson called Wednesday for a recount in his race for re-election against Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nIn a statement from Nelson's office, the longtime incumbent said Scott had prematurely declared victory in the race, which CNN has not yet called.\n\nIn Florida, an automatic recount is triggered when the final margin is less than .5% and is not triggered by candidate requests. Votes were still being counted Wednesday morning, but Scott's lead was within that margin, according to CNN projections. The initial vote count won't be finalized until Saturday at noon.\n\nA spokesman for Scott chided Nelson over the request.\n\n\"This race is over. It's a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career,\" Chris Hartline said in a statement. \"He is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exists.\"\n\nRead More",

powers next year to reopen the House's Russia investigation, probe possible obstruction of justice and fight to ensure that special counsel Robert Mueller's findings are not hidden from the public.\n\nThe renewed focus in a Democratic-run House on the key elements of the special counsel's probe will play out as Democratic leaders will face pressures both internally and externally to launch proceedings to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and aides say planning is already underway for how they will use their committee powers \u2014 from hearings to subpoenas \u2014 to get the answers to their burning questions about matters ranging from Trump campaign contacts with Russian officials to the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. Potential probes into Russia and obstruction are just two of the numerous ways that Democrats are readying oversight of the Trump administration's actions as well as Trump's personal finances once they control the House.\n\nBut they aren't planning to come out guns blazing come January, they say, because many of their questions may already be answered by the special counsel probe.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, for instance, who is expected to become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, intends to wait to see what both Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee found before diving back into his panel's Russia investigation, according to a senior House Democratic aide.\n\n\"The idea is not to do a full-blown investigation again, but to fill in the information gaps that remain,\" the aide said.\n\nThe special counsel's investigation into Trump's team is believed to be nearing its conclusion, and activity is expected to ramp up after Mueller worked quietly ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe looming question is what Mueller's team concludes when it comes to the President himself, whose legal team is preparing written responses to Mueller's questions. Trump's lawyers have argued that a sitting President cannot be indicted, pointing to Justice Department regulations, and it's still unknown whether an in-person interview of Trump will happen.\n\nWhat this could mean for impeachment\n\nThe wild card for Democrats in their preparations for next year is they don't know yet when \u2014 and in what form \u2014 the special counsel will present his findings, which has them in a holding pattern as they anticipate the end of the Mueller probe could be near.\n\nWhen that end comes, the question will inevitably turn to impeachment, a topic Nancy Pelosi and other top House Democrats have strenuously avoided during the campaign. Democrats say they're cognizant of the fact there's a risk of overreaching with their investigations and an impeachment process that leads to the public to souring on them.\n\n\"Saying he ought to be impeached right now is not the model. If we do that, we will permanently alienate his base, who are fellow Americans who voted for him,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat. \"I hope people stop and realize impeachment is sort of the culmination of a process, not the beginning of a process. It also needs to be fact-based and thoroughly vetted, and involve bringing the public along, if it comes to that.\"\n\nPelosi said on \"PBS NewsHour\" Tuesday: \"For those who want impeachment, that's not what our caucus is about.\"\n\nOf course, there's a vocal wing of the Democratic Party that argues the President has already crossed the impeachment threshold, and a small band of House Democrats last year forced the House to take procedural votes on the matter. The impeachment question is likely to be one chasing Democratic presidential hopefuls onto the campaign trail while House Democrats debate the matter on Capitol Hill. CNN's exit polling Tuesday found 77% of self-identified Democrats supported impeachment.\n\n\"The question is, are you going to tell the truth or are you going to try to play a political game?\" Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic donor who has called for Trump's impeachment, said in an interview. \"They're looking at it in the framework of the next political election. We're saying this is a matter of right and wrong for the country.\"\n\nAny impeachment process is likely to be led by New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the expected chair of the House Judiciary Committee in charge of impeachment. In the run-up to the midterms, Nadler has mostly avoided the topic.\n\n\"I think it's way too early to talk about impeachment,\" Nadler told CNN. \"We have to see what the Mueller investigation comes up with.\"\n\nThere are still open questions, Nadler said, about whether Trump colluded with the Russians or obstructed justice. \"If there are no longer open questions, then we will have to make judgment and we will go from there,\" he said.\n\nThe Mueller factor\n\nDemocrats are looking to Mueller's findings as a jumping off point for Russia, obstruction of justice and possibly impeachment.\n\nBut there's no guarantee they'll even learn what the special counsel has uncovered.\n\nThere's nothing in Justice Department regulations that requires Mueller to present his conclusions to Congress or the public, and Democrats are already preparing to fight any attempts to keep his findings hidden.\n\nThey also are watching for what could be a more central threat to the Mueller investigation: the departure of either Attorney General Jeff Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises the Mueller probe with Sessions recused.\n\nNadler said that if the President tries to interfere with the Mueller probe, his committee will try to protect the special counsel's inquiry and push the administration to preserve the records.\n\nAttorneys who have dealt with Mueller's investigators and other officials expect that the special counsel's efforts will include a report outlining what Mueller's investigators decided to prosecute and what they declined.\n\n\"I expect his report based on his investigation will be more thorough and also broader in scope than what the Congress has done,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat. \"And it could \u2014 we don't know what will be in there \u2014 lead the Congress to have other questions about the information that's presented.\"\n\nNot being 'Benghazi-like'\n\nDemocrats on multiple congressional panels, including the Judiciary, Intelligence and Oversight committees, could play a role in reacting to whatever Mueller has uncovered. Congressional aides say it will be important politically for the speaker to coordinate so the committees aren't fighting to get the same information and witnesses.\n\n\"What's important to me is that people know it's not the Democrats frothing to be Benghazi-like,\" said Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, referencing the GOP-led investigation into the 2012 terrorist attack that Democrats say was a political attack on Hillary Clinton. \"We'll see what (Mueller) does, how he is treated, and that'll tell us what we have left to do.\"\n\nPolitically, Trump campaigned during the midterms on the idea that Democrats would try to impeach him, and there's concern among some Democrats that impeachment could be politically helpful to Trump in 2020 \u2014 he'd claim he's the victim, that his political enemies were abusing their power to attack him.\n\nWhile Democrats could impeach Trump with a majority, it would require two thirds of the Senate to remove him from office.\n\n\"America saw how divisive impeachment was when the Republicans impeached Bill Clinton for telling one lie,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat. \"I detect no bloodlust for impeachment on the Democratic side. ... (But) I do think all of us take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and high crimes and misdemeanors are not something that can be swept under the rug.\"\n\nInvestigative blueprints\n\nTop Democrats on multiple congressional committees laid out their investigative road maps through the dozens of letters sent to GOP committee chairmen over the past two years with requests for interviews, hearings and subpoenas.\n\nSchiff may have crafted the most comprehensive blueprint when Republicans ended their Russia investigation in March, releasing a 21-page status report with more than 60 witnesses, document requests and subpoenas he wanted to pursue to finish the investigation.\n\nPursing all those leads isn't the Democrats' plan in January, because much of that work may have already been completed elsewhere, aides and lawmakers say. Schiff has said he wants a primary focus as chairman to be restoring comity and credibility on the Intelligence Committee after the Russia probe bitterly divided the panel.\n\nBut the California Democrat has hinted at some areas of the Russia matter that he may address.\n\n\"The question, though, that I don't know whether Mueller has been able to answer, because I don't know whether he's been given the license to look into it, is were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization?\" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last month. \"That will be a very high priority to get an answer to.\"\n\nIn addition to Russian money laundering, the committee may probe Trump's financial relationship with Deutsche Bank, social media interference, GOP operative Peter Smith's hunt for Hillary Clinton's emails and who Donald Trump Jr. called in between his calls setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with pop star Emin Agalarov, the Democratic aide said.\n\n\"I don't believe in overkill, I don't believe in fighting just for the sake of fighting,\" Castro said. \"But I do want to make sure we give the American people the investigation they deserve, get the answers they deserve.\"", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump offered outward optimism Wednesday at his party's electoral successes, a cheeriness that was later belied by surly, combative exchanges with reporters over the dark tone he adopted in the midterms' closing days.\n\nIn a post-election news conference, a weary-seeming President ticked through his party's wins, characterizing an expanded majority in the Senate as a history-defying feat of political prowess. He shrugged off new threats from Democrats, who will assume control of the House with new investigative power.\n\nBut when the questions started coming, the President's sunny outlook melted away. He lashed out at questions about his fear-mongering and race-baiting rhetoric against immigrants, and demanded a reporter inquiring about voter suppression take her seat.\n\nHe went back and forth on his opinion of the newly powerful Democrats, alternately vowing to find areas of cooperation and threatening them with investigations of his own. He vowed a \"warlike posture\" should he find himself barraged with subpoenas.\n\n\"Almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they've been giving us this investigation fatigue,\" Trump said. \"They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate, and a lot of very questionable things were done.\"\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Connecticut Democrat Ned Lamont has won the governor's race, CNN projects.\n\nCNN was projecting a narrow victory for Lamont, who founded a cable company , early Wednesday morning. His Republican opponent, Bob Stefanowski, conceded in a statement and said he wished Lamont and Connecticut \"success over these next four years.\"\n\nStefanowski, a former executive at General Electric who campaigned on the platform that his business experience could help him solve the state's budget issues, said he was glad his campaign could \"draw so much attention to the tax burden in this state.\"\n\n\"I have learned a lot over the course of this campaign, but the biggest takeaway for me has been the realization that (Connecticut) is one big family,\" he said. \"That won't end with the campaign.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nThere was something for everyone in Tuesday's fascinating midterm election, but for investors there was one major theme: President Trump's economic agenda \u2014 tax cuts and deregulation \u2014 will stay firmly in place for the next two years.\n\nIt's highly unlikely he will get any new proposals through the House, now controlled by Democrats. It's virtually certain that he can't get more tax reduction, as he and House Republicans have proposed. There could be progress toward an infrastructure bill, but the details will be challenging.\n\nSo it looks like there will be gridlock in Washington for the next two years, but the financial markets can live with that \u2014 even if there's no significant progress in reducing budget deficits, which are headed higher. The key legislative factor will be Trump's veto, which looks solid; if Democrats try to pass legislation to kill his tax cuts or raise the minimum wage, the firewall against those bills will be Trump's veto pen and the solidly Republican Senate.\n\nJUST WATCHED Where the House and Senate stand now Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Where the House and Senate stand now 03:14\n\nThis doesn't mean that Washington will be boring in the next two years \u2014 far from it. In just the next few weeks there will be several major developments: a likely interest rate hike in December from the Fed; a meeting between presidents Trump and Xi Jinping of China; another budget fight over a wall with Mexico; and a major exodus from the White House, as Trump staffers move on.\n\nAnd only in Washington could the next election come into focus just days after the past one. We I expect several Democrats to announce they're forming exploratory committees in the next few weeks. Joe Biden is the nominal favorite Trump challenger based on early polls, but at least a dozen strong candidates will emerge.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

"Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Ethics and Political Values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently \" Stokely: A Life .\" The views expressed here are his.\n\n(CNN) Although Andrew Gillum lost the governor's race in Florida and Stacey Abrams is behind but may yet force a runoff in another close contest in Georgia, the two candidates offered a blueprint for how progressive Democrats can win both statewide and national elections.\n\nGillum and Abrams represented a new generation of Democratic politicians, who better reflect the party's multiracial base , its reliance on black women voters and its ability to appeal to millennials and baby boomers by advocating policy issues such as free college tuition and Medicare for all.\n\nFor many Americans, Tuesday's midterm elections served as battleground in a larger political war over the soul of the nation. Nationally, both races were a referendum on Donald Trump's toxic impact on American political culture . Trump, of course, made both races about him, treating the Republican candidates, Ron DeSantis in Florida and Brian Kemp in Georgia, as handpicked surrogates.\n\nTrump played to his base by exploiting racial fears about immigration, the prospect of Florida and Georgia electing their first black governors, and anxieties over the perceived loss of white privilege.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams should be proud of the campaigns they ran, which harkened back to the idea of E pluribus unum: \"Out of many, one.\"\n\nGillum and Abrams took a page out of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s notion of a \"beloved community\" by arguing that America's strength resided in its increasingly diverse population.\n\nAt the same time, they both personified a generation of relatively young politicians attuned to the deep racial, social and economic divisions that have only increased against the backdrop of the Trump presidency.\n\nOn this score, they ran as unapologetic progressives in deep red states, trying to shatter the racial glass ceiling that has witnessed only two black governors -- Virginia's Doug Wilder in 1989 and Massachusetts' Deval Patrick in 2006 -- ever elected in American history.\n\nGillum, who lost by less than 1%, proved that a black, progressive Democrat could almost win in a state where the President owns a home and that voted for Trump in 2016.\n\nJUST WATCHED Abrams vows to remain in gubernatorial race Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Abrams vows to remain in gubernatorial race 01:50\n\nAbrams performed honorably , her nomination and campaign a testament to the millions of black women voters whom the Democratic Party has increasingly relied on to win elections (most recently the special Senate election in Alabama), but slow to embrace as political candidates in municipal, statewide and national elections.\n\nIn the following weeks we will be able to better parse out the specific reasons for the results in Florida and Georgia, but voter suppression will be surely atop the list.\n\nThe Republican Party in Florida and Georgia used the demise of the enforcement section of the Voting Rights Act after the 2013 Supreme Court Shelby v. Holder decision to make it harder for Democratic-leaning constituencies to votes -- especially, but not exclusively, people of color and the young.\n\nFlorida's DeSantis took a cue from Trump's playbook and warned Gillum not to \"monkey the race up\" in a naked display of race baiting.\n\nKemp, Georgia's secretary of state, led what amounted to a coordinated effort to purge blacks from the voter rolls, spread false rumors that Abrams encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote and appeared in an ad before the primary election loading a rifle to prove his National Rifle Association bona fides.\n\nWhile Democrats must surely be disappointed, both states offer a blueprint for turning red states blue in 2020 and beyond.\n\nHistorically red states such as Florida, Georgia and Texas (where US Rep. Beto O'Rourke ran a surprisingly robust campaign in defeat against incumbent Ted Cruz) are trending Democratic, buoyed by an infusion of voters who are younger, more liberal, racially diverse and politically progressive than ever before.\n\nWe can take three preliminary lessons from Tuesday night's elections, with Democrats projected to control the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years but underperforming in senatorial races (where Senate Democrats had 26 seats up for grabs to the GOP's nine).\n\nJUST WATCHED How 2018 midterms compare to past elections Replay More Videos ...

Millions of Americans remain locked out of participating in our political system through no fault of their own. There is no federal system of nationwide voter registration, which is left to the purview of states.\n\nThe idea that demography is destiny -- that the browning of America would fundamentally change our democracy -- continues to be delayed through voter suppression tactics that include reducing the number of polling places in majority-minority precincts, curbing or eliminating early voting, introducing burdensome ID requirements that privilege gun licenses over college IDs.\n\nAll of these measures add up to a modern-day poll tax inspired by the Jim Crow era's efforts to preclude all Americans from voting.\n\nThe Obama coalition is alive, well and growing. Nationally, the Latino vote came out in higher numbers than ever for a midterm election, and the black vote proved robust as well.\n\nYoung and first-time voters came out nationally in droves. Gillum came the closest to knitting together the kind of multiracial political coalition that twice elected the nation's first black President, Barack Obama. But Abrams and O'Rourke each shone brightly.\n\nOvert racism, once thought to have been eradicated from our post-civil rights body politic, is back with a vengeance in American politics. From racist calls targeting Abrams to Trump's characterization of Gillum as a \"thief\" and his astonishingly wrongheaded efforts to link Democrats to caravans of undocumented immigrants via an ad reminiscent of Willie Horton, racial prejudice and nativism fueled the GOP firewall.\n\nYet there is ample reason to consider Tuesday's results a victory for America that goes beyond party or ideology. A new generation of progressive Democrats, led by women of color such Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, arrived on the national scene in both victory and defeat. Colorado elected the nation's first openly gay governor in Jared Polis, and Rachael Rollins became the first African-American woman elected to district attorney in Suffolk County, Massachusetts (Boston).\n\nProgressive Democrats, especially women and people of color, made history in victory and defeat. Tuesday night's winners will immediately change the makeup of representation in our democracy.\n\nThose who lost may well have a deeper, long-term impact by transforming the national political trajectory of the Democratic Party. In a series of close defeats, the party of the New Deal and Great Society that has, over the last several decades (and despite the rise of Obama) lost its identity, finally found its voice again.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEn seis estados se vot\u00f3 sobre la legalizaci\u00f3n de la marihuana recreativa o medicinal\n\nSeis estados aprobaron protecciones espec\u00edficas para v\u00edctimas del crimen y los procedimientos judiciales\n\nLos votantes de Alabama y Virginia Occidental votaron para que no se financien los abortos con fondos p\u00fablicos y se proteja la vida del no nacido\n\n(CNN) - Las elecciones intermedias no solo fueron una oportunidad para cambiar la cara del Congreso y las C\u00e1maras locales en todo el pa\u00eds.

To do that, the coffee company is making some changes.\n\nAfter years of aggressive growth, the coffee company has locations all over the world. But now, CEO Kevin Johnson wants to focus on growing in the two coffee-loving countries where it thinks its efforts will pay off the most.\n\nTo drive that growth, Starbucks freed up cash and resources by closing its Teavana retail stores, partnering with Nestle to create a \"global coffee alliance\" and reorganizing its corporate team.\n\n\"I tend to bring a much more disciplined approach to picking the priorities,\" Johnson said during the Oppenheimer Consumer Conference in June. \"If you pick the right priorities and you put the resources and energy behind them, you move the needle.\"\n\nSince taking over from Howard Schultz in April of last year, Johnson has outlined a plan to trim fat and bolster the company in its two largest markets. So far, it's working.\n\nStarbucks ( SBUX ) beat Wall Street's expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings . Revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter that ended in September, up 11% from the same time last year. In the three months ending in September, comparable store sales grew by 4% in the United States and 1% in China. The good results sent shares of the company soaring.\n\nRecently, Starbucks announced that it is handing over the ownership and management of its stores in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Luxembourg to its partner Alsea, which operates restaurants in Latin America.\n\nThe decision to step back from those markets in Western Europe may have been driven by how competitive the market is there, said Robert Salomon, a professor of international management at NYU's Stern business school.\n\n\"It's very difficult for them to enter with a proposition to say 'Hey, we're the espresso coffee company,'\" he noted. But in China, Starbucks can set itself up as a coffee destination.\n\nStarbucks wants to be big in China. NICOLAS ASFOURI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStarbucks opened its first store in China in 1999. \"They are certainly ahead of the curve,\" he said.\n\nBut Starbucks has only recently decided to lean into the Chinese market. That may be because now, Chinese customers may be more amenable to what Starbucks has to offer, Saloman said. Today, consumers in China have an \"increasing affinity for Western goods, especially more luxury goods,\" said Saloman. \"Starbucks has that high-end appeal, so they're capitalizing on that trend.\"\n\nTo build up its presence in China, Starbucks is opening stores at a rapid pace . The company said in May that it plans to nearly double its number of coffee shops to 6,000 before the end of 2022. And it's making sure that people who don't come into stores have easy access to Starbucks coffee: Over the past few months, Starbucks has been steadily building up its delivery capabilities in the country.\n\nJohnson said during the Oppenheimer conference that he plans to introduce Starbucks coffee to a whole new generation of coffee drinkers in China.\n\nThe efforts are paying off. \"Results in China are extraordinary,\" noted Nick Setyan, a restaurant analyst with Wedbush.\n\nBut China isn't a sure bet, Saloman said. If political ties worsen, or if China's economy takes a hit and people have less disposable income, customers may take their business elsewhere.\n\n\"China presents a tremendous amount of risk, but also a lot of upside potential,\" Saloman said.

He is the co-founder of #cut50, a national, bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. The views expressed here are solely his.\n\n(CNN) In this election, we witnessed the end of two years of one-party rule and the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the deep South to the Midwest.\n\nWe can debate whether it was a Blue Wave . But in the US House of Representatives, at least, the popular vote margin -- at more than nine percentage points -- was larger than in the Newt Gingrich wave of 1994 and the Tea Party wave of 2014.\n\nI call this torrent of inclusive populism \"The Rainbow Wave.\" Here is why I am excited about this peek into the future of our nation and the Democratic Party:\n\nMichigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, both Democrats, will be the first Muslim women in the House of Representatives. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, also Democrats, will be the first Native American women in the House of Representatives. Colorado Democrat Jared Polis will be the nation's first openly gay governor. Sharice Davids, mentioned above, is also part of the LGBT community. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema still stands a chance of being the first openly bisexual senator. Ayanna Pressley will become the first black woman to represent Massachusetts in the House of Representatives, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest ever member of Congress. Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia will be the first Latinas from Texas in the House of Representatives. Stacey Abrams, a black woman in the heart of the old Confederacy, conceivably has forced a runoff against Brian Kemp. She did this despite long lines, non-functioning polling machines, purged voters and other hallmarks of voter suppression. A bipartisan effort led to Florida voters striking down a Jim Crow-era law that barred convicted felons from voting for life. Thanks to the passage of Amendment 4, 1.5 million people who have paid their debt to society will now regain the right to vote. Democrats retook the Midwest. After Trump's shocking wins in places like Wisconsin, few suspected Democrats would win governorships and hold Senate seats in places like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. 115 women won national office, as of the last count. 42 are women of color. And four so far are veterans. All notable increases over the previous Congress. Florida's Andrew Gillum came closer to winning his race for governor than did the Democrat in traditional swing state Ohio. I will admit it was a heartbreaking loss. Combined with US Senate defeats, I was feeling sad earlier in the evening. But reflecting on two black progressives being competitive in the former Confederacy gives me hope for the future of these rapidly changing states. Campaigns like those of Gillum, Abrams and Beto O'Rourke demonstrated that knocking on doors and talking to neighbors matters more than television ads -- and refusing corporate cash is wildly popular. Democrats can learn key lessons from their strengths even in defeat. Ballot initiatives. Voters in Utah, Idaho and Nebraska voted to expand Medicaid. Michigan legalized marijuana. Nebraska and Missouri raised the minimum wage. On criminal justice, Amendment 11 in Florida will make reforms retroactive, Louisiana now requires unanimous jury verdicts in felony cases, and Colorado voters abolished unpaid prison labor. The grassroots energy paid off. All of the hard work calling and texting and talking to friends and neighbors -- from groups like Win Justice, the Working Families Party, the Movement Voter Project and the Black Voters Matter Fund -- produced a popular vote margin for the US House that is bigger than the 2006, 2010, and 2014 waves. Only gerrymandering kept our Rainbow Wave from giving us even more seats. Democrats are positioned to hold Trump accountable. That means investigations into unconscionable policies like tearing children away from their parents at the borders. It also means learning how much he is personally profiting from the presidency. Democrats can call Trump's bluff. Under a Republican Congress, Trump could claim to support raising the minimum wage or cracking down on pharmaceutical companies but never had to walk the walk. Now he will have nowhere to hide. Nothing on the list above would have happened without the youth. Young people registered and voted in record numbers -- in some states doubling 2014 numbers. They waited in ridiculous lines and struggled with deliberate voter suppression (both problems it is time to solve). Their hard work paid off; the most diverse generation in American history sees voting as one of many tools and declared themselves ready to use it to transform America.\n\nBlue Wave or not -- it for sure was a Rainbow Wave.", "Counselor to President Donald Trump Kellyanne Conway would not say whether the President will continue to call the press \"the enemy of the people.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

There, prevalence among girls up to 14 years old dropped from 71.4% in 1995 to 8% in 2016.\n\nTraditionally, rates have been high in East African nations, such as Somalia , where 98% of women between the ages of 15 and 49 have been cut, according to UN figures.\n\nThe decline has been \"much slower\" in West and North Africa but is still significant, said the report's authors, a team of UK and South African researchers led by Ngianga-Bakwin Kandala, professor of biostatistics at Britain's Northumbria University.\n\nIn North Africa, the percentage of girls undergoing FGM dropped from 57.7% to 14.1% between 1990 and 2015, according to the report. Meanwhile, in West Africa, the prevalence of the practice fell from 73.6% in 1996 to 25.4% in 2017.\n\nIn two countries in the Middle East covered by the data, Iraq and Yemen, the rate of FGM has actually increased since 1997, the report said.\n\nThe report drew on data gathered between 1990 and 2017 covering nearly 210,000 girls from 14 up, from 29 countries.\n\n\"There is evidence of huge and significant decline in the prevalence of FGM/C among children across countries and regions,\" the report's authors wrote.\n\n\"There is a need to sustain comprehensive intervention efforts. In addition, further targeted, culturally sensitive policy interventions and other effective strategies for preventing FGM/C should be a major public health priority in countries and regions still showing high prevalence of FGM/C among children, where the practice is still pervasive.\"\n\nFemale genital mutilation involves the altering or removing of the female genitals, such as the clitoris or labia. The procedure can cause severe bleeding and health issues including infections and infertility, as well as complications in childbirth.\n\nAccording to United Nations statistics , at least 200 million girls and women across 30 countries are today affected by the practice, which is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women.\n\nThe report's authors note that while the significant overall decline points toward the success of national and international investment and intervention over the past three decades, certain risk factors still prevail and could lead to a reversal in the trend in some countries.\n\n\"These risk factors include lack of, or poor education, poverty and continued perception of FGM/C as a potential marriage market activity,\" the report said.\n\nThe study is, however, observational and survey data relied on personal contributions often affected by illiteracy, poverty and cultural sensitivities, the report points out.\n\nFurther efforts are needed if the goal of eliminating the practice completely is to be reached, it said, including through legislation, advocacy and education.\n\nPartnerships with religious and community leaders, young people and health workers may be needed to come up with \"more culturally-sensitive and community-engaging strategies\" to drive the practice downward, the authors suggest.\n\nThe report notes that while female genital mutilation is most prevalent in Africa and some Middle Eastern regions, research shows that the practice also exists elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East. It is reported in Europe, North and South America too, particularly as a result of migration.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa esposa fue hallada en una tumba superficial y las ni\u00f1as en unos dep\u00f3sitos de petr\u00f3leo\n\nWatts ser\u00e1 sentenciado el 19 de noviembre y se enfrenta a cadena perpetua\n\n(CNN) - Un hombre de Colorado, que mat\u00f3 a su esposa embarazada y a sus dos peque\u00f1as hijas, se declar\u00f3 culpable este martes como parte de un acuerdo que le permitir\u00e1 evitar la pena de muerte, dijo el fiscal de distrito del condado de Weld, Michael Rourke.\n\nChris Watts, de 33 a\u00f1os, se declar\u00f3 culpable de los nueve cargos que enfrent\u00f3, incluyendo asesinato y terminaci\u00f3n ilegal de un embarazo, por los asesinatos en agosto de su esposa, Shanann, quien fue encontrada en una tumba poco profunda, y sus dos hijas, Bella (4 a\u00f1os) y Celeste (3), cuyos restos fueron hallados en tanques de combustible.\n\n\"Solo puedo decir que espero que haya una sensaci\u00f3n de cierre [para los familiares de los fallecidos]\", dijo Rourke a los periodistas. \"S\u00e9 que eso nunca se har\u00e1 realidad porque, obviamente, la tragedia que se nos presenta hoy es la p\u00e9rdida de cuatro vidas hermosas\", continu\u00f3.\n\nLEE: ADN en una servilleta usada ayuda a resolver un caso de asesinato 32 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s\n\nWatts ser\u00e1 sentenciado el 19 de noviembre y se enfrenta a cadena perpetua.

Los viajeros con un presupuesto reducido que quieran quedarse en la ciudad probablemente terminar\u00e1n en la calle llena de hostales llamada Salta.\n\nAunque la mayor\u00eda de las opciones de presupuesto en la ciudad ofrecen la misma experiencia gen\u00e9rica, el albergue Periko's, en la calle Morales, es la mejor opci\u00f3n.\n\nEl alojamiento puede ser sencillo, pero est\u00e1 a solo 300 metros del centro de la ciudad y a cuatro kil\u00f3metros de la principal terminal de autobuses de larga distancia. Est\u00e1 compuesto por anfitriones genuinamente c\u00e1lidos que pueden ayudar a los hu\u00e9spedes a garantizar el traslado tanto al Cerro Catedral para esquiar como al comienzo del famoso Frey Trek.\n\nLas familias que viajan con ni\u00f1os deben visitar Villa Huanid. A solo dos kil\u00f3metros del centro de la ciudad, este complejo hotelero est\u00e1 ubicado en lo alto de una colina, ofreciendo vistas privilegiadas del lago desde todas partes.\n\nHay tres opciones para elegir aqu\u00ed: el complejo de Pioneros, m\u00e1s asequible; el complejo de Bustillo, un poco m\u00e1s exclusivo (pero nunca pretencioso); y caba\u00f1as privadas con mucho espacio verde para que los ni\u00f1os corran.

Si bien las cervezas artesanales recientemente han alcanzado una gran popularidad en Argentina, Blest estaba muy adelantada a los tiempos en que comenz\u00f3 a hacer cerveza aqu\u00ed, hace 30 a\u00f1os.\n\nLas porciones de comida aqu\u00ed son generosas (la hamburguesa de cordero y las fajitas son notables). Los nuevos visitantes deben probar una degustaci\u00f3n de muestra para conocer varias cervezas, entre ellas, Pilsen, Cream Stout, Scotch Ale, sidra y una deliciosa IPA. Blest tambi\u00e9n ofrece algunas cervezas regionales especiales, como la cerveza Honey Queen y una cerveza de frambuesa ligeramente \u00e1cida, ambas con ingredientes frescos de la zona.\n\nNo es ning\u00fan secreto que Argentina ama su carne a la parrilla. Para probar lo mejor del asado de Bariloche, Alto el Fuego es un encantador y acogedor restaurante familiar ubicado en una adorable casa antigua cerca del Centro C\u00edvico.\n\nEn la planta baja hay una formidable bodega de vinos que contiene algunos vinos muy por debajo del radar, y uno de los due\u00f1os hace todos los postres caseros desde cero y los presenta en lindos frascos Mason.\n\nUbicado a pocos kil\u00f3metros de Bariloche en Dina Huapi, Almazen de Sabores sirve comida argentina cl\u00e1sica con un toque moderno: piense en un bistec al curry rojo y una bruschetta de cerdo y verdura patag\u00f3nica estofada.\n\nButterfly es posiblemente el restaurante gourmet m\u00e1s famoso de Bariloche y cualquier amante de la gastronom\u00eda debe probar este lugar cuando est\u00e9 en la ciudad. El interior de dise\u00f1o impecable es a la vez hogare\u00f1o y moderno, con una chimenea y enormes ventanas con vista al lago Nahuel Huapi. Solo hay un pu\u00f1ado de mesas, lo que hace que tener una reserva sea una necesidad.\n\n(Una nota sobre los precios: Argentina tiene una de las tasas de inflaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s altas del mundo y los precios pueden variar enormemente.

Hide Caption 27 of 27\n\nFollowing Boeing's bulletin, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced on Wednesday it would issue an airworthiness directive to Boeing 737 MAX 8 crews if they experience the same problems that brought down Lion Air Flight 610.\n\nIn a statement it said, \"The FAA has alerted affected domestic carriers and foreign airworthiness authorities who oversee air carriers who use the 737 MAX.\"\n\nThe FAA directive does not acknowledge an issue with the entire fleet of 737 MAX 8 airplanes -- the same model as Flight 610 -- and there have been no reported comparable issues in the US.\n\nProblems on the last four flights\n\nThe Boeing statement comes amid a number of significant developments in the investigation into the fatal airline disaster, following the discovery of Flight 610's flight data recorder last Thursday.\n\nInvestigators who analyzed the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) after the October 29 crash uncovered the issue, said Tjahjono. The finding is the first technical problem revealed as part of the investigation into why the plane crashed.\n\n\"We are formulating, with the NTSB (US National Transportation Safety Board) and Boeing, detailed inspections regarding the airspeed indicator,\" said Tjahjono, on Tuesday.\n\nLion Air Group Managing Director Captain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi told CNN on Wednesday that Lion Air strictly follow Boeing's guidance for operating the 737 MAX 8s, as laid out in the maintenance manual book.\n\n\"Pilots write in the logbook about the problem they had in the flight, then our technicians fix it and write (what) they did in the logbook,\" said the managing director, adding that technical conversations between pilot and technician regarding the aircraft are written and signed in a document called the Aircraft Flight and Maintenance Log.\n\nHowever, analysts have asked why the plane wasn't grounded earlier, when the problem with the air speed indicator issue first surfaced.\n\n\"The question is why wasn't this plane pulled from service and the problem system removed,\" said Geoffrey Thomas.\n\nLion Air Group's managing director told CNN that Boeing's maintenance manual does not provide instructions to ground the aircraft, even if they encounter a repeated problem.\n\n\"As long as we fixed the problem and the technician declares that aircraft is safe to fly, the pilot will fly the aircraft, because that means the aircraft is safe to fly,\" said Captain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi.\n\nPlane was intact when it crashed, investigators say\n\nLion Air Flight 610 was intact with its engines running when it crashed at high speed into the Java Sea, Tjahjono said Monday.\n\nTjahjono said that due to the small size of the debris found and loss of the plane's engine blades, investigators determined that Flight 610 did not explode in the air, but was in \"good shape\" before it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff.\n\nSome of the families of the victims aboard Flight 610 were taken by boat to the crash site location on Tuesday to pray for their loved ones and view the recovery process in-person, Muhammad Syaugi, head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency said.\n\nHe said that his team was still working to locate the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which he believes is buried under the deep mud.\n\nAfter initially hearing a \"ping\" from the CVR on Saturday, diving teams could no longer hear a signal from the device.\n\nMeanwhile, the plane's other black box, the flight data recorder, was located Thursday, and investigators said it showed Flight 610 had performed 19 flights -- including its final flight.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

del Carmen, Mexico (CNN) \u2014 I wanted to take my family on a relaxing vacation. Note that I didn't say an exciting vacation, or a mind-broadening one. I just wanted something easy.\n\nWe live in New Jersey, where it's been rainy and snowy and cold for about 37 years now, so somewhere warm, with sun, water and alcohol would be ideal.\n\nI have some rules about relaxing vacation destinations . First off, I'm only taking one plane there -- no connections. Second, I'm spending, max, four hours on that plane. Third, I'm not spanning a fistful of time zones to get where I'm going.\n\nI want to go somewhere hot, particularly from October through April. Not warm, not balmy -- H.O.T. I don't play golf, so a nice 70-degree day does nothing for me. It's gotta be at least 80 degrees, or I walk. I want it to be hot enough that jumping in a pool or ocean isn't even a discussion.\n\nAnd I want my hotel to be no more than 45 minutes from the airport. I didn't fly for hours to then spend more hours in a backseat.\n\nWith all these factors in mind, Mexico becomes a leading candidate. And among the many places in Mexico you could choose, you can't really do much better than Mayakoba.\n\nResort heaven\n\nMayakoba is a 500+ acre development about 35 minutes south of Cancun in the city of Playa del Carmen. On one side of Mayakoba is the Caribbean Sea, on the other, a series of lagoons and canals wend their way through mangrove forests.\n\nMayakoba got its start about 20 years ago, when a Spanish construction firm purchased the undeveloped land. In the intervening years, an ambitious program of terraforming has taken place.\n\nWith careful attention paid to the existing plant and animal life, underground rivers were opened up, creating a system of canals; trees and plants were removed, roots and all, and replanted in new locations; wildlife was reintroduced to the area and thousands of feet of beach was reclaimed.\n\nFairmont Mayakoba has a selection of beachfront casitas in addition to its lagoon-side offerings. Courtesy Fairmont Mayakoba\n\nAnd the firm built four hotels there: The Andaz, Banyan Tree, Fairmont and Rosewood resorts. Each has its own property and style, but there is an underlying connectedness to them.\n\nThey all have neighboring beaches; transportation between the hotels is easy and frequent; and guests can charge any hotel's restaurant back to their room, regardless of where they're staying.\n\nMayakoba also has an 18-hole, Greg Norman-designed golf course, a special-events venue for weddings and such and an EPCOT-style traditional Mexican town square with additional shops and restaurants.\n\nAll four hotels share a similar layout. Due to protected mangrove forests just inland from the beach, each hotel is split between two areas: beachfront and lagoon.\n\nRosewood Mayakoba and the other resorts are connected by a network of canals and lagoons. Durston Saylor\n\nAll the resorts have at least one restaurant and swimming pool by the beach, along with rooms and suites. Over on the lagoon side is each hotel's entrance, more restaurants, a pool and additional guest rooms.\n\nGetting from the lagoon to the beach (and vice versa) can be accomplished in three ways: on foot; using one of the many bikes available at each resort (at some of the hotels, bikes are assigned to your room; at others, there's a hotel-wide bikeshare program); or by a five-minute golf-cart ride.\n\nTo get between resorts, you can grab a ride from a hotel lobby or ride boats that regularly float through the canal system that links the properties.\n\nYou can also take an eco-tour on the canal boats, where you can see iguanas, crocodiles and birds that inhabit Mayakoba. (A note about the crocs: once they get about two feet long, they are removed from the property and taken to a nice farm, where they have lots of room to run around with other crocodiles -- or something like that).\n\nAnother animal thing to mention is the regular presence of falcons.\n\nThey are almost always attached to the arm of one of the many staff falconers at Mayakoba and are only deployed to scare away other birds, should the property's winged friends get too nosy around the many outdoor eating areas. The birds seem to have gotten wise, as we never saw them get too close to anyone.\n\nRelated content How Mazatl\u00e1n got its groove back\n\nTailored properties\n\nFairmont Mayakoba is AAA Five Diamond property. It offers 401 guest rooms (including 34 suites). Courtesy Fairmont Mayakoba\n\nThe four resorts share some basic architectural principles -- a collection of low-slung buildings that extend from each hotel's lobby building -- but the vibes are noticeably different.\n\nThe Andaz, which just opened a year ago, is clearly the younger, hipper sibling of the Mayakoba family. Its modern buildings are painted in shades of white and gray, occasionally punctuated by brightly-painted murals of indigenous birds.\n\nThe first North American outpost of the Asian chain, The Banyan Tree is striking and transportive -- a dramatic collection of buildings that equally make you think of Southeast Asia and one of the kingdoms of Game of Thrones (Dorn, perhaps).\n\nThe Fairmont, with its palapa-roofed beach tents and large beachside restaurant, is the more conventional hotel in the area, and feels more like what you'd imagine a Mexican resort to be.\n\nThe Rosewood feels almost Californian -- its lush gardens and beachside restaurant feel as much like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica as the Yucatan.\n\nEach of these hotels has at least three restaurants. Since you're in Mexico, you can rest easy that the food will be good (because tacos are the world's perfect food). But the cuisines stretch far beyond the peninsula.\n\nAgave Azul is one of the Rosewood's airy restaurants. Courtesy Rosewood Mayakoba\n\nThe Banyan Tree's glorious breakfast buffet at Oriente reminded me of those globetrotting buffets you see in Asia. You can (and really should) have sushi, prosciutto, pancakes, chilaquiles and croissants all in one sitting.\n\nThe Banyan's Thai restaurant was spectacular, both in food (get the crispy fish) and location, as we sat on a dock over the mangrove lagoon while listening to the calls of hooded orioles and green herons.\n\nIn the 19th century, Mexico saw an influx of Italian immigrants, who blended their ancestral cuisine with the ingredients available to them in their new home.\n\nThat Italo-Mexican tradition is available at the Rosewood's Casa del Lago, which is next to Agave Azul, a sushi bar with a formidable list of tequilas and mezcals. Beachside is more traditional Mexican fare at La Punta Bonita, which also has an extensive Mexican wine list.\n\nThe restaurants at the Fairmont are under the direction of one of Mexico's most famous chefs, Richard Sandoval. They range from the Latin-Caribbean-themed Brisas by the beach -- which has some addictive grilled oysters in Tabasco sauce -- to the Latin-Asian fusion El Puerco, overlooking the main lagoon.\n\nAndaz's restaurants are more Mexican focused. Beachside are Olla Taco and Olla Ceviche, which also serve as the bar areas for the beachside pool.\n\nA larger selection of Mexican dishes can be had inland at Cocina Milagro, while Casa Amate is a great option for a broader Latin American menu, served in a building meant to resemble the home of a globe-trotting Mexican family.\n\nRelated content The unspoiled Caribbean is here\n\nBy the water\n\nMayakoba resorts center around the beach and the lagoons. Courtesy Fairmont Mayakoba\n\nWhen you're not eating, you're likely sitting next to a body of water. All the hotels in Mayakoba have multiple pools, some with swim-up bars. The beach is also fully staffed, with umbrellas, chaises and waiter service.\n\nIn a nice nod to modernity, servers will place a small, wireless button (think of the ones Amazon gives you to reorder Tide) that connects to your server's watch. When it's time for another margarita, just press and someone from the staff will magically appear.\n\nAll beaches have kayaks and pedal boats you can borrow. For an additional fee, you can rent catamarans (which come with a captain if you're more of a landlubber), Jet Skis, kitesurfing equipment and instruction and parasailing rides from a boat anchored a few hundred feet offshore.\n\nAnd when you're not taking advantage of those activities, the accommodations at Mayakoba's resorts range from standard rooms to multi-room villas. All of them are arranged in small clusters -- there are no massive hotel buildings like you see in Cancun or Cozum\u00e9l.\n\nBeachside rooms are more expensive, but the lagoon rooms do have their own charms, as many are perched over the water with outside spaces that float on the lagoon.\n\nNo matter where you are, you can be assured of excellent service at any of the Mayakoba properties. We were warmly welcomed at each hotel, from staff in the lobbies to servers at the restaurants.\n\nTwice-daily housekeeping kept our room immaculate. The networking of the staff to one another with Secret-Service style earpieces is a nice touch.\n\nWhoever you were talking to could relay info to whomever could be helpful. Take a golf cart to your hotel's lobby, and the driver would radio ahead to make sure a car was waiting for you to take you to one of the other resorts, for example.\n\nWithin a day or two at Mayakoba, my family had all settled into a delightfully mellow groove. The weather back in Jersey was reassuringly terrible, only driving home the point that whatever we were doing in Mexico was far better than what we could be doing back at home.", "New York (CNN Business) Voters in Colorado have rejected a measure that would have added buffer zones for new oil and gas drilling areas.\n\nIf approved, Colorado's flourishing oil industry would've been dealt a major blow because a chunk of the surging Denver-Julesburg, or DJ, basin in Colorado, would suddenly become off limits.\n\n\"We appreciate our fellow Coloradans' support for responsible energy development,\" said Chip Rimer, chairman of the Colarado Oil and Gas Association's Board of Directors, in a statement. \"This measure was an extreme proposal that would have had devastating impacts.\"\n\nOil companies like Anadarko Petroleum ( APC ) and Noble Energy ( NBL ) own a large parts of land in the energy-rich state.

They also expressed concern over its extra weight on the plane, AFP reported\n\nThe spiky fruit's flavor and creamy texture has made it popular throughout Southeast Asia, but its strong odor has gained it many detractors. Singapore has banned the fruit in its subway system, and many hotels ban durians because of the notorious smell -- which some critics have likened to rotten food or dirty socks.\n\nRelated content Meet the American woman hunting for Asia's best durians\n\nThe airline said the fruit would not endanger the flight and the smell would go once the plane was in the air.\n\n\"Durian is not classified as a hazardous material to be transported on a plane,\" Sriwijaya Air official Abdul Rahim told national television station Kompas TV late Tuesday, AFP reports.\n\nHe added that they placed coffee powder and pandan leaves -- sweet-smelling leaves that are widely used to flavor desserts in Southeast Asia -- on the plane \"to absorb the durian smell.\"\n\nThe standoff ended when boarded passengers began to get off the flight.

aut\u00f3ctono en 2014 y ahora lucha para contener el brote de sarampi\u00f3n importado\n\nEntre marzo y noviembre de 2018, se han registrado 158 casos de sarampi\u00f3n en Colombia\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El Instituto Nacional de Salud de Colombia inform\u00f3 que se han confirmado 158 casos de sarampi\u00f3n en todo el pa\u00eds en lo que va de 2018.\n\nEl aumento es dram\u00e1tico respecto al primer trimestre del a\u00f1o, cuando se registr\u00f3 el primer caso de sarampi\u00f3n importado, una situaci\u00f3n que ha sido impulsada por la inmigraci\u00f3n de venezolanos a Colombia, seg\u00fan las autoridades sanitarias del pa\u00eds.\n\nDe los 4.863 casos notificados hasta el 2 de noviembre de 2018, 4.327 fueron descartados, report\u00f3 el INS de Colombia. En 2014, este pa\u00eds hab\u00eda sido declarado como territorio libre de sarampi\u00f3n aut\u00f3ctono.\n\nEl dram\u00e1tico aumento de los casos de sarampi\u00f3n en Colombia ha ocurrido desde marzo de 2018 cuando se registr\u00f3 el primer caso, en Medell\u00edn, en un ni\u00f1o de 14 meses proveniente de Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nDesde entonces los casos de sarampi\u00f3n \u201cimportado\u201d, es decir, personas de otros pa\u00edses que llevan la enfermedad a Colombia, han aumentado notablemente. Esto se debe al flujo migratorio de venezolanos en Colombia, que hasta el 30 de octubre de 2018 fue de casi 800.000 ciudadanos, seg\u00fan Migraci\u00f3n Colombia.\n\n\u201cSon todos de este a\u00f1o. Arrancaron en marzo, fue el primer caso que tenemos nosotros\u201d, le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Diego Garc\u00eda Londo\u00f1o, coordinador nacional del Programa de Vacunaci\u00f3n del Ministerio de Salud de Colombia. \u201cNo tuvimos casos reportados el a\u00f1o pasado\u201d.\n\n\"Los primeros casos que se presentaron del pa\u00eds fueron casos importados en poblaci\u00f3n venezolana que ven\u00eda procedente de ese pa\u00eds\", dijo Garc\u00eda Londo\u00f1o. \"Ha habido unos casos asociados a estos y ahorita en Cartagena tenemos ya una circulaci\u00f3n del virus... con casos ya en poblaci\u00f3n colombiana\".\n\nCifras del Ministerio de Salud dan cuenta que de los 158 casos de sarampi\u00f3n el 29% corresponde a casos importados; el 58% son relacionados con esas importaciones, y el 13%, es de fuente desconocida. Hasta el momento, dice Garc\u00eda Londo\u00f1o, Colombia no ha presentado casos aut\u00f3ctonos ni de sarampi\u00f3n ni de rubeola, otra de las enfermedades que ha aumentado en el pa\u00eds en los \u00faltimos meses.\n\nLugares como Cartagena (65), Norte de Santander (26) y Barranquilla (14) son algunos de los m\u00e1s afectados por el brote, dice el Ministerio.\n\nCartagena es uno de los focos de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e1s grandes para las autoridades sanitarias, con 30 casos en ni\u00f1os menores de un a\u00f1o, seg\u00fan Garc\u00eda Londo\u00f1o. En esta ciudad el brote de sarampi\u00f3n inici\u00f3 a mediados de julio, seg\u00fan el Ministerio de Salud.\n\nA pesar de que los casos de sarampi\u00f3n han aumentado dram\u00e1ticamente desde marzo de 2018, las cifras de Colombia son m\u00ednimas respecto a las de otros pa\u00edses como Brasil y Venezuela, un pa\u00eds que restableci\u00f3 \u201cla transmisi\u00f3n end\u00e9mica del virus\u201d, seg\u00fan la Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud.\n\nHasta el octubre 23 de 2018, en Venezuela se hab\u00edan registrado 5.525 casos de sarampi\u00f3n, entre ellas 73 muertes; en Brasil, 2.192 casos, entre ellas 12 muertes; Estados Unidos, 142, y Ecuador, 19 casos, entre otros.\n\nEn general, hasta esa fecha, en 11 pa\u00edses de Am\u00e9rica se han registrado 8.091 casos confirmados de sarampi\u00f3n, incluidas 85 defunciones, seg\u00fan la OPS.\n\nPero las autoridades de Colombia dicen que el 95% de la poblaci\u00f3n de un a\u00f1o est\u00e1 vacunada contra el sarampi\u00f3n, y dijo que el pa\u00eds compr\u00f3 250.000 dosis adicionales para vacunar menores de edad en las regiones de m\u00e1s alto riesgo como lo son las \u00e1reas fronterizas por donde hay alto flujo de venezolanos.\n\n\u201cNuestra poblaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 vacunada, adecuadamente protegida con las campa\u00f1as de vacunaci\u00f3n que hemos hecho\u201d, puntualiz\u00f3 el director de Vacunaci\u00f3n del Ministerio de Salud de Colombia.\n\nLas autoridades de salud de Colombia alertaron en septiembre de este a\u00f1o que otras enfermedades como malaria, VIH, c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino y condiciones como la malnutrici\u00f3n entre la poblaci\u00f3n de venezolanos que vive en Colombia aumentaron debido a la ola migratoria de los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os.",

Nabire died of a ruptured cyst in July 2015, leaving only a few northern white rhinos left in the world.\n\nWith the death of the male rhino, scientists have scrambled to find ways to save the subspecies. Now a new DNA study shows northern white rhinos have mated and exchanged genes with the southern white rhinos in the past, and this would be a viable option if other methods of using pure northern white rhino genetic material fail, said Michael Bruford of Cardiff University and co-author of the study.\n\nThe study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B has revealed that the two subspecies are closer than previously thought, Bruford said.\n\nIn vitro experiments conducted in the lab between northern white sperm and southern white egg showed promising results, he said.\n\n\"They are different but have had the ability to exchange genes in the past,\" Bruford said. \"This happened during the ice ages when African grasslands expanded, bringing the two populations into contact.\"\n\nHe said the subspecies mixed as recently as 15,000 years ago.\n\nIf reproductive technologies involving only northern white rhino genes fail, Bruford said, scientists could consider using southern white females for in vitro fertilization. He said a hybrid female rhino lived in a zoo in the Czech Republic and survived for 32 years.\n\nThe southern white rhinos are not as endangered -- Ol Pejeta has 32 -- and while the offspring would not be 100% northern white rhino, it would be better than nothing, experts said.\n\nResearchers saved some of the male rhino's genetic material in the hopes of using it for artificial insemination, Elodie Sampere, a representative for Ol Pejeta, has previously said.\n\nScientists have used IVF techniques to develop hybrid rhino embryos -- \"test-tube rhinos.\"\n\nA team was also able to extract stem cell lines from southern white rhino embryos, which could be used to make reproductive cells such as eggs and sperm to create embryos.\n\nThe Ol Pejeta Conservancy acquired northern white rhinos -- two males and two females -- in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic.

This is what begs the question. Take this woman out of it, take Rush out of it for a moment,\" Lewis said in a March 2012 episode. \"Does a woman now have the right to behave -- and I know there's a double standard between the way men chase women and running and running around -- you know, I'm not going to get there, but you know what I'm talking about.

Sign up here for the '5 Things' newsletter.\n\nWelcome to a special midterm elections edition of 5 Things. The blue wave rolled through the House but hit a red wall in the Senate. That's the split decision America delivered. Here's what else you need to know to. (You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here .)\n\n1. Midterm elections\n\nSo, what did we learn about ourselves as a country after these more-contentious-than-normal midterms? We're still divided. And that's reflected in the opposite trends in the House and Senate results. CNN's Stephen Collinson explains that the political and cultural gulf between diverse and affluent liberals in big cities and suburbs and mostly white, working-class voters in rural areas has never seemed wider.\n\nThe election was most definitely a referendum on President Trump. Nearly 4 out of 10 voters said their vote was a sign of opposition to him. But you can't deny, by virtue of that strong GOP showing in the Senate, that Trump's allure endures for a big swath of the country.\n\nAs for the much-talked-about blue wave, it gave Democrats something big -- the House -- but didn't quite deliver the cathartic punch they'd been craving since 2016. Here are more takeaways from the 2018 midterms, and you can get the latest updates and results on all the races right here.\n\n2. House and Senate races\n\nAs expected, the Democrats won control of the House of Representatives . CNN projects the Dems will gain as many as 35 seats in the chamber. It's a huge victory for the party, which was shut out of power after President Trump's big win two years ago. And it's an even bigger setback for the President, who will no doubt have to contend with a dizzying array of investigations brought by the newly empowered Democrats.\n\nJUST WATCHED Van Jones: It's a rainbow wave Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Van Jones: It's a rainbow wave 02:11\n\nThe Republicans not only kept the Senate , but they increased their majority. They knocked off two vulnerable red state Democrats in North Dakota and Indiana and fought off Democratic challenges in Texas and Tennessee. The GOP has the President to thank for this. Trump crisscrossed the country campaigning for Republican Senate candidates, even if it meant losing the House. Keeping the Senate means the GOP can continue confirming the conservative judges that Trump has been nominating.\n\n3. Gubernatorial races\n\nDemocrats made some gains in governors' mansions, but what they'll remember most about 2018 are the races that got away. Yes, the Dems gained six seats in governor's races, including impressive pickups in Kansas and Wisconsin . But the losses by Andrew Gillum in Florida and Richard Cordray in Ohio will surely sting for some time. Democrat Stacey Abrams refused to concede her high-profile race to Republican Brian Kemp in Georgia. He's ahead in votes with 99% of precincts reporting, but she wants to wait for the absentee ballots to be counted before giving up the fight.\n\nJUST WATCHED Brian Kemp: Confident victory is near Replay More Videos ...

Let's start with the record number of women -- at least 96 -- projected to win seats in the House. The historic total caps off a campaign season in the wake of President Trump's election that was defined in large part by female activism.

Her ability to hang on will depend on the makeup of the new Democratic caucus. Both sides agree: Pelosi is safer with a bigger majority \u2014 and will be difficult to beat.\n\nNo challenger has yet emerged, and the Ohio Democrat who did run against her in 2016 -- Rep. Tim Ryan -- told CNN he hasn't ruled it out, but he isn't considering challenging her at the moment, either.\n\n\"I don't have any intention of doing it,\" Ryan said when asked Tuesday night.\n\nBut Ryan added: \"There are lot of conversations happening with a lot of people from a lot of different caucuses that we have that are thinking about it. A lot of people will be surprised about who is thinking about doing something.\"\n\nHe said the next 24-48 hours would determine the direction the Pelosi detractors take based on conversations with the new members to see \"who would put them in the best position to succeed.\"\n\nAccording to CNN tallies, 12 incumbents who had already pledged to vote against Pelosi were re-elected Tuesday night, along with at least seven new candidates.\n\nRep. Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat who is pushing for new leadership, said Pelosi's bid is \"in real peril\" if Democrats only have a majority of about dozen seats.\n\nA senior Democratic aide pushed back on Vela, disputing the congressman's math and arguing Pelosi would have enough votes to get elected speaker.\n\nPelosi allies said that the sweeping Democratic victory would silence many of her critics -- particularly from those who were concerned the party couldn't win with her as its leader. Her powerful fundraising and ability to dole out key committee assignments also would win over some skeptics, her allies predict.\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat of Texas, said he was open to seeing the top three leaders remaining in the House Democratic majority.\n\n\"If you have to bet, bet on her,\" Cuellar said.\n\nAdded Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico: \"I believe in Nancy Pelosi, I support Nancy Pelosi and I believe she will be our next speaker.\"\n\nPelosi has tried to allay concerns by saying she would be a \"transitional leader,\" but Democrats across the board want more answers.\n\n\"People want change,\" Ryan said when asked about her pitch. \"This is getting bigger than any one person. This would be taking the first step of building a long-term sustainable coalition that can actually govern the country and get it back on track.\"\n\nRyan's comments reflect an appetite among some for a full ticket of new names, including for the No. 2 and No. 3 spot in the caucus, currently held by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn.\n\n\"Regardless of how much we win by, if Democrats win the House, it's a sign that American people want change, and we'd be shooting ourselves in the foot if we elect the same leaders again,\" said one Democratic aide who is aligned with Pelosi critics.\n\nSome Pelosi detractors are open to other members often mentioned as rising stars and potential top leaders in the caucus, including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Cheri Bustos of Illinois, David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Karen Bass of California and Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico.\n\nBut so far it appears highly unlikely these members would launch a challenge against Pelosi, given their close ties with the minority leader. Bustos and Cicilline are currently running for the Assistant Democratic Leader position, which will be the No. 4 post under a majority.\n\nRep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat from Oregon who hasn't been shy in his thoughts about Pelosi, argued no one has stepped forward to challenge her because they're \"afraid of her.\"\n\n\"Which is pretty pathetic,\" he told CNN in an interview two weeks ago. \"If your leadership is based on fear, that's terrible. That's what Donald Trump does for god sakes, based on fear. I think what we want in a leader is someone that's empowering.\"\n\nSchrader, Ryan and Vela were three of 11 members who signed on to a proposal this fall that would make it difficult for anyone, including Pelosi, to get the caucus nomination for speaker in this month's leadership elections. Traditionally, it only takes a majority of the caucus to win the nomination, but this proposal would raise the threshold to 218 -- the same number of votes needed to win the speaker in the final vote on the House floor.\n\nThe proposal was withdrawn shortly before members left for their October recess, but it's expected to be brought up again. Supporters of the idea want the caucus to be united behind their nominee before going to the floor in January.\n\nTheir concerns come as some members have already pledged to vote against Pelosi for speaker on the House floor, potentially threatening her chances for speaker during the final vote. Pelosi could survive that scenario if some of those members vote \"present\" instead of voting for another name, as it would reduce the threshold needed for a majority and members could still say they didn't vote for Pelosi.\n\nBut the contingency of members wanting to take Pelosi down will urge anti-Pelosi candidates to say a different name, rather than vote \"present,\" according to one Democratic aide who's aligned with Pelosi critics.\n\nHer allies point to her deep relationships across the caucus, her massive fundraising numbers for the party, and the fact that Democrats won the House despite Republicans spending nearly $90 million on attack ads against Pelosi.\n\nCueller said there needed to be \"new faces\" as part of the broader leadership team -- including Blue Dogs -- because the seats won Tuesday were \"not liberal seats\" and will now be occupied by moderate Democrats in conservative districts. He said he has spoken with her about the matter.", "Washington (CNN) After nearly four years of improbable political momentum, President Donald Trump demonstrated Tuesday his brand of race-baiting and fear-mongering politics -- which inflamed his base voters but scorched the rest -- can still win some big elections.\n\nThat, it appeared, was proof enough to the President his dark impulses haven't led him wrong. Even losing the House of Representatives and providing Democrats their first real check on the presidency seemed unlikely to force a reckoning at the White House over Trump's inflammatory tone. '\n\nTrump will continue a presidential tradition by holding a post-midterm election news conference at 11:30 a.m., ET.\n\nAides say he will claim victory for Republican gains in the Senate and key races for governor. He is expected to give remarks about his role in the midterms before taking questions.\n\n\"He feels vindicated,\" a Trump confidant said.\n\nThe President's mood is upbeat, aides say, largely because he is able to point to major victories in races where he campaigned, particularly in Florida, Indiana, Missouri and others. He will likely downplay -- or ignore -- disappointments, particularly losses in governor's races.\n\nBut the voters' split verdict will eventually force Trump to reckon with a changed political reality as he quickly turns toward his own re-election.\n\nThe newly powerful Democrats will not only limit Trump's legislative ambitions. Subpoena powers mean a raft of new probes could distract and occupy the White House as Trump fights for a second term. While Democratic leaders have downplayed the chances they will seek to impeach him, the possibility now looms in a way it did not when Republicans were in control.\n\nTrump is mindful of Democratic investigations to come, but a presidential confidant said most allies do not believe the President understands the full weight of what's ahead and how things will change for him during the second half of his first term.\n\nThe anticipated Democratic probes come on top of the existing investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller, which is expected to scale up now that the elections have concluded. Trump and his lawyers will have to determine in the next weeks whether to comply with Mueller's request for an interview, or at least provide written answers to his questions.\n\nWhite House officials are bracing for developments in Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nRoom for reflection?\n\nJUST WATCHED Sarah Sanders: Why would Trump call Pelosi? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sarah Sanders: Why would Trump call Pelosi? 01:10\n\nIn the midterms' waning hours, Trump mused of a desire to dial back his rhetoric and unite the country like a \"beautiful puzzle.\"\n\n\"I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel, to a certain extent, I have no choice,\" he told the administration-friendly Sinclair Broadcast Group in an interview. \"But maybe I do.\"\n\nThere is scant evidence in the President's short political career of self-reflection or message refinement. Instead, officials and confidants said Trump is more likely to muddle through the changed political landscape with the mixture of bombast and deal-making that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\n\"We'll just have to work a little bit differently,\" the President said Monday on an airport tarmac in Indiana, his second of three stops on a final barnstorm through red states. \"It'll all work out.\"\n\nTrump spent Election Day behind closed doors, having mailed in his own absentee ballot weeks ago. He phoned congressional leaders and Republican political advisers from his third-floor residence and visited a \"war room\" in the White House East Wing for updates on critical races.\n\nFamily members and friends, including ex-campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, and informal advisers like Blackstone chief Stephen Schwarzman, joined him in the evening for a viewing party, snacking on pizza and tiny hot dogs as they watched results come in on television.\n\nHe phoned both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to congratulate them on their victories, even though his spokeswoman suggested earlier that a call to Pelosi wasn't necessary since she wouldn't automatically become the presumptive speaker of the 116th Congress.\n\nTrump is poised to shuffle his Cabinet , hoping to replace officials he's deemed disloyal or ineffective, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, with more pliant replacements. Other administration aides, both in the West Wing and at agencies, are expected to exit, wary of being implicated in the wash of investigations that could soon descend.\n\nOfficials said Trump is unlikely to take much of a break from the stump. He'll soon begin holding rallies explicitly for his re-election, events that boost his mood and allow him to escape Washington.\n\n\"This fall made him realize how much he loves rallies and how much he missed them,\" one Trump confidant said.\n\nBut for the immediate future, Trump will turn to foreign policy, an area with wide executive leeway that past presidents have used as a refuge during moments of political chastening. He joins European leaders this weekend in Paris for a ceremony commemorating the World War I armistice, and meets in Buenos Aires at the end of the month with Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nThe new landscape\n\nJUST WATCHED Pelosi: Tomorrow will be a new day in America Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi: Tomorrow will be a new day in America 01:49\n\nTrump will return from his pair of upcoming foreign trips forced to confront an unfriendly House of Representatives, with the legislative promises he made over the course of the past several months trimmed. The 10-percent tax cut Trump promised middle-class Americans -- a loose objective to begin with -- seems in doubt. Democrats ardently oppose funding for a border wall, the signature promise of Trump's first presidential campaign.\n\nThe President plans to show areas of potential -- and limited -- cooperation with Democrats, largely on infrastructure. The White House legislative affairs team has been talking to Democratic and Republican House leaders about this for several weeks.\n\nAnd there are some areas Democrats and Trump appear poised to cooperate. The NAFTA re-write Trump forged with Canada and Mexico could gain approval if some of its labor and enforceability provisions are strengthened. Drug pricing and criminal justice reform legislation have both gained bipartisan support. A long-awaited infrastructure overhaul is a stated priority of Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the President's going to work with whoever comes into office. We have a lot of things on our agenda and we look forward to getting them all done,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on a darkened White House driveway Tuesday. \"The President's agenda isn't going to change regardless of whose party is there.\"\n\nEven before Democrats take power, the two sides will have to come to an agreement in the lame duck Congress on government funding or face a December shutdown.\n\nWith the Senate still in Republican hands, Trump's push to appoint conservative federal judges will likely continue apace. Should he need it, Trump still has the power to veto legislation he dislikes, a prerogative he has yet to exercise.\n\nBut the legislative hurdles represent only a fraction of the challenges that a divided Congress will pose in the coming year. When they assume control in January, Democrats will have the power to launch investigations into all manner of Trump dealings, from his ties to Russia to his business practices. A prime target appeared to be his tax returns, which he's refused to release to the public.\n\nDemocrats themselves have been somewhat divided on the issue, wary of appearing blindly political in their newfound leadership roles. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, has said she will focus on Democrats' legislative agenda, not on impeaching the President. But even lesser proceedings have a way of distracting White House lawyers and aides.\n\nKellyanne Conway, the President's counselor, shrugged off the notion of Democrats using new investigative powers in the new Congress.\n\n\"I guess they can try, but he's going to continue trying to work with them on the agenda because he's a policy guy and he's -- they're talking about investigations and subpoenas and he's talking about issues and substance so it's quite a contrast,\" she said.\n\nPast as precedent\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN projects Democrats gain control of House Replay More Videos ...

Bush and Barack Obama all lost control of the House during their presidencies. Two of those presidents, Clinton and Obama, went on to win re-election two years later, partly by running against the opposition Congress.\n\nIn the aftermath of their losses, those men acknowledged their own culpability.\n\n\"I accept my share of the responsibility in the result of the elections,\" Clinton told reporters in 1994 after Republicans seized control of the House for the first time in decades.\n\n\"I share a large part of the responsibility,\" Bush echoed in 2006 when he described a \"thumping\" for Republicans. Obama uttered the phrase \"take responsibility\" six times during his news conference in 2010 after what he deemed a Republican \"shellacking\" in the House.\n\nWhether Trump accepts the same responsibility for losing the House on Wednesday remains to be seen. But if his past actions offer any guidance, the answer is doubtful.", "San Francisco (CNN Business) Voters in San Francisco backed a plan to tax rich companies to help the homeless.\n\nThe city-wide ballot measure called Proposition C passed by a wide margin : 60% to 40%.

Lo cierto es que \u00e9l podr\u00eda decir que fue exactamente ese tipo de enfoque lo que estuvo detr\u00e1s de un desempe\u00f1o republicano mejor de lo esperado en las contiendas en el Senado.\n\nPero los cr\u00edticos argumentar\u00e1n que con su incesante preocupaci\u00f3n por reforzar el respaldo de sus m\u00e1s fervientes seguidores y sus furiosas aventuras se corre el riesgo de profundizar el da\u00f1o sufrido especialmente entre las votantes con educaci\u00f3n universitaria, de una forma que podr\u00eda comprometer severamente sus esperanzas de ganar la reelecci\u00f3n en dos a\u00f1os.\n\nEl presidente vio c\u00f3mo iban d\u00e1ndose los resultados despu\u00e9s de cenar con su familia en la Casa Blanca.\n\nEstuvo acompa\u00f1ado por el megadonante republicano Sheldon Adelson; el director ejecutivo de Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman, y de sus exasesores de campa\u00f1a David Bossie y Corey Lewandowski, seg\u00fan una fuente familiarizada con la lista de invitados.\n\nOtras dos fuentes cercanas a la Casa Blanca dijeron que Trump ya estaba culpando de la derrota en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes al saliente portavoz republicano Paul Ryan.\n\n\"\u00c9l est\u00e1 verdaderamente molesto con Ryan\", dijo una fuente, por \"todo\".\n\nDrew Hammill, asesor de Nancy Pelosi, tuite\u00f3 el martes por la noche que el presidente hab\u00eda llamado a la l\u00edder dem\u00f3crata a las 11:45 p.m. ET \"para ofrecer sus felicitaciones por el triunfo dem\u00f3crata en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes\".", "(CNN) \u2014 Hypersonics, electric propulsion, triple deckers -- think you've seen everything when it comes to new aircraft concepts?\n\nWell just hold on a second, here comes the pod plane.\n\nThere are several independent initiatives exploring the feasibility of modular planes, which could transform the way people and cargo travel\n\nOne of these revolutionary aircraft designs, called Clip-Air, has been created by Switzerland's Federal Polytechnic Institute\n\nAnother is the Link & Fly concept, designed by AKKA Technologies , a European engineering services firm.\n\nFuturistic and disruptive\n\nWhile the concept might be boundary-pushing, the inspiration for Clip-Air is more mundane: the humble shipping container.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, its simple design, the shipping container is one of the most disruptive inventions of the past century.\n\nIt allows cargo to be moved cheaply from one mode of transport to another and has facilitated the development of the complex supply chains all modern economies rely on.\n\nTransfer from truck to giant cargo ship to freight train is seamless and the container can be used again and again, drastically reducing the cost of long-distance shipping.\n\nThat's the magic of inter-modal transport -- and it's something this futuristic and potentially game-changing concept hopes to emulate.\n\nRelated content Totally new jetliner unveiled for US fliers\n\nIntermodality is also at the core of the Link & Fly proposal.\n\nIn fact, AKKA Technologies is increasingly defining itself as a provider of integrated mobility solutions, blurring the difference between its automotive, rail and aerospace practices.\n\nThe key idea here, both in Clip-Air and Link & Fly, is that the aircraft is composed of two elements.\n\nThere's the flying component, including airframe, cockpit and engines.\n\nThen there are the capsules, a number of detachable pods that can act as cabin or cargo hold, depending on the chosen configuration.\n\nBoth concept aircraft feature an arch-like airframe, with an elevated wing and the engines mounted on top. This makes it possible to place the cabin right underneath and attach and detach it easily.\n\nClip-Air, for example, is based on a flying-wing concept, reminiscent of a stealth bomber. Some may even find some similarities to the X-48 , an experimental pilotless aircraft developed for NASA a decade ago.\n\nVersatile design\n\nClip-Air modules are designed to be carried by a variety of vehicles. EPFL/ENAC/TRANSP-OR\n\nA pair of long metal legs protruding from each side of the flying wing, and containing the landing wheels mechanism, keep the airframe high above the ground.\n\nThe height is to allow for capsules to be hung from the belly of the aircraft, not unlike the way warplanes carry bombs and missiles.\n\nThese capsules could be made to carry either passengers or cargo.\n\nIn fact, while Clip-Air's speed and range is expected to be on a par with that of modern midsized airliners, the beauty of the concept rests precisely upon the versatility provided by the capsules.\n\nLink & Fly's concept presents a similar setup, with modules that can be adapted to simultaneously carry a wide range of cargo and passenger combinations.\n\nThis way, one single aircraft would be able to perform multiple roles.\n\nThe capsules can also be easily attached and detached from the airframe, making it possible for aircraft to achieve very quick rotations on the ground.\n\nClaudio Leonardi, who manages the Clip-Air project at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Lausanne, says this'll allow operators to maximize use of the airframe, the most expensive component.\n\nSeamless transfer\n\nClip-Air: Up to three pods can be carried side by side. EPFL/ENAC/TRANSP-OR\n\nWhat's more, for passengers the boarding process could become a lot faster and less stressful as they'll be able to board capsules well before the flight -- goodbye to aisle jams.\n\nAnd there's the whole multi-modal aspect of the concept.\n\nAs with shipping containers, Clip-Air capsules could be seamlessly transferred onto trucks and trains, opening up a world of possibilities, not only for freight operators but also for the airline industry.\n\nFor example, there may be a decoupling of who manages the airframe and passenger cabin. In the case of Clip-Air, those are likely to be multiple cabins, since up to three independent capsules could be attached to each aircraft.\n\nSimilar to what happens in the rail or shipping industry, some firms could specialize in the flying while others would focus on the passenger experience.\n\nPassengers may even be able to choose from three different competitors, all flown by the same aircraft.\n\nOperators could also market multi-modal itineraries that start or end well beyond the airport.\n\n'Brilliant engineering'\n\nClip-Air's designers are building a drone prototype. EPFL/ENAC/TRANSP-OR\n\nPassengers might board a capsule at a local bus station and wake up in another city on the other side of the country, or planet, after a road, air and rail journey during which they didn't leave their seat.\n\nSo what are the chances of this ever happening?\n\nRather slim, according to Addison Schonland, founder of Airinsight , a consultancy providing market intelligence about the aviation industry.\n\n\"Although it may be brilliant from an engineering point of view, it is going to be very tough to make it work commercially,\" Schonland says.\n\n\"It would need to compete with proven and well-established technologies, and, frankly, it is dubious whether the market will be ready for such a radical new concept, even in the long term.\n\n\"In any case, if the concept is ever to take off, I would see it working for cargo first.\"\n\nLink & Fly: Probably not coming soon to skies near you. Courtesy Akka Technologies\n\nNeither is AKKA Technologies expecting its Link & Fly to go into production anytime soon.\n\nAlthough the design is fully engineered, meaning every aspect has been designed with technological feasibility in mind, its main purpose is to demonstrate emerging technologies.\n\n\"Our role is not to manufacture the Link & Fly but to accompany OEMs [Original Equipment Manufacturers] in the development of future, multi-modal transportation systems,\" says Maurice Ricci, founder and CEO of AKKA Technologies.\n\nRelated content EasyJet plans electric planes by 2030\n\n\"Similar to what we have achieved with our electric autonomous vehicle Link & Go, rolled out in 2011, of which key technological bricks can be found in the most recent vehicles coming onto the market, the same might well be the case with the underlying technologies of the Link & Fly,\" says Ricci.\n\nIn the case of Clip-Air, researchers are well aware of the challenges ahead and that years of further research and tests are needed to validate the concept.\n\nLeonardi, however, remains adamant about his ultimate goal to build an aircraft able to fly simultaneously three capsules with the capacity to carry 150 passengers each.\n\n\"We are using only technologies and materials that are already in use and well known to the industry,\" he says.\n\nClip-Air's researchers, who are also looking into the possibility of using biofuels or liquid hydrogen as alternative fuels, have already initiated some contacts with the aerospace industry.\n\nObtaining support from one of the major industry players would be a game-changer, and the team are hoping to hear from anyone interested.", "(CNN) Violence in Yemen's key port city of Hodeidah is at its worst in months, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator has warned, as a leader of the Houthi rebels vowed that his side would carry on fighting despite US calls for a ceasefire.\n\nHodeidah, a vital entry point for UN and other humanitarian aid, has become the center of the conflict in Yemen between US-backed Arab allies led by Saudi Arabia and Houthi rebels backed by Iran.\n\nFighting has escalated since US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis a week ago called on all participants in Yemen's civil war to agree to a ceasefire in the next 30 days and start peace talks.\n\n\"The uptick in violence is some of the fiercest fighting we've seen in months and months,\" UN humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, told CNN.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition claimed Monday it had made significant gains in the battle to capture Hodeidah from the Houthis.\n\nA Houthi leader on Wednesday said the latest military escalation by the Saudi-led coalition was in line with an \"American vision.\"\n\n\"Based on experience in the past, we know that this is an American style, they call for peace while they are preparing for a new military aggression,\" Abdul Malik al-Houthi said in a speech broadcast on pro-Houthi al-Masirah TV.\n\n\"The Saudi aggression primarily depends on US military supervision, planning, weapons and logistical support,\" he added.\n\nYemeni pro-government forces advance Tuesday toward the port area from the eastern outskirts of Hodeidah.\n\nChildren at risk, UNICEF says\n\nHumanitarian workers fear that more than 100 civilians may have died in the just past week in Hodeidah, CNN has learned.\n\nUN children's agency UNICEF warned Tuesday that intense fighting in Hodeidah was putting children in the city's hospital in grave danger.\n\nThe lives of 59 children are at risk, it said, including 25 who are in the intensive care unit at the city's al-Thawra hospital.\n\nHodeidah and the neighboring governates account for 40% of the 400,000 children in the country who suffer from severe acute malnutrition, UNICEF said. \"Some of the sickest are taken to the hospital for urgent care,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, up to 80% of Yemen's humanitarian supplies, fuel and commercial goods are delivered through Hodeidah's port, around which fighting has reportedly intensified, the agency said.\n\n\"The toll in lives could be catastrophic if the port is damaged, destroyed or blocked,\" it warned.\n\nThe three-year conflict between the US-backed, Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthis has devastated Yemen and reportedly killed at least 10,000 people.\n\nPro-government forces advance toward the port area.\n\nAirstrikes intensify\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition had launched 400 airstrikes in Hodeidah over the past few days, a Yemeni journalist close to the Houthis told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n\"The coalition is using Kilo 16 -- a road linking between the capital, Sanaa, and Hodeidah -- as a battleground,\" Hussain Albukhaiti told CNN by phone. \"The coalition distributed pamphlets two months ago warning people and their cars to stay clear of that road.\"\n\nThe coalition said in September that its targeting operations in Yemen resembled the \"highest international standards\" and pledged to investigate incidents involving civilian deaths reported on by CNN.\n\nThe US military provides the Saudi coalition with training meant to help minimize civilian casualties, as well as aerial refueling of coalition warplanes.\n\nUN experts from the World Food Programme say that the coalition's bombings of civilians are potential war crimes and that its partial blockade of the country has put 12 million men, women and children at risk of starvation in what could become the worst famine in 100 years.\n\nThe situation in Yemen is \"an unprecedented human tragedy,\" the head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, said Tuesday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's administration has drawn criticism

Uno que supuestamente mat\u00f3 a dos personas negras en un supermercado, tras un intento fallido minutos antes de ingresar a una iglesia negra. Otro abri\u00f3 fuego en un estudio de yoga, asesinando a dos personas e hiriendo a cinco m\u00e1s antes de apuntarse a s\u00ed mismo con el arma.

Estas personas sostienen alternativamente que la movilizaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 llena de miembros de pandillas, personas de \u201cMedio Oriente\u201d e incluso individuos con rabia. El mandatario, adem\u00e1s, tambi\u00e9n anunci\u00f3 sus planes de desplegar hasta 15.000 tropas estadounidenses para repeler la \u201cinvasi\u00f3n\u201d y advirti\u00f3 que si alguno de los migrantes de la caravana lanzaba piedras a sus cuerpos de seguridad, podr\u00edan recibir disparos, una amenaza que luego neg\u00f3.\n\nNadie est\u00e1 diciendo que la reciente serie de tiroteos puede atribuirse al Partido Republicano. Pero el contraste entre el terror que realmente experimentan muchos estadounidenses y el espectro de violencia que invoc\u00f3 Trump es un ejemplo cl\u00e1sico de una forma insidiosa de racismo que algunos dicen es generalizada aunque rara vez se reconoce:\n\nHombres blancos con rabia se\u00f1alando en otros \u201cagresiones primitivas\u201d que se reh\u00fasan a ver en s\u00ed mismos.\n\nLos hombres blancos advierten al p\u00fablico sobre las bandas violentas de Centroam\u00e9rica que invaden Estados Unidos, a pesar de que otros hombres blancos han cometido m\u00e1s tiroteos en masa que cualquier otra poblaci\u00f3n. Algunos hombres blancos aseguran que los \u201cterroristas isl\u00e1micos radicales\u201d representan la amenaza m\u00e1s grave para su pa\u00eds, aunque los grupos extremistas violentos de derecha son responsables de m\u00e1s incidentes mortales en EE.UU. desde el 11 de septiembre de 2001. Algunos hombres blancos \u2013como los nacionalistas blancos que se manifestaron el a\u00f1o pasado en Charlottesville, Virginia\u2013 dicen que est\u00e1n en peligro de ser reemplazados por personas no blancas, a pesar de que todav\u00eda ellos constituyen la gran mayor\u00eda de los presidentes ejecutivos, multimillonarios y l\u00edderes pol\u00edticos del pa\u00eds.\n\nLos psic\u00f3logos tienen un nombre para este tipo de patr\u00f3n. Se llama proyecci\u00f3n y ocurre cuando las personas o grupos de individuos atribuyen elementos ocultos o reprimidos de s\u00ed mismos sobre los dem\u00e1s. Pero si eres miembro de un grupo que ha sido juzgado como \u201cel otro\u201d por un hombre blanco enojado, como lo es Ijeoma Oluo, este patr\u00f3n ya es costumbre.\n\nPara ella no existe nada m\u00e1s aterrador que la rabia de un hombre blanco, seg\u00fan escribi\u00f3 en un ensayo que se hizo viral con el t\u00edtulo de \u201cLa mentira sobre la rabia del hombre blanco\u201d. Oluo explic\u00f3 que vive constantemente con el temor de que la ira de un hombre blanco pueda llegarle de forma violenta a ella y a \u201cinnumerables personas negras, morenas, discapacitadas, queer, trans, y mujeres de todos los grupos demogr\u00e1ficos\u201d.

Pero nadie est\u00e1 diciendo que todos los hombres blancos son inherentemente violentos o que representan la mayor amenaza para Estados Unidos. Hacer amplias generalizaciones sobre cualquier poblaci\u00f3n es cometer el mismo error de racistas y antisemitas.\n\nAlgunos hombres no blancos son responsables de actos violentos y despiadados en Estados Unidos. Cuatro de los ataques terroristas m\u00e1s recientes \u2013en San Bernardino, Boston, Chattanooga y Fort Hood\u2013 fueron cometidos presuntamente por terroristas musulmanes. Y, por supuesto, los ataques del 11 de septiembre los perpetraron musulmanes.\n\nSin embargo, existe un sorprendente trabajo en literatura y psicolog\u00eda que analiza esta tendencia de algunas personas blancas \u2013en particular los hombres blancos\u2013 de ver r\u00e1pidamente la cara del terror en un \u201cotro\u201d. Lo hacen proyectando algunos de los aspectos m\u00e1s indeseables y reprimidos de s\u00ed mismos sobre los dem\u00e1s.\n\nUno de los aspectos mortales de dicha proyecci\u00f3n es que quienes la realizan suelen desconocer que, de hecho, lo est\u00e1n haciendo, explic\u00f3 Kenneth M. Reeves, psic\u00f3logo y autor del art\u00edculo acad\u00e9mico \u201cRacismo y proyecci\u00f3n de la sombra\u201d. Seg\u00fan explica, la proyecci\u00f3n es tan com\u00fan que conforma un \u201cdrama universal diario\u201d que impide que quien tiene esta conducta realmente pueda ver \u201cel otro\u201d en su humanidad completa.\n\nPero esta forma de proyecci\u00f3n va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de lo personal: da forma a nuestra pol\u00edtica.\n\nHay personas que dividen a Estados Unidos entre los estados rojo y azul (republicanos y dem\u00f3cratas, respectivamente), pero la verdadera l\u00ednea diferenciadora puede estar entre los hombres blancos con rabia y el resto.\n\nEl senador Graham ya no tiene que preocuparse. Los republicanos se est\u00e1n convirtiendo en lo que algunos llaman la \u201cBancada del hombre blanco Angus\u201d. Ya de por s\u00ed abrumadoramente blanco, el Partido Republicano est\u00e1 viendo c\u00f3mo las mujeres se alejan. Algunos culpan a la actitud general del colectivo hacia la campa\u00f1a #MeToo y su apoyo al juez de la Corte Suprema de EE.UU. Brett Kavanaugh, quien recientemente fue confirmado en el tribunal tras acusaciones de agresi\u00f3n sexual, que \u00e9l neg\u00f3.\n\nDe hecho, los republicanos han sido asociados tanto con la ira del hombre blanco que un humorista recientemente sugiri\u00f3 que \u201clos estadounidenses se sentir\u00edan m\u00e1s seguros si una enorme caravana de hombres blancos enojados se fuera del pa\u00eds\u201d.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 los hombres blancos tienen tanta rabia?\n\nEl reverendo Gibson Stroupe conoce de primera mano la ira del blanco.

Ha escrito extensamente y ha dado muchas conferencias sobre racismo.\n\nStroupe observa algo de la ira que alguna vez sinti\u00f3 en la manera c\u00f3mo algunos hombre blancos reaccionaron a la elecci\u00f3n del primer presidente negro de EE.UU., Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cEso fue bastante impactante para muchos de nosotros los blancos, especialmente los hombres blancos\u201d, se\u00f1al\u00f3 Stroupe, autor de \u201cAgua m\u00e1s profunda: sermones para una nueva visi\u00f3n\u201d. \u201cNo estamos acostumbrados a que los hombres afroamericanos tengan poder sobre nosotros\u201d.\n\nEn ese sentido, el reverendo explic\u00f3 que uno de los modos en que el hombre blanco tratan con ese miedo es proyectando su propia violencia sobre los hombres negros.\n\n\u201cLos hombres blancos reconocen lo mucho que hemos hecho contra los negros, especialmente contra los hombres negros\u201d, indic\u00f3. \u201cNuestro deseo de aferrarnos a nuestras armas con tanta fuerza\u2026 creemos que si los hombres negros tienen poder sobre nosotros nos har\u00e1n lo mismo que les hicimos\u201d, dijo.\n\nEsta forma de proyecci\u00f3n se ha convertido en una poderosa herramienta pol\u00edtica, apunt\u00f3 el reverendo Fred Robinson, director ejecutivo de MeckMin, un grupo interreligioso sin \u00e1nimo de lucro que patrocin\u00f3 un servicio interreligioso en Charlotte, Carolina del Norte, para apoyar a los miembros de la sinagoga de Pittsburgh que fue atacada.\n\nLos l\u00edderes pol\u00edticos que tienen esta conducta de proyecci\u00f3n les dan a los blancos una persona o grupo a quien culpar cuando est\u00e1n en problemas, a\u00f1adi\u00f3.\n\n\u201cAsustan a los blancos de las bases para que crean que otra persona es el problema: los jud\u00edos son el problema. Los negros son el problema. Los mexicanos son el problema. Los homosexuales son el problema. Funciona m\u00e1gicamente porque se basa en nuestra narrativa cultural\u201d, sostuvo Robinson, pastor asociado la Iglesia Holy Covenant United Church of Christ en Charlotte.\n\nRobinson asegur\u00f3 que puede imaginar un futuro en el que algunos hombres blancos con rabia crear\u00e1n en Estados Unidos un sistema pol\u00edtico similar al apartheid, donde podr\u00e1n mantenerse en el poder a pesar de ser una minor\u00eda racial.\n\nEso significar\u00eda m\u00e1s ira de los hombres blancos.

They had a lot in common: Both were non-verbal, both relied on me for their well-being, and both were in possession of what Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz called \" baby schema .\"\n\nThis is the combination of large head, round face and big eyes that we humans find irresistibly cute and motivates us to care for vulnerable and needy creatures.\n\nThe difference between dog and baby, though, is potential consequences. Nobody tells you how important it is to talk to your dog. Everybody tells you how crucial it is to talk to your baby.\n\nAccording to the mountain of research on the importance of talking to babies and toddlers , the first three years of a child's life are a period of rapid and expansive brain development. Talking to young children helps fire up the connections that will allow them to process language. The more words they hear, the stronger those connections get.\n\nWhen there's a lot at stake, performance anxiety tends to kick in. Do I have to be in constant narration mode when chatting with my 18-month-old, like a Werner Herzog of my own life? \"Now, Mommy wets her toothbrush. Now, Mommy puts the toothbrush in her mouth ...\" Or is it OK to let it all unfold a bit more organically, including regular breaks for -- dare I say it? -- silence?\n\nMake it a conversation\n\n\"Back and forth responsiveness\" is the most important thing when talking to a baby or toddler, according to Alice Honig, professor emerita in the department of human development and family science at Syracuse University and co-author of \" Talking With Your Baby .\" \"It's about real intimate connection.\"\n\nFor young babies, this means making a small \"coo\" sound and waiting, patiently, for the baby to make a \"coo\" in response. She said parents and caregivers should try this out early on, even if the baby doesn't \"coo\" back right away.\n\n\"It sends them the message that 'I'm important. Somebody is talking to me. I have to focus.' Before one month, they can focus when we talk to them.\"\n\nHonig said that as babies mature, it is appropriate to move from \"coos\" to words to sentences. However, do not stop speaking in the kind of baby talk experts call \"parentese.\" This is that high-octave, musical, long-voweled \" schmoopy \" tone that we associate with affection.\n\nAnother important thing to remember is that even if children can't speak yet, they can still communicate.\n\nHonig noted the distinction between expressive language and receptive language. The former is being able to talk back. The latter is being able to understand what was said.\n\nMy 18-month-old's expressive language skills are at an age-appropriate minimum. But his receptive language skills are not bad! The other day, my husband and I were talking about how it was time to feed the dog, and our toddler, without instruction, went and grabbed the dog bowl and walked it over to where the food is.\n\n\"Receptive language is the one you want to be alert to,\" Honig said, explaining that it is how we know the child really understands what is happening around her and what is being said to her.\n\nHonig encourages parents and caregivers to work on cultivating these receptive skills, largely by asking questions. She said toddlers can benefit from being asked questions with one-word answers. Apple or pear? Truck or ball? Happy or sad? (Emotion questions are doubly effective, because they teach them how to label, and ultimately understand, their feelings.)\n\nParents should also be asking open-ended questions that push young children to think critically and creatively, which communicates that their opinion matters. Ask toddlers whether they can figure out how to get around a puddle in a park or what they can do with a pile of blocks or with a handful of clay. Many will respond through their bodies, even if they don't have the words.\n\nAs to the right timing for all these stages, Honig says, it depends. \"Let your child teach you where your child is at,\" she said.\n\nQuality can matter more than quantity\n\nIn 2003, education researchers Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley coined the term \" word gap \" based on their findings that low-income children hear, on average, 30 million fewer words by the age of 3 than their wealthier counterparts. As a result, their language skills tended to be less-developed, and they were less likely to succeed in school.\n\nTheir findings have been both critiqued and confirmed over the years, and many nonprofits and government initiatives were set up to increase the number of words children heard in their early years.\n\nThough both this study and many of the interventions inspired by it are important, the conversation around the word gap is often misleading. The takeaway is that, when it comes to talking to young children, it's the volume that matters.\n\n\"My sense is that we are coming to a consensus in the field, and a number of studies have found, that the types of conversations we have with children matter more than the number of words,\" said Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, professor of psychology at Temple University and author of a number of books on early childhood development.\n\nLike Honig, she said that the key is to make talking to your young children feel like a conversation as much as possible. \"I responded to you, and you responded to me, and we both listened to what the other was saying. It is really important to human species; think about it is as human glue. ... This matters for building brain area, whereas the number of words don't.\"\n\nHirsh-Pasek said parents shouldn't feel as though they have to narrate their lives for their children. It's perfectly acceptable to, say, push a small child in a cart down an aisle in a supermarket and not speak out loud the name of a single item on the shelf.\n\nHowever, as that worry recedes another one should replace it: screens. \"There is a lot of talk about kids' media use, but the real issue, with respect to language and conversations, is not kids' media use [but rather] adult media use. The more we are constantly looking down at our cell phone, the more we turn off, the more they get detached from conversation,\" she said.\n\nHirsh-Pasek encourages parents to put their devices away as much as possible during the evening or on weekends .

Fonki Samuel Forba, the moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon, told CNN that authorities realized the two children were missing after the other children underwent interviews and medical checks.\n\n\"When we handed the children to their parents this evening, we learned two students are still with the kidnappers, and the principal and one teacher,\" Forba said. On Tuesday, Forba said all 78 children had been freed.\n\nForba said the kidnappers had asked the students to tell if them if their parents had high-ranking government positions. \"These two raised their hands. So they kept them,\" he said.\n\nThe group of 42 girls and 36 boys was seized early Monday by gunmen, along with their principal, a teacher and a driver, from the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda, in the northwest of the central African nation. One other girl managed to escape from the kidnappers.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

didn't. Instead, the 200,000-member USAG has been mired in one scandal after another, including recent criminal charges against former employees, a revolving door of presidents and now the possible removal of USAG's status as the US governing body for the sport.\n\nHere's a look at how the post-Nassar recovery has been plagued by problems -- and how some gymnasts are reacting:\n\nMore criminal charges get filed\n\nSteve Penny was the president and CEO of USA Gymnastics from 2005 to 2017, during which many of Nassar's accusers said they were molested by the former team doctor.\n\nPenny once testified that he didn't think it was always necessary to forward child abuse allegations to authorities. He also expressed concern that false allegations could harm a coach's reputation , the Indianapolis Star reported.\n\nIf convicted of the third-degree felony charge, Penny faces up to 10 years in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.\n\n\"This is for every little girl who could have been saved from Larry, and from every coach that Penny received warnings about, and then put into a file cabinet,\" Denhollander posted on Facebook . \"May justice continue to be done.\"\n\nformer USAG trainer Deborah Van Horn also faces a criminal charge. She was arrested in June and charged with In addition to Penny,former USAG trainer Deborah Van Horn also faces a criminal charge. She was arrested in June and charged with sexual assault of a child in the second degree\n\nFormer USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn, who worked with Larry Nassar, was arrested in Houston.\n\nProsecutors said Van Horn's charge stems from \"acting as a party.\" Officials said one of Nassar's victims is the same victim Van Horn is charged with assaulting.\n\n2 USAG presidents resign in 2 months\n\nAfter the Nassar sex abuse scandal erupted -- and after Penny quit USAG -- Kerry Perry became USAG's new president last December\n\nMany hoped she would create a drastically new, open culture and reach out to high-profile Nassar abuse survivors. But Perry was widely criticized for what many considered inadequate action and boilerplate soundbites after the Nassar scandal.\n\nAfter nine months on the job, Perry resigned in September.\n\nBono came under fire after a September tweet surfaced of her defacing a Nike logo. (Nike had recently featured former NFL player and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in an ad campaign.)\n\nBut Nike is also a huge sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, the biggest star of USA Gymnastics and the face of the sport. Biles called Bono out on her tweet\n\n\"don't worry, it's not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,\" Biles tweeted\n\nOthers said Bono's tweet was tone-deaf in the wake of the Nassar scandal, saying it was the suppression of athletes' voices that allowed Nassar's abuse to fester.\n\nBono deleted the tweet and said she regretted the post.\n\n\"I deeply regret posting the tweet because I respect everyone's views and their fundamental right to express them,\" Bono said in a statement October 13.\n\n\"This in no way reflects how I will approach my position at USA Gymnastics. I will do everything I can to help change the culture and to work with the entire community to build an open, safe and positive environment.\"\n\nBut three days after releasing that statement, Bono resigned . USAG is still looking for a new CEO.\n\nMore ousters, resignations or suspensions\n\nAt least five high-ranking officials have left USAG in the past seven months, even though most came on board after the Nassar sex-abuse scandal came to light.\n\nIn addition to Perry and Bono, former elite development coordinator Mary Lee Tracy is out. Tracy had been on the job for only three days when she was asked to resign in August.\n\nUSAG said Tracy had \"inappropriately contacted a [Nassar] survivor, who is also a represented plaintiff, in response to that survivor's public criticism of her.\"\n\nIn May, USAG lost the head of its women's program, Rhonda Faehn. Then-CEO Perry would not say whether Faehn was fired or resigned, calling Faehn's departure a \"personnel matter that we will not discuss in detail.\"\n\nhead tumbling coach Sergio Galvez was directed to resign \"pending an investigation of a report filed at the And last month,head tumbling coach Sergio Galvez was directed to resign \"pending an investigation of a report filed at the US Center for SafeSport ,\" USAG said.\n\nNo details were released on what was alleged in that report. Online USAG records show Galvez was suspended pending a hearing\n\nGalvez was forbidden from traveling with the US team to the World Trampoline and Tumbling Championships in Russia this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, USAG told CNN that Galvez had resigned.\n\nNo clear future\n\nPerhaps the most damaging post-Nassar hit to USA Gymnastics came Monday, when the US Olympic Committee said it wants to revoke USAG's status as the sport's governing body in America.\n\nThe USOC has started taking steps to decertify USA Gymnastics and has offered USAG the option of surrendering its status voluntarily.\n\n\"We believe the challenges facing (USAG) are simply more than it is capable of overcoming in its current form,\" USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland wrote in an open letter to the gymnastics community.\n\nOlympic champion Aly Raisman welcomed the move.\n\n\"I believe this is a significant step forward that is necessary for the overall health and well-being of the sport and its athletes,\" Raisman tweeted . \"There are so many amazing, talented, and kindhearted people in this sport, and it's time for them to lead us into the future!\"\n\nBut it's not clear exactly what will happen next.\n\n\"You're no doubt wondering what this means for you and the gymnastics community,\" Hirshland wrote to athletes. \"Until the process is completed and a final determination on USAG's status is made, we will work to ensure that gymnastics training and competitions will continue as usual.\"\n\nUSAG has not said whether it will challenge the USOC's move. In an open letter to its members , the USAG said its board of directors was seated in June \"and inherited an organization in crisis with significant challenges that were years in the making.\"\n\nIn the months since, \"the board has done everything it could to move this organization towards a better future,\" USAG said. \"We immediately took steps to change the leadership and are currently conducting a search to find a CEO who can rebuild the organization and, most importantly, regain the trust of the gymnastics community.\"", "(CNN) President Donald Trump demolished the \"blue wall\" in the Great Lakes region two years ago. On Tuesday night, Democrats rebuilt it.\n\nThe party's candidates won races for governor and the Senate in the three states that delivered Trump the presidency -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats padded their new House majority in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Detroit, while Milwaukee delivered the surge they needed to finally, on their fourth try, beat Republican Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nThe Democratic victories set the stage for a 2020 battle royale in the three states that could decide the presidency.\n\nThey could also shape a Democratic nominating contest set to begin almost immediately, underscoring which states Democrats are best poised to win and which candidates and issues most appeal in those states.\n\nIt's a dynamic that Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a populist Democrat with Midwestern appeal who was re-elected Tuesday night, sought to tap into almost immediately with a victory speech that foreshadowed a potential presidential run when he called his win \"the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\"\n\n\"Let our country -- our nation's citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country -- let them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest,\" he said.\n\nThe recipe for a Democratic comeback in the Great Lakes region was straightforward. Candidates largely ignored Trump. Instead, they focused on health care as well as bread-and-butter budget issues like funding for schools, roads and infrastructure.\n\nThey also capitalized on a reality that didn't end when Trump took office: Voters are still angry, they're eager to assign blame, and Barack Obama is no longer around to shoulder it.\n\nRepublicans have dominated governors' offices and legislatures in the Midwest for most of the last decade. Following the template set by former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, they've largely governed on an agenda of budget austerity -- which has been met with occasional protests over funding for education and infrastructure.\n\nVoters appear to have reached a breaking point. A Marquette Law School poll in October found Wisconsin voters would, by a 57% to 37% margin, rather increase spending on public schools than reduce their property taxes.\n\nTrump's message of scrapped trade deals and rebuilt roads and bridges appealed to voters who have watched their region's manufacturing base crumble in recent decades. But the gains those voters expected have largely not materialized under Trump, and frustrations over issues such as stalled funding for schools and still-rising health insurance premiums have mounted. With Obama no longer in office and Hillary Clinton off the political stage, there's no one to blame but Republicans.\n\nGretchen Whitmer on the campaign trail in June.\n\n\"You can't say government is terrible if your party's in control of it,\" Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor-elect of Michigan, said in an interview.\n\nThe 47-year-old Whitmer -- who some Democratic strategists said was the party's best candidate this year -- could be the biggest star in Tuesday's crop of winners.\n\nShe campaigned on a simple, blunt slogan: \"Fix the damn roads.\" The slogan was more than a literal call to fill the potholes that forced Whitmer to replace two car windshields during the campaign -- and it tapped into something that party strategists said was at the core of their resurgence.\n\nOn the campaign trail, people frequently shouted takes on Whitmer's slogan at her. \"Fix the damn schools\" and \"fix the damn water\" were two of the most common variations, she said.\n\n\"It touches people at that nerve where they feel it, right? But also it points directly to what state government's supposed to be doing,\" Whitmer said.\n\nIn Wisconsin, rising Democratic star Josh Kaul leads a razor-tight race for attorney general. He echoed Whitmer, saying voters are worried about an opioid crisis, environmental catastrophes especially in water infrastructure, school safety and more.\n\n\"I think that there is a sense that people want new leadership, they want a change of direction. And right now, Republicans are in control of the governor's office of Wisconsin, the state legislature, the attorney general's office, certainly Donald Trump is the president,\" he said.\n\nEarly signs of a Democratic resurgence came in special elections in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And Walker -- a battle-tested Republican who had built an effective political machine in Wisconsin -- saw it coming.\n\nIn January, he warned that a state senate special election victory by Democrats was \"a wake up call for Republicans in Wisconsin.\" When the liberal candidate won a state Supreme Court seat in April, Walker tweeted that \"we are at risk of a #BlueWave.\"\n\nBut the most significant sign of all came in April, when Democrat Conor Lamb won a special congressional election for a heavily Republican district outside Pittsburgh.\n\n\"The Conor Lamb victory really kind of painted a roadmap,\" said Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist in western Pennsylvania. \"What that told me there was a big enough group of people that liked Trump but still considered themselves Democrats. That was the building block.\"\n\nMikus said Democrats in 2016 watched counties that they'd always lost slip -- with their share of the vote plummeting from the mid-40s to the low-30s. That gap couldn't be overcome in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh alone.\n\nHe said Gov. Tom Wolf's persistence working for economic opportunity for those rural areas, as well as Sen. Bob Casey's focus on pensions and health care for retired miners, were part of why those Democrats cruised to re-election in 2018 without facing serious challenges.\n\n\"What I think a lot of people missed is there was a heck of a lot of voters that didn't like Trump, didn't like Hillary, and they ended up voting for Trump,\" he said. \"You have to give them a reason to come back.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLos votantes en Texas eligieron por primera vez a dos mujeres para el Congreso\n\nEl representante dem\u00f3crata por Colorado Jared Polis ser\u00e1 el primer hombre abiertamente gay en ganar una gubernatura\n\nLas dem\u00f3cratas Sharice Davids y Deb Haaland ser\u00e1n las primeras mujeres ind\u00edgenas americanas elegidas al Congreso de Estados Unidos\n\nWashington (CNN) - Un par de mujeres ind\u00edgenas americanas, una refugiada somal\u00ed o el primer hombre abiertamente gay elegido a gobernador.

Democratic candidate Joe Cunningham will be elected to Congress in a narrow victory over Republican Katie Arrington, CNN projects.\n\nThe pick up in District 1 win marks South Carolina's second Democratic seat, with all seven districts reporting.\n\nThe win follows an already dramatic upset in the Republican primary in a district that has gone red since 1981.\n\nArrington, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, took on former incumbent Rep. Mark Sanford in the primary . Trump blasted Sanford in June as \"very unhelpful\" to his campaign and endorsed Arrington.\n\n\"We are the party of President Donald J. Trump,\" she said following her primary win.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "A \"no\" vote on Question 3 would have repealed the law signed in July 2016. With the \"yes\" vote, people can use bathrooms and other public facilities consistent with their gender identity.\n\nThe measure is the first statewide referendum to put the question of protections for transgender people in voters' hands. In 2015, Houston voters repealed a citywide anti-discrimination ordinance protecting gender identity in public accommodations; this year, Anchorage voted to retain theirs.\n\n\"This victory is one for the history books. Tonight, Massachusetts became the first state in the country to uphold transgender protections at the ballot box!\" Freedom Massachusetts tweeted Tuesday.\n\nWhat the law does\n\nOpponents of the law say the referendum was about protecting public safety and privacy.\n\nThe group that brought the question, Keep MA Safe, said the law lets people \"self-identify\" however they wish, leaving the door open for people to impersonate members of the opposite sex for unlawful purposes, such as entering public restrooms to harass or assault women and children.\n\nKeep MA Safe feared that could lead to situations that result in criminal or civil penalties for those who complain about misuse of single-sex facilities, the group's spokeswoman Yvette Ollada said.\n\nNo official data exists to support either of these claims. Research compiled by the National Center for Transgender Equality shows that transgender people are the ones who are more likely to experience violence or harassment for using restrooms that match their gender identity. Advocates say laws such as the one in Massachusetts are necessary for their safety.\n\nState issues guidance\n\nIn guidance issued after the law took effect two years ago, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office emphasized that it does not protect anyone who engages in improper or unlawful conduct in a restroom or elsewhere.\n\nThe guidance says places of public accommodation should not assume a person's gender identity based solely on appearance, and noted that \"misuse of sex-segregated facilities is exceedingly rare.\"\n\nOllada said the law puts the onus on a patron to confront the person they suspect of misusing a restroom. But neither the law nor the attorney general's guidance suggest that a customer should take such action.\n\nIf a patron suspects another person of using a facility improperly, the guidance directs businesses to assess the claims. If the business has reason to believe a person is misusing a facility, they can ask the person to produce state-issued identification or a letter from a health care provider, clergy or friend attesting to their gender identity.\n\nCivil rights activists say the referendum is the latest effort to undercut civil rights for transgender people using the bathroom predator myth", "During the live portion of the show, Colbert put the Democrats victory in the House in perspective.\n\n\"The Democrats have taken control of half of one of the three branches of government,\" Colbert said. \"All the GOP has is the other half of Congress, the Supreme Court and a President who does whatever he wants.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel opened his live show on ABC by saying that Tuesday felt like \"America is in the doctor's office waiting for our STD results to come back.\"\n\n\"No matter what happens, whether you are Republican or Democrat, I think we can all agree that the big loser this year is all of our Thanksgiving dinners,\" the host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" said. \"Thanksgiving is ruined.\"\n\nKimmel then mentioned that the Democrats flipped the House like \"it was a three-bedroom craftsman in Echo Park\" and that Trump was reportedly blaming Paul Ryan for the loss of the House.\n\n\"He is said to be so disappointed in the speaker of the House, he might start calling him 'Don Jr.,'\" the TV host joked.\n\nKimmel also commented on Sen.

Scott Walker from office, CNN can project, denying the Republican a third term and accomplishing something Democrats have long looked to achieve.\n\nEvers, the Wisconsin state superintendent of public instruction, hammered Walker throughout the campaign as a career politician who has been around too long with too few results. Evers, like Democrats across the country, ran in clear opposition to the Republican health care plan, but he also seized on the widely held view in the state that education had suffered under Walker.\n\nThe governor was on defense for much of the campaign, accusing Evers of being a Democrat who wants to raise taxes on all Wisconsinites and arguing that he was wrong about his health care attacks.\n\nAlthough Walker ran in parallel with Trump for much of the campaign -- the President visited Mosinee, Wisconsin, in late October to rally with Walker -- Evers declined to seize on anti-Trump sentiment in the state and instead argued Trump had little to do with his campaign.\n\n\"I don't care about Donald Trump.

would win gubernatorial races.\n\nThe numbers in each category tilted largely to Democrats, with 87 of the projected female House winners coming from the Democratic Party and 13 from the Republican side.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629

He is a former British member of Parliament and a former British foreign secretary. The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nThe cruel aphorism attributed to former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has too often proved true.\n\nAfter the surprise and welcome -- though belated -- call by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a ceasefire in Yemen, maybe the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi thugs has created a new mantra: one death can be the spark that forestalls the suffering of millions.\n\nIt is increasingly clear that the killing of Jamal Khashoggi was a terrible crime rather than an unfortunate tragedy. The feeble excuses from Saudi spokesmen, the changing and contradictory \"lines to take\", all speak to an old truth: the danger that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. No one seems to think that King Salman ordered the killing, so his son, Mohammed bin Salman, needs to explain his role.\n\nThe focus of the international community on this murder, and its demands for accountability, cannot however be limited to this one case. The callous disregard for one life should be an alarm bell about decisions by the same government that are affecting the lives of millions. This is where the ceasefire call by Secretary Pompeo could be so significant.\n\nI recently visited Yemen . It is immediately clear that the world's worst humanitarian crisis is in fact a political crisis.\n\nThe humanitarian suffering is not a natural tragedy but a man-made catastrophe. After nearly four years of war, precipitated by the coup by the Houthis, and thousands of airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition in retaliation, Yemen has been brought to its knees.\n\nThe current Saudi war plan is making things worse. The bombing campaign from the air causes carnage, but cannot shift the Houthi fighters dug in amongst the local population. No one is winning, except Al Qaeda and ISIS, who gain foothold wherever there is chaos.\n\nSo Saudi Arabia's allies in the war effort, led by its closest partners the US and UK, need to deploy their political and military leverage to end the current war strategy. Already, the Saudi-led coalition has intensified its push for Hodeidah in the days since Pompeo's statement in an attempt to change military facts on the ground.\n\nJUST WATCHED Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Starving girl who became iconic symbol dies 02:52\n\nSecretary Pompeo's ceasefire call needs to be codified immediately in a new UN Security Council resolution. This would stop the increasing violence, would allow humanitarian relief to flow, vital services to be delivered, and the political process essential to a sustainable peace to be driven forward. Britain is the \"pen holder\" on this file at the Security Council and has no excuse for inertia.\n\nMilitary support from the UK and US for the war strategy should stop forthwith to keep this from being a rhetorical exercise. Germany has set an example by cutting off sales, but doesn't have the same influence.\n\nThis move needs to be backed up by other measures. All of Yemen's critical sea ports must be allowed to function at full capacity and Sana'a airport must be opened to critical humanitarian and commercial traffic. Salaries must urgently be paid to the 1.2 million civil servants across the country, including the doctors and nurses, to provide life-saving assistance to the millions in need.\n\nThere needs to be practical measures to make peace sustainable. Treatment of the wounded and prisoner swaps are obvious candidates.\n\nThere is also the tougher question of accountability for war crimes that have been documented by the UN.\n\nAt the Senate's request, the US Administration is reviewing sanctions against those responsible for Khashoggi's death. This is one avenue for the pursuit of justice which should be widened to include violations of international law in Yemen.\n\nPressure on the Saudis and their coalition partners alone is not enough. The Houthis and their backers must also feel the squeeze to come to the table in good faith. As Germany is soon joining the UN Security Council, it can use its credibility and links to good effect.\n\nThe experienced diplomat Martin Griffiths, special envoy of the UN Secretary General, needs substantive, not just rhetorical, backing. There is a landing zone for peace talks, including assurances about an end to missile strikes from the Houthis, backed by Iran, into Saudi Arabia. But the continued fighting is at best delaying his essential peace-making. At worst, it's making peace impossible.\n\nThe suffering in Yemen has gone unacknowledged for far too long - and has emboldened those willing to act with impunity. Jamal Khashoggi's legacy should be accountability not just for the suffering of one, but of millions.", "Washington DC (CNN Business) Halfway through Election Day, a video purporting to show votes being switched by a machine at a polling place in Ohio began to go viral on Twitter.\n\nExcept it turned out the video was fake. Election officials in Ohio, where the video was taken, quickly pointed out that the timestamps on the receipts shown in the clip made clear that no votes were inaccurately recorded.\n\nFacebook removed the video from the main site and from its subsidiary Instagram.\n\nBut the video continued to thrive on Twitter.\n\nA spokesman pointed CNN to a tweet from the New York Times debunking the video.\n\nTwitter has been criticized in recent weeks for failing to respond to complaints about Cesar Sayoc, who was reported multiple times in the months before he was arrested in October and charged with sending pipe bombs to senior Democratic politicians as well as CNN.\n\nEarlier this year, the company was the last major platform to ban the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\n\nThroughout 2018, Twitter pledged to combat false information targeting voters. But the company failed to act against a false video that was sowing doubt and confusion on Election Day.\n\nHow the video is false\n\nThe Election Day video was posted by an anonymous Twitter account that appeared to be connected with a supporter of the Qanon conspiracy theory.\n\n\"More voter fraud in Ohio. Why is it that all the errors are always the Democrats?? Because the only way they can win is if they cheat!! This madness needs to stop,\" text accompanying the video read.\n\nThe video purported to show a paper ballot recording a vote for the Democratic candidate for governor after a voter presses the button for Republican Mike DeWine. It's unclear who filmed it.\n\nMore voter fraud in Ohio. Why is it that all the errors are always the Democrats?? Because the only way they can win is if they cheat!! This madness needs to stop.\n\n\n\nSee something say something!!@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @VP @DHSgov @FBI do something. pic.twitter.com/CcMO6HPFza \u2014 WWG1WGA (@findtruthQ) November 6, 2018\n\nAaron Sellers, a spokesman for Franklin County Board of Elections, said the machine involved had a paper jam and has since been taken offline.\n\n\"The voter that made the video checked in at 10:05 a.m.,\" Sellers said. \"If you look on the video she's voting for DeWine and the paper tape is showing (a vote for) Cordray. That vote occurred at 9:39 a.m.\"\n\nHe said the voter requested help from a poll worker. \"She hadn't completed her ballot yet so they were able to cancel her out. They moved her to another machine, she was able to vote and go on her way,\" Sellers said. \"That machine was taken off line and it had a total of 29 votes cast on it.\"\n\nA DHS official said in a call with reporters that Ohio officials had alerted the agency to the video. DHS in turn notified Twitter.\n\n'Rapid response'\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, speaking on a call with reporters, a DHS official said that disinformation relating to the election had \"been rapidly addressed\" by social media platforms.\n\nFacebook said it had removed posts falsely claiming that Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents were patrolling polling locations looking for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe rumor had previously been confirmed to be false by ICE. The agency tweeted last month, \"ICE does not patrol or conduct enforcement operations at polling locations.

Dean Heller in Nevada, CNN can project, delivering a key Senate pick up for Democrats.\n\nHeller's campaign was defined by his awkward dance with President Donald Trump, someone that the senator flip-flopped on throughout the President's first two years in office.

election that -- despite its significance -- exposed the limitations of both parties for 2020. CNN commentators weigh in on the outcome and what comes next. Their opinions are their own.\n\nHeather Cox Richardson: Blue wave will radicalize Republicans\n\nThe blue wave happened Tuesday, and it was a big one. The congressional map was bad for the Democrats this year, with five Democratic senators running for re-election in states Donald Trump won by more than 19 percentage points. But the Democrats won control of the House, making it younger, darker and more female as they took at least 26 seats.\n\nBut gerrymandering means the Democrats' relatively small majority in the House does not reflect reality: The Democratic margin of the popular vote was more than 9 percentage points, comparable to the 10.6% Democratic margin during the presidential election year of 2008, and above the midterm wave years of 1994 or 2010 in which Republicans won a 7.1% and 7.2% popular margin, respectively.\n\nThe election has radicalized Republicans even further. They lost support in the Midwest and Rust Belt regions that were important to Trump's presidential victory, meaning there is little point in continuing to try to woo voters with economic arguments. But Republicans won in Texas and Florida, where their candidates ran campaigns that echoed Trump's racism and immigrant bashing. Structurally, Democratic pickups replaced less enthusiastic Trump supporters, moving the Republican leadership further right. It will embrace Trumpian tactics wholeheartedly.\n\nSo while Democrats now control key House committees for oversight of Trump's finances, the corruption scandals surrounding some of his Cabinet officers and his campaign's possible ties to Russia, Republicans have more incentive than ever to support the President and his agenda.\n\nRepublicans have to face the other key takeaway from the evening: If they are unpopular now, it will be worse in 2020. Voters on Tuesday restored the voting rights of 1.4 million Floridians who have been disenfranchised (Trump won Florida by about 100,000 votes); endorsed redistricting reform in Michigan, Colorado and Missouri; and took control of the Supreme Court of the heavily gerrymandered North Carolina, which will revisit that issue. Kansas rejected the gubernatorial bid of voter-suppression operative Kris Kobach, and Brian Kemp's suppression of votes in Georgia has attracted national disgust that bodes well for reform.\n\nThe wave looks more and more like a running tide. Expect Republicans to fight and claw to hold on.\n\n\n\n\"To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party.\" Heather Cox Richardson is a professor of history at Boston College. Her most recent book is\n\nCarrie Sheffield: Now Democrats must choose wisely what to do with their power\n\nCarrie Sheffield\n\nTuesday's Democratic victory for control of the House shouldn't come as a surprise, given that many of these felled GOP candidates were in districts where Hillary Clinton won and President Donald Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. But the Republican Senate gains and strong Florida and Georgia gubernatorial showings ran counter to the mainstream media bubble's narrative; elite media would be wise to self-reflect.\n\nAmerica is now at a juncture: Will a divided Congress collapse into a vitriolic abyss of presidential House impeachment (and subsequent Senate acquittal), endless House Russia conspiracy theories, subpoenas and baseless investigations? Or will Democrats and Republicans work together to fight the opioid crisis, rein in our deficit and reform our education and criminal justice systems?\n\nIf House Democrats choose the former, they will weary the American people and face a similar electoral outcome in 2020 to that of congressional Republicans in 2000 -- losses in both houses -- after they impeached President Bill Clinton. Americans signaled Tuesday night they want a bipartisan Congress, not a polarized one.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was penitent a day before this disappointing House finish: \"I would like to have a much softer tone,\" he told the Sinclair Broadcast Group. \"I feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint.\"\n\nSuburban voters, including many women, were key in flipping these House districts, and Trump is noticing. He'll need conservatives of every stripe to build on his agenda heading into 2020.\n\nCarrie Sheffield, a conservative commentator, is national editor for Accuracy in Media , a citizens' media watchdog.\n\nRoxanne Jones: Women leave a profound mark on 2018\n\nRoxanne Jones\n\nIf Tuesday proved anything it is this: Sisters are doing it for themselves, as the catchy '80s tune by the Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin goes. \"Standin' on their own 2 feet. And ringin' on their own bells.\"\n\nAnd ring the bells we did from sea to shining sea Tuesday as a record number of women -- mostly Democrats -- ran for office for the first time. And while women didn't win it all, we did compete strongly and registered wins in key congressional and municipal seats across the map. And when all the votes are counted, it's likely, more than 100 women in almost every demographic will be heading to Washington in January.\n\nIn a historic first, Massachusetts voters elected Democrat Ayanna Pressley, who will become the state's first black congresswoman.\n\nMichigan Democrats also turned out huge for women. The state elected women for every statewide office on Tuesday's ballot: governor, US senator, attorney general and secretary of state.\n\nNative American women also made history: Sharice Davids (Kansas) and Deb Haaland (New Mexico) elected to Congress -- a first for America.\n\nMuslim women have arrived: Detroit-born Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are headed to Congress -- the first Muslim women to do so.\n\nBut there were complications for progressive women. Georgia's Stacey Abrams has fought a good fight to become the nation's first black female governor -- some say with one hand tied behind her back -- against Republican nominee Brian Kemp, who as secretary of state is Georgia's top election official. Abrams has not conceded and has a slim chance of moving on to a runoff. Despite celebrity backers such as Oprah Winfrey, Abrams faced a wave of alleged voter suppression tactics, including lack of power cords for voting machines in majority-black voting precincts and a new \"exact match\" voting law, as well as a mass removal of tens of thousands of inactive voters from the state rolls.\n\nIf the Abrams race tells us anything, it is that voter suppression is real, and unless we can enact measures to protect voting rights , women such as Abrams will always have an uphill battle in states where old racial attitudes play a particularly antagonizing role.\n\nStill, women have left their mark in 2018. A record 257 of us ran for the House and Senate this year, according to The New York Times. Whether inspired by Hillary Clinton's historic presidential run (or Trump's), the Women's March, or the empowerment of the #MeToo movement, it's clear women are marching on Washington, and we are here to stay.\n\nRoxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has worked as a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

This is in large part because the Democratic party is still searching for its post-2008 identity. It wants to represent the young and diverse, but key leadership roles continue to be held by the old and the white, much like the Republican Party it chastises.\n\nIn 2010 and in 2014, Democratic incumbents seeking re-election distanced themselves from President Barack Obama's policies, not because they disagreed with them but because they weren't popular. As repulsive as some of Trump's rhetoric and policies may have been to Republicans over the past two years, you did not see the same level of retreat from them in this election as Obama experienced in his 2010 midterm shellacking. Which is why the Democrats' victory was not so resounding.\n\nSay what you will about the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, the reality is that it's effective because it is a clear, proactive message. What exactly was the Democratic Party's message in 2016? 2018? What will it be in 2020?\n\nLZ Granderson is a journalist and political analyst.

Before I mounted the stage, I asked Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi what she wanted me to say. \"Don't make it about President Trump,\" she cautioned, \"and certainly don't make it about me. Make it about the candidates and the volunteers and the voters.\"\n\nI tried to follow her wishes, but let me take a minute to praise her now. Nancy Pelosi was the subject of tens of thousands of attack ads. She was demonized, vilified, and caricatured. And yet she persisted.\n\nAnd now she has won. Nancy Pelosi, along with Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-New Mexico, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has taken back the House of Representatives, giving Democrats their first taste of real power on the federal level since Donald Trump was inaugurated.\n\nShe did it by maintaining grace under relentless pressure. With Lujan she recruited strong candidates who fit their districts: women, veterans, moderates. Most of all, she did it by keeping her eyes on the prize: making the election not about her -- nor, crucially, about Donald Trump -- but about the people of this country. Her slogan said it all: \"For the people.\"\n\nThere is an important lesson here for both parties. As the old saying goes, \"If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.\" Republicans didn't stand for anything. They didn't run on the strong economy. They didn't run on their corporate tax cut. They didn't run for anything. They just ran against Pelosi. And they lost.\n\nDemocrats, too, need to remember the lesson of this election. Led by Pelosi, they refused to fall into the impeachment trap, declined to base their message on hatred of Donald Trump. Instead, they ran on health care, Social Security, infrastructure, and education. Democrats stood for something. Republicans fell for anything.\n\nPaul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, which was a pro-Obama super PAC before it was a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC.\n\nMark Bauerlein: Conservatives will make their voices heard\n\nMark Bauerlein\n\nDemocrats should not be surprised to find that they just guaranteed six more years of President Trump.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m., Fox News called the House for the Democrats. Though Republicans will hold the Senate, any defeat is a serious wound for conservatism. Expect many leading House Democrats to spend more time now on eradicating the opposition through investigations, hearings, and impeachment than on crafting traditional liberal legislation. Democrats have raised health care and the poor during the campaign, but those traditional issues have been drowned out by allegations of the evils of their opponents.\n\nThe results trickled in during an anxious day and -- with so many races too close to call -- a breathless night. Why so tense?\n\nBecause, in 2018 America, only in politics is the battle of left vs. right unresolved. The big institutions are solidly lined up against believers in traditional sex roles, family values, God, and country. Hollywood doesn't like them, nor do Silicon Valley, academia, public schools, the art world, most newsrooms, big funders like the Ford Foundation and the Koch brothers, and corporate America, whose human resources tell social conservatives that their beliefs are backward and discriminatory. The Democratic Party got rid of pro-lifers years ago, and even most church leaders have made their peace with secular culture and leaned liberal.\n\nThat means the ballot box is the sole place where conservatives can fight and win. Every election, in that case, is existential. If conservatives lose, progressives have the chance to stamp out conservatism forever. If conservatives win ... well, they survive until the next election. Those were the stakes tonight. Elections are no longer who's-up-and-who's-down. They are: does-conservatism-live-or-die.\n\nThe Senate is still Republican, and every attempt the Dems make to discredit Trump won't pass the upper chamber.

And they can use the committee's subpoena power if necessary. Although Mueller is investigating these threads as well, the public will be able to get a fuller and more direct window into what took place through a congressional investigation, rather than having to rely only on piecemeal information revealed in criminal indictments from the special counsel investigation.\n\nMost importantly, when Mueller submits his final report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the House Judiciary Committee will be able to request it from the Department of Justice, and make it public if it deems that it is warranted. All of these actions will make it much harder for the White House to block or bury evidence of any alleged collusion or obstruction of justice, whether or not Mueller or Rosenstein are fired.\n\nAsha Rangappa is a senior lecturer at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs.

Trumpism lives on\n\nWilliam Howell\n\nNot a bad night for Donald Trump. Not at all. Having lost the House, the President won't be able to push forward much of a legislative agenda during the coming two years. Truth be told, though, he never had much of a legislative agenda. He's about to be pounded by investigations and subpoenas for all manner of misdoings. This is a President, though, who lives for the counterpunch. Meanwhile, Republican control of the Senate offers insurance against impeachment, and the support Trump needs to continue appointing conservatives to the judiciary.\n\nNothing about tonight's electoral returns meaningfully impinges upon the President's foreign policy. And with Congress divided, Trump can continue to exercise his unilateral powers as aggressively as ever -- eliminating business and environmental regulations, taking substantive and symbolic stands against immigration, delivering favors to key Republican constituencies. No midterm repudiation of this President tonight. No blue wave washing up on the White House doorstep. No mid-course correction. For that, we'll have to wait until 2020. For that, voters will need to vote Trump himself out of office. In the meantime, settle in America. Trumpism lives on.\n\nNayyera Haq: Now we double down to Make America Normal Again\n\nNayyera Haq\n\nOur country now has its first openly gay governor, from Colorado. The first Native American woman, the first and second Muslim women, and the youngest woman ever will be part of the largest cohort of women to join Congress. Changes are coming in from all levels of the political structure. The citizens of Florida voted to reinstate the voting rights of 1.4 million people -- former felons who had been denied the vote. Voters in Massachusetts defended the rights of transgender people in public spaces. Forget the demographic projections for 2050; America is definitively a different country today as a result of the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nPeople with a variety of identities that go well beyond straight, white, and male are changing the political structure in ways that have national implications. This reality about America will continue to scare Donald Trump and the people he relies on to keep his power. The President will double down on spinning stories of caravans of diseased terrorists coming to take away your guns and make your kids gay.\n\nWhen Trumpism gets worse, can we rely on this new crop of political leaders to bridge the divides in our country? Democrats in Congress will wage the necessary legal battles to protect our democratic institutions, but the rest of us will need to double down on the daily battle to Make America Normal Again. We need to transfer the energy from the ballot box into the social courage necessary to challenge hate, fear, and bigotry when it confronts our communities.\n\nNayyera Haq is a SiriusXM radio host and a former White House Senior Director and State Department spokesperson in the Obama administration.

His journey is only beginning. He has awakened the moribund Texas Democratic Party, which can now see a brighter future for candidates and fund-raising. The enthusiasm and hopefulness he generated also undoubtedly helped the election of the state's first two Latina congresswomen, and unseated longtime incumbent Republicans John Culberson of Houston and Pete Sessions of Dallas.\n\nO'Rourke may have lost only because he waited too long to broadcast attack ads against Sen. Ted Cruz. But he showed Democrats how to raise money without selling out to PACs and corporate interests, how to maintain your principles and win with a message of uniting Americans.\n\nAnd whoever wants to be the next Democratic president will need to consider Beto as a running mate.\n\nBiden-Beto 2020?\n\nOr maybe O'Rourke just needs to fire up his own presidential run.\n\nJames C.

Can this Congress do it?\n\nAli Noorani\n\nIn the end, President Trump's strategy of ignoring the center and playing to his base by ginning up anti-immigrant angst -- something we haven't seen from a White House in the modern era -- failed to keep suburban America in the Republican camp.\n\nDespite a strong economy and foreign policy wins, the Republicans went all-in on immigration, and as a result Democrats now control the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the context of divided government, where do we go from here on the vexing and complicated issue of immigration?\n\nDespite vitriol, division, and searing images of young children being separated from their parents, millions of Americans in suburban communities are looking for compromise. These are the voters who gave power back to the Democrats. They are the two-thirds of Americans that More in Common's research identified as the \"Exhausted Majority:\" they dislike polarization, they are largely ignored in a fragmented media environment, and, in fact, they are flexible in their views. And, most importantly, they seek leadership that can unify the country.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

When we show curiosity and empathy, we can build a coalition to make reforms most Americans support: improving the legal immigration system, bolstering security at ports of entry and at the borders, and extending citizenship to undocumented individuals who are already contributing to America.\n\nWe've gone through a tremendously difficult time, with newcomers pegged as scapegoats for global migration, economic changes, and new cultural norms.\n\nBut there's good news as we return to divided government: most Americans want progress -- and consensus -- on American immigration.\n\nCan Congress live up to this challenge?\n\nShan Wu: A cleansing blue wave made landfall\n\nShan Wu\n\nIn the months leading up to Tuesday night's midterm elections, the references to the blue wave emoji symbolizing a \"wave\" of hoped-for Democratic victories grew legion on social media like Twitter.

As they neared the midterm, these waves pulled back the surface waters of American life revealing underlying hatred, misogyny, racism and violence.\n\nThe Democratic Party's blue wave made landfall Tuesday night in a terrain-changing slew of victories in the House of Representatives.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) President Donald Trump loves to complain about how the media doesn't give him credit for his accomplishments. Well, let me correct that right now. Trump absolutely, unequivocally deserves credit for one big thing: Making the Democratic party great again. This achievement deserves its own hashtag #MDGA and maybe even a blue hat with the embroidered slogan that Trump could give away or, in traditional Trump fashion, sell on his website.\n\nIn fact, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders should send Trump a fruit basket or 10 for helping them succeed at something they haven't been able to achieve since 2010 -- taking control of the House. This alone is a tremendous accomplishment. Every House committee come January 2019 can have a Democrat as chair. The party will also be able to set the House's legislative agenda and engage in oversight of the Trump administration, including over Trump himself for possible violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause\n\nAnd Democrats won a handful of governorships that had been held by Republicans, including in Kansas where Democrat Laura Kelly beat Kris Kobach, who Trump had appointed to co-chair his now-abandoned voter fraud commission . All of that is thanks to the President. Although we can't take away from the great Democratic candidates we saw this election cycle who worked tirelessly to win, some of the candidates ran this year in reaction to Trump.\n\nAs I heard first-hand when speaking to Democratic congressional candidates, from New Jersey to Texas to California, on my SiriusXM radio show, Trump's election spurred them to want to do more than just vote or be active in local politics -- to seek congressional office as a form of resistance to his right-wing policies and his bigoted and sexist views. And as Emily's List, a Democratic organization that supports women candidates in favor of abortion rights, noted, the surge in interest by women to run for office in 2018 came in the aftermath of Trump's 2016 win.\n\nThat's why we saw so many firsts on Tuesday. We witnessed the first Muslim woman elected to Congress - in fact, the first two, Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, both Democrats. Then there's Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley and Connecticut's Jahana Hayes , who not only became the first black women to be elected to Congress from their respective states but from the entire New England region.\n\nBut despite Trump almost making the Democratic party completely great again (Democrats lost ground in the Senate), in fairness it can also be said that President Obama helped make the GOP great -- or at least helped rebuild itself. And the same case can me be made about George W. Bush helping rebuild the Democratic Party and even playing a role in Obama's 2008 victory.\n\nThe reality is that when voters want to send a message that they aren't happy with the President, they vote against the President's party in the midterm elections. Look what happened to Obama in his first midterm election in 2010 shortly after the ACA passed which then was very unpopular. Going into the 2010 election, Democrats controlled the House and the Senate. But after the votes were all counted, the Democrats lost a whopping 63 House seats and control of the House, plus six Senate seats. And by the time Obama left office, Democrats had lost control of the Senate and Republicans picked up nearly 1,000 state legislative seats overall.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSame scenario with Bush, but in his second midterm in 2006. Despite a solid economy, Bush's handling of the Iraq war soured Americans, leaving Bush with an approval rating in the area of 38% that election year. American voters sent Bush a message in that midterm election by making the Democratic Party pretty great again. The Democrats remarkably regained control of the House for the first time in 12 years in addition to seizing control of the Senate. And Democrats even flipped six governorships , taking control of 28 nationwide.\n\nNow the big question going forward is: Does Trump make the Democratic Party really great again by helping the party win the White House and control of the Senate in 2020? Given Trump's track record, I'd say there's a pretty good shot that the hashtag #MDGA will be trending come 2020.", "CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash take a look at a lineup of Democrats in the House of Representatives that could become the new chairs of congressional committees.", "(CNN) A week and a day after President Donald Trump's inauguration, Republican Rep.

And believe me, it's not to give positive input.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Brat, who's a well-known conservative figure in the House, lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger for those two reasons: women and health care. After her victory, Spanberger, a former CIA officer who ran on increasing health care coverage with a public health insurance option, will be the first woman to represent Virginia's 7th District.\n\nIt was just four years ago when Brat won one of the greatest political upsets in US history, toppling Republican Rep. Eric Cantor, the first House majority leader ever to lose a primary. The Randolph-Macon College economics professor won in part by attacking Cantor from the right on immigration, gaining the support of conservative media figures like Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Republican Reps.

Every morning, he leaves his home at 6.30 a.m. and will drive across the vast Indian capital of Delhi for the next 10 hours.\n\nRana, 42, is an auto rickshaw driver. The three-wheeled taxicabs, with their distinctive green and yellow livery, are a common sight on the streets of Delhi, where they provide a cheap and ready available means of transport on the city's heavily congested roads.\n\nThe job provides Rana with a steady income to help support his family, but it comes with a risk -- especially during winter -- when the city's already toxic air becomes even more lethal.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the day after Diwali , the Hindu festival of lights that is celebrated with fireworks, parts of the capital reported levels almost 40 times those considered \"safe\" by the World Health Organization.\n\n\"I have trouble breathing. By the time I return home, I have chest pain, I'm coughing,\" Rana, who has been a auto rickshaw driver for 24 years, told CNN of his experience driving during the winter smog.\n\n\"Now, when I cough, I assume it is because of the pollution.\"\n\nAuto rickshaw drivers pass a building site in Old Delhi.\n\nWorst in the world\n\nPollution in India is believed to be responsible for up to a million deaths a year. In Delhi, where the air is ranked among the the worst in the world, the risks are particularly acute for those whose jobs require them to be outdoors.\n\n\"What are our lives worth? We're prone to having breathing problems because we drive for 14 to 15 hours every day of the week,\" said Rahul Jaiswal, who has worked as an auto rickshaw driver for more than 20 years.\n\nThe sides of auto rickshaws are open to the elements, making drivers vulnerable to the effects of smog.\n\n\"We have been hearing in the news that breathing this air is like smoking 20 cigarettes so imagine what it's like for us,\" Jaiswal added.\n\nNaresh Kumar Rana spends up to ten hours a day exposed to Delhi's harmful air during the winter months.\n\nAccording to Jaiswal, there has been a clear deterioration in the city's air quality in recent years. \"This has been happening for the last five years, especially during the winter. The difference is huge.\"\n\nRohtas Singh, a Delhi Traffic Police officer, has also seen the air quality worsen. However, the impact on his health hasn't been as detrimental because he is provided with a special pollution mask.\n\n\"The mask provides relief. I have no health problems. I don't really have breathing troubles as I wear the mask in the mornings and evenings when the pollution is at its worse,\" said Singh.\n\nRana also tried using a pollution mask but found it offered him little relief. An effective mask like the one worn by Singh can cost around $20, a price too high for Rana, whose take home pay is equivalent to around $4 day.\n\nInstead, Rana ties a wet handkerchief around his face when driving during times of peak winter pollution.\n\nDelhi residents woke up to find the city under a thick layer of toxic pollution Thursday morning.\n\nDelhi's air quality worsens\n\nAir quality measurements provided by air quality monitoring stations track smog levels across the city in real time.\n\nThe past week has seen air quality in the city plunge. On Thursday, the air quality index reached levels of 999 in some parts of Delhi, the highest reading available before levels go \"off-the-charts.\"\n\nThose levels are based on the concentration of fine particle matter, known as PM2.5, per cubic meter. The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful because they are small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs, causing serious health risks.\n\nThe World Health Organization considers a PM2.5 density below 25 micrograms to be safe.\n\nLast month, the country's Supreme Court banned the sale of most firecrackers amid concerns that their use during the annual celebrations would again send pollution levels soaring.\n\nTraffic jams in Delhi are a routine occurrence, even on days with clean air.\n\nSystemic problems\n\nThe polluting pyrotechnics aren't the sole reason behind the toxic smog. In fact, aside from periods of intense use like Diwali, they don't have much of an impact.\n\nDelhi's pollution is driven by more systemic problems such as poor infrastructure and clogged roads, aggravated by the city's unfortunate geography.\n\nThe landlocked city sits in a natural bowl and is surrounded by industrial and agricultural hubs.\n\nWithout the coastal breeze of cities such as Mumbai and Chennai, much of the pollution settles.\n\nIn addition, every year, farmers across fertile neighboring states set fire to their fields to clear them for the next season.\n\nKnown as stubble burning, millions of tons of crop residue are set alight at a time of year that typically coincides with Diwali.", "(CNN) House Democrats are ready to unleash the full force of their oversight powers on the Trump administration, a political liability for the President that will come from a newly divided government in Washington.\n\nNow in the majority, Democrats are prepared to force Cabinet secretaries to testify, request President Donald Trump's tax returns and scrutinize some of the Trump's most controversial policy decisions that got little more than an eye-roll or harsh statement from Trump's fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNow that oversight will come under the hot lights of television cameras in high-octane Democratic-controlled hearings.\n\nIt's the moment Democrats have been waiting for.\n\n\"This election was about accountability,\" New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, who is expected to lead the Judiciary Committee next year, told CNN. \"Donald Trump may not like hearing it, but for the first time, his administration is going to be held accountable.\"\n\nThe preparations for a Democratic takeover have been underway for months.\n\nOne source familiar with the discussions said that \"it would have been malpractice\" not to be ready even as leadership encouraged members to exercise caution. The person described rigorous planning in which key oversight teams were communicating with each other \"every single day.\"\n\n\"Winning the majority is a mandate to provide a check and balance in the form of oversight and accountability that's been completely absent during two years of the Trump administration under Republican control of Congress,\" said. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia. \"But how we do it is what will be the test. We can't look like Torquemada in the Spanish Inquisition. It has to be fact-based, methodical, meticulous and well-grounded. And judicious. But I believe we are more than capable of doing that. We've done it before.\"\n\nWhere to look\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform committee will be at the center of the action. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland who is expected to lead the committee, plans to look at \"all the things the President has done that go against the mandates of our founding fathers in the Constitution.\"\n\n\"Right now, we have a president who is accountable to no one,\" Cummings told CNN.\n\nStill, Cummings insisted he would \"work very hard\" to approach his chairmanship in a deliberative and bipartisan manner. \"I don't want people to think we are going to rush in and beat up on Trump,\" he said.\n\nEven in the minority, Cummings sought to investigate potential violations of the Emoluments clause and whether the administration followed protocols when it came to their employees' security clearances. In the weeks leading up to the election, Cummings has accused Trump of being far more instrumental than first thought in the decision to keep the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, DC, as opposed to moving it to the suburbs, a move Democrats argued was so that Trump could ensure another developer wouldn't buy it and build something that would compete with Trump's nearby hotel.\n\nBut, the House Judiciary Committee will also have a major stake in the oversight game. Over the last few months, the panel's Democrats have sent dozens of letters on everything from the Trump administration's family separations on the Southern border to the rise of white nationalism to why the Justice Department has refused to defend the Affordable Care Act in a Texas court case.\n\nNadler, whose political fights with Trump stretch back decades over New York real estate politics, told CNN that his committee would probe many of those same issues they previously pressed Republicans to examine, including family separation, gun safety, environmental laws and the Justice Department's failure to defend the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"He's going to learn that he's not above the law,\" Nadler said of Trump.\n\nTrump's tax returns\n\nAnother top priority will be asking for Trump's tax returns. Rep. Richard Neal, the man expected to lead the House Ways and Means Committee, told CNN in October he plans to first ask Trump for them. If that fails, he will use an arcane IRS code to formally request them, a move that is expected to launch a months-long court battle.\n\n\"I think we would all be comfortable if this was done on a voluntary basis,\" Neal said. \"If they would resist the overture then I think you could probably see a long and grinding court case.\"\n\nCummings said Trump's tax returns would \"probably\" be pursued as part of his panel's Emoluments investigation as well, but predicted that the committees would coordinate their oversight efforts. \"The last thing we want to do is step on each other,\" he said.\n\n\"All of this is complicated because it's like coming upon an 88-car pile-up on the highway. It's hard to know where to begin,\" said Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the Judiciary and Oversight Committees.\n\nFor policy committees, expect even more oversight of federal agencies. The House Energy and Commerce committee will conduct oversight into the ways the Trump administration has weakened protections for people with pre-existing conditions at the Department of Health and Human Services. And, the House Natural Resources Committee's expected Chairman Raul Grijalva has said he wants to bring Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke before his committee after reporting that the Department of Justice is investigating the secretary.\n\n\"Secretary Zinke will be called to testify in February on why his conduct in office merited referral to the Justice Department, whether that referral was related to the recent attempted firing of his inspector general, and his many other failures and scandals,\" Grijalva said in a statement before the midterms.\n\nRussia\n\nThe new Democratic majority is also likely to result in a restarting of the congressional investigation into potential collusion between Trump's team and Russia, which House Republicans concluded in March.\n\nBut Rep. Adam Schiff, who is likely to become chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, isn't planning to re-launch a full blown investigation into Russia. That's because special counsel Robert Mueller is believed to be close to completing his work, and the Senate Intelligence Committee is also nearing the finish line of its own Russia investigation.\n\nAs a result, Democrats plan to wait to see what Mueller and the Senate find -- and what questions they believe are still unanswered, according to a senior House Democratic aide. They expect there could be several key issues that might go unanswered that they can continue to probe, including potential Russian money laundering, Trump's financial ties to Deutsche Bank and the number Donald Trump Jr. called when he dialed a blocked phone the while arranging the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting.\n\n\"The question, though, that I don't know whether Mueller has been able to answer, because I don't know whether he's been given the license to look into it, is were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization?\" Schiff told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last month. \"And that will be a very high priority to get an answer to. For the reason that, if they were doing this, it's not only a crime, but it's something provable.\"\n\nOf course, one unanswered question that could change Democrats' planning is that they don't know what form the end result of the special counsel will take, if his findings will even be provided to Congress and who might be supervising the special counsel investigation if Attorney General Jeff Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein leave the Justice Department.\n\nDOJ regulations don't require that Mueller's findings are provided to Congress, and if they are not sent to Capitol Hill, it's likely to be one of the biggest early fights between the new Democratic House and the Trump administration.\n\nWill the White House cooperate?\n\nOne outside White House ally predicted an \"long fight\" over subpoenas from Democratic investigations between lawmakers and the Trump administration, but said the White House might be inclined to cooperate more than some might expect.\n\n\"Why give them a needle when you can give them the haystack?\" the ally said, suggesting that document dumps might drown Democrats in so much paperwork that it keeps them occupied for months.\n\nSeparately, another White House official acknowledged that they will need a coordinated campaign between legal and communications teams to fight back in public. Much of this response is expected come down to what new White House counsel Pat Cipollone advises, the official said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - El representante dem\u00f3crata por Colorado Jared Polis ser\u00e1 el pr\u00f3ximo gobernador del estado y con ello se convertir\u00e1 en el primer hombre p\u00fablicamente gay en obtener una gubernatura en Estados Unidos, seg\u00fan proyecciones de CNN.\n\nD\u00eda de elecciones en EE.UU.: lo que debes saber minuto a minuto\n\nPolis suceder\u00e1 en el cargo al dem\u00f3crata John Hickenlooper y vencer\u00e1 al candidato republicano Walker Stapleton.\n\nLa gobernadora dem\u00f3crata de Oregon Kate Brown, quien se identifica como bisexual, fue la primera persona de la comunidad LGBT en ser elegida como gobernadora.

The views expressed are solely their own.\n\nRaul Reyes: Chances are, we have not heard the last from Beto\n\nOn Tuesday, just hours before the polls closed in Texas, Beyonce made a surprise endorsement for Democrat Beto O'Rourke over Republican Ted Cruz in the race for Texas senator. Maybe Queen Bey should have weighed in a little sooner. Maybe O'Rourke should have run a more traditional campaign, instead of refusing to run negative ads. Maybe O'Rourke should have worked harder at winning over Republican voters, rather than focusing on identifying new voters.\n\nThe \"what-if's\" will no doubt linger around O'Rourke's candidacy for a long time, as incumbent Cruz defeated him in the Lone Star State by single digits. Though O'Rourke excited voters in a way reminiscent of Barack Obama, this was not Beto's night. His narrow defeat was a heartbreaker for Democrats who have long dreamed of turning this state blue.\n\nStill, this has been an extraordinary campaign, one that O'Rourke can and should be proud of. If he had run a conventional campaign, it likely would not have captured national attention, inspired Texas Democrats and made \"Beto\" a household name . O'Rourke should be pleased with the fact that he has awakened the state's Democrats. Just the fact that, until around 10 p.m. Tuesday night, the race was seen as a tossup is an accomplishment in itself.\n\nO'Rourke has shown that a progressive Democrat can mount a serious challenge in a red state. He has brought in thousands of first-time voters, among them many Latinos and millennials. And he did this while refraining from personal attacks and staying true to his inclusive values.\n\nTed Cruz likely benefitted from the structural electoral advantages that Republicans enjoy in Texas -- as well as a healthy dose of political tribalism. But thanks to his charisma and sharp political instincts, O'Rourke has made a substantial impact on Texas politics. He is well-positioned to challenge Sen. John Cornyn, or even consider a presidential run. Chances are, we have not heard the last from Beto.\n\nRaul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes\n\nJennifer L. Lawless: Three lessons from Texas 23\n\nRepublican incumbent Will Hurd's win over Gina Jones in Texas' 23rd Congressional District race demonstrates three important lessons about the midterms.\n\nFirst, TX-23 is one of the 23 House districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but which sent a Republican to Congress. Both parties were laser-focused on this year's race because it was prime real estate to flip. The fact that the GOP held it yet the Democrats still found a path to control the House highlights the importance of broadening the electoral map. A loss in TX-23 would have been devastating for Democrats had fewer districts been in play.\n\nSecond, a compelling profile can only take a candidate so far. Gina Jones' background was a progressive Democratic voter's dream come true. She's young. She's gay. She's a woman of color. She's an Iraq War veteran. But even if she motivated and energized Democrats, there weren't enough of them in the district.\n\nThird, Hurd's win isn't synonymous with a Donald Trump victory. Hurd isn't a Trump acolyte. He differs from the President on DACA and the border wall (not surprising given that the district is 55% Hispanic). And as a former CIA official, he's condemned the administration for how it handled Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hurd didn't embrace Trump and managed to eke out a win, probably to the president's chagrin.\n\nTX-23 reminds us that even in a nationalized election, some politics are still local.\n\nJennifer L. Lawless is the Commonwealth Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nJulian Zelizer: Trumpism was victorious in Tennessee\n\nTennessee produced an important victory for Trumpism, a Republican agenda that revolves around nativism, tariffs and nationalism -- as well as an unorthodox style of governance. The state's Senate race was perceived by both parties as a good test of what kind of impact Trump was having in territory that was friendly to him in 2016.\n\nDemocrats were hoping that the former governor, Phil Bredesen, a moderate and beloved politician, could defeat the conservative Representative Marsha Blackburn, a close ally of Trump.\n\nAnd Bredesen put up a good fight. He stuck to whatever center still exists in American politics -- supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh and saying he wouldn't vote for Sen. Chuck Schumer as the party leader. But the fact that he could not pull this off will be deflating.\n\nIf the Senate remains in Republican hands, the administration and the Republican leadership will certainly read into the results signs that the last month's aggressive partisan strategy worked -- play to the base, be as rightward as possible and do not cede anything to moderation.\n\nThe message from Tennessee will also have an effect on Democrats, as they start sorting through what kind of candidates they want to run in 2020 -- with an inevitable battle between those who favor centrists and those who want progressives. Bredesen's inability to pull off a victory in Tennessee means there is little hope that anyone else in the party can.\n\nWith Tennessee, even in an evening when Republicans suffered in swing House districts, score one for Trumpism.\n\nJulian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\"\n\nSally Kohn: Georgia's 6th District reminds us why every vote matters\n\nWhen Democrat Lucy McBath announced her candidacy to unseat Republican incumbent Karen Handel in Georgia's 6th, no one really thought the flight attendant turned gun control advocate had a chance. After all, Handel had won her seat in the fiercely contested special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff in June 2017. While Ossoff broke fundraising records and almost became a national rock star, Handel ultimately won by more than 3 percentage points.\n\nGeorgia's 6th District -- the one that once sent Republican Newt Gingrich to Congress -- is historically red and 60% white. McBath is a black woman who rose to prominence as a voice in the Black Lives Matter movement after her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed by a white man at a gas station after an argument over the volume of music playing in the teen's car.\n\nSo what happened in the election? As of Thursday morning, McBath won. What's more, it appears turnout in the district this midterm election nearly matches that of 2016 , which is highly unusual.\n\nIn addition, a strong base of volunteers showed up for both McBath and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, at the top of the state ticket. What really seems to distinguish this election is the level of sustained and enthusiastic grassroots support across the country. Trump supporters may have shown up in big numbers to attend rallies in airport hangars, but Democrats knocked on millions of doors, made millions of calls and mobilized in ways that will continue to shake politics in this country. That surge of progressive grassroots action is just beginning. George Goehl, the director of People's Action, rightly called the midterm results a \"people's wave.\"\n\nThat's in a state where allegations of voter suppression were widely reported, especially after Georgia's secretary of state and Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp canceled more than 1.4 million voter registrations since 2012, according to The Associated Press . Republicans and Trump made clear in this election that they're willing to fight dirty by spreading hate or actively discouraging people from voting. And the Georgia 6th race reminds us why every vote matters.\n\nSally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \"The Opposite of Hate.\"\n\nJeff Yang: Never underestimate a well-run Democratic campaign\n\nIn a night where the Democratic Party's hope for a blue tidal wave was tempered by a redder-than-expected reality, Antonio Delgado's victory in New York's 19th Congressional District was a sterling example of how the traditional combination of an appealing candidate, methodical grassroots organizing, and, of course, an ample war chest is still the formula for success in demographically challenging areas.\n\nDelgado, running as a pragmatic progressive in a rural, 84% white district that Trump won, set incumbent John Faso back on his heels with his ability to fund-raise and with competitive results in early polls.\n\nRepublicans tried to fight him by playing the racial fear card, running an ad referring to Delgado as an ex-rapper whose profane lyrics and left-wing politics showed him to be out of touch with the values of the community -- obscuring Delgado's status as a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar.\n\nThe ads may have backfired; at the least, they led to articles shaming Faso's clumsy attempt at race-baiting in the New York Times, Washington Post, New York magazine and local papers like the Times-Union. This allowed Delgado to avoid directly responding to the attacks, while focusing on more pertinent concerns for the district, such as health care, a topic on which Faso, who had voted to kill Obamacare, was already vulnerable. The victory polishes Delgado's status as a potential rising star in the Democratic Party -- which the party needs, given its lackluster bench going forward into 2020 and beyond.\n\nJeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications, and the co-host of the podcast \"They Call Us Bruce.\"\n\nScott Jennings: Progressives cannot win in Kentucky\n\nRepublican incumbent Andy Barr in Kentucky's 6th Congressional District found himself in a dogfight with Democratic challenger Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot who came home to storm her primary and give Democrats hope in a district that covers Kentucky's beautiful bluegrass region.\n\nBut Barr brought in a wingman -- President Donald Trump -- and defeated McGrath in one of the closest congressional races in recent Kentucky history.\n\nTrump rallied for Barr in Madison County, where thousands packed an arena on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond. And when the votes were tallied on election night Madison delivered for Barr, giving him 59% of the vote and a nearly 7,000-vote margin.\n\nRepublican turnout in the district's rural counties overcame McGrath's strong showing in Fayette County, the urban heart of the district. There was some Republican handwringing over whether Barr should cleave so closely to Trump, but the campaign made the correct call and used the President in just the right way, giving Barr his happy landing.\n\nThis campaign showed the value of opposition research. Insiders say McGrath had a double-digit polling lead during the summer, but crashed back to earth when the Barr campaign unleashed tapes of her talking to liberal donors at out-of-state fundraisers.\n\n\"I am further left, I am more progressive, than anyone in the state of Kentucky,\" McGrath told her donors in one speech, a clip of which appeared in numerous sidewinders fired off by Barr and the Republicans in their ad barrage. Note to future candidates: everything you say anywhere might follow you home.\n\nMcGrath's strong showing could make her a player for a future contest, perhaps a state office in 2019 or a run for US Senate in 2020 or 2022 when senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul next face the voters, respectively. But given the damage the opposition research did to McGrath's image in a purplish district like Kentucky's sixth, it's hard to imagine her words playing any better throughout the redder portions of Kentucky.\n\nTrump will be at the top of the ticket in 2020, and his alliance with McConnell will make it hard for any self-professed progressive to overcome the President and Senate majority leader in a state that's among the most receptive to the #MAGA agenda.\n\nScott Jennings, a CNN contributor, is a former special assistant to President George W.

Beto O'Rourke's grassroots turnout operation,and energizing message helped bring more Democrats to the polls and helped Lizzie Fletcher defeat John Culberson in Texas' 7th Congressional District.\n\nFletcher ran a smart race focused on health care and Culberson's votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And she successfully appealed to the anger and frustration of women in the Houston suburbs, including independent and Republican women, who were eager to send a message to President Donald Trump.\n\nThis race also showed that, once again, Democrats can come together after a bruising primary contest -- even one where the national party ham-handedly weighed in with opposition research against the primary candidate they viewed as weaker. Whether or not it was the right tactic, the Democrats ended up with the nominee they wanted and a nominee who won a crucial southern seat.\n\nJen Psaki, a CNN political commentator, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration.

Gary Johnson came up well short in his third-party bid for New Mexico's Senate seat -- a familiar outcome for the Libertarian presidential aspirant.\n\nJohnson, who previously earned 3% of the national popular vote in the 2016 presidential election, entered New Mexico's Senate race in early August. He took an early lead over Republican candidate Mark Rich, but trailed incumbent Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich. An early Emerson College poll put Johnson at 21% vs. Rich's 11% and Heinrich's 39%. That turned out to be the high-water mark for Johnson; his support collapsed in subsequent polls. News outlets called the race on Tuesday night for Heinrich.\n\nIt's tough out there for third-party candidates. Dissatisfied voters who plan to spurn the two major parties often come around and cast a lesser-of-two-evils vote for one or the other. Johnson, for instance, was polling at 10% at various points in 2016, but the final tally -- while still the strongest showing for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot -- was just over 3%.\n\nJohnson's loss is not unexpected, but it's still a pity. An independent senator willing to challenge Trump and the Democratic Party would have been a welcome change of pace. Alas, the two-party duopoly is tough to break, no matter how many Americans would prefer a wider variety of choices.\n\nRobby Soave writes for the libertarian magazine Reason . Follow him on Twitter @robbysoave\n\nHaroon Moghul: Ojeda represented something unusual\n\nI wanted Richard Ojeda to win, not just because he is a Democrat, but because he represented something as important as it is unusual. A one-time Trump supporter, the military veteran switched sides, not out of crass political calculation -- West Virginia, whose 3rd Congressional District he ran in, is obviously not a blue state -- but out of genuine conviction. He believed, and rightly, that the President was not keeping his promises, that his fellow West Virginians were better represented by a party that cared for and fought for them. Ojeda represented, in other words, the possibility of partisan fluidity.\n\nIt may be that, in a district where he had little, if any, realistic chance of victory, there is no larger lesson to be learned. It could be, though, that this speaks to a disquieting obstacle; that, come 2020, Democrats will be doomed by a terrible trinity: gerrymandering, an Electoral College that slights majorities and party loyalty impossible to transcend.\n\nBut in the same state where Ojeda lost to Carol Miller, the state Trump won by a whopping 42%, Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin held on. However, Manchin voted to confirm Kavanaugh. That's another kind of partisan fluidity.\n\nBe careful what you wish for.\n\nHaroon Moghul is Fellow in Jewish-Muslim Relations at the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America, and author of \"How to be a Muslim: An American Story.\"\n\nErrol Louis: DeSantis benefited from the Trump boost\n\nAndrew Gillum's potential loss to Ron DeSantis in the race for Florida governor continues a pattern: Democrats, who have frequently carried the Sunshine State in presidential contests, have not won the governor's mansion since 1998, despite coming within 1% of victory three times.\n\nThe race was nasty from the very start, with DeSantis drawing criticism for warning supporters not to \"monkey this up\" by losing to Gillum -- a statement immediately condemned as racist by DeSantis critics.\n\nGillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, at first looked like the candidate to change the Democrats' luck. He led in 34 out of 37 polls leading up to election day; the final pre-election sounding by NBC News/Marist found Gillum leading DeSantis by a healthy 50% to 46%.\n\nGillum rolled up decent majorities in urban areas, including Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami and his base in Tallahassee. But last-minute campaigning by President Donald Trump boosted the turnout for DeSantis in Republican strongholds, as well as many suburban and exurban communities surrounding the Democratic cities.\n\nOne bright sign on the horizon for Democrats is the passage of a voter referendum that abolishes Florida's onerous practice of banning ex-felons from voting for life unless a special pardon was granted. The restoration of voting rights could add more than 1 million voters to the rolls. That could be a game-changer in a future race.\n\nErrol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel.\n\nTara Setmayer: It may be another generation before we see a New Jersey GOP Senator\n\nDemocratic incumbent Bob Medendez won his third term handily, despite his ethics-plagued tenure. His Republican challenger, Bob Hugin, tried to make the race a referendum on Menendez's scandals by spending $36 million of his own money in what became one of the nastiest Senate races in the country. Hugin spent millions on TV ads alone, hammering Menendez on his alleged corruption and outspending the incumbent two to one . But he could not overcome Trump's unpopularity in a state where the blue wave crashed ashore with a vengeance.\n\nHugin gave Democrats a scare when he pulled within single digits of Menendez, prompting the party to infuse almost $8 million into a race that shouldn't have been competitive in the first place. Menendez's ethical issues in office created lukewarm support for him within the party. Democrats were already in a tough spot defending multiple Senate seats in red states that Trump won in 2016. The last thing they wanted to do was spend that kind of money in a reliably blue state like New Jersey. It took home state elected officials like Senator Cory Booker and Governor Phil Murphy to use their political capital to convince reluctant Democrats to hold their noses and support Menendez.\n\nGiven how well Democrats performed in New Jersey, turning three long-time Republican congressional districts blue, it may be another generation before we see a GOP senator from the Garden State.\n\nTara Setmayer, a CNN political commentator, is the host of the \"Honestly Speaking with Tara\" podcast.

Steve King won a ninth term to Congress in his toughest campaign yet, defeating a strong challenge from J.D. Scholten, despite criticism from his own Republican colleagues over his comments this year criticizing diversity in the United States, as well as George Soros, a Jewish billionaire and Democratic donor.\n\nWith 99% of precincts reporting, CNN projected King won the deeply conservative district with 50.6% of the vote to 46.8% for his Democratic challenger JD Scholten. In 2016, King cruised to victory with over 61% of the vote.\n\nLast month, The Washington Post reported that King questioned the value of diversity in an interview with Unzensuriert, \"a publication associated with Austria's Freedom Party, which was founded by a former Nazi SS officer and is now led by Heinz-Christian Strache, who was active in neo-Nazi circles as a youth.\" The Post noted that, \"the party has distanced itself from those connections\" but \"recently embraced a hard-line anti-immigration stance while seeking ties with other far-right parties and leaders abroad.\"\n\nIn the interview, King said, \"diversity is not a strength\" and asked, \"what does it bring that we don't have that is worth the price?\"\n\nKing suggested in the same interview that Soros has propped up a range of liberal causes and speculated that he may have funded the Women's March.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Thursday meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been postponed, the State Department said, a potential setback in the seemingly stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\nThe State Department announced the decision to reschedule the meeting in the middle of the night as results from the US midterm elections were coming in.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert did not offer an explanation as to why the talks would be postponed, but two diplomatic sources told CNN that the move was clearly a signal that North Korea has not been willing to cooperate with the US's expectations up to this point.\n\nThe US has been looking for some sort of concession from Pyongyang -- such as opening sites connected to its nuclear program for inspections -- before going forward with a second summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim, the two sources said.\n\nThe sources \u200etold CNN that North Korea, for its part, is looking for the US to offer something before moving forward, but that the US has not been willing to give anything up first, such as easing the punitive sanctions levied on the Kim regime.\n\nRead More", "\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0642\u062f

He has pushed well beyond the boundaries of any rational concept of presidential behavior, to say the least.\n\nThis is why may politicos thought the 2018 midterm election was going to be a referendum. And it was, in a sense -- but not so much on Trump or the Republican Party as it was for a Democratic Party that continues to struggle to compose a message about what it is for as opposed to what it is against.\n\nJUST WATCHED Van Jones: This is heartbreaking Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Van Jones: This is heartbreaking 01:26\n\nYes, the party took the House but the blue wave was not the tsunami party leadership had hoped it would be. This is in large part because the Democratic Party is still searching for its post 2008 identity. It wants to represent the young and diverse, but key leadership roles continue to be held by the old and the white, much like the Republican Party it chastises.\n\nIn 2010 and in 2014, Democratic incumbents seeking reelection distanced themselves from President Barack Obama's policies, not because they disagreed with them but because they weren't popular. As repulsive as some of Trump's rhetoric and policies may have been to Republicans over the past two years, you did not see the same level of retreat from them in this election as Obama experienced in his 2010 midterm shellacking. Which is why the Democrats victory was not so resounding.\n\nRead More", "Beijing (CNN) The Democrats have retaken the US House of Representatives, dealing a major blow to President Donald Trump's domestic agenda, but if anxious politicians in Beijing think that means a reprieve from the White House, they should think again.\n\nChina is one of the few policy areas where there is some bipartisan consensus. The Democrats broadly agree that the US should take tougher action against the rising power across a range of fronts, from the military, to trade, intelligence and diplomacy.\n\nDesperate for a solution to the trade war that is weighing on China's economy, there is a view in China that a Democrat-led House might mean a softer stance against Beijing.\n\nNick Marro, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that view was misguided because the Democrats have historically been more pro-labor unions and less in favor of unconstrained free trade than their opponents. \"It's unlikely that they'll push for greater trade engagement with China,\" he said.\n\nEven if the House wanted to, the power to slap tariffs on China is essentially vested in the executive -- that's President Trump. If he needs support from Congress on China policy in the future, the Democrats have shown few signs they'll stand in his way.\n\nAll this is bad news for Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose government has been scrambling to appease an increasingly hostile US administration, after attempts at flattery and acts of friendship early in Trump's term didn't quite deliver.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying declined to comment directly on the election result on Wednesday, saying regardless of the outcome China \"won't change its recognition of the importance of China-US relations.\"\n\nBeyond the economic implications, the optics of the row with Trump are also hurting Xi at home.\n\nWilly Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies and well-connected political analyst, said Xi has faced rare criticism from inside the ruling Communist Party for his handling of the US crisis.\n\n\"He has been widely criticized, not by name of course, but subtly, for failing to handle Trump's multi-pronged challenge. He's very much on the defensive,\" Lam said.\n\nJUST WATCHED The real cost of Trump's tariffs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The real cost of Trump's tariffs 03:09\n\n'Competitive and confrontational'\n\nThe trade war between the US and China that Trump ignited in the middle of the year steadily worsened over months, with tariffs now on more than $250 billion of Chinese goods.\n\nBut it was a landmark speech by US Vice President Mike Pence in early October that marked the start of a new aggressive policy against Beijing, sparking talk of a new Cold War.\n\n\"Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach to advance its influence and benefit its interests. It's employing this power in more proactive and coercive ways to interfere in the domestic policies of this country,\" Pence said in Washington on October 4.\n\n\"To put it bluntly, President Trump's leadership is working. China wants a different American President.\"\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, both Trump and Pence have accused China of trying to meddle in the November 6 elections, citing little proof. The claims have been roundly denied by Beijing.\n\nThe US leaders pointed to Chinese state media's placement of advertorials in US newspapers as evidence, but analysts say that practice is longstanding and pales in comparison with past Russian efforts at interference.\n\nAll this has led to a perception in China that Trump's criticisms against the country were merely a way to drum up the Republican vote ahead of the Tuesday's elections.\n\nTong Zhao, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said China had been \"over-emphasized\" in US politics of late.\n\n\"The sentiment is that the US is hyping up the competitive and confrontational nature of bilateral relations for the benefits of domestic politics.\"\n\nTense relationship\n\nBut the fear of a more powerful China in the United States is real. Trump made competitiveness with China a major part of his election campaign two years ago, and now it's not all about trade.\n\nIn addition to increasing military maneuvers near China's doorsteps, Trump appears to be using aid to counter China's influence in the world.\n\nJUST WATCHED Attorney General Jeff Sessions on China: Enough is enough Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Attorney General Jeff Sessions on China: Enough is enough 01:12\n\nTrump threatened to cut foreign aid before his election, but last month he signed off on the newly created US International Development Finance Corporation for developing nations in October, backed with $60 billion in loans and other assistance. That came just a month after Xi announced his own package of aid, investment and loans in Africa, also worth $60 billion.\n\nYet there is some cause for optimism. Trump and Xi's on-again-off-again friendship seems to have warmed after a phone call last Wednesday. It was their first conversation in months and came barely a week before the midterm elections, hinting at a thaw in relations.\n\nTrump tweeted about his \"long and very good conversation\" with Xi, and called the Chinese President \"great\" numerous times in a campaign rally speech after the call.\n\nBut Beijing has become familiar with Trump's fickle nature, and soon mixed signals began to creep into the White House messaging.\n\nWhile Bloomberg News, citing sources, reported that Trump had directed his Cabinet to draft a trade deal with Beijing, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the two countries were \"not on the cusp of a deal.\"\n\nTough line on China 'popular'\n\nThe idea that the Chinese government would pin its hope on the Democrats to ease tensions is remarkable, especially as Xi tightens his grip domestically and cracks down hard on anything perceived as dissent.\n\nFor decades, ever since President Richard Nixon made a historic visit to Communist China in 1972, it was his fellow Republicans -- more pro-business than the Democrats -- who tended to be China's closest allies in Washington.\n\nIn comparison, the Democrats -- who have traditionally tended to focus more on human rights issues in China -- were reluctant to let Beijing off the hook in the hopes of closer trade ties, a view that remains to this day.\n\nBut as frustration grew in the business community with China's perceived refusal to liberalize its economy, the Republicans also hardened their stance toward Beijing and business lobby groups cooled their pro-China stance.\n\n\"I don't think Beijing understands just how popular in DC a tougher line on China is,\" Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, told CNN.\n\n\"There is surprising bipartisan support in DC for a tougher, or some would say more fair, policy to China, especially on trade but also human rights.\"\n\nPanic in Beijing\n\nThe US midterms come at a time when Beijing finds itself more and more at a loss over how to deal with the increasingly hostile Trump administration.\n\nWhen Chinese ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai appeared on Fox News in mid-October, he was asked by host Chris Wallace who in the White House was running trade policy on China.\n\n\"You tell me,\" Cui replied, with a smile. \"(Diplomats) don't know who is the final decision maker. Of course, presumably the President would take the final decision, but who is playing what role? Sometimes it could be very confusing.\"\n\nChinese officials, who had viewed Trump as a politically naive transactional leader, were taken by surprise when relations with the US suddenly became tense in the latter half of the year. Now they are struggling to work out how to restore peace.\n\nBut Stone Fish said at the end of the day, Washington politics may not be the greatest problem looming for Xi, amid a growing number of domestic headaches for the Chinese leader.\n\nThe Communist Party's Politburo, one of the country's highest decision-making bodies, issued a statement last week acknowledging for the first time \"increased downward pressure\" on the economy.\n\nEven before Trump began his trade assault against China, the government was fiercely battling surging debt across the country as well as attempting to balance environmental protection with avoiding a slowdown in growth.\n\n\"Of concerns that Xi faces, the top 20 are much more domestically focused,\" Stone Fish said.\n\nIf both Xi and Trump are forced to turn further inward to address domestic turmoil, a diplomatic thaw may take some time to come.", "(CNN) Mike DeWine will keep the Ohio governor's office in Republican hands, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Richard Cordray in a race that tested whether the rightward drift that helped President Donald Trump win Ohio by 9 percentage points could last.\n\nThe two were running to replace outgoing Ohio Gov.

That bests the previous record of 85 representatives, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nFirst Native American women\n\nDemocrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will become the first Native American women elected to Congress, CNN projected. Davids' win in Kansas against GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder was a pickup for Democrats, who CNN projects to gain control of the House.\n\nHaaland will replace New Mexico Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who vacated the seat to run for governor.\n\nDavids is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and Haaland is an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna, according to their respective campaigns. Davids identifies as a lesbian, making her the first openly LGBT member of Congress from Kansas as well. She will enter Congress having previously worked as a lawyer and a former mixed martial arts fighter.\n\nFirst Muslim women\n\nCNN projected Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party will become the first Muslim women in Congress.\n\nVictories for both were expected following primary victories earlier this year.\n\nTlaib will fill the seat formerly occupied by Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers, who left office last year amid accusations of sexual misconduct. Omar will take the seat vacated by Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress. Ellison opted to run for Minnesota attorney general this year.\n\nOmar, in addition to being one of the first Muslim women in Congress, will also be the first Somali-American member. She came to the US more than two decades ago as a refugee.\n\nFirst openly gay man elected governor\n\nColorado Democratic Rep. Jared Polis' bid for governor will be successful , CNN projected, meaning the openly gay member of Congress will become the first openly gay man elected governor.\n\nPolis will succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is term-limited from seeking the office again, and will defeat Republican gubernatorial nominee Walker Stapleton.\n\nOregon Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, who identifies as bisexual, is already the first openly LGBT person to be elected governor. Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey came out as gay before he stepped down from office in the early 2000s.\n\nPolis was one of several LGBT candidates who ran for governor this cycle, along with Brown in Oregon, Vermont Democrat Christine Hallquist and Texas Democrat Lupe Valdez.\n\nFirst female senator from Tennessee\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn became the first female senator to represent Tennessee when she outlasted a challenge from former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who looked to run against his party to win in a state President Donald Trump won by 26 percentage points in 2016.\n\nBlackburn, a conservative lawmaker closely tied to the President, looked to nationalize the Senate race as much as possible, hoping to tap into the same conservatism that elected Trump in order to blunt some goodwill Bredesen had built up during his two terms as governor.

Any effort to impeach Trump would run smack into a trial in a friendly Senate.\n\nDemocrats' current leader, Nancy Pelosi, has said she is not interested in moving to impeach Trump, but that won't stop a lot of them from agitating for it; 77% of self-identified Democrats supported impeachment in the exit polls, compared with just 5% of Republicans and 33% of independents.\n\nSupport in the exit polls for impeaching Trump is nowhere near a majority, but as CNN has pointed out , 40% is much higher support for impeachment than most presidents face, including President Bill Clinton, who was actually impeached.\n\nSupport for impeachment is the highest in California, where 54% of 2018 voters back it, followed by New York with 52% support.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The Democratic Party regained control of the House of Representatives as a result of Tuesday's midterm elections, while the Republicans held firm control of the Senate. While a Democratic-controlled House now has the power to impeach the President, such a precipitous move is politically fraught, and likely will happen only if special counsel Robert Mueller delivers knockout evidence of criminality.\n\nIt is more crucial than ever, therefore, that Mueller be permitted to complete his investigation without political interference. Tuesday's seismic shift in power provides crucial -- though imperfect -- protection for Mueller against political forces that might seek to suppress or stifle his ultimate investigative findings.\n\nWith Tuesday's election results, the prospect of presidential impeachment just went from \"nil\" under a Republican House to \"unlikely but entirely possible\" with the Democrats in control. The Constitution requires only a simple majority in the House -- 218 of the 435 total votes -- to impeach.\n\nWhile the Democrats now can impeach the President unilaterally, there are practical and political risks to exercising that power. Practically, even if the House votes to impeach, the President can be removed only by a vote of two-thirds of the Senate. After Tuesday's vote, the Democrats do not have a Senate majority and are well shy of the 67 votes required to remove the President. Even a successful House vote to impeach could be a mere formality, given the infinitesimal chance of a significant number of Republican Senators turning on their own political leader.\n\nImpeachment also carries political risks. Former (and potential future) Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said recently that \"I don't think we should be talking about impeachment. ... On the political side I think it's a gift to the Republicans.\" Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have used the possibility of impeachment to rally political support and to motivate their base supporters. Indeed, history calls for political caution by Democrats: President Bill Clinton's favorability ratings increased 10 points to 73% following his 1998 impeachment, while only 35% of respondents approved the House's decision to impeach.\n\nThe political calculation will change drastically, however, if Mueller produces what prosecutors sometimes call a \"head shot\" -- irrefutable proof of a serious crime. Evidence has a way of changing minds and political calculus, quickly. Perhaps the most famous example is the Richard Nixon White House tapes. After a protracted legal battle in 1974, the United States Supreme Court ordered Nixon to produce tapes that had been made inside the White House to the special prosecutor. Those tapes contained stunning evidence that Nixon took part in a conspiracy to obstruct justice by paying witnesses \"hush money\" to remain silent. Nixon resigned several weeks later, under unbearable political pressure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mueller has or will develop similarly damning evidence against Trump, or even some lesser showing that could still justify impeachment or otherwise change the political landscape. Of course, Mueller knows far more than we do at this point, but we already know that he knows a lot. Mueller thus far has developed evidence strong enough to charge and convict Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former national security adviser Michael Flynn , personal attorney Michael Cohen (who pleaded before the Southern District of New York after a referral from Mueller) and other advisers, including Rick Gates and George Papadopoluos . Each of those now-convicted associates of the President's now have, in turn, provided more evidence to Mueller.\n\nThe big question following midterms, then, is whether Mueller will have the ability to complete his work and to act on whatever evidence he gathers. The passage of Tuesday's midterm elections could place Mueller in increased danger of political interference -- but at the same time, the fact that the Democrats took the House provides Mueller with vital, counter-balancing protections.\n\nJUST WATCHED Apparent scheme to disparage Mueller unravels Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Apparent scheme to disparage Mueller unravels 02:36\n\nNow that midterms have passed, Trump is all but certain to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whom Trump has publicly berated as \"weak,\" \"beleaguered\" and \"scared stiff and Missing in Action.\" Because Sessions recused himself from the Mueller investigation -- a move Trump has called \"very unfair to the President\" -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein assumed supervision of Mueller. If either Sessions or Rosenstein departs now that midterms are over, Mueller will have a new boss. That new boss certainly will be well aware of the President's feelings about Mueller's investigation.\n\nWhoever takes over as Mueller's boss will hold broad power to supervise, and potentially limit, his work. The special counsel regulations provide that the attorney general \"may request that the special counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.\" Translation: the attorney general can squash anything that Mueller wants to do, from issuing subpoenas to filing charges, if he provides a reason why, in his view, the special counsel's proposed action is inappropriate or unwarranted.\n\nThe special counsel regulations also require Mueller to provide a confidential report upon the conclusion of his investigation to the attorney general, who, in turn, has discretion over dissemination of the report or its component findings to Congress and the public. The newly Democratic-controlled House that takes office in January 2019 is far more likely than its Republican-majority predecessor to demand full transparency from the attorney general on the special counsel's findings and to make those findings known to the American public.\n\nFor more opinion...

Even if the President or his new attorney general limits Mueller's work, fires him or otherwise prevents Mueller's findings from becoming public, the Democrats now hold the all-important subpoena power in the House. Therefore, House Democrats will have the ability to compel production of evidence and to hold public hearings on any unresolved issue that might have fallen under Mueller's purview, or even beyond. While the House itself cannot issue criminal charges, it can give a public airing to important issues and it can refer matters to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation.\n\nAs Mueller's work continues, the stakes will increase. Now, with the passage of midterms, Trump will be able to once again focus his attention and attacks on Mueller. However, the fact that Democrats have regained control of the House provides at least some assurance that Mueller will be able to complete his work without undue political interference.", "(CNN) A runway lighting issue at London's Heathrow Airport has caused delays to a number of early morning flights, the airport said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAirline passengers in the United States and other international airports around the world took to social media to complain of being unable to take off due to delays in the UK.\n\n\"We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, but at this stage we anticipate that there will be some disruption at the airport throughout this morning,\" the statement read.\n\nWe're currently investigating and working to fix a technical issue with the lighting system for the runways.

She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy, she said, and had completed rehab.\n\nBut her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery, screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs, but why?\n\nAmid an opioid epidemic , the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin, fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead, they said, the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.\n\n'A false sense of safety'\n\nAccording to a case report published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics, both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom, a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.\n\nThe plant, which is native to Southeast Asia, is typically used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs, it is hailed by some as a solution to the opioid epidemic but derided by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug.\n\nThe mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep.\n\n\"I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative,\" said Dr. Whitney Eldridge, a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report.\n\nThe mother might have been well-intentioned, but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant, her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition, known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life, after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications, the boy was discharged to his parents.\n\nIt's rare, but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that \"this case is not unique.\" He said the FDA \"is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery.\"\n\nof Gottlieb, whose agency has issued a variety warnings on kratom, called the new report \"a tragic case of harm\" and said it \"further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom, including the potential for abuse and addiction.\"\n\nAnd though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom, she believes that physicians today \"need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn.\"\n\nExperts urge caution, cast doubt\n\nSome experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome, the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that this is possible,\" said Dr. Andrew Kruegel, an associate research scientist at Columbia University, \"because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users, especially at higher doses.\"\n\nBut Kruegel, who has studied the plant for seven years, noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. \"The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking,\" he said. \"Without that information, you can't really extrapolate too much.\"\n\nAnd the mother might not have been taking kratom at all, said Dr. Edward W. Boyer, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"It's the husband who reported the kratom use,\" he said. \"The wife who actually ingested the product, who thought it was kratom, and the authors of the case report itself, none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom.\"\n\nKratom's rocky past and uncertain future\n\nDespite the FDA's warnings, kratom is easy to buy and is sometimes sold as a tea in caf\u00e9s . The nonprofit American Kratom Association estimates that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance, and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products.\n\n\"We believe that, as in many supplements, there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this,\" Dave Herman, the association's chairman, said. \"That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure.\"\n\nKratom acts on opioid receptors, which the FDA says is evidence of its potential for abuse. The agency points to 44 deaths associated with kratom, but Kruegel said that \"if you look at those 44 deaths, the vast majority of them involve other substances, including other strong opioids.\"\n\nBoyer said kratom may have other risks, such as seizures, but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because \"there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone.\"\n\nRespiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction, steering users away from more dangerous drugs.\n\n\"If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies, then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment, particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy,\" Boyer said.\n\nChallenges to developing kratom-based drugs\n\nThe American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug, especially because they can't patent the raw plant.\n\n\"If I'm a drug company, I think that it costs somewhere, depending on who you speak to, between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market,\" Herman said. \"Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat, ride down a river and grab it off a tree?\"\n\nBecause kratom is considered a dietary supplement , manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut some companies have done just that, drawing the FDA's ire for saying their products could \"relieve opioid withdrawal\" or \"treat a myriad of ailments.\" The association says those cases are anomalies.\n\n\"The reality is, our belief is, this is America,\" Herman said. \"And if a product is useful for your health and well-being, you should have the right to take it, as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm.\"\n\nThe FDA, however, continues to warn against kratom, even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic.\n\n\"Kratom has never been studied in humans,\" Gottlieb said in the statement. \"What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead, as the FDA has warned, kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis.\"", "\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646

Tammy Baldwin bested her Republican challenger Leah Vukmir, CNN projects, overcoming a late push from President Donald Trump to mobilize Republican voters in the state.\n\nHer win came in a state Democrats were determined to move back into their column after Trump toppled the \"blue wall\" of Midwestern states -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- two years earlier.\n\nThrough a race in which both parties focused on turning out their bases, Baldwin and Vukmir clashed over the country's approach to abortion, immigration and the #MeToo movement.\n\n\"We don't put children in cages like this President has done and we can't let this happen again,\" Baldwin said at a debate in October.\n\nVukmir said Baldwin's plan for the border would be \"drawing a line in the dirt.\"\n\nRead More", "", "(CNN) Republicans will pick up a Senate in Missouri, CNN projects, with state attorney general Josh Hawley defeating Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in a state Donald Trump won by nearly 19 points in 2016.\n\nHawley touted himself as a self-proclaimed champion of Trump's agenda who said McCaskill had become out-of-touch politically with the state she represents. Trump's last campaign rally for the 2018 midterms was for Hawley in Missouri on Monday night.\n\nAlso central to Hawley's strategy was the Senate's role in confirming Supreme Court justices, which came into even sharper focus with the bitter battle over Brett Kavanaugh, whom McCaskill opposed.\n\nFrom the beginning, McCaskill faced a challenging political landscape in her bid for re-election. Missouri has trended progressively more Republican since her last race in 2012.\n\nBut the dynamics in this election cycle, with Democrats unusually energized and Trump's approval flagging, helped McCaskill to keep pace with Hawley right up until Election Day, giving her supporters hope that she could ultimately beat the odds to win another term.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Americans disapprove of President Donald Trump's job as President, according to preliminary CNN exit polls. The results match his approval in recent public opinion polls, which have shown him to be under water nationally for months.\n\nBut there's much more to the story. In nearly every state with a key contested Senate or governor's race, he has a positive approval and is over 50%, according to CNN's preliminary exit poll data.\n\nThat wide difference in Trump's national vs. his key state approval helps explain the dual storyline emerging on election night of Democratic pickups giving them control of the US House and Republican success holding control of the US Senate by picking off Democratic senators representing states Trump won in 2016.\n\nHis highest approval of these states is West Virginia, oddly enough, where slightly more than three-in-five approve of the job he's doing as President, but Democrat Joe Manchin was able to keep his seat.\n\nThe exceptions to Trump's key state approval come in Nevada, Wisconsin and Texas, where his approval

would. Democrats cleaned up in the suburbs , using a massive gender gap among women to retake the majority they lost in 2010. In the Senate , geography was destiny; the map was heavily tilted toward Republican-friendly states where President Donald Trump remained popular -- and the GOP scored a series of wins in those states. The governors races produced a split decision; Democrats won in Michigan, Illinois and, somewhat surprisingly, Kansas; Republicans, however, won the two big prizes on the map in Florida and Ohio.\n\nWe're still sifting through the data and there are a number of races that are still uncalled. But we know a lot. And here are my big takeaways from another amazing night in American democracy:\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. The year of the woman\n\nHouse Democrats placed a MASSIVE bet on women in their plan to retake the majority. Dozens and dozens of Democratic female candidates jumped into races across the country. Democrats tailored much of their messaging on health care, on taxes, on everything to female voters -- especially in the suburbs. That was clearly the right bet. Women made up 52% of the overall electorate, according to preliminary exit polls , and they went for Democratic candidates over Republicans by 20. According to the Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman , there will now be more than 100 women in the House in 2019 for the first time in history.\n\nIf you are looking forward to 2020, the results from Tuesday night suggest that a female candidate running to be the Democratic nominee against President Donald Trump may well have a major advantage.\n\n2. A Trump referendum\n\nIn the closing days of the campaign, Trump went back and forth on whether or not this election was a referendum on his first two years in office. At times, he acknowledged that it was, telling roaring audiences that a vote for [fill in the blank Republican candidate] was effectively a vote for him. At others, Trump sought to note that his name wasn't on the ballot -- and that he couldn't be held responsible for whatever happened to Republicans.\n\nThe early exit polling suggests that two-thirds of voters said that their vote on Tuesday was about Trump, with more saying they came to vote to show opposition rather than support for the President; nearly 4 in 10 voters said that their vote was meant as a sign of opposition to Trump.\n\nThat, by the way, is not unique to Trump. Midterm elections are almost always referendums on the president and his party. And they are almost always negative referendums. (Americans like divided government.) It's why the president's party has not lost House seats in only three midterms since the Civil War. ( What years were those? 1934, 1998 and 2002.\n\nThe split decisions -- Democrats win the House majority, Republicans keep control of the Senate -- is fitting in an election about Trump, the single most polarizing President in modern politics. Trump allies will insist that without him, Republicans would have lost the Senate and the House. Trump detractors -- including some Republicans -- will argue that Trump cost them any chance at keeping control of the House.\n\n3. Mitch McConnell is still the smartest guy in Senate politics\n\nFor a time over the summer, there was talk that Democrats could win the Senate. McConnell never panicked, kept Trump on board and delivered the goods -- again -- on Tuesday night. Wins in Florida, Indiana, North Dakota, coupled with Republicans holding their own endangered seats in Tennessee and Texas, not only kept the Senate in GOP hands but expanded the party's majority -- giving them some wiggle room on tough votes over the next two years.\n\nThis was a map -- 26 Democratic seats up as compared to nine for Republicans -- that Republicans should have capitalized on. And while they didn't run the table -- Joe Manchin in West Virginia, for one, won -- they picked up seats in a national environment that clearly favored Democrats. That looked unlikely as recently as a month ago.\n\n4. Sherrod Brown is someone Democrats should listen to more\n\nThe Ohio Democratic Senator cruised to a third term on Tuesday night against a credible opponent -- Rep. Jim Renacci (R) -- in a state that Trump won by eight points two years ago. That won't get all that much attention -- no one on either side thought Brown would lose -- but it should, as the party turns to 2020. Remember that Trump is President because of 80,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The Midwest is, literally, where he built his path to the White House -- and where he will look again in 2020.\n\n\"Let our country -- our nation's citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country -- let them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest, to our Great Lakes state,\" Brown said in his victory speech. \"And we will show America how we celebrate organized labor and all workers - the waitress in Dayton, the office worker in Toledo, the nurse in Columbus, the mineworker in Coshocton. That is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\"\n\nHe's right. And what Brown proved on Tuesday night is that a Midwestern liberal populist can win -- and win easily in what will be the key battleground in 2020. If you're looking for a dark horse in the 2020 Democratic field , you could do a lot worse than Brown.\n\n5. The 2020 race started tonight\n\nSpeaking of 2020 and Brown, the easy reelections of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) will almost certainly serve as springboards for 2020 presidential bids. Klobuchar had more than $5 million in the bank as of mid-October while Gillibrand had $10.6 million. All of that money could be ported directly over to a presidential bid.\n\nKlobuchar will likely position herself as someone, like Brown, who has demonstrated an ability to run and win in the Midwest, with a coalition that goes beyond just Democrats. Gillibrand is likely to cast herself as a liberal warrior for women in the Senate and as someone, being from New York, who knows how to stand toe-to-toe with the current President.\n\nI'd be very surprised if either of them DON'T run for president at this point.\n\n6. All of Democrats' BIG national rising stars got wiped out\n\nQuick, name the three Democrats running for statewide office that Democrats who didn't live in their states knew and/or cared about: Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke, right? Well, Gillum lost narrowly. Abrams is losing less narrowly. And O'Rourke overperformed past Democrats in Texas but still lost.\n\nThat knocks out the three biggest potential stars coming out of this election for Democrats. Yes, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez won -- but we all knew she was going to after she beat Joe Crowley in a primary in an overwhelmingly Democratic district in New York City.\n\nPolitics abhors a vacuum, so other rising star Democrats will fill the void left by the losses of Gillum, Abrams and O'Rourke. (And keep an eye on O'Rourke. I could see him trying to use his narrow-ish defeat as a way to run for president in 2020.) I'd watch Gretchen Whitmer, who got elected governor in Michigan, Jared Polis, the first openly gay governor in the country (he's from Colorado) and the new governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham.\n\n7. Republicans won the biggest governor's races in the country.\n\nIf you asked Democrats going into Tuesday night which governor race they wanted to win the most, they'd likely name Florida first and then Ohio. They won neither. And there's meaning well beyond simply losing at the gubernatorial level. Both are swing states -- maybe the two swingiest states -- going into the 2020 presidential election, and it's always better to have a governor's political machine working for you rather than against you in a swing state.

Those issues, which were already bubbling up throughout the primary, were escalated by DeSantis when he went on Fox News a day after becoming the nominee to warn Florida voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum. DeSantis denied there was any racial innuendo in his remark, but race -- and allegations that DeSantis was using it against his opponent -- were never far off during the 10-week general election sprint.\n\nTensions hit a boiling point during the pair's second and final debate. DeSantis loudly objected to suggestions he was in cahoots with far-right figures or that his ties, unwitting he said, to white supremacists should be held against him.\n\n\"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\" Gillum said in response. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nRead More", "Story highlights This page includes the show Transcript\n\nNovember 7, 2018\n\nThe U.S. Midterm Elections are front and center on CNN 10 today.

Ted Cruz will defeat Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in the race for Senate in Texas, CNN projects, holding off the progressive online fundraising sensation and leaving Democrats who hoped to snap a 24-year statewide losing streak disappointed again.\n\nCruz made his name in Washington as a right-wing crusader against Obamacare. That elevated him with the GOP's base during his failed 2016 bid for the party's presidential nomination -- but also made him a top Democratic target.\n\nAnother reason progressive activists were deeply invested in the race: As more Latinos register to vote, Democrats believe the state that hasn't elected a member of their party in 24 years will move leftward and eventually become competitive. It's part of a Sun Belt shift that the left hopes could also remake the political landscapes of Georgia and Arizona and eventually lock in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada as solidly Democratic.\n\nThe Texas Senate race's flashpoints were often over cultural issues, particularly the National Anthem.\n\nAn O'Rourke speech defending NFL players who kneel to protest during the anthem and comparing them to Civil Rights Movement protesters went viral in August, leading Cruz to respond with a video featuring a double amputee.\n\nRead More", "\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628: \u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0623\u064a\u0646 \u062c\u062b\u0629 \u062e\u0627\u0634\u0642\u062c\u064a \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u0646\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641 \u0630\u0644\u0643\n\n\u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 (CNN)\u2014 \u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u063a\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0648\u062e \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0646\u063a\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062a CNN \u0644\u0645\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u062e\u0627\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0635\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 2018.\n\n\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631 \u062a\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0645\u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0627\u062a CNN \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u063a\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u06408 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 23 \u0645\u0642\u0639\u062f\u0627 \u0648\u062a\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u063a\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0641\u064a \u062e\u0637\u0648\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0630 8 \u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a.\n\n\u0648\u0628\u0631\u0632 \u0641\u0648\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0646\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u060c \u062a\u064a\u062f \u0643\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u0648\u0632\u0647 \u0628\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u062a\u0643\u0633\u0627\u0633\u060c \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u060c \u0628\u064a\u062a\u0648 \u0623\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0643\u064a\u060c \u0641\u064a \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0632 \u0641\u0648\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0634\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0628\u0642\u060c \u0645\u064a\u062a \u0631\u0648\u0645\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0647.\n\n\u0633\u064a\u0637\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0648\u062e \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0644\u062f \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u064a\u062f\u0639\u0645 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0644\u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d \u0645\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0639 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0637\u064a\u064a\u0646.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Kevin Cramer will win his bid to be the next senator from North Dakota, CNN can project, ousting incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and dealing a significant blow to Democrats' prospect at taking control of the Senate.\n\nHeitkamp, in the closing months of the campaign, was widely considered the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the Senate, given Trump won North Dakota by 36 percentage points. That position was cemented when, weeks before Election Day, her campaign mistakenly identified sexual assault survivors in an ad, forcing the Democrats to emotionally apologize and promise to make up for the mistake.\n\nHeitkamp, in a move many Democrats applauded by questioned as political risky, decided to vote against Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court who was confirmed despite being accused of sexual assault, which he denied. The Kavanaugh hearings became a contentious matter in the race, with Heitkamp arguing that she had to vote against the nominee to be able to look at herself in the mirror at night.\n\nThe vote, however, was a boon for Heitkamp's fundraising. In the roughly two weeks after her vote against Kavanaugh, Heitkamp raised just over $12.5 million, money that was funneled directly into her the millions worth of ads her campaign ran in the final months.\n\nCramer ran towards Trump throughout the race, looking to tap into the same base of voters that propelled him to the White House in 2016.

It is a heaven or hell decision,\" Davis said in a statement at the time, citing her religion.\n\nA federal court judge declared Davis in contempt of court for refusing to issue the licenses and not allowing her six deputy clerks to issue them in her place. US District Court Judge David Bunning ordered that Davis remain behind bars until she complied.\n\nFive of her deputies then agreed to issue marriage licenses in her absence, and the Rowan County Clerk's Office also began doing so.\n\nThe judge ordered her release days later, saying he was satisfied the office was issuing marriage licenses to \"legally eligible couples.\"\n\nA few years before the Supreme Court ruling, Davis had converted to Apostolic Christianity, a faith which has a strict moral code, her attorney said at the time.", "(CNN) Democrats Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland will become the first Native American women elected to Congress, CNN has projected.\n\nIn New Mexico, Haaland will replace Democratic Rep.

But Kobach's standing with Trump never wavered.\n\n\"He's tough, he's strong and I hated that he ran because I would have loved to have brought him into my administration,\" Trump said at an October rally in Kansas. \"In fact, if he loses, I'll bring him into my administration in two seconds.\"\n\nTrump's backing \u2014 including a pre-primary endorsement -- was also key in helping Kobach unseat the current governor, fellow Republican Jeff Colyer, in the primary.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Colorado Democratic US Rep.

The drug has been outlawed since the 1970s, when a country-wide crackdown on marijuana (known as the \"happy smoke scandal\") led to the arrest and torture of more than 50 artists and singers\n\nA law passed in the 1970s introduced long prison sentences -- or even execution -- for the possession or distribution of cannabis. Although now less severe, the country's drug policies are still considered among the world's harshest.\n\nYet, Dae and Cindy report a small but growing cannabis movement in the country.\n\n\"The cannabist culture in Korea is pretty much non-existent,\" said Dae. \"But with the rise of youth culture and counterculture in Korea -- as you can see from the hip-hop movement and underground tattoo scene -- there's more curiosity towards it.\"\n\nPop-up installation \"Garden of Mari(juan)a\" (2017) in Seoul featured 303 Virgin Mary sculptures.

Una situaci\u00f3n que amenaza a los republicanos con con p\u00e9rdidas generalizadas en suburbios altamente educados \u2013a menudo racialmente diversos\u2013 en las principales \u00e1reas metropolitanas del pa\u00eds. Tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 en el panorama la posible p\u00e9rdida de esca\u00f1os para el Senado en los diversos y crecientes estados del suroeste: Nevada, Arizona y posiblemente (aunque menos probable) Texas.\n\nEn la otra orilla, sin embargo, Trump mantiene un fuerte apoyo entre los votantes blancos evang\u00e9licos, rurales y sin educaci\u00f3n universitaria, incluidas las mujeres. El presidente ha motivado a estos electores con un argumento de cierre de campa\u00f1a que apela a los temores y resentimientos raciales de blancos m\u00e1s abiertamente que cualquier otra figura pol\u00edtica nacional desde George Wallace a fines de los a\u00f1os sesenta.\n\nLos esfuerzos de Trump se enfocan principalmente en reforzar las oportunidades republicanas de expulsar a los senadores dem\u00f3cratas en funciones de varios estados del interior m\u00e1s antiguos y predominantemente blancos que votaron por \u00e9l en 2016. El gran entusiasmo de la base del presidente tambi\u00e9n alimenta las esperanzas republicanas de mantener el control de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes por una peque\u00f1a diferencia \u2013o al menos minimizar cualquier mayor\u00eda dem\u00f3crata\u2013, al hacerse con el dominio sobre la mayor\u00eda de los esca\u00f1os de lugares que van m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los suburbios son de cuello azul.\n\nEl resultado podr\u00eda ser unas elecciones intermedias divididas que, simult\u00e1neamente, repudia a Trump y le proporciona cierta reafirmaci\u00f3n. Aunque el debate se ha centrado en si una respuesta negativa contra Trump podr\u00eda genera cierta \u201cola\u201d de triunfos dem\u00f3cratas, parece m\u00e1s probable que las elecciones de este martes consoliden e incluso profundicen las divisiones geogr\u00e1ficas y demogr\u00e1ficas que marcaron la victoria de Trump en 2016.\n\nLa expectativa de que la participaci\u00f3n supere ampliamente el nivel de los comicios en 2014 \u2013cuando se realizaron las \u00faltimas elecciones intermedias\u2013, por quiz\u00e1s 20 millones de personas o m\u00e1s, subraya la sensaci\u00f3n de que esta campa\u00f1a puede marcar un nuevo pico en la divisi\u00f3n de la sociedad estadounidense entre dos coaliciones pol\u00edticas. Las cuales est\u00e1n separadas especialmente frente al hecho de si acogen o temen los profundos cambios demogr\u00e1ficos, culturales y econ\u00f3micos que est\u00e1n redise\u00f1ando la vida estadounidense.\n\nEn general, los dem\u00f3cratas parecen posicionados para obtener los mejores resultados. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la batalla por el Congreso, este partido se dirige a obtener victorias significativas en las contiendas de gobernadores, incluidos varios de campos de batalla clave en la regi\u00f3n Rust Belt que definieron el triunfo de Trump. Y las encuestas de \u00faltimo minuto sugieren que si hay sorpresas en las contiendas por la C\u00e1mara de Representantes y el Senado, es m\u00e1s probable que los dem\u00f3cratas se impongan en el terreno de Trump sobre los republicanos que muestran una fuerza inesperada en las \u00e1reas suburbanas culturalmente liberales.\n\nTrump divide al pa\u00eds pero fortalece su base\n\nEl \u00e9nfasis de Trump en un mensaje final de campa\u00f1a con tal grado polarizaci\u00f3n racial puede interpretarse como una forma de clasificaci\u00f3n en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. Casi todos los asesores republicanos coinciden en que el presidente est\u00e1 empeorando los problemas para congresistas en funciones de este partido que intentan mantener sus esca\u00f1os en lugares suburbanos, en medio de un gran riesgo. Pero, Trump tambi\u00e9n puede estar fortaleciendo las defensas republicanas para los asientos de zonas de cuello azul, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los suburbios y de ciudades peque\u00f1as. Dicho de otra manera, el cierre divisorio del mandatario estar\u00eda reduciendo las probabilidades de que los dem\u00f3cratas ganen 45 esca\u00f1os en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes, pero al precio de aumentar las posibilidades de que se lleven los 23 puestos que necesitan para recuperar a la mayor\u00eda.\n\nDesde principios de la d\u00e9cada de 1990, se ha fortalecido el v\u00ednculo entre c\u00f3mo califican los votantes al presidente en funciones y si apoyan o no a los candidatos de su partido en las elecciones a la C\u00e1mara de Representantes. Sin embargo, los comicios de 2018 pueden llevar esa trayectoria a un nuevo pico.\n\nEn las \u00faltimas tres elecciones intermedias (2006, 2010 y 2014), entre el 82% y el 84% de los electores que desaprobaron el desempe\u00f1o del presidente votaron en contra de los candidatos de su partido para la C\u00e1mara, mientras que entre el 84% y el 87% de quienes aprobaron la gesti\u00f3n votaron a favor de los aspirantes del partido del mandatario. En la m\u00e1s reciente encuesta de CNN, el 91% de los que aprueban a Trump indicaron que planean votar por republicanos, mientras que el 92% de quienes rechazan la gesti\u00f3n del presidente se\u00f1alaron que tienen la intenci\u00f3n de elegir dem\u00f3cratas.\n\nEstados dem\u00f3cratas y estados republicanos\n\nSeg\u00fan est\u00e1ndares hist\u00f3ricos, el n\u00famero de electores en distritos que votaron por el candidato presidencial del otro partido es muy bajo: solo 25 republicanos est\u00e1n en distritos que prefirieron a Clinton y apenas 12 dem\u00f3cratas tienen esca\u00f1os en distritos que respaldaron a Trump. Al menos dos tercios de los republicanos en los lugares donde gan\u00f3 Clinton est\u00e1n en grave peligro, lo que significa que el n\u00famero de miembros del Partido Republicano en esos esca\u00f1os podr\u00eda caer a un solo d\u00edgito despu\u00e9s de las elecciones. A su vez, este partido tiene al menos alguna posibilidad de sacar a cerca de un tercio de los dem\u00f3cratas en los distritos donde Trump se impuso, aunque los dem\u00f3cratas ahora tambi\u00e9n tienen oportunidades de compensar eso al obtener m\u00e1s de una docena de los distritos que el presidente gan\u00f3.\n\nEl Senado podr\u00eda tener el mismo patr\u00f3n. Actualmente es mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil para los senadores ganar en estados que usualmente votan a la inversa en las elecciones presidenciales. Por ejemplo, la senadora Susan Collins de Maine, que se enfrenta a la reelecci\u00f3n en 2020, es la \u00fanica republicana que queda de los 30 senadores elegidos en los 15 estados que votaron por dem\u00f3cratas en todas las elecciones presidenciales desde 1992.\n\nEsta elecci\u00f3n podr\u00eda afectar a\u00fan m\u00e1s las ya disminuidas filas de senadores dem\u00f3cratas en terrenos de inclinaciones republicanas:\n\n13 estados han votado por el Partido Republicano en las siete elecciones presidenciales desde 1992 .

(Unless you are looking between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. EST, in which case you need to watch me analyze the hell out of this election on CNN's airwaves .) To that end, I've put together aof a small handful of races I will be watching to see which way the wind is blowing. (Remember, in the immortal words of Bob Dylan , you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.)\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics.

But these are the races I'm watching:\n\n6 p.m.\n\n: Donald Trump won this seat by 15 points in 2016. So if Amy McGrath (D) beats Rep. Andy Barr (R) , it's an early but important sign that Democrats are very likely to have a very good night.\n\n7 p.m.\n\nIndiana Senate: This is one of five states that Trump won by double digits in 2016 in which a Democratic senator -- in this case Joe Donnelly -- is trying to get re-elected. Trump stopped in Fort Wayne in his final day of campaigning on Monday, so you know how important he thinks this one is. : This is one of five states that Trump won by double digits in 2016 in which a Democratic senator -- in this case Joe Donnelly -- is trying to get re-elected. Trump stopped in Fort Wayne in his final day of campaigning on Monday, so you know how important he thinks this one is. If Donnelly loses , it's hard to see how Democrats' already narrow path to the Senate majority doesn't disappear.\n\nVirginia's 7th district: Rep. Dave Brat's stunning primary upset of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R) in 2014 heralded that takeover of the party that Trump brought to full fruition two years later. But Trump only won this seat with 50.5% in 2016, and : Rep. Dave Brat's stunning primary upset of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R) in 2014 heralded that takeover of the party that Trump brought to full fruition two years later. But Trump only won this seat with 50.5% in 2016, and Brat may simply be too conservative (and too Trump-y) for this electorate.\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nWest Virginia Senate: The expectation is that Sen. Joe Manchin (D) will beat state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) despite the fact that Trump carried the state by 43 points. What's most telling here is margin: : The expectation is that Sen. Joe Manchin (D) will beat state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) despite the fact that Trump carried the state by 43 points. What's most telling here is margin: If this race gets called by the networks by 8:30 p.m. (or earlier), it's going to be a good night for Democrats. If it's close as the vote rolls in and at midnight it's still not called, it's a sign Republicans are doing better than we expected.\n\n8 p.m.\n\nFlorida governor: To my mind, the race between Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) is the : To my mind, the race between Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum (D) and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R) is the single most important race in the country . It's not just because Gillum is running as a representative of the new left -- non-white, unapologetically liberal -- or that DeSantis has hugged Trump as closely as any candidate in the country. It's also because whoever wins will be the highest-ranked elected official in the swingiest state headed into 2020, and will play a major role in how the state's legislative and congressional lines are drawn in 2021.\n\n9 p.m.\n\nArizona Senate: If Democrats can re-elect Donnelly and Manchin, which means their hopes of taking the Senate majority still exist by the time polls close in Arizona, then the next domino they need to fall is Rep. Krysten Sinema (D) beating Rep. Martha McSally (R) in this : If Democrats can re-elect Donnelly and Manchin, which means their hopes of taking the Senate majority still exist by the time polls close in Arizona, then the next domino they need to fall is Rep. Krysten Sinema (D) beating Rep. Martha McSally (R) in this open-seat race for Jeff Flake's seat . Sinema has led -- albeit narrowly -- for much of the race -- but Democrats have had very, very little success winning federal races in Arizona in recent years.\n\n10 p.m.\n\nIowa governor: There's no question that Democrats are going to pick up governorships tonight. But how many? And where? Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin may get more attention, but I am keeping a : There's no question that Democrats are going to pick up governorships tonight. But how many? And where? Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin may get more attention, but I am keeping a close eye on Iowa , where Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) is trying to win a full term. Reynolds is a down-the-line establishment Republican. But will she be lumped into Trump's category? And if she loses, what does that say about the state of the electorate in this most crucial of early 2020 states?\n\n11 p.m.\n\nCalifornia's 21st district: Want to know if it's a total and complete Democratic wave? : Want to know if it's a total and complete Democratic wave? Watch this seat , where Rep. David Valadao (R) has done everything right -- except represent a seat that Hillary Clinton won by 15.5 points in 2016. If this election is a negative referendum on Trump of significant proportions, Valadao loses.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.
