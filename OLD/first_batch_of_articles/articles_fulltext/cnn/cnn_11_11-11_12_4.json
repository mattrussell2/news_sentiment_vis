Pick a side,\" he said.\n\nTying Federer\n\nThe 31-year-old Serb, who didn't play in London last year because of injury, is trying to win the ATP Finals for a sixth time, tying the record held by Federer.\n\nThe Swiss, who is chasing his 100th career title, had opened the ATP Finals on Sunday with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 defeat by the ninth-ranked Kei Nishikori of Japan. Federer, 37, plays his second group match against French Open finalist Dominic Thiem of Austria on Tuesday night.\n\nThis time last year, Djokovic had been forced to sit out the ATP Finals as he tried to recover from an elbow injury, for which he eventually underwent surgery in February.\n\nTough start to 2018\n\nUnlike Federer, who returned from a six-month injury break at the start of 2017 to win the Australian Open, Djokovic struggled during the first few months of his comeback, even falling out of the top 20 in May for the first time since 2006.\n\nAfter ending his coaching relationship with former world No. 1 Andre Agassi, Djokovic reunited with his old team led by Marian Vajda in April. Although his form improved, he crashed out of the Roland-Garros quarterfinals in a tempestuous match against world No. 72 Marco Cecchinato of Italy, and even hinted at skipping the grass-court season altogether.\n\nJUST WATCHED Isner eyes future grand slam Replay More Videos ...

After he served out the first set to love, 6-4, Djokovic broke again at 3-3 in the second set.\n\nServing to stay in the match at 5-3 down, Isner was broken for the third and final time as Djokovic found another backhand passing shot for a winner.\n\n\"He's the best returner I've ever faced for sure,\" Isner said.\n\nZverev next\n\nEarlier on Monday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated former US Open winner Marin Cilic of Croatia 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-1) in the other round-robin match in the group Guga Kuerten.\n\nDjokovic will next play the big-serving Zverev, with whom he is tied 1-1.\n\n\"I'm feeling fit physically and mentally,\" said Djokovic, who lost to Zverev last year on clay in the finals of Rome but beat the 21-year-old in the semifinals of Shanghai last month. \"I'm looking forward to that match.\"\n\nHe added: \"I played him recently in Shanghai, but wasn't at his best.

I have passed two polygraph tests administered and analyzed by two of the nations leading experts to prove I have truthful.\"\n\nCorsi has been involved in Mueller's investigation for roughly two months and had already been subpoenaed for documents and testimony before the grand jury, and he complied with both.\n\nCorsi's role in the investigation largely revolves around the possibility that he was an intermediary between Stone and WikiLeaks.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Stone publicly bragged about having \"backchannel communications\" with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, and on several occasions appeared to predict the WikiLeaks releases that roiled the race in the final stretch of the campaign. But in the two years since Trump's victory, Stone has walked back those claims and said his \"backchannel\" was merely New York radio host Randy Credico sharing information about his interviews with Assange. Credico denies serving as an intermediary between the two.\n\nInvestigators have been skeptical of Stone's explanation. CNN has reported that Mueller's team is examining the possibility that Stone had another intermediary beyond Credico, and that Corsi might have been involved.\n\nBoth Stone and his lawyer, Grant Smith, tell CNN that Stone has not been contacted by Mueller's team.\n\nCorsi injected himself into Stone's situation last year when he claimed that one of his own articles for InfoWars inspired Stone to predict in October 2016 that there would be trouble coming for Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.

However, the opposite was true for heart disease during that period; fewer counties reported it as the top killer.\n\nIn fact, cancer will replace heart disease as the leading cause of death in the United States within two years, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projections referenced in the study, published Monday in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\"We're just on the cusp of the transition from heart disease to cancer as the leading cause of death,\" said Dr. Latha Palaniappan, lead author of the study and an internist, professor and clinical researcher at Stanford University Medical Center.\n\nShifts in socioeconomic, ethnic groups\n\nA decades-old theory described a shift that occurred in health and disease patterns in the United States during the last century. Early in the 100-year period, infectious diseases including tuberculosis, diphtheria and flu took more American lives than other illnesses. Yet by the end of the century, chronic diseases, including heart disease and cancer, had become the leading cause of death. The theory described these complex patterns and suggested that such shifts stemmed from economic and social conditions.\n\nRecent data suggests that the nation is experiencing a new transition, this time within the chronic disease category itself. To understand these changes, Stanford Medical School researchers examined more than 32 million death records across 3,143 American counties for 2003 through 2015. The research team looked not only at medical information but at demographic data, including income and race.\n\nOver the 13-year study period, the mortality rate decreased in the total population by 12%, from about 823 deaths per every 100,000 people to roughly 724 deaths per 100,000.\n\nIn more than three-quarters of all counties (79%), heart disease was the leading cause of death in 2003, yet this remained true for only 59% of counties in 2015.\n\nBy contrast, cancer caused the most deaths in about two of every 10 counties during 2003, with the same true for four of every 10 counties in 2015.\n\nWhile the overall heart disease mortality rate decreased by 28%, high-income counties experienced a 30% drop, versus a 22% fall in low-income counties. The cancer mortality rate also dropped, though less dramatically: It declined by 16%, with an 18% drop seen in high-income counties versus 11% in low-income.\n\nAccording to the researchers, lower-income areas may see a slower shift in the cause of death due to socioeconomic, geographic, demographic and other factors that influence health and death.\n\nThe researchers also compared shifts in patterns for racial and ethnic groups. Here, they found that among Asian-Americans, Hispanics and whites, cancer replaced heart disease as the leading cause of death. However, a similar pattern was not seen among American Indians/Alaska Natives or blacks.\n\nEconomic factors also affect the new pattern of mortality rates across the nation. Heart disease surpassed other causes of death in the lowest-income counties for all racial and ethnic groups during 2015, the researchers found, yet only Asian-Americans, Hispanics and whites in the highest-income counties saw cancer outpace heart disease as the leading cause of death in 2015.\n\nMaking improvements in cancer care available to all\n\nThe research \"provides another lens\" for interpreting dynamics related to the transition in mortality patterns, wrote Silvia Stringhini, a researcher at Switzerland's Lausanne University Hospital, and Dr. Idris Guessous, a practicing physician and epidemiologist at Switzerland's Geneva University Hospitals, in an editorial published with the study.\n\n\"The driving force behind the transition from the age of 'pestilence and famine' to the age of 'manmade diseases' is improvement in socioeconomic conditions, such as standards of living, health habits, hygiene, and nutrition,\" Stringhini and Guessous wrote.\n\nHow genetic testing, screening and personalized medicine affect cancer rates is still unclear, they noted. New and expensive cancer therapies are being introduced, yet they might contribute to \"increasing social inequalities in cancer survival, with better-off persons experiencing more rapid decreases in mortality,\" they added. And the same may be true of genetic testing and cancer screening, they noted.\n\nIt's likely that any differences in mortality trends could be explained by differences in smoking, obesity and diabetes trends among high and low income groups, the authors stated. \"For example, between 1960 and 2015, the prevalence of smoking in the United States decreased from 39% to 6% among college graduates but from 46% to 23% among persons who did not complete high school,\" they wrote.\n\nWith cancer about to overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death, what do most Americans need to know?\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Undergo all of the recommended cancer screenings,\" Palaniappan advised, and adopt \"lifestyle prevention practices, such as healthy diet and exercise, which are beneficial in lowering both cancer and heart disease mortality.\"\n\n\"The investments in research in both heart disease and cancer have paid off over the last decades because both heart disease and cancer rates are going down,\" she said. \"Without all of the wonderful new therapies that we have now, this would not have happened.\"\n\nStill, there's more work to be done, she said: \"We need to work harder in lower income areas of the US so they can see the same improvements in mortality. We need to focus more on heart disease and cancer prevention and treatment efforts in African-American populations particularly.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nNo se espera que las condiciones mejoren, al menos durante varios d\u00edas\n\nLas autoridades emitieron advertencias sobre el humo y la calidad del aire en los condados de Los \u00c1ngeles y Santa B\u00e1rbara\n\n(CNN) - Cielos brumosos y llenos de humo causados por los incendios forestales que azotan California est\u00e1n provocando una mala calidad del aire y problemas de salud.\n\nLas autoridades emitieron advertencias sobre el humo y la calidad del aire en varios condados.\n\nAqu\u00ed hay algunos consejos para reducir la exposici\u00f3n al riesgo y mantenerte seguro t\u00fa y tu familia.\n\nPor qu\u00e9 te hace da\u00f1o el humo de los incendios\n\nEl humo de los incendios forestales contiene part\u00edculas de vegetaci\u00f3n quemada y materiales de construcci\u00f3n mezcladas con gases. Si sientes que tus ojos pican, la exposici\u00f3n al humo podr\u00eda estar causando otro tipo de da\u00f1o. Las part\u00edculas podr\u00edan estar entrando en tu sistema respiratorio.\n\nLa exposici\u00f3n puede causar dolor en el pecho, un aumento en la velocidad de los latidos del coraz\u00f3n o provocar un ataque de asma. Adem\u00e1s de tos y problemas con la respiraci\u00f3n, muchas personas experimentan s\u00edntomas similares a los de una sinusitis, como dolores de cabeza, dolor de garganta, nariz que moquea e incluso cansancio, de acuerdo con los Centros para el Control y Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).\n\nEl humo de los incendios forestales puede ser especialmente da\u00f1ino para los ancianos, las mujeres embarazadas, los ni\u00f1os y las personas con enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas del coraz\u00f3n y los pulmones. Debido a que los menores respiran m\u00e1s aire en relaci\u00f3n a su peso corporal que los adultos y sus v\u00edas respiratorias a\u00fan se encuentran en desarrollo, ellos pueden experimentar s\u00edntomas m\u00e1s severos.\n\nLas personas con asma y enfermedades pulmonares deben consultar con sus m\u00e9dicos sobre c\u00f3mo manejar estas situaciones. Algunas personas podr\u00edan experimentar incluso enfermedades como la bronquitis, provocadas por las part\u00edculas finas, de acuerdo con la Agencia de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental de Estados Unidos.\n\nPermanecer saludable aunque haya humo\n\nSi ves niebla, hueles humo o sabes de un incendio forestal en tu zona o en sitio que planees visitar, revisa el \u00cdndice de Calidad del Aire para determinar si debes limitar tu tiempo en el exterior.\n\nCuando se notifique que hay que permanecer en interiores, mant\u00e9n las ventanas y puertas cerradas. Est\u00e1 bien mantener el aire acondicionado en funcionamiento, pero aseg\u00farate de que el filtro est\u00e1 limpio y cierra la entrada de aire fresco para prevenir el ingreso de humo, de acuerdo con los CDC.\n\nTambi\u00e9n es importante mantener el aire limpio en interiores evitando encender velas o el uso de chimeneas o estufas de gas. Encender una aspiradora tambi\u00e9n puede provocar la circulaci\u00f3n de part\u00edculas en el aire.\n\nLas mascarillas o tapabocas en realidad solo atrapan part\u00edculas grandes y no protegen tus pulmones de la inhalaci\u00f3n de humo, pero una m\u00e1scara con filtro puede ofrecer algo de protecci\u00f3n. Los CDC tambi\u00e9n tienen consejos sobre la efectividad de los diferentes tipos de m\u00e1scara, dependiendo de la exposici\u00f3n.\n\nA\u00fan si el aire afuera o dentro de tu casa se ve claro, puede que no est\u00e9 libre de part\u00edculas microsc\u00f3picas da\u00f1inas, especialmente si los incendios forestales y el humo persisten por semanas.\n\nPediatras neum\u00f3logos del Hospital Infantil del Instituto de Respiraci\u00f3n de Colorado tambi\u00e9n recomiendan cambiarte de ropa si has estado afuera, enjuagarte los ojos si est\u00e1n rojos e irritados y beber l\u00edquidos para evitar deshidrataci\u00f3n.\n\nLos padres deben buscar atenci\u00f3n de emergencia para sus hijos en caso de que experimenten dificultades para respirar o un cambio en su nivel de conciencia.\n\nExiste un bajo riesgo de efectos a largo plazo por la exposici\u00f3n al humo de los incendios en individuos saludables.\n\nNota del editor: art\u00edculo publicado originalmente en diciembre de 2017 y actualizado", "(CNN) The United States has more than double the rate of premature overdose deaths of at least 12 other countries, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, says that there were an estimated 63,632 drug overdose deaths in 2016 in the US.\n\n\"The U.S. has the highest death rate due to drug overdoses for both men and women (35 deaths in 100,000 men and 20 deaths in 100,000 women) in 2015, more than double those of any other country in our study,\" Yingxi Chen, one of the researchers and a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute , wrote in an email.\n\nMexico had the lowest rates: 1 death per 100,000 men and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 women.\n\nThe researchers also found that the United States had the second-highest increase in drug overdose deaths: 4.3% per year in men and 5.3% per year in women, Chen said.

(Under Mississippi law, the two will compete in a Nov. 27 runoff.) Five days after the vote, the video emerged of Hyde-Smith's \"joke\" -- and a national controversy quickly ensued.\n\nTrying to stop the bleeding, Hyde-Smith released a statement on Sunday, saying: \"In a comment on Nov. 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement. In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\"\n\nWhich brings us to Monday in Mississippi. And specifically, a news conference with Hyde-Smith and Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who appointed her in March to fill the seat of Thad Cochran , who resigned due to health issues.\n\nLet me just say this as plainly as possible: This news conference could not have gone worse for Cindy Hyde-Smith. Like, it's simply not possible. You need to watch the whole video -- it's only 140 seconds long -- but just in case you don't, here's everything Hyde-Smith said when being asked a variety of questions about her \"public hanging\" comment. (These are in the order she said them.)\n\n1. \"I put out a statement yesterday and we stand by that statement.\"\n\n2. \"We put out the statement yesterday and it's available and we stand by that statement.\"\n\n3. \"I put out a statement yesterday and that's all I am going to say about it.\"\n\n4. \"I put out a statement and we stand by the statement and that's all I'm going to say about it.\"\n\n5. \"We put out a statement yesterday and I stand by the statement.\"\n\nIt's impossibly awkward. Like, me in high school awkward. Hell, it might even qualify as me in junior high school awkward.\n\nAnd all of that comes before Bryant, who up to this point has been a bystander in this political disaster, is asked how Hyde-Smith referring to her past statement makes him feel.\n\n\"She's certainly addressing the fact that she put out a statement,\" he says in what has to be a first-ballot entrant into the saying-something-while-saying-nothing Hall of Fame. What Bryant is essentially saying is this: Look, I don't want ANY part of this. But I can attest to the fact that Hyde-Smith did say some words. Confirmed.\n\nHere's what's remarkable about the whole thing: Hyde-Smith, a sitting Republican senator who had jokingly referred to a public hanging just days before the election, somehow made things even worse for herself in this news conference.\n\nAnd what amazes me most is that it didn't have to be this way.\n\nHyde-Smith should know FAR better than to refer in a joking manner to public hangings in a state that, according to the NAACP, conducted the most lynchings (561) from 1882 to 1968 . (Many people have suggested that the comment was made even worse by the fact that Hyde-Smith's main opponent in her re-election race is black. I think the comment is about as tone deaf and bad as it can possibly get no matter who Hyde-Smith is running against.)\n\nBut given that she made the comment, what she should have immediately done is simply apologize for her choice of words. Something like: \"I got caught up in a moment of frivolity and made a deeply unfortunate word choice. I understand how deeply lynchings scarred the state of Mississippi and I am recommitting myself to fighting for the rights of every Mississippian when I go back to the Senate next year.\"\n\nShe didn't do that. Instead, she initially tried to suggest that people were twisting her words in search of a \"negative connotation.\" What, exactly, is the positive connotation of the words \"public hanging\"? And the quote above from Hyde-Smith on Nov. 2 is entirely unedited. So how could she possibly have been misunderstood?\n\nThen, on Monday, someone gave Hyde-Smith bad advice -- along the lines of \"Stick to your initial statement. Don't give the fire any oxygen.\" Which, broadly speaking, makes sense when dealing with political problems. It does not make sense when the statement to which Hyde-Smith keeps referring is a bad one (as I noted above) and expresses no real apology for her comment. What you take from that 140 seconds of awkwardness is that Hyde-Smith's final word on her \"joke\" about a public hanging is that people are reading too much into it.\n\nYou can't get it more wrong than that.\n\nHere's the thing: Hyde-Smith is still a heavy favorite to win a full six-year-term in two weeks' time. Mississippi is a decidedly conservative state and Republican candidates combined for more than 55% of the vote in the Senate race last Tuesday.\n\nBut what she's done over the past 48 hours -- and especially her news conference Monday -- amounts to a series of bad, bad, bad political blunders. And when a politician makes a mistake this grievous, sometimes the normal rules of political gravity don't hold.", "Bozeman, Montana (CNN) For a few hours on a sun-soaked autumn morning, Dan McGuinness stands ankle-deep in Montana's idyllic Sixteen Mile Creek. His thoughts focus on casting a fly lure to the perfect spot, drawing the attention of spawning brown trout just upstream. It's his moment of zen.\n\n\"A place of serenity, a place to relax, a place to have some fun,\" explains McGuinness, a former Navy explosive ordnance disposal technician. \"There's a lot of people that find extreme peace and joy in Montana.\"\n\nAfter three deployments to Iraq, the North Carolina native medically retired from service and moved to Big Sky Country five and a half years ago. He sought, in part, its abundance of nature and lack of people.\n\n\"There's definitely a draw to the West for a lot of guys who want a little bit of quiet and want to seek nature,\" says McGuinness. \"There's vets everywhere.\"\n\nAccording to Department of Veterans Affairs statistics, Montana has the second highest veteran population per adult capita in the United States. More than a third of Montana's veteran population served post-9/11.\n\n\"They don't want to be around a lot of people,\" explains Karl Rosston, Montana's suicide prevention coordinator. He is very familiar with Montana's veteran population because the state also has one of the country's highest veteran suicide rates. Veterans account for one out of every five Montana suicides. The reasons for these alarming statistics are abundant.\n\nCNN producer Jeremy Harlan filming in the rivers near Bozeman, Montana.\n\n\"I always hear about people moving to Montana from California or something because they want to get away from the big city. And what they don't realize is the very thing that they're getting away from actually may be harming them,\" Rosston says. He believes isolation, combined with the state's culture, long winters, lack of sunshine, and easy access to firearms pose threats to veterans struggling with physical and emotional war wounds.\n\n\"We have major issues with stigma. We see this not only in Montana, but then you throw in a vet in Montana and it's even worse,\" Rosston explains. \"So that kind of cowboy-up mentality, sense of independence. We take care of our own. We don't talk about our problems. And when it comes to mental health issues we see it as a weakness and we see ourselves as a burden.\"\n\nThat unwillingness to discuss mental health issues is an obstacle Warriors & Quiet Waters, a nonprofit group based in Bozeman, is helping combat wounded veterans overcome.\n\nThe group invites post-9/11 veterans from all over the country to participate in week-long fly-fishing expeditions. Veterans are outfitted with clothing, gear, and lessons before spending two days on some of the country's best fishing rivers. The foundation's executive director, Faye Nelson, believes a critical part of the experience is camaraderie forged between veterans with shared combat experiences. That bond, she says, allows them to open up about their struggles.\n\n\"Most of them aren't interested in coming to a program where they get to know another shrink,\" Nelson says. \"Veterans are really sensitive to programs that say, 'we're going to fix you,' or 'you're broken, you need to be fixed.' So, we make it very clear to them that's not what this is. And no one's in their face. It's very much a hands-off passive therapy experience.\" And while the foundation is happy to provide a week of respite and relaxation for these wounded warriors, it knows its mission will only be successful if veterans' lives change long term.\n\nCombat veterans fish near Bozeman, Montana, as part of the Warriors and Quite Waters Program.\n\nNelson believes Warriors & Quiet Waters is doing just that, pointing to data collected from surveys given to participants three months after their fishing week. In the organization's 2017 annual report, more than half of the warrior participants stated they felt more connected to others, had more control of her/his life, felt a willingness to participate in community activities, and had an increase in satisfaction from personal relationships.\n\nRosston, Montana's suicide prevention coordinator, is not surprised.\n\n\"Some of the organizations that get vets involved with outdoor experiences or experiential experiences are critical,\" Rosston says. \"It creates a sense of belonging, a source of connection and a peer-to-peer they're not getting by themselves. And I think the more of those types of organizations that we have, the better off we are going to be.\"\n\nFor McGuinness, his week fly fishing with Warriors & Quiet Waters has been the ideal respite from the pain he deals with daily from spinal injuries he suffered while in the Navy.\n\n\"Every action I take is a direct reflection of how my symptoms flare up,\" he said. \"And I'm going to pay hard when I get home.

In short order, the duo launched the Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, Iron Man, a revived version of Captain America and Ant-Man, while Lee added perhaps Marvel's most renowned character, Spider-Man, with Steve Ditko.\n\nDespite their colorful costumes and cosmic powers, the Marvel heroes grappled with real-world problems, and went on to address serious social issues. Lee -- who died Monday, at age 95 -- also developed a way of working with artists that empowered them, blocking out stories -- in part out of necessity, given the number of titles he was writing -- then adding dialogue when the illustrated pages came back.\n\nBeyond his creations, in Lee, comic books had an ebullient cheerleader and goodwill ambassador, a self-described \"ham\" who toured college campuses proselytizing on Marvel's behalf.

Ser\u00eda la sexta movilizaci\u00f3n masiva desde el 10 de octubre, cuando las universidades p\u00fablicas empezaron las manifestaciones y el paro indefinido. Los manifestantes le han exigido al gobierno 18,2 billones de pesos (un poco m\u00e1s de 5.500 millones de d\u00f3lares) para las universidades, y han rechazado la reforma tributaria que califican como \u201cregresiva\u201d y que gravar\u00eda la canasta familiar.\n\nDe ese presupuesto, 3,2 billones de pesos es para el funcionamiento (pago de salarios, servicios p\u00fablicos, papeler\u00eda, etc) y 15 billones de pesos para infraestructura, le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Alejandro Palacio, presidente de la Asociaci\u00f3n Colombiana de Representantes Estudiantiles de la Educaci\u00f3n Superior (Acrees), uno de los l\u00edderes de las movilizaciones.\n\nEl gobierno de Duque ha prometido dotar de m\u00e1s recursos a las universidades p\u00fablicas.

The comments were reminiscent of his false claims after the 2016 election that millions of illegal votes cast in California cost him the popular vote and that voters were bused into New Hampshire from Massachusetts.\n\nTrump's latest claims reflect a basic lack of understanding of those states' ordinary procedures for counting ballots.\n\nAnd his proposed remedies -- determining results based only on the ballots counted on election night in Florida, and potentially holding a new election in Arizona -- lack any sort of legal or historical grounding.\n\nHere's a look at what Trump is claiming and what the facts are in each state:\n\nFlorida\n\nTrump is apparently complaining that a messy vote-counting process in Florida has cut into his allies' leads in the key presidential swing state.\n\nTrump tweeted Monday morning: \"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nHis complaint comes after a weekend in which the GOP's Senate candidate, Gov. Rick Scott, and its gubernatorial candidate, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, both saw their leads shrink as heavily Democratic Broward and Palm Beach counties finished counting ballots.\n\nThere have been problems in Florida, to be sure -- including Miami-Dade County's election board collecting a set of mysterious ballots in the Opa-locka mail facility after Democrats raised concern about the uncounted votes. Those 266 ballots are not being counted because Florida law requires all ballots sent by mail to arrive at the election facility by 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nBut Trump's claim of a \"massively infected\" process is not supported by the evidence.\n\nA Florida judge on Monday denied the Scott campaign's request to impound the voting machines in Broward County. And state elections monitors reported that they'd seen no evidence of criminal activity there.\n\nScott, who is still Florida's governor, last week said he was asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the elections offices in Palm Beach and Broward counties. But officials at the agency said they were told by the Florida Department of State that there were no credible allegations of fraud.\n\nThere are also outstanding ballots from voters overseas -- including members of the military -- whose ballots have until November 16 to arrive in Florida.\n\nMore broadly, Trump's assertion that the race should be \"called\" for the candidates who led in the early tally on election night is a misstatement of the vote-counting process.\n\nIt's not unusual for vote-counting to continue for several days after an election. In fact, that's what happened in Broward County in 2014 and 2016, too.\n\nNews outlets \"call\" races -- or project their winners -- based on the results from the precincts and counties that have reported and how those results compare historically to the state's results. When a race isn't close, it's often immediately clear who will prevail. But that standard is unofficial.\n\nState elections officials who oversee vote-counting and actually declare winners and losers don't \"call\" races on election night. That's a lengthy process that can take weeks of canvassing and verifying results. It usually wraps up weeks after the election was held.\n\nArizona\n\nAfter Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema passed Republican Rep. Martha McSally as more votes were counted in Arizona's Senate race late last week, the President began complaining.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday afternoon: \"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\"\n\nJust out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018\n\nHe also complained to reporters on Friday that in Arizona, \"all of a sudden, out of the wilderness, they find a lot of votes\" to put Sinema in the lead.\n\nHis comments reflect a lack of understanding of how Arizona counts its votes.\n\nAbout three-fourths of the state's votes are cast by mail. And counting them isn't a simple matter of opening the envelopes and counting the votes.\n\nArizona law requires voters to sign and seal their envelopes, and for elections officials to match that signature with the one on the voter's registration form before even opening the envelope. That routinely takes several days and isn't finished on Election Day.\n\nThe controversy in Arizona was over officials in the heavily populated, Democratic-leaning Maricopa and Pima counties allowing voters several days to \"cure\" their ballots -- that is, to fix discrepancies such as forgetting to sign their envelopes. After suing, Republicans reached an agreement with county recorders last week to have the state's rural, Republican-leaning counties follow the same procedure.\n\nTrump was swiftly rebuked Friday by Republicans in the state, including Gov. Doug Ducey, who had just won re-election.\n\n\"We often hear the phrase: Every vote matters. And the #AZSen race is proof. So let's get this right. All legally cast votes MUST be counted. Lawful votes in EVERY county in the state MUST be counted,\" Ducey tweeted hours after Trump.\n\n\"Let's follow the law, count the votes, prevent any cheating, and heed the will of the voters,\" Ducey added in a second tweet.\n\nOutgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake also criticized Trump on Twitter. \"There is no evidence of 'electoral corruption' in Arizona, Mr. President. Thousands of dedicated Arizonans work in a non-partisan fashion every election cycle to ensure that every vote is counted. We appreciate their service,\" he tweeted.\n\nArizona's Republican secretary of state, Michele Reagan, has repeatedly tweeted links to a blog post in which she explained why the state's vote-counting procedure moves slowly.\n\n\"Arizona takes elections seriously -- from the poll workers to the county elections officials, and the Secretary of State's office and everybody is working diligently to tabulate all of the election results in a manner that Arizonans can be proud of and, most importantly, trust the results,\" she wrote.\n\nMcSally's camp is also not complaining. The lengthy vote-counting process in Arizona is a reality with which McSally is deeply familiar: Her 2012 and 2014 House races were among the nation's closest. She wasn't declared a winner in 2014 until mid-December.", "The Federal Aviation Administration says a Las Vegas air traffic controller is no longer on the job after she slurred her words and confused pilots for about 40 minutes from the control tower.

Now, research shows that that test, either alone or combined with other evaluation methods, is better at predicting whether a symptomatic patient required heart surgery than the standard evaluation.\n\nThe test, a scan for coronary artery calcium or CAC, provides patients with a simple score or a quantifiable measure of how hardened their arteries have become. By contrast, the standard evaluation that doctors use to measure heart disease risk includes blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body weight, blood glucose and lifestyle factors, such as smoking status.\n\n\"If you're concerned about your risk of heart disease, then you should ask your doctor about the coronary artery calcium score,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Anderson , lead author of the new study, presented Monday at the American Heart Association Scientific Session conference. He is also a clinical and research physician and past director of cardiovascular research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nA measure of actual plaque\n\nLast year, White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson revealed that as part of his physical exam, Trump had undergone a coronary calcium CT scan, a test that has been around since at least 1990. The president's score was 133, which indicates that some plaque is present and would place him in the middle-risk category as defined by the new study. The lowest-risk category includes patients with scores of zero, and the highest-risk category includes patients with scores of 1,000 or higher.\n\nAnderson said the study questioned which of three types of evaluations is the best predictor of either a major coronary event, including heart attack, or the need for surgery to place a stent or perform a bypass. He and his colleagues looked at 1,107 symptomatic patients at Intermountain Medical Center who had been referred for a positron emission tomography (PET) test.\n\n\"These are patients with low-risk symptoms. Some have coronary disease; most don't,\" Anderson explained.\n\nThe first evaluation is the current standard used by doctors. The second includes all the same factors as the standard evaluation method, along with a patient's CAC score. The third evaluation was a CAC score alone.\n\nThe researchers followed the patients in the study for 1\u00bd years to nearly three years. They discovered that the CAC score alone and the evaluation plus the CAC score did a better job of predicting who eventually needed to have bypass surgery or a stent placed than the evaluation method without the score, Anderson said.\n\nThe CAC score gives actual \"anatomic information,\" he said. \"You're actually seeing plaque -- not all the plaque, not the soft plaque, but advanced plaque where calcium is present.\"\n\nNone of the three evaluation methods did a good job of predicting heart attack risk, the study found.\n\nHeart association urges use\n\n\"I would anticipate, based on this study and the guidelines, that this will broaden the use of CAC scoring for patients at risk\" for heart attack, said Walsh, who was not involved in the study. \"And my hope is that with the guidelines coming out and this growing evidence, that patients will have Insurance coverage for the study as well.\"\n\n\"When CAC scoring was initially done, there was pretty significant radiation exposure,\" said Walsh, who is also the American College of Cardiology's immediate past president. The technology has improved today, so \"it's about the same equivalent radiation as getting a mammogram.\"\n\nThe test is like any CT scan, in which a patient lies on a table in a scanner and pictures are taken, she said. \"It doesn't cause pain. You don't have to have an IV in,\" she said. \"What we're able to see from the heart is the degree of calcification of the heart artery.\"\n\nThe higher the CAC score, the more calcium a patient has in his or her arteries and the higher the risk, she said. A score of zero shows no calcification in the coronary artery.\n\nGenerally, people who have risk factors such as \"abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, family history of heart disease, hypertension, smoking -- all those traditional risk factors -- those people have a higher chance of having an abnormal CAC score,\" Walsh said.\n\nShe noted that a high CAC score is \"not a natural progression with aging,\" though if you took a random sample of 80-year-olds, there would be more likelihood that they would have some calcium. \"But what predicts higher calcium levels is the other risk factors,\" she said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn recent years, she said, she's seen billboards advertising a \"Father's Day special\" in which people could gift their dads a CAC screening test.\n\nThough hospitals appear to have pulled back on them recently, these ad campaigns were aimed at reassuring people who feared a heart attack, she said.\n\nThe new study, combined with the new recommendation to use the test in asymptomatic patients in the middle-risk category, when \"put together, show us that this is going to be a test we're going to use more in the future,\" Walsh said.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

que se le env\u00eden m\u00e1s fondos de ayuda a Puerto Rico, le dijo a CNN un asesor del liderazgo del Congreso.\n\nAunque no hay conversaciones para recortar fondos que ya han sido apropiados, un consejero de la Casa Blanca dijo que las negociaciones se han enfocado en mantener los fondos de ayuda humanitaria de Puerto Rico lejos de un proyecto de ley que financiar\u00e1 los esfuerzos de asistencia en partes del sur de Estados Unidos que fueron devastadas por los huracanes este a\u00f1o.\n\nEse asesor dijo que las autoridades de Puerto Rico a\u00fan no han gastado todo el dinero que el Congreso reserv\u00f3 para ellos, y dijo que el gobierno se est\u00e1 moviendo para evitar que m\u00e1s dinero vaya a ayudar a la isla \u201cporque ellos no lo necesitan y es muy probable que no sean capaces de gastarlo\u201d.\n\nLa posici\u00f3n m\u00e1s reciente de Trump sobre Puerto Rico primero fue reportada por Axios. La Casa Blanca ha estado dando a conocer esto \u201cdesde hace un rato\u201d, dijo el asesor de un l\u00edder del Congreso.\n\nPreviamente Trump hab\u00eda criticado a las autoridades de Puerto Rico por el manejo que le dieron a miles de millones de d\u00f3lares en fondos de ayuda que su gobierno le hab\u00eda dado para la recuperaci\u00f3n de las tormentas, acusando a los l\u00edderes de la isla de gastar algo de ese dinero en otras razones diferentes a la limpieza de los huracanes.\n\n\u201cLa gente de Puerto Rico es maravillosa, pero los pol\u00edticos ineptos est\u00e1n tratando de usar las masivas y rid\u00edculamente altas cantidades de dinero de ayuda para pagar otras obligaciones\u201d, escribi\u00f3 Trump el 23 de octubre. \u201cEstados Unidos no rescatar\u00e1 las obligaciones pendientes con el dinero de ayuda los huracanes\u201d.\n\nThe people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations.

The voluntary recall only involves the 100 milligram/25 milligram tablets, it does not involve the other versions of the drug, sometimes sold under the brand names Hyzaar. If you take Sandoz's losartan potassium, look on the bottle for the lot number. If it has the lot number JB8912, then you have the recalled pills. Patients use these drugs to keep their high blood pressure in check.\n\nThe drug is being recalled because the active ingredient has tested positive for N-Nitrosodiethylamine or NDEA, a suspected human and animal carcinogen that is used in gasoline as a stabilizer for industry materials and as a lubricant additive, according to the National Institutes of Health\n\nThe ingredient was made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Company Co. Ltd. The FDA placed the Chinese company on an import alert at the end of September, meaning all of its active pharmaceutical products and finished products will not be permitted to enter the United States. The FDA made that decision after an inspection of the facility.\n\nSeveral pills that contain valsartan , another drug used by heart patients, have been under a recall since July. The drugs were tainted with NDEA or NDMA, N-nitrosodimethylamine, an impurity that is also considered a possible carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency\n\nNDMA is an organic chemical used to make liquid rocket fuel and is a byproduct of manufacturing some pesticides and processing fish. It can be unintentionally introduced into manufacturing through certain chemical reactions.\n\nThe FDA is testing all heart drugs known as ARBs for these impurities.\n\nNot all medicine containing valsartan is recalled. The FDA keeps an ongoing list of products that are recalled and a list of the valsartan products that are not recalled.\n\nThe latest recall impacts less than 1% of the total losartan drug products in the US market, according to the FDA.\n\nIf your drug is on the recall list, the FDA suggests taking it until your doctor or pharmacist provides a replacement. Because not all valsartan and irbesartan drugs are involved in the recall, you might be able to switch to a version by another company.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIt's unclear exactly what the cancer risk is if you take the contaminated valsartan pills; the FDA believed that the risk was low with the valsartan recall.\n\nIt estimated that if 8,000 people took the highest dose of valsartan (320 milligrams) containing NDMA from these recalled batches daily for four years, there may be one additional case of cancer over the lifetimes of 8,000 people. Many patients take a much lower dose of valsartan, and therefore their risks are theoretically much lower.\n\nThe FDA said it will continue to test all products containing valsartan and similar drugs for the presence of impurities.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Donald Trump's decision to not attend a ceremony at an American burial ground in France because of rain \"let down our country.\"\n\n\"He should've gone through it to go. It was not that big a challenge or problem. It was an embarrassment,\" Hagel, who served in the Obama administration, told CNN's Brianna Keilar on \"CNN Right Now.\"\n\n\"And he let down, I think, our veterans, he let down our country. And I think he sent a very wrong message to the world,\" he said.\n\nTrump, who was in Paris to commemorate the centennial of the end of World War I with other world leaders, has faced criticism for not attending the Saturday trip to the cemetery. Officially, the reason for scrapping the journey to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial came down to safety: the President's Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials and not the President.\n\nBut there did not appear to be a backup plan and the President did not make any statements of regret at not being able to visit the cemetery. The White House defended the President's decision not to travel by car, saying such a trip would have required closures to Parisian roadways on short notice.\n\n\"It was an embarrassment,\" says former Defense secretary Chuck Hagel about Trump skipping the veterans event: \"He let down our veterans, he let down our country.\" https://t.co/xz7o6nEKTx pic.twitter.com/Y7ZdcbmKNO \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) November 12, 2018\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) New commercial satellite images released Monday have identified more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program amid indications that talks with the US have stalled in recent months.\n\nWhile the network of undeclared sites has long been known to American intelligence agencies, it has not been publicly acknowledged by President Donald Trump, who asserted that North Korea was \"no longer a nuclear threat\" following his June summit with dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment on the images, but US officials have expressed concern about North Korea using hidden and undeclared locations to continue to work on improving their missile technology and possibly their nuclear program.\n\nThe new images, first reported by The New York Times , show researchers at the Beyond Parallel program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies have identified 13 of an estimated 20 hidden missile operating bases unreported by the North Korean government.\n\n\"These missile operating bases, which can be used for all classes of ballistic missile from short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) up to and including intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), would presumably have to be subject to declaration, verification, and dismantlement in any final and fully verifiable denuclearization deal,\" the report states.\n\nPhotos: Satellite photos reveal North Korea missile base Overview of the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base and adjacent unidentified military facility, March 29, 2018.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nUS intelligence has long assessed that the North Koreans have stored much of their weapons capability, including mobile missile launchers, in underground mountain bunkers.\n\nSpecifically, the images focus on the Sakkanmol missile base, which \"currently houses a unit equipped with short-range ballistic missiles but could easily accommodate more capable medium-range ballistic warheads.\"\n\n\"Despite the difference in interpretation between the US government and the North Koreans over what these declarations have meant, the Singapore declaration and the new Korean declaration, for North Korea watchers it has been pretty clear that the North has not been willing to give up its entire nuclear program,\" Lisa Collins a fellow with the Korea Chair at CSIS and one of the authors of the report, told CNN.\n\nHowever, an official with South Korea's Blue House called the report \"nothing new\" and told media Tuesday \"the United States and South Korean intelligence service hold more detailed information using the military satellites,\" and that nuclear sites couldn't be \"undeclared\" as there had been no agreement with North Korea to declare them.\n\nThe official went on to say that North Korea had not previously pledged to close the Sakkanmol Missile Base, the focus of CSIS's report, saying, \"There had been no treaty or negotiation that mandated closing the missile base.\"\n\nMonday's report comes days after Trump told reporters his administration is \"very happy with how it's going with North Korea\" despite the administration's announcement, in the middle of the night as last week's midterm elections results were coming in, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's meeting with a key aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had been postponed.\n\nTrump has conveyed a starkly different image than the one painted by US military officials, foreign diplomats and sources familiar with developments who told CNN that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is \"really angry\" about the US refusal to offer sanctions relief and that personal friction between US and North Korean negotiators may be slowing progress.\n\nA source familiar with the ongoing dance between officials in Washington and Pyongyang previously told CNN that North Korea's stance is that the US \"must make a move before we make the next one.\"\n\nBut the US appears unwilling to oblige, at the moment, according to a US official, who said the Trump administration wants to move away from the \"tit-for-tat\" approach of the past.\n\n\"There has been a move away from past administrations' approach to North Korea in terms of 'we will give you a little here if you give us a little there' ... kind of a tit-for-tat piece. ... We haven't seen that work in the past, so the President is insistent on holding the full pressure campaign until he gets the full denuclearization,\" a US official told CNN.\n\nNorth Korea has often argued it is unable to provide comprehensive details about the locations of its nuclear and missile sites because that could serve as a target list should the situation escalate into an armed conflict. But Collins said that the hope is that \"this type of analysis and data would help to push forward the negotiations rather than cause more blockage.\"\n\n\"It would actually get rid of one of the primary excuses or reasons why North Korea has not produced a list,\" she said, adding that \"open source and independent data\" can help the process as US officials might be wary of publicly disclosing information that they believe could compromise sources and methods.\n\nWhen asked about Monday's new report, a State Department spokesperson implored Kim to \"follow through on his commitments -- including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs.\"\n\n\"President Trump has made clear that should Chairman Kim follow through on his commitments \u2014 including complete denuclearization and the elimination of ballistic missile programs \u2014 a much brighter future lies ahead for North Korea and its people,\" the spokesperson told CNN.\n\nBut experts point out that Kim has not offered to stop producing ballistic missiles, let alone unilaterally give them up, and said on New Year's Day that he would continue to mass-produce ballistic missiles and deploy those that have already been tested.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Monday that the images once again show that Trump's comments on North Korea have been a \"fabrication.\"\n\n\"The North Koreans have not signed any document working out, laying out, what steps they are going to take to denuclearize,\" Hagel said. \"There has been nothing stated, agreed to, framed signed, except what President Trump says they've said ... but now ... we have a whole different story, and it is the reality, it is not fantasy,\" he added.\n\nVipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies nuclear proliferation, told CNN that Kim's actions do not amount to \"deception since he said on New Year's Day that North Korea would mass-produce and deploy its missiles that it already tested.\"\n\nNarang added that the images released Monday identify \"operating bases which, until and unless there is a deal, Kim can't eliminate without undermining his security.\"\n\nAsked about the State Department's response to Monday's report, Narang called the assertion that North Korea has committed to eliminating its ballistic missile programs is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"There has been no agreement or discussion remotely that detailed --- even on nuclear systems, and many of these are short range conventional missiles which North Korea has never said were on the table,\" he told CNN.\n\nJeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN that experts have known about these sites for years, and it is no surprise that they remain operational given Kim's declaration in January that North Korea would shift from research and development to the mass-production of nuclear systems.\n\n\"Kim didn't dupe Trump. Trump duped himself,\" Lewis said, noting that North Korea has never offered to unilaterally disarm.\n\nSakkanmol missile base is one of the facilities where North Korea deploys its mass produced systems, he said.\n\nStill, Trump has sought to convey the image that progress continues to be made and teased a possible second summit with Kim in the near future.\n\n\"We're in no rush. We're in no hurry,\" Trump told reporters at a White House press conference last week. \"The sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes are home.\"\n\nWhile North Korea claims that it has taken some steps toward denuclearization, experts say those moves are largely cosmetic and easily reversible. Kim's regime has shuttered a missile engine testing facility; destroyed the entrances to its nuclear test site; and promised to close the Yongbyon nuclear facility, where North Korea is believed to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons, if Washington takes what it calls \"corresponding measures.\"\n\nIn July, Trump touted indications that North Korea had begun dismantling \"a key missile site\" after the prominent monitoring group 38 North published images showing Pyongyang had begun decommissioning its Sohae Satellite Launching Station.\n\nBut while that step attracted significant media attention at the time, Monday's report states that the dismantling of the Sohae facility \"obscures the military threat to US forces and South Korea from this and other undeclared ballistic missile bases.\"\n\nCollins told CNN that she believes one reason North Korea canceled the latest round of talks with Pompeo is because they might be targeting \"the very top levels of negotiations\" -- another meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nHowever, she also warned that \"you can't get anywhere without these working-level talks because that's where the nitty-gritty stuff happens.\"\n\n\"You can't get a verifiable list of anything unless nuclear weapons experts are part of the process,\" she said. \"Is President Trump going to create a list of all those facilities? Does he even know where some of these places are? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\n\"There have to be working-level talks, but the North Koreans are clearly targeting a big package deal, for them, which can only happen if President Trump is there to make the decision,\" Collins added. \"But I think the US has been very cautious and careful to keep the negotiations moving forward at the working level and try not to have President Trump jump every time there is an offer.\"", "ABC followed up on Friday morning by airing a preview of Robin Roberts' interview with Obama. On Friday evening ABC shared clips from the audiobook edition of \"Becoming,\" so listeners could hear Obama speak about Trump in her own voice.\n\nRoberts' full interview with Obama aired as a one-hour special on ABC Sunday night.\n\nRoberts also has Obama's first live interview for the book. It will take place in Chicago Tuesday morning on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nThat same day, Gayle King will sit down with Obama, also in Chicago, for an interview that will air Wednesday on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nAnd Jenna Bush Hager will interview Obama for NBC's \"Today\" show. That, too, will be taped on Tuesday in Chicago, and air on Wednesday.\n\nNetwork morning shows are usually hyper-competitive about guests. Oftentimes shows won't accept going second or third for an interview, and they'll just skip the guest instead. But Obama is the rare guest who can sweep ABC, NBC and CBS in the same week.\n\nThe hook for Bush Hager's interview is that she lived in the White House before Obama, as one of George W. Bush's daughters.\n\nOther stories about \"Becoming\" are hitting the magazine shelves. Obama is on the cover of ELLE magazine's December issue. And Oprah Winfrey interviewed Obama in front of a live audience for a feature in O, The Oprah Magazine. Both ELLE and O are Hearst titles.\n\n\"Michelle Obama is still optimistic\" read the banner headline on Elle.com on Monday morning.\n\nAround the same time that feature came out, Winfrey announced on Twitter that \"Becoming\" is her next book club selection.\n\n\"I've known Michelle for 14 years, but this book is so vulnerable, I felt like she was in my ear,\" Winfrey tweeted.\n\nA few hours later, People magazine came out with its own feature. \"Michelle Obama: My Own Story\" is the cover of this week's issue.\n\nEvery outlet wants to have a unique hook. So in People's case, it was an \"exclusive at-home interview.\"\n\nAll of this is timed, of course, to maximize book sales.\n\n\"Becoming\" has been in the works for more than a year and a half. It had already received a sizable number of pre-orders before the promotions ramped up last week. That's when it jumped from No. 10 on Amazon to No. 1. It hasn't moved since.\n\nAmazon's best selling books list is updated every hour. It is a pretty reliable guide to what will eventually end up on The New York Times best sellers list.\n\nPenguin Random House has a lot riding on \"Becoming.\"\n\nThe publishing house won the bidding war for two Obama books, one by the former president and one by the former first lady, in early 2017.\n\nIt is unclear how much Penguin Random House ultimately paid. But The Financial Times reported that bidding war between several prominent publishers surpassed the $60 million mark. The FT said it amounted to \"a record sum for US presidential memoirs.\"", "The paper's top editor, Audrey Cooper, tweeted a budget of her newsroom's recent expenditures, to give readers a sense of what goes into the fire coverage. \"About $24,000 to outfit 9 journalists and keep them safe,\" Cooper said.\n\nThe budget listed fire shelters, flame-resistant Nomex attire, gloves, goggles, boots, and other gear.\n\nThis year we put in a capital funding request to put Lizzie in a Nomex fire suit that fit. (She's sorta tiny.) Hers alone cost about $5,000, if I remember right.\n\n\n\nIt's not \"selling subscriptions.\" It's about supporting media that gets information that matters. https://t.co/PUwDggLLN6 \u2014 Audrey Cooper (@audreycoopersf) November 11, 2018\n\nThe burned down town of Paradise, where the Camp Fire started, has been the epicenter of the coverage in Northern California.\n\nMultiple camera phone videos of people fleeing Paradise, with bright orange fires raging in close range, have received national news attention. In the videos, residents narrate the disaster that's unfolding before their eyes.\n\nOne of the videos, uploaded to YouTube on Friday, has stoked controversy because it shows multiple dead bodies. A Paradise resident who narrowly survived the firestorm last Thursday, Greg Woodcox, filmed it on his phone.\n\n\"I'm going to show you what happened here. This poor soul right here got burned out,\" Woodcox said, the trauma evident in his voice.\n\nAt one point a human skeleton can be seen in the passenger seat of a burnt-out car.\n\nThe comments on YouTube are mixed, with some users criticizing the grisly images and others saying it needs to be seen.\n\nA user who described himself as a wildland firefighter wrote that \"this is what the public needs to see. Too many think that evacuation notices and alerts are 'over the top' or 'not mandatory' and would rather stay.\"\n\nOn Monday The Chronicle wrote about Woodcox and how he tried to save his neighbors.\n\nReporters covering these stories occasionally become grief counselors.\n\nChronicle reporter Evan Sernoffsky tweeted this photo of a colleague, Jessica Christian, comforting an \"elderly survivor who miraculously made it through\" the firestorm in Paradise:\n\nEmotional moments reporting on the #CampFire. @sfchronicle photographer @jachristian embraces elderly survivor who miraculously made it through firestorm pic.twitter.com/iOJUDzxXai \u2014 Evan Sernoffsky \ud83e\udd43 (@EvanSernoffsky) November 11, 2018\n\nCooper, the Chronicle editor, told Poynter that \"we've unfortunately gotten very, very good at this,\" meaning covering these fires. \"We know our interactive fire tracker will take off online, we know the 'What we know, what we don't' sidebars are very useful for people. Air quality sidebars are done from muscle memory. And we know we will meet residents who will be part of our reporting for months and years to come.\"\n\nSometimes reporters are among the affected. For part of the day on Sunday, the editor of the Chico Enterprise-Record, the closest daily paper to Paradise, was having a hard time locating several of his employees. They were found safe by the end of the day.\n\nAmid hopes that the 228 people reported missing will be found alive, The Enterprise-Record printed the missing persons hotline phone number on the front page on Monday.\n\nIn Southern California, the Woolsey Fire near Malibu has killed 2 people.\n\nSocial media posts from celebrities -- some of whom have lost their homes -- have helped personalized the story.\n\nThere, too, video diaries from evacuees have provided harrowing up-close views of the danger.\n\nTV stations in Los Angeles have had their helicopters in the air for long stretches to show the fire-fighting efforts.\n\nThe CBS-owned station posted a webpage full of \"footage from our aerial shots across the Malibu area in effort to help residents discern if their homes have been affected.\"\n\nLocal reporters have been joined by national news crews from all the major networks. ABC and NBC's nightly newscasts were anchored from southern California on Friday, and ABC's David Muir will anchor from there again on Monday.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

operation in Gaza left a Hamas commander and an Israeli soldier dead.\n\nEleven people in Israel were injured by the rocket fire, prompting retaliatory ground and airstrikes by the Israeli military that left at least three Palestinians in Gaza dead, the Palestinian health ministry said.\n\nOne man in Israel was seriously wounded after a bus close to the Gaza fence was hit by an anti-tank missile, according to ZAKA, a volunteer emergency response service. Ten other people were hurt when rockets landed in the Israeli town of Sderot, according to Israeli emergency services.\n\nA bus set ablaze after it was hit by a rocket fired from Gaza.\n\nSmoke and flame are seen during an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli TV showed video of multiple rocket launches from the coastal enclave, which has been controlled by the militant group Hamas for more than a decade.\n\nThe Israeli army said about 60 rockets were intercepted by the Israel Defense Force's Iron Dome aerial defense system, with many other rockets falling on open ground. Sirens continued to sound in Israeli communities close to the Gaza fence on Monday evening, indicating further incoming rocket fire.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had struck more than 20 targets in Gaza from the ground and the air over the last couple of hours.\n\nOne of those targets was the al-Aqsa TV channel, which is run by Hamas. Israel destroyed al-Aqsa's main building in a strike late Monday night after carrying out a \"door knock,\" CNN producers said. A door knock is a nonexplosive device designed as a warning to those inside to evacuate.\n\nIt was unclear whether there were any casualties in the airstrike, and, a short time later, al-Aqsa was broadcasting from a different location.\n\nHamas had warned that attacking the channel would be a violation of international law. Hamas' Government Media Center said the channel's destruction \"requires a clear response from all international institutions that are interested in the freedom of speech.\"\n\nIsrael has long accused the channel of spreading misinformation and inciting Palestinians to attack Israelis.\n\nIsraeli security forces and firefighters gather near a bus hit by a rocket fired from Gaza.\n\nThe violence comes a day after an Israeli special forces operation in Gaza ended in an exchange of fire with militants from Hamas' armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. One Israeli soldier and seven Palestinians were killed, among them a senior Hamas military commander.\n\nThe Israeli army would not give details of the operation, but IDF spokesman Ronen Manelis defended it in an interview in Israeli Radio.\n\n\"We are talking about an operation that was well-planned right down to the smallest of details. It is the sort of thing that takes place every night, and in most instances remains under the media's radar,\" Manelis said.\n\nOn this occasion, the soldiers had found themselves in a \"very complicated situation,\" Manelis added.\n\nThe IDF identified the dead Israeli soldier only as Lt. Col. M. Another Israeli officer was wounded.\n\nHamas identified its commander killed as Nour Baraka of the Qassam Brigades.\n\nIsraeli soldiers arrive near the Gaza fence on Monday.\n\nHamas issued a warning to Israel on Monday that if the IDF responded with what Hamas called \"excessive aggression\" after Monday's rocket attacks from Gaza, the response from Hamas would be to \"increase the depth and intensity\" of its shelling of Israel.\n\nThe statement from the Qassam Brigades made clear that Hamas sees Monday's rocket attacks on Israel as a response to the IDF operation inside Gaza on Sunday evening, which the statement described as a \"heinous crime.\"\n\nSo far, Monday's rocket attacks have all been short-range, with the farthest hitting the town of Ashkelon about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away from Gaza.\n\nBy threatening to \"increase the depth\" of its attacks, Hamas was signaling that it could launch rockets towards Tel Aviv, about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away, or Jerusalem, almost 50 miles (80 kilometers) away, which would be seen by Israel as a significant escalation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Monday with his Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman and other senior officials at the Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv in the wake of the escalation of violence in and around Gaza.\n\nCalling the escalation \"EXTREMELY dangerous and reckless\" in a Twitter post on Monday, United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov said the UN was working with Egypt to try to achieve a cessation of hostilities. Mladenov called on both Israeli forces and militants in Gaza to show restraint.\n\nDuring previous escalations over the past few months, the UN and Egypt have often stepped in to put in place short-term ceasefires between Israel and Gaza.", "(CNN) Plans for Dan Crenshaw's much-talked-about appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" this past weekend were kept quiet until the last minute.\n\nBut on Monday's episode of \"Today,\" the Republican Congressman-elect explained that he agreed to appear alongside Pete Davidson to accept his apology after being contacted by \"SNL\" producers.\n\n\"We were hesitant at first, we weren't sure what the skit was going to look like,\" Crenshaw said. \"But in the end, we decided to do it because what better platform than to give a united message for the country, talk about forgiveness and then talk about veterans?\"\n\nDavidson faced widespread criticism for a joke in the previous week's episode of \"SNL\" about Crenshaw's eye patch, a result of an injury he suffered while serving as a Navy SEAL in Afghanistan.\n\n\"I mean this from the bottom of my heart, it was a poor choice of words,\" Davidson said to Crenshaw in apology. \"The man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\"\n\nRead More", "Photos: Comic book legend Stan Lee Stan Lee poses next to a Spider-Man model at his office in 2008.

The cause of death is not yet known, according to Schneck.\n\nLee began his career at what was then Timely Comics in 1939. Over the years he was a writer, editor and occasional illustrator. But, bored with the output, he was preparing to leave the company when history took a sudden turn.\n\nFor many years, the business had been dominated by DC (then National) Comics, creators of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern.\n\nIn the late '50s, DC started reimagining its heroes -- kicking off what comics historians call the \"Silver Age\" of the business -- but those figures were still, largely, otherworldly and two-dimensional, living in made-up places such as Metropolis and Gotham City.\n\nPhotos: Comic book legend Stan Lee Photos: Comic book legend Stan Lee Stan Lee poses next to a Spider-Man model at his office in 2008.

I would write down the original story, they would draw it and then I would edit it and do the art direction.

Hide Caption 32 of 32\n\nIn the early '60s, Lee was asked to come up with a team of superheroes to compete against DC's Justice League. With the notable help of artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he helped instigate a revolution, though Lee didn't see it that way at the time.\n\n\"If my publisher hadn't said 'let's do superhero stories,' I'd probably still be doing 'A Kid Called Outlaw,' 'The Two-Gun Kid' or 'Millie the Model' or whatever I was doing at the time,\" he told CNN in 2013.\n\nMarvel revitalized the comics business with a series of flawed, more human superheroes. Its figures lived in the real world -- a few were based in New York City, with all its dirt and clamor -- and struggled with everyday challenges, whether it was paying the rent or wondering about their purposes in life.\n\nFirst came the Fantastic Four, a superhero team probably most famous for the grumpy, rock-skinned Thing. Following that success Lee and Marvel introduced such characters as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men and Daredevil.\n\nThese new superheroes -- all created in a burst between 1961 and 1964 -- were hugely popular and allowed Marvel to surpass DC in both sales and fashionableness.\n\nSpider-Man, in particular, became the imprint's signature character: a neurotic photographer named Peter Parker who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider, develops spider-like powers. Parker was forever clashing with newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (an angry, cigar-chomping martinet who was no Perry White), wondering about his relationship with Mary Jane Watson and worrying about his fragile Aunt May. Crime fighting was the least of his concerns.\n\n\"I never thought that Spider-Man would become the worldwide icon that he is. I just hoped the books would sell and I'd keep my job,\" Lee said in 2006.\n\nMany of the characters were developed for television with varying degrees of success. But it was the emergence of the \"Marvel Universe\" in the movies, especially with the \"X-Men\" franchise and the Sam Raimi-directed \"Spider-Man\" (2002), that truly made the brand ubiquitous. In 2009, the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment -- the licensing arm of the comic-book brand -- for $4 billion.\n\nBy that point, Lee had long since become more of a company figurehead rather than a writer and editor in the day-to-day trenches. He became the company's editorial director and publisher in 1972 and eventually immersed himself in spreading the Marvel gospel (often with the exclamation, \"Excelsior!\") He's had bit parts in most of the films featuring the company's characters.\n\nHe was occasionally criticized for egotistically cheerleading for himself as much as Marvel. \"Stan the Brand,\" the authors of \"Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book\" called him, pointedly.\n\nIt wasn't all joy for Lee. Though the success of the movies made the characters worth billions, Lee maintained that he saw little of that wealth. Even so, he saw more than artist Kirby, who many comics historians credit with molding a number of characters. Over the years, the credit for the characters -- and, therefore, the profits -- has been the subject of court cases, some involving Kirby or his family.\n\nThe characters' impact, however, is indisputable.\n\nMarvel characters are known the world over, and its films have become huge successes.\n\n\"I used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers,\" he told the Washington Post. \"And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people's lives. Without it they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you're able to entertain people, you're doing a good thing.\"\n\nHe retained a lifelong passion for the medium he helped mold, and wouldn't tolerate disdain.\n\n\"Comic book should be written as one word. So from now on, I want you to remember that,\" he said in a 2012 YouTube video. \"They are not funny books. They are not comic books, they are comicbooks! Remember that, or incur my wrath.\"\n\nThe couple had a true partnership and Marvel fans came to know Joan Lee for her voice-over work as Miss Forbes and Madame Web in the animated versions of \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Spider-Man.\" She also had a cameo in \"X-Men: Apocalypse\" in 2016.\n\n\"The whole thing has been confusing to everyone, including myself and the fans, but I am now happy to be surrounded by those who want the best for me,\" Lee said in a statement. \"I am thrilled to put the lawsuit behind me, get back to business with my friends and colleagues at POW! and launch the next wave of amazing characters and stories!\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - He aqu\u00ed un vistazo a la vida del autor estadounidense de c\u00f3mics Stan Lee, quien muri\u00f3 este lunes a los 95 a\u00f1os.\n\nPersonal:\n\nFecha de nacimiento: 28 de diciembre de 1922.\n\nLugar de nacimiento: Nueva York, Nueva York\n\nNombre de nacimiento: Stanley Martin Lieber\n\nPadre: Jack Lieber, sastre\n\nMadre: Celia (Solomon) Lieber\n\nMatrimonio: Joan (Boocock) Lee (diciembre de 1947 \u2013 6 de julio de 2017, su muerte)\n\nHijos: Jan (fallecido) y Joan\n\nServicio militar: Ej\u00e9rcito de los Estados Unidos, 1942-1945, Sargento.\n\n1 de 24 | Stan Lee posa junto a una figura de Spider-Man en su oficina en 2008.

And the kingdom threw its weight behind OPEC and its allies reducing supply further next year.\n\nIt's a big reversal. Just months ago Saudi Arabia, under pressure from President Donald Trump , was opening up the taps in a bid to prevent $100 oil.\n\nSaudi Arabia's 180 is good news for US shale companies, especially high-debt frackers that are sensitive to price swings. It signals that the world's largest oil exporter won't stand for crude crashing any further.\n\n\"If you are a producer in Texas, you have to be happy with the fact that there is a swing supplier in the market that wants to keep prices supported,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\nFears about oversupply sent US oil prices plunging into a bear market last week . Those concerns were driven in part by developments in the United States.\n\nFirst, US shale companies ramped up production faster than anyone anticipated. US output topped 11 million barrels per day in August for the first time ever.\n\nSecond, the Trump administration granted temporary waivers to China, India and other countries to keep buying oil from Iran. The softer-than-expected approach prevented sanctions from knocking too many Iranian barrels offline.\n\n'We need a floor!'\n\nUS oil prices declined 10 straight days through Friday.\n\n\"We need a floor! It's been quite a month,\" Dan Eberhart, CEO of oilfield services company Canary LLC, told CNN Business.\n\nSaudi energy minister Khalid Al Falih suggested the kingdom wants to do just that.\n\n\"The consensus among all members is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market,\" Al Falih said at a conference in Abu Dhabi Monday. \"If that means trimming supply by a million [barrels per day], we will do it.\"\n\nThe odds are \"fairly high\" that OPEC and its allies will announce next month a production cut of about 1 million barrels per day, according to Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital.\n\nUS oil prices initially jumped around 1% on Monday, defying a selloff in the stock market. However, the rally faded and crude settled below $60 a barrel. The 11-day slump is the longest slump since futures trading began in 1983.\n\nWhile the Dow dropped nearly 2%, some oil companies with shale exposure, including Hess ( HES ) and Pioneer Natural Resources ( PXD ), outperformed.\n\n\"For oil companies, whether shale or anywhere else, obviously the higher the better as far as prices go,\" said Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James.\n\nMolchanov cautioned that companies make their investment decisions based on long-term oil price forecasts, not short-term moves.\n\nFrackers took on debt\n\nStill, some small and medium-sized frackers piled on debt to take advantage of opportunities in the Permian Basin and other shale oilfields. That debt makes these companies vulnerable to short-term changes in cash flow caused by swings in prices.\n\nUS oil companies sensitive to oil price movements include frackers like Whiting Petroleum ( WLL ) and Oasis Petroleum as well as California Resources and Kosmos Energy ( KOS ), according to analysts.\n\nLarge independent producers such as EOG Resources ( EOG ) and Devon Energy ( DVN ) are also somewhat levered to prices because they only produce the raw commodity.\n\nOil supermajors, such as ExxonMobil ( XOM ), Chevron ( CVX ) and BP ( BP ), are more insulated to price swings because they are diversified. All three own refining businesses that give them a natural hedge when prices crash.\n\nNo price war this time\n\nSaudi Arabia has its own reasons for defending prices. Brent crude needs to fetch around $89 a barrel in order for the kingdom to balance its 2018 budget, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's well above current prices.\n\nIn 2014-2015, Saudi Arabia took a much different approach aimed at easing a supply glut. At the time the kingdom flooded the market with excess oil in a bid to drown out high-cost producers, including shale companies in the United States.\n\nCheap oil -- crude dropped to $26 a barrel in early 2016 -- caused dozens of oil companies to file for bankruptcy and led to countless layoffs. But shale oil companies emerged from the crash with stronger balance sheets and better technology.\n\nIt seems that Saudi Arabia doesn't have a desire to fight that war against US shale again.", "(CNN) Here's a look at the life of Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader and Democratic senator from New York.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: November 23, 1950\n\nBirth place: Brooklyn, New York\n\nBirth name: Charles Ellis Schumer\n\nFather: Abe Schumer, exterminator\n\nMother: Selma (Rosen) Schumer\n\nMarriage: Iris Weinshall (1980-present) Iris Weinshall (1980-present)\n\nChildren: Jessica, Alison\n\nEducation: Harvard University, A.B., 1971; Harvard Law School, J.D., 1974\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts: He edited his high school newspaper, and at one point considered pursuing a career in chemistry.

of Democracies, where she focuses on the Gulf. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nThe killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi confirms what we already know: The US alliance with Saudi Arabia is not built on shared values. This is a relationship sustained by mutual interests, namely oil for security. From Wahhabism to hate speech to incitement and women's rights , the US has compromised on its values repeatedly.\n\nWhatever steps Congress and the Trump administration take to punish the kingdom, there is a line that cannot be crossed. Elements of the US-Saudi strategic partnership remain vital to US interests \u2014 especially Riyadh's role as the world's swing oil producer. The kingdom's massive oil wealth keeps global oil markets balanced and prices relatively low.\n\nIf America really wants to start distancing itself from its unhappy marriage with Saudi Arabia, it needs a plan. The Saudis recently unveiled their plan to become less dependent on oil. It's called Vision 2030. Washington needs a Vision 2030, too.\n\nJUST WATCHED Saudi Arabia calls for oil output cuts Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Saudi Arabia calls for oil output cuts 01:50\n\nEven if Saudi Arabia was not an imperfect or troubling ally, the US needs this vision. The US must adopt a national strategy for a post-oil future. Without energy independence, or at least a serious plan for a post-oil future in mind, Washington will find itself stuck in the past. A national strategy for a post-oil future would boost the US's geopolitical flexibility and leverage around the world, ending its need to rely on less-than-ideal partners. Such a blueprint would enable the US to pursue both interests and values equally, finally breaking Washington's long-standing dilemma with the Saudis and other allies in the Middle East.\n\nOn a policy level, an American Vision 2030 could include providing subsidies or indexing tax credits for electric cars that would incentivize increased ownership of electric vehicles. It could include government funding to boost R&D efforts at companies like Tesla or Lucid Motors to help them develop more cost-effective models. It could include a spending package to build a large, well-connected charging infrastructure network\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Here is a look at the life of Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: November 28, 1953\n\nBirth place: Elizabeth, New Jersey\n\nBirth name: Michael Chertoff\n\nFather: Gershon Chertoff, rabbi\n\nMother: Livia Chertoff\n\nMarriage: Meryl (Justin) Chertoff (1988-present)\n\nChildren: Philip; Emily\n\nEducation: Harvard University, BA, 1975; Harvard University, JD, 1978\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts:\n\nHelped write the Patriot Act after Helped write the Patriot Act after September 11th terrorist attacks\n\nPlayed a key role in the government investigations of WorldCom, Enron and the accounting firm, Arthur Andersen\n\nProsecuted the former boss of the Genovese crime family, Anthony \"Fat Tony\" Salerno, and the founder of Crazy Eddie electronics, Eddie Antar, and Jersey City Mayor Gerald McCann.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1978-1979 - Law clerk to Judge Murray Gurfein, US Court of Appeals Second Circuit, New York.\n\n1979-1980 - Serves as law clerk to Justice William Brennan, US Supreme Court.\n\n1980-1983 - Associate at Latham & Watkins in Washington, DC.\n\n1983-1987 - Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\n1987 - Recipient of the John Marshall award from the US Department of Justice.\n\n1987-1990 - Is first Assistant US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\n1990-1994 - US Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\n1994-1996 - Special Counsel for Senate Whitewater Committee.\n\n2001-2003 - Assistant US Attorney General, the criminal division.\n\n2003-2005 - Judge for the US Court of Appeals, 3rd circuit.\n\nFebruary 15, 2005-January 21, 2009 - Serves as the second Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nMarch 26, 2009-present - Senior counsel at the DC law firm Covington & Burling LLP.\n\nMay 1, 2012 - Takes office as Chairman of the Board Directors of BAE Systems, Inc.", "Washington (CNN Politics) In the middle of the busy week before the midterm elections, the White House held an event in the State Dining Room to advertise what sounded like a milestone: millions of new training opportunities pledged by companies and trade associations , offering pathways to better wages.\n\n\"We're up to 6.3 million new jobs,\" said Ivanka Trump, who has taken on the workforce development portfolio for her father's administration. \"That represents 5% of the current workforce. So it's really remarkable.\"\n\nThe event provided a pre-election showcase for the administration's efforts to seed better-paying careers across the US. But the idea that the pledge was responsible for adding all those jobs \u2014 amplified by the White House repeatedly on Twitter in in the final days of the vote \u2014 turns out to be exaggerated.\n\nCorporate America may well offer 6.3 million training opportunities in the next five years. According to interviews with many of the pledge's largest signatories, however, the numbers advertised at the Oct. 31 event largely represented a tally of already-planned training programs rather than the brand-new opportunities Ivanka Trump claimed.\n\nTake the Associated General Contractors, a trade group that represents about 26,000 construction companies and suppliers. The organization pledged 172,500 apprenticeships, safety programs, and upskilling courses over the next five years \u2014 all steps it planned to take with or without the pledge, a reflection of how difficult construction companies say it is to find enough skilled workers in today's hot economy.\n\n\"Our understanding was that the intent of the event was to demonstrate what employer and labor groups were doing to train workers in the United States,\" says Brian Turmail, the trade group's vice president for public affairs. \"It was a way to highlight investments they're already making.\"\n\nAnother construction association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, pledged 500,000 opportunities over the next five years \u2014 about as many people as they train annually as a matter of course.\n\n\"To be very candid, that number is a number that we heard from both our members and others, just an accumulation of 'I could use that based on the volume of work,'\" says Greg Sizemore, the association's vice president for workforce development. \"We have to, because of technology, retirement and attrition. You've got to educate.\"\n\nOther companies and organizations declined to specify how much of their commitment was new and in response to the White House's pledge, but acknowledged that a significant portion had been in the works previously.\n\nThe Society for Human Resource Management's pledge of 127,000 opportunities represents the number of people it plans to educate over the next five years through its two certification programs, which it launched two years ago , according to a spokeswoman. General Motors' 10,000 opportunities includes all of its internships, apprenticeship programs, support of vocational training programs, and continuing education programs, including one it started two years ago for people returning to the workforce after taking a break.\n\nFedEx pledged 512,000 opportunities, including employees who take advantage of its longstanding tuition assistance benefit and other pre-existing programs ; a spokeswoman would not say whether that represented an increase from FedEx's typical rate.\n\nWalmart pledged a million opportunities over the next five years. That would be roughly the same rate since 2016, when it began launching Walmart Academies, which have now trained about 500,000 associates\n\nSeveral companies and associations said that making a public commitment was helpful both to hold themselves accountable and to advertise to potential applicants that their industry offered career pathways at a time when job-seekers have more options than they have had in years.\n\nmillion opportunities over the next five years \u2014 a significant ramp-up over existing numbers. \"What the pledge did for us is it helped us step up even further, cast broader vision, and use it as a rallying cry for our industry,\" says John Mitchell, president and CEO of IPC, an association of electronics manufacturers that typically certifies about 55,000 people a year and committed to amillion opportunities over the next five years \u2014 a significant ramp-up over existing numbers.\n\nMitchell said that reflects the tight job market as much as anything else. \"I'm sure some of that stuff would have happened anyway, because frankly, successful companies have to do that,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked why all the opportunities represented in the pledge were characterized as \"new\" even though many would have happened anyway, the White House said it didn't want to exclude companies and associations that already had training programs in place.\n\nEncouraging that investment has been a priority for several past administrations, and workforce development organizations say that there's nothing wrong with publicizing private sector training opportunities through mechanisms like Trump's pledge.\n\nHowever, they note that public sector investment is important too \u2014 and the Trump White House's past two budget proposals have contained drastic cuts to federal funding for workforce training , even though Congress hasn't gone along with them.\n\n\"We've consistently heard from this administration these big public calls saying they're focusing on workforce development, but at the same time we've seen a lot of focus on eliminating programs or streamlining programs ,\" says Katie Spiker, who leads federal policy for the National Skills Coalition.\n\nPublic funding is particularly important for smaller employers who can't necessarily invest in large-scale training programs, Spiker says, as well as to create support services like transportation and child care to make it easier for workers to complete their training.\n\nAlthough at last week's event National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said that the commitments included \"no government money,\" a few signatories said that their commitments did include some opportunities supported by federal funding. For example, the Associated General Contractors provides safety training to 700 workers per year thanks to the Department of Labor's Susan Harwood grant program , which the White House's proposed fiscal year 2019 budget would have eliminated.\n\nIn response, the White House said that the vast majority of opportunities represented in its pledge were funded by private money, and that they didn't screen out those that were subsidized by taxpayers.\n\nThat includes the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, which pledged almost 370,000 opportunities on behalf of members. Some apprenticeships are supported by federal grants, but Executive Vice President Rob Gifford says the Foundation is committing millions of dollars to the effort, too. \"The overwhelming majority is member money,\" he said.", "Photos: Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' to these Thanksgiving dishes Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' \u2013 The average American gains 1 to 2 pounds during the holiday season, according to a study in The New England Journal of Medicine.

That's why they keep on working.\n\nDozens of firefighters, police officers and sheriff's deputies in Northern California have lost their homes to the massive Camp Fire, officials say, and their numbers are expected to grow. But it has barely stopped the officers from answering the call of duty.\n\nThe Camp Fire is the most destructive in the state's history , torching thousands of homes and obliterating the historic town of Paradise. By Monday morning, it had burned more than 113,000 acres and was about 25% contained.\n\n\"A high percentage of firefighters who live and work here lost their homes,\" Tim Aboudara, a representative of the International Association of Firefighters, told CNN affiliate KCRA\n\n\"To see the number of them that were out there fighting the fire, knowing that their own homes were lost, it's just -- it's unbelievable.\"\n\nFirefighters hold a morning meeting as they battle the Camp Fire on Saturday in Paradise.\n\nAt least 53 firefighters had lost their homes in Butte County as of Sunday night, Aboudara said.\n\nOne of them is Leland Ratcliff, captain of the US Forest Service's Feather River Hotshot crew. He saw the smoke over Paradise on Thursday and said his intuition told him the fire was on a rapid path to destroy the town.\n\nHe was able to tell his wife, who took both children out of school before official evacuations began. As the family fled with their dog, cat and important documents, there were already spot fires near their home, Ratcliff told CNN.\n\nOnce they were safe, Ratcliff said, he had to make a decision: \"Do I go try to save other stuff (from our house) or do I go to try to let people know what was going on?\"\n\nHe chose the latter, evacuating residents from their houses and plucking them from the streets, putting them on Forest Service vehicles and racing them to points of protection set up by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nHe said it wasn't a difficult decision in the moment, but then he realized what things he lost forever in the house he left -- his children's handprints from kindergarten, and his wedding pictures.\n\n\"The guilt doesn't come until afterwards, when you realize you don't have that stuff anymore. ... You always want to think that life is more important than property, but it doesn't make it any easier in hindsight.\"\n\nThe IAFF union set up a disaster operations center in the town of Chico to help members affected by the fire. Aboudara shared the story of one firefighter who came to the center on Sunday.\n\n\"He was just blocks away from his own home, engaged in a firefight, well aware that his own home was possibly on fire,\" Aboudara said. \"He had to stay on mission and keep doing his job, not knowing if his fianc\u00e9e got out.\"\n\nMost members of the Paradise police force lost their houses, Mayor Jody Jones told KCRA. The mayor herself was left homeless -- along with town council members and public works employees, she said.\n\nThe Butte County Sheriff's Office said more than 30 of its sheriff's deputies reported for duty despite losing their homes, too, CNN affiliate KTXL reported\n\nYuba and Butte County sherriff's deputies sift through a destroyed home to collect the human remains of a victim of the Camp Fire on November 10 in Paradise.\n\nJarrod Hughes, a sergeant with the nearby Colusa Police Department, said he raced out of his Paradise home when the fire got closer, throwing his bags and animals in his truck and making sure his 14-year-old son got to safety.\n\nBut after doing that, Hughes told KTXL, \"I get my uniform and my patrol car and head back up to help.\"\n\n\"It's my community. It's where I grew up. It's something I absolutely had to do,\" he explained. \"There was no question about it. It was get my family to safety so I can get in and get back up there and help everybody else.\"\n\nMonday, Ratcliff was in Susanville, where the family is staying with his mother-in-law. It was his first day off since Thursday, but he planned to be back at work the next day.\n\nAsked what he says to people who might call him brave, Ratcliff demurred.\n\n\"No, I don't know. No. We just do what we do because we like it. We like helping people. The adrenaline rush and helping people.

Here it is:\n\n\"Get ready for Hillary Clinton 4.0. More than 30 years in the making, this new version of Mrs. Clinton, when she runs for president in 2020, will come full circle\u2014back to the universal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand of 1994. True to her name, Mrs. Clinton will fight this out until the last dog dies. She won't let a little thing like two stunning defeats stand in the way of her claim to the White House.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nThat's former Clinton pollster Mark Penn and former New York City politician Andrew Stein 's view of how Clinton will run (again) and win in two years' time.\n\nAnd, before you pull a muscle from rolling your eyes too hard (this is a real injury!), consider what Clinton told Recode's Kara Swisher last month about another run for the nation's top office:\n\n\"Well I'd like to be president. I think, hopefully, when we have a Democrat in the Oval Office in January of 2021, there's going to be so much work to be done. I mean we have confused everybody in the world, including ourselves. We have confused our friends and our enemies. They have no idea what the United States stands for, what we're likely to do, what we think is important, so the work would be work that I feel very well prepared for having been at the Senate for eight years, having been a diplomat in the State Department, and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting.\"\n\nIn case you are keeping track at home, that isn't a \"no.\" Or even close to one.\n\nYou can understand why Clinton wouldn't want to totally rule out another bid. Buyer's remorse from voters who helped elect Donald Trump in 2016. The backing of an energized female base within the Democratic Party. Plus, if Joe Biden (75 years old) and Bernie Sanders (77) can run again for president, why can't she?\n\nTrue enough! But here's the thing: Democrats should be rooting VERY hard against another presidential run by Clinton. That is, if they want to beat Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nAs you may remember, Clinton lost the 2016 presidential race to Trump. You might have missed it, it wasn't that big a story.\n\nShe lost that race despite these facts:\n\nShe was seeking to follow a popular Democratic president in office. She drastically outraised and outspent Trump in all key battleground states. A tape emerged just weeks before the end of the race where Trump made a laundry list of misogynistic comments. Her opponent was Donald Trump.\n\nYes, there were mitigating factors -- most notably James Comey's decision to announce that he was re-opening the FBI investigation into her use of a private email server just days before the election. And WikiLeaks' strategic release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee designed to embarrass the Clinton team and distract them from the task at hand.\n\nBUT, but, but. The 2016 race was still a VERY winnable one for Clinton -- and one that most experts, polls and people expected her to win, and win easily.\n\nAnd then she lost.\n\nThe roots of that defeat are pretty obvious in retrospect. People didn't like Trump. But they didn't like Clinton any better. People didn't trust Trump or think he was honest. But they felt the exact same way about Clinton.\n\nIn the end, people voted for Trump -- and, yes, Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million -- because they wanted RADICAL change. And he was that change. Clinton was, well, more of the same.\n\nHere's a number that tells the story of that election : Almost 4 in 10 voters said that the most important thing about a candidate for them was that he or she could bring about needed change in the country. Trump got 82% of the vote among that group. Clinton got 14%.\n\nNow, ask yourself this: What's changed? I'll answer that one for you: Not a hell of a lot.\n\nIf anything, Clinton is in a worse position, politically speaking, than she was back then. According to Gallup polling in September , just 36% of people have a favorable view of Hillary Clinton. That's down 7 points from where it stood just before the 2016 election and is tied for her lowest favorable rating ever in Gallup polling.\n\nWhy? Who knows? Some of the low regard in which Clinton is held is tied to the devastating efficacy of Trump's \"Crooked Hillary\" attacks. Some likely has to do with her decision to remain a vocal and high-profile critic of the president after losing. Some -- much? -- of it has to do with the fact that negative feelings about Clinton are baked into the electorate and just will never change.\n\nThat deep-seated negative opinion about Clinton is at the center of why she would be a very poor choice for Democrats in 2020. Clinton's many years in the public eye -- and the many questions raised about her time in public life -- allowed Trump to make the election a referendum on her and her baggage rather than on him and his own deep flaws as a person and a politician.\n\nWhich, interestingly enough, Penn and Stein acknowledge right at the start of their piece arguing that Clinton will run and win in 2020. The very fact that there can be a \"Clinton 4.0\" suggests she may have a) been around national politics too long and/or b) changed shape as a politician too many times over that multiple decade run in the public eye.\n\nWith a field packed with fresh faces -- including California Sen. Kamala Harris, who is the new No. 1 in our 2020 rankings -- the case to give Clinton a third (or fourth) bite at the apple is a tough sell.\n\nAnd, remember this: Beating Trump is harder than it might look from the outside. For all of his abnormalities in office, he has demonstrated an ability to rally the Republican base like few GOP politicians before him. And he will do absolutely anything -- literally -- to win.\n\nDemocrats would do well to try a different approach than Clinton used in 2016, which, when boiled down, amounted to this: I'm running against Donald Trump, and you're certainly not going to vote for him, are you?\n\nAnd they'd be well served to try a different candidate to deliver that different message -- not someone who was rejected by voters in the last presidential election even though she was running against the weakest Republican nominee in modern memory.\n\nThe third time is rarely the charm in presidential politics. Especially when you're talking about a candidate as divisive as Hillary Clinton.", "(CNN) As if the gut-wrenching images weren't powerful enough, the staggering numbers behind the California wildfires show this recent rash of infernos is unlike any other:\n\n50 deaths\n\nOf the 50 people killed in this month's wildfires, 48 died in Northern California's Camp Fire .

He made that abundantly clear after taking office in 2015, when he mandated his cabinet be 50% men and 50% women \u2014 a first in the history of the office.\n\nTrudeau says his father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, taught him the importance of defending the rights of others. But he credits his mother and his wife with shaping him into the feminist he is today.\n\n\"I, at one point, said to Sophie, my wife, that it was really important to me that we raise our daughter Ella-Grace, to be a feminist,\" he says. \"And she said, 'Yes. And your sons?' Because I have two sons as well. And I I said, 'Oh, oh, yeah. I guess I need to raise them to be feminists, as well.'\"\n\nLast year, Trudeau introduced a new parental sharing benefit , which provides an additional five weeks of leave for mothers and fathers when they both agree to take time off.\n\n\"You're creating more parental involvement and investment in things like changing diapers and being part of a new baby's life,\" Trudeau says.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trudeau: Both parents need time off work Replay More Videos ...

So anyone in those private sectors will have to abide by this pay equity legislation,\" he says. \"And there are already provinces with pay equity legislation that we're hoping is going to end up matching where we are.\"\n\nWhat we've seen time and time again is when you have more fairness, more equality, you actually create better prosperity, more opportunity for everyone.\" Justin Trudeau\n\nTrudeau also recently introduced new legislation to increase women's representation on boards. Canadian women hold only 14% of board seats, despite making up 48% of the country's workforce. Unlike a recent California law that mandates that there be at least one woman on every public company board, Trudeau's proposed legislation would force companies to share board member diversity information with shareholders, essentially shaming them into cooperation.\n\n\"So by forcing a level of transparency and making people actually explicitly say what their plan is to bring more women onto boards, more diversity onto their boards, we're going to spur people to actually act,\" Trudeau says.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trudeau: Government should play a role in equal pay Replay More Videos ...

He denied the allegations, saying , \"I do not feel that I acted inappropriately in any way. But I respect the fact that someone else might have experienced that differently and this is part of the reflections that we have to go through.\"\n\nWhen asked how the #MeToo movement has changed his leadership, Trudeau told Harlow that \"respecting and leaving room for multiple voices and multiple experiences is essential in our conversation.\"\n\nWhile his work for women has afforded him accolades from many, recent Nanos Research polls showed a decline in support from men for the prime minister. As one poll scientist told the Harvard Political Review, \"there's a tacit assumption that they are not a priority.\"\n\n\"I can understand worries that people have any time there is a status quo that is challenged,\" Trudeau says. \"But what we've seen time and time again is when you have more fairness, more equality, you actually create better prosperity, more opportunity for everyone.\"\n\nTrudeau says he's encouraged by more conversations about male allyship , and he sees huge opportunity when it comes to teaching more men about this path.\n\n\"You can have a world in which our daughters believe they can do anything but in which our sons also believe that our daughters can do and be anything and will be allies to them,\" he says. \"That's really how we have to raise our families.\"", "(CNN) If you're sitting down while reading this, stand up. Guidelines released Monday by the federal government show that most Americans are not getting the exercise they need, costing the health care system over $100 billion each year.\n\nThe new standards are similar to those released 10 years ago, but the government is scrapping a recommendation that physical activity occur in 10-minute blocks, instead telling Americans to \"move more and sit less\" whenever possible.\n\nAny amount of exercise has some health benefits, officials say, and some benefits are even immediate, like better quality of sleep or reduced anxiety.\n\n\"The new guidelines demonstrate that, based on the best science, everyone can dramatically improve their health just by moving -- anytime, anywhere, and by any means that gets you active,\" said Dr. Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe guidelines recommend an hour of \"moderate-to-vigorous\" activity each day for children 6 to 17, along with muscle-strengthening activities two days a week, like climbing on playground equipment or playing basketball. For the first time, the guidelines also recommend that preschool-age children have at least three hours of \"active play\" each day.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that agents in his country have listened to audio recordings related to Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\nTurkey has claimed for weeks to have audio evidence that exposes how the Saudi journalist was killed on October 2 as he visited the consulate to obtain papers for his upcoming marriage.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saturday that his country had shared the recordings with Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.\n\nWhile in Paris for World War I commemorations, Trudeau confirmed to reporters that Canadian agents had heard the recordings but that he himself had not.\n\n\"We continue to be engaged with our allies on the investigation into accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and we are in discussions with our like-minded allies as to next steps towards Saudi Arabia,\" he said.\n\nRead More", "\u064a\u0639\u062f

reconocimiento mundial\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Los dos mejores restaurantes de Am\u00e9rica Latina, seg\u00fan Latinamerica's 50 Best, est\u00e1n en Per\u00fa: Maido y Central, en Lima. Estos son los \u00fanicos latinoamericanos que aparecen entre los 10 mejores de este mismo listado a nivel mundial, poniendo a la cocina de Per\u00fa en el foco de la gastronom\u00eda regional y mundial.\n\nJunto a Per\u00fa, M\u00e9xico, se destaca como uno de los pa\u00edses que m\u00e1s restaurantes tiene en la lista de Latin America's 50 Best, un listado que es elegido por la votaci\u00f3n de chefs y restauranteros, periodistas y cr\u00edticos, y viajeros cosmopolitas que debieron haber visitado los restaurantes de por los que votan por lo menos una vez el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o.\n\nY otras cocinas regionales, como las de Colombia y Chile, est\u00e1n dando la batalla por ingresar al mundo de los mejores. \u00bfQu\u00e9 les falta?\n\nLos casos de Per\u00fa y M\u00e9xico\n\nSin duda, para los expertos, lo que hace grande en t\u00e9rminos de gastronom\u00eda a Per\u00fa y a M\u00e9xico es su amplia tradici\u00f3n cultural, pues esta industria, dicen, se ha desarrollado durante muchos a\u00f1os en esos pa\u00edses y ha logrado posesionarse no solo entre los mismos comensales locales, que se han identificado y reconocido la importancia de su comida, sino tambi\u00e9n en el exterior.\n\n\"Es identidad, es orgullo patrio, es sentirse orgulloso de tu pa\u00eds y de tu cocina\", le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Mitsuharu Tsumura, chef de Maido, que hace unas semanas fue elegido como el mejor restaurante de Am\u00e9rica Latina.\n\n\"Desde la persona que maneja el taxi en un aeropuerto, la gente que est\u00e1 en la calle, en el hotel que te est\u00e1s hospedando, que te hable de su cocina, que crea, que lo valore, que recomiende lugares, que no solamente sea el cocinero o el restaurante, sino que la sociedad en general valore y se sienta orgullosa de su cocina\", agreg\u00f3 Tsumura.\n\nVirgilio Mart\u00ednez, de Central, coincide en que en las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas los peruanos han logrado tener un \"aprecio\" por sus tradiciones.\n\n\"En estos 20 a\u00f1os hemos aprendido y seguimos aprendiendo a mirarnos a nosotros mismos, c\u00f3mo nos alimentamos\", le dijo Mart\u00ednez a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\n\n\"Realmente se est\u00e1 regresando a las ra\u00edces\", a\u00f1ade Mart\u00ednez. \"La gente est\u00e1 pensando m\u00e1s en lo que est\u00e1 comiendo a los 'las carretillas', que son lugares peque\u00f1os humildes y empezamos a apreciarlo y empezamos a valorarnos\".\n\nSeg\u00fan \u00e9l, la alta cocina peruana viene inspirada por estos lugares \"peque\u00f1os, humildes\" donde hay una \"creatividad e innovaci\u00f3n brutal\".\n\nMira en este video: El mejor restaurante de Am\u00e9rica Latina nos cuenta sus secretos\n\nLa diversidad\n\nTsumura y Mart\u00ednez concuerdan que la diversidad alimentaria en Per\u00fa es la clave para que la gastronom\u00eda local pueda desarrollarse como lo ha hecho hasta ahora. Seg\u00fan Virgilio Mart\u00ednez, esa diversidad es clave para Per\u00fa, pues este pa\u00eds no es solo es andino, sino tambi\u00e9n amaz\u00f3nico.\n\n\"El hecho de estar muy cerca a los Andes y a la Amazon\u00eda nos pone en posiciones donde tenemos productos muy cerca, productos con muchas historias\", dice Mart\u00ednez. \"Per\u00fa es pa\u00eds que es 60% Amazonia, entonces empezamos a ver que nosotros no solo \u00e9ramos Lima como antes pens\u00e1bamos, sino es un pa\u00eds tan andino como amaz\u00f3nico y antes no lo dec\u00edamos\".\n\nY para Tsumura, la fusi\u00f3n de gastronom\u00edas internacionales en Per\u00fa es muy importante.\n\n\"Hay una gran cantidad de productos maravillosos que compartimos todos, no solamente en Per\u00fa, (sino) en toda Latinoam\u00e9rica\", le dijo Tsumura a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \"Y las influencias externas como la japonesa, la china, la espa\u00f1ola, la africana, la italiana, de alguna manera u otra han ido enriqueciendo la cocina cada vez m\u00e1s\".\n\nM\u00e9xico\n\nM\u00e1s arriba, en M\u00e9xico, la tradici\u00f3n y la defensa de su cultura ha sido clave para que tambi\u00e9n sea una de las cocinas m\u00e1s importantes de la regi\u00f3n.\n\n\"Para m\u00ed una de las cosas m\u00e1s grandes que tiene es que tiene un semillero, una base espectacular\", le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol el espa\u00f1ol Jes\u00fas Escalera, chef de La Postrer\u00eda, en Guadalajara, al hablar sobre la formaci\u00f3n de nuevos cocineros en este pa\u00eds. Seg\u00fan \u00e9l, en M\u00e9xico los chefs \"han agarrado t\u00e9cnicas nuevas con las bases regionales\" y esto ha hecho que la gastronom\u00eda mexicana, \"se catapulte\".\n\nEscalera fue reconocido hace unas semanas con el premio de Mejor pastelero de Am\u00e9rica Latina seg\u00fan Latinamerica's 50 Best.\n\nSolo este a\u00f1o, M\u00e9xico fue el pa\u00eds que m\u00e1s restaurantes puso en el top de los mejores 50 de Latinoam\u00e9rica: 11, frente a 9 de Per\u00fa. Y despu\u00e9s de los peruanos, Pujol, en Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, ocup\u00f3 el tercer lugar de la lista. En el listado de los 50 Mejores restaurantes del mundo aparecen en los puestos 11 y 13, Quintonil y Pujol, respectivamente, ambos en la capital mexicana.\n\nAlgunos de los platos m\u00e1s reconocidos de estos son La t\u00e1rtara de aguacate tatemado con escamoles y chips de quelites, en Quintonil; y el mole madre, mole nuevo, en Pujol.\n\nLos expertos tambi\u00e9n aseguran que el turismo es un gran impulsor de la gastronom\u00eda, pues al ser ciudades como Lima y Ciudad de M\u00e9xico tan atractivas para los turistas, la cocina cobra un reconocimiento y exposici\u00f3n internacionales.\n\n\"Es importante que todos los pa\u00edses sigamos creciendo a nivel gastron\u00f3mico porque eso ayuda a que el turismo\", agreg\u00f3 Tsumura \"Mucha gente hoy en d\u00eda lo que quiere es tener experiencias y eso es lo que es la cocina: es una experiencia\".\n\nColombia y Chile, en ascenso\n\nSeg\u00fan Laura Price, editora adjunta de Latinamerica's 50 Best, Colombia es uno de los pa\u00edses que est\u00e1 \"creciendo r\u00e1pidamente\" en el mercado gastron\u00f3mico, y al ser un pa\u00eds que est\u00e1 pasando por un \"buen momento\", es posible que en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os pueda tener m\u00e1s presencia entre los mejores.\n\n\"Yo creo que en la medida en que los cocineros empiecen con un discurso basado en las tradiciones culinarias colombianas o basados en la biodiversidad... creo que Colombia va a figurar en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os porque tiene todo: tiene producto, tiene creatividad\", le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Leonor Espinosa, cuyo restaurante en Bogot\u00e1, LEO, fue elegido como el mejor de Colombia y puso a este pa\u00eds entre los 10 mejores de la regi\u00f3n.\n\nEl restaurante El Chato, de Bogot\u00e1, tuvo la mayor nueva entrada, ubic\u00e1ndose en el puesto 21 del listado de los 50 Best.\n\nEntra tanto, Chile se perfila tambi\u00e9n como otros de los pa\u00edses que cuya gastronom\u00eda est\u00e1 creciendo. Este a\u00f1o tuvo cinco restaurantes en la lista, y el cuarto mejor restaurante de la regi\u00f3n est\u00e1 en Santiago: Borag\u00f3.\n\n\"Chile es un pa\u00eds donde la gastronom\u00eda ha empezado a tomar una relevancia hace no muchos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s\", le dijo a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Rodolfo Guzm\u00e1n, chef de Borag\u00f3. \"Hasta hace poco no solamente lo mejor sino que lo bueno era lo que ven\u00eda de afuera. Entonces est\u00e1 reci\u00e9n empezando\".\n\nPara Guzm\u00e1n, el hecho de que Chile \"se est\u00e1 empezando a sentir orgulloso de su territorio, de su cultura, de su gente\", es un s\u00edmbolo de crecimiento para la gastronom\u00eda de este pa\u00eds.\n\nEsta mirada hacia adentro es un paso primordial para que estas gastronom\u00edas puedan igualarse a otras de la regi\u00f3n como Argentina y Brasil, de donde hay 10 y 9 restaurantes entre los mejores de Latinoam\u00e9rica, respectivamente.\n\nY un ingrediente final que les falta a estas gastronom\u00eda es m\u00e1s exposici\u00f3n y tiempo para que puedan ver un surgimiento de sus cocinas, algo en lo que coincidieron expertos.\n\n\"\u00bfQu\u00e9 falta? Seguro que m\u00e1s exposici\u00f3n, impulsar el turismo gastron\u00f3mico, el trabajo en equipo, el trabajo en comunidad, entender un poco de mirarse a uno mismo\", dijo Virgilio Mart\u00ednez.\n\nLos expertos aseguran que las cocinas latinoamericanas que est\u00e1n en un proceso de surgimiento (como la colombiana y chilena) deben conectarse con sus ra\u00edces, involucrarse m\u00e1s con sus comunidades, generar m\u00e1s identidad cultural con lo propio, y esperar a que el tiempo haga lo suyo.\n\n\"Yo creo que todo pa\u00eds latinoamericano tiene la riqueza natural, la biodiversidad y la tradici\u00f3n para poder hacer que su cocina sea importante. Y si no se ha logrado todav\u00eda, (se debe) crear una cocina maravillosa, porque las cocinas se van inventando todos los d\u00edas\", puntualiz\u00f3 Mitsuharu Tsumura, para quien es necesario inventar y renovar todos los d\u00edas y tambi\u00e9n preservar la tradici\u00f3n.", "(CNN) Aung San Suu Kyi has been stripped of Amnesty International's highest honor in light of her \"shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for,\" the UK-based rights group announced Tuesday.\n\nAmnesty's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, wrote to Suu Kyi, Myanmar's civilian leader, Sunday informing her of the decision to revoke the Amnesty International Ambassador of Conscience Award, which she received in 2009.\n\n\"Today, we are profoundly dismayed that you no longer represent a symbol of hope, courage, and the undying defense of human rights,\" Naidoo wrote . \"Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\"\n\nAmnesty criticized the Nobel laureate in a press release for failing to use her \"political and moral authority\" to safeguard human rights in the country, citing her \"apparent indifference\" to military atrocities in ethnic areas and \"increasing intolerance of freedom of expression.\"\n\nOnce an icon of the international human rights community, Suu Kyi has been stripped of a number of prestigious awards amid allegations of genocide of the country's minority Rohingya Muslim population.\n\nCNN has reached out to Suu Kyi's representatives for comment.\n\nIn September, Suu Kyi said that, with hindsight, her government could have better handled the situation in Rakhine state.\n\nSuu Kyi 'actively shielded the military from scrutiny'\n\nThe announcement comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine State last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp.\n\nThe UN has called on the International Criminal Court to investigate Myanmar's military leaders on charges of genocide.\n\nIn the letter, Naidoo said Suu Kyi has \"chosen to overlook and excuse the brutal oppression and crimes against humanity committed by the military\" and adds that her administration \"actively shielded the military from international scrutiny and accountability.\"\n\nPhotos: Rohingya refugees flee Myanmar Rohingya children wait to receive food from an aid group at a refugee camp in Ukhiya, Bangladesh, on Tuesday, November 14.

Hide Caption 34 of 34\n\nSuu Kyi's administration has repeatedly denied abuses occurred in Rakhine State, saying the military was responding to attacks from Rohingya militants.\n\nGovernment propaganda portrays the Rohingya as illegal Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh and labels them \"Bengali,\" despite many Rohingya families living in Myanmar for generations. Online hate speech, especially on Facebook , against religious and ethnic minorities has been used to fuel political division and bloodshed.\n\n\"We have also been appalled to witness your administration spread hate narratives against minorities, fostering rather than challenging discrimination and hostility,\" Naidoo said in the letter.\n\nAs well as abuses in Rakhine State, Amnesty pointed to the military's operations in other areas of the country, including the northern Kachin and Shan states, where more than 100,000 people have been displaced in years of civil war.\n\nActivists and journalists imprisoned\n\nMyanmar's civilian government shares power with the military, which retains control of a quarter of the seats in parliament. But Amnesty criticized Suu Kyi for not using the power she does have in her official position as State Counselor to enact reforms that would benefit human rights. Since she took office in 2015, human rights activists and journalists have continued to be arrested and imprisoned for their work under repressive colonial-era laws, Amnesty said.\n\nEarlier this year, two Reuters reporters were sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been investigating military atrocities in Rakhine State, including the massacre of 10 Rohingya men and boys.\n\nJUST WATCHED Families of jailed journalists struggle to cope Replay More Videos ...

In March, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum announced it was rescinding the prestigious Elie Wiesel Award granted to Suu Kyi in 2012 because she had failed to intervene in Rakhine.\n\nIn November 2017, Suu Kyi was stripped of the Freedom of the City of Oxford award, which honored her in 1997 for \"her opposition to oppression and military rule in Burma.\" Suu Kyi studied at Oxford University's St. Hugh's College as an undergraduate, but her portrait in the college has since been removed.\n\nAnd in September, Canada's House of Commons voted unanimously to revoke her honorary citizenship, recognizing that \"the crimes against humanity committed against the Rohingyas constitute a genocide.\"\n\nSuu Kyi was serving time under house arrest when she was named Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience in 2009. She was awarded the honor in recognition of her peaceful and nonviolent struggle for democracy and human rights.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for justice and human rights in Myanmar -- with or without her support,\" Amnesty's Naidoo said.", "(CNN) White House officials have told congressional leaders and appropriators that President Donald Trump does not want any additional relief funding sent to Puerto Rico, a congressional leadership aide told CNN on Monday.\n\nWhile there are no talks to cut funds that have already been appropriated, a White House aide said negotiations have focused on keeping Puerto Rico relief funding out of a supplemental spending bill that would fund relief efforts in parts of the south that were ravaged by hurricanes this year.\n\nThat aide noted Puerto Rican officials haven't yet spent all the money Congress has set aside for them, and said the administration is moving to stop any more money from going to help the island \"because they don't need it and will most likely not be able to spend it.\"\n\nTrump's latest positioning on Puerto Rico was first reported by Axios . The White House has been making this known on Capitol Hill for \"a while now,\" the congressional leadership aide said.\n\nTrump has previously taken aim at Puerto Rican officials for their management of the billions in relief funds his administration has appropriated for storm recovery, accusing the island's leaders of spending some of that money for reasons other than hurricane clean-up.\n\nRead

El grupo fue prohibido en 2016.\n\nSeg\u00fan la agencia de noticias de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Prensa del Reino Unido (PA), la corte escuch\u00f3 que la pareja le dio a su hijo el segundo nombre \"Adolf\" por Hitler, debido a la \"admiraci\u00f3n\" de Thomas por \u00e9l.\n\nLas fotograf\u00edas que se recuperaron de la casa de la pareja que mostraba a Thomas vestido con la t\u00fanica blanca del Ku Klux Klan mientras sosten\u00eda a su hijo, seg\u00fan PA.\n\nAl jurado tambi\u00e9n se le mostr\u00f3 un tatuaje que tiene Patatas, que reproduce un intrincado dise\u00f1o del piso de una antigua sede de las SS en el castillo de Wewelsburg en Alemania, dijo PA.\n\nEl tribunal escuch\u00f3 c\u00f3mo los miembros de Acci\u00f3n Nacional ten\u00edan varios m\u00e9todos para camuflar el contacto entre ellos y usaron plataformas de mensajer\u00eda cifradas y cerradas para organizar reuniones para difundir su ideolog\u00eda.\n\nLa ex secretaria de asuntos del Reino Unido, Amber Rudd, prohibi\u00f3 al grupo, despu\u00e9s de calificarlo como \"racista, antisemita y homof\u00f3bica\".\n\nRudd agreg\u00f3 que es una \"organizaci\u00f3n que despierta el odio, glorifica la violencia y promueve una ideolog\u00eda vil, y no lo voy a defender. No tiene absolutamente ning\u00fan lugar en una Gran Breta\u00f1a que funcione para todos\".\n\nEl grupo fue proscrito despu\u00e9s de haber celebrado el asesinato del miembro del Partido Laborista del Parlamento, la legistlaora Jo Cox.\n\nComo parte del mismo juicio, Daniel Bogunovic, de 27 a\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n fue declarado culpable por ser parte del grupo y otros tres hombres admitieron que eran miembros antes del caso, dijo la polic\u00eda de West Midlands.\n\nLa pareja y los otros cuatro hombres ser\u00e1n sentenciados en diciembre, inform\u00f3 PA.\n\nHablando despu\u00e9s del veredicto, el jefe de la Unidad contra el Terrorismo de West Midlands, Matt Ward, dijo que los condenados \"no eran simplemente fantasmas racistas\".\n\n\"Ahora sabemos que eran una organizaci\u00f3n peligrosa y bien estructurada\", dijo en un comunicado en el sitio web de la Polic\u00eda de West Midlands.\n\n\"Su objetivo era difundir la ideolog\u00eda neonazi provocando una guerra de razas en el Reino Unido y hab\u00edan pasado a\u00f1os adquiriendo las habilidades para llevar a cabo esto.\n\nHab\u00edan investigado c\u00f3mo fabricar explosivos. Hab\u00edan reunido armas ... Si no se hubieran detectado verificado habr\u00edan inspirado violencia y difundi\u00f3 el odio y el miedo en West Midlands\".\n\nWard dijo que las condenas dieron un golpe significativo al grupo National Action. \"Hemos desmantelado su grupo de Midlands, pero eso no significa que la amenaza que plantean haya desaparecido\", agreg\u00f3.\n\nHasta el momento, un total de 10 personas han sido condenadas o admitidas como miembros de National Action, seg\u00fan PA.", "New York (CNN Business) Why are stocks falling again? President Donald Trump says it's because Democrats are gearing up to use their impending control of the House of Representatives to investigate him. As always, when it comes to the markets, the real answer is complicated.\n\nThe Dow fell more than 600 points, or 2.3%, on Monday, dragged down by investors' concerns about the tech sector and the rising dollar. The Nasdaq fell 2.8% and the broader S&P 500 fell 2%.\n\nApple ( AAPL ) fell 5% after supplier Lumentum cut its earnings and sales forecast because of weak demand, and JPMorgan cut its target price on Apple's stock.\n\nThat weighed on other technology stocks, including Amazon ( AMZN ) -\u2014 down nearly 4.5% \u2014 and Tesla ( TSLA ), which fell more than 5%. Facebook ( FB ), Google ( GOOGL ), Netflix ( NFLX ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) were all down more than 2%.\n\nThe strong dollar also weighed on stocks. The US currency surged to a 16-month high because investors fear the European economy could stall if no Brexit deal is reached this week. Prospects of another rate hike from the Fed next month have also helped lift the dollar. The rising dollar is a signal of a strong economy, but it hurts sales and profits for American companies that do business overseas.\n\nThe prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nThough Trump blamed Democrats for the drop, the Dow had actually bounced back since the midterms, rising last week in its best showing since March. Wall Street tends to like stagnation in Washington, so investors are actually just fine with Democrats taking the House.\n\nAs for what Trump termed the \"prospect of presidential harassment,\" there is not much evidence the stock market will bat an eye if Democratic leaders in the House begin investigations into the Trump administration. Stocks rose before, during and after President Bill Clinton's impeachment.\n\nStocks fell in the run-up to President Richard Nixon's impeachment proceedings and for a few months after he resigned. But the economy was in recession at the time.\n\nThe stock market had risen steadily after Trump's election through 2017. But it hiccuped in January 2018 after Trump introduced the first of many tariffs aimed at growing the US steel industry and reducing America's purchases of foreign-made products.\n\nStocks rebounded in the middle of the year but have swooned again because investors are worried about rising rates -\u2014 and a mountain of debt caused by the tax cut bill that higher rates will make more expensive

unseated in the midterm elections last week has come out with an op-ed blaming the late Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain for the party losing control of the House.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece , outgoing Minnesota GOP Rep. Jason Lewis pinned the wave of Democratic victories last week on McCain's vote in July 2017 to sink a GOP attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\"MCain's last-minute decision prompted a 'green wave' of liberal special-interest money, which was used to propagate false claims that the House plan 'gutted coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,'\" Lewis wrote.\n\nMcCain, along with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, crossed party lines to defeat the GOP's so-called \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare. The bill would have allowed states to waive key provisions in the landmark health care law, such as the requirements that insurers provide comprehensive coverage and put limits on consumers' out-of-pocket spending. This would have likely raised costs for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHealth care was one of the most talked about issues in the midterm elections, and Obamacare's protections for those with pre-existing conditions became a major point of focus. Despite the provisions of the White House-supported repeal effort and the Justice Department's own legal filings to the contrary, President Donald Trump tweeted in late October that \"Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions.\"\n\nMcCain died earlier this year and was a famed veteran of the Vietnam War. Lewis' op-ed was published on Veterans' Day.\n\nMeghan McCain, daughter of the late senator, responded to the piece on Twitter, writing, \"This is abhorrent.\"\n\nLewis, in his op-ed, maintained that under Obamacare \"all policyholders are charged as if they are sick.\" The House GOP repeal bill contained provisions that \"were an attempt to alleviate the pre-existing condition problem, not exacerbate it,\" and that without the bill being passed, Republicans couldn't campaign on it.", "New York (CNN Business) General Electric took years to break. New CEO Larry Culp knows that he won't fix it overnight.\n\n\"We didn't get to where we are in six weeks so it's going to take a while,\" Culp told CNBC on Monday.\n\nCulp, the former boss of industrial manufacturer Danaher, was unexpectedly hired on October 1 as the first outsider-CEO in GE's 126-year history. He quickly moved to slash GE's cherished dividend to a penny , took a $22 billion accounting writedown and warned of more trouble ahead.\n\n\"I've got the energy and runway to do what it takes,\" said Culp, 55. \"This is the challenge of a lifetime given where we find the company today.\"\n\nThe new CEO's blunt talk did little to inspire confidence on Wall Street. GE's ( GE ) shares dropped as much as 10% on Monday morning and briefly tumbled below $8 for the first time since March 2009. The stock is now down 54% this year.\n\nGE's nosedive accelerated on Friday after JPMorgan published a brutal research report warning about serious problems with the company's debt-riddled balance sheet. The firm specifically called out heavy leverage at GE Capital, its banking arm.\n\nJPMorgan analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr. said GE Capital is approaching a \"tipping point\" and warned that the \"clock is ticking.\" Tusa, who correctly went negative on the stock in May 2016, estimates that GE Capital has up to $45 billion of \"stranded\" debt and liabilities.\n\n'We do have a lot of leverage'\n\nAsked about the state of GE Capital, Culp told CNBC that GE is moving to rapidly shrink the business. He also said that GE Capital has assets that \"match\" liabilities.\n\nCulp vowed to move with a \"sense of urgency\" to repair GE's balance sheet by selling GE Healthcare, the majority stake in Baker Hughes ( BHGE ) and other businesses.\n\n\"We do have a lot of leverage,\" he said. \"We all agree in that regard. We have a number of options to bring that leverage down over time.\"\n\nSome analysts have urged GE to raise cash by selling stock, a move the company hasn't taken since Warren Buffett came to the rescue in 2008 . Culp reiterated that GE has \"no plans\" for an equity raise, but left open the possibility of reconsidering if \"conditions change.\"\n\nThe credit ratings companies are losing patience. Moody's Investors Services and S&P Global Ratings both cut GE's credit ratings last month because of concerns about elevated debt and shrinking cash flow. The downgrades forced GE to retreat from commercial paper , a form of cheap short-term borrowing relied on by businesses with strong balance sheets. GE is instead relying on more expensive bank financing.\n\nCulp said that GE has only tapped $2 billion of the $40 billion of credit lines it has with banks.\n\nGE Power 'close' to bottoming\n\nGE's cash crunch has been caused in part by poorly timed deals. Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE doubled down on fossil fuels by spending $9.5 billion in 2015 to acquire Alstom's power business. That acquisition turned out to be a disaster, as evidenced by GE Power's need to take a $22 billion goodwill impairment charge last quarter.\n\nCulp said that GE Power, which makes turbines for power plants, has successfully cut $700 million of costs and reduced its facility footprint by 20%. But he said that isn't enough given the pressures GE Power faces from the \"energy transition\" toward renewables.\n\nAsked if GE Power had finally bottomed, Culp said: \"We're getting close.\"\n\nCulp expressed confidence in the ability of GE employees to overcome the enormous challenges currently facing the company.\n\n\"They don't scare easily,\" he said. \"They are up for the fight.\"", "(CNN) Snapping a selfie might seem like a harmless bit of fun, but some people will take extreme risks to get a unique shot.\n\nAuthorities in India's capital New Delhi have spoken out after a newly-opened bridge attracted thousands of visitors, some of whom put themselves in danger to get a selfie.\n\nThe $200-million Signature Bridge, which spans the Yamuna River, was inaugurated on November 4, around eight years after construction began.\n\nImages posted to social media show people climbing the suspension cables and leaning out of moving cars to get the perfect picture, prompting local officials to warn people not to risk their lives.\n\n\"We have seen people getting too close to the edge or climbing over the rails so we try and dissuade them from doing this and inform them that it can endanger their lives,\" Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police, Delhi Police (North East district) told CNN.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Ford and Volkswagen appear headed for some kind of combination. They'd better.\n\nThe industry is facing the challenges and costs at least as great as those posed by the financial crisis of a decade ago. Going it alone no longer appears to be an option.\n\nAutomakers are spending billions of dollars in development costs as they try to develop the electric and self-driving vehicles they believe are the future. They're also facing more competition from tech companies, including Uber and Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG ). Upstarts like Tesla ( TSLA ) and new combinations, such as the joint effort by General Motors ( GM ), Softbank and Honda , also could shake up who wins the future of cars.\n\nIt's a race in which neither VW nor Ford are in lead.\n\n\"We don't see either Ford or VW as currently in a leadership position on autonomous mobility and see them as lagging peers in some areas,\" said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas. \"On electric vehicles, we see Ford and VW as in the middle of the pack -- not the leader, but not the laggard.\"\n\nFord has already said it plans to spend $11 billion on new technologies and reshaping the focus of the company in the next three to five years. Finding someone to share those kinds of costs with will be crucial to its success. But it has yet to give details of its plans.\n\nVolkswagen officials are similarly tight-lipped, refusing to confirm a report by Reuters that VW CEO Herbert Diess is set to outline a 10-year plan to the company's supervisory board as soon as next week.\n\nSo far the only alliance firmly in place between Ford and VW involves an agreement to work together on commercial vehicles. But more is in the works as the companies are in negotiations for additional forms of cooperation.\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg , Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said the companies' discussions are \"broad\" but not limited to any particular technology, product or geography. But some kind of combination or alliance appears inevitable.\n\nThe companies are clearly a good fit.\n\nFord's sales and profitability are strong in the United States, but the company is trailing competitors badly in China and continuing to struggle in Europe and Latin America. Volkswagen does well in Europe, China and Latin America but and has never been a major player in the United States.\n\nFord's lineup strength is with trucks and SUVs, but it's struggling in luxury cars and is walking way from sedans . Volkswagen is a power-player in sedans and luxury cars -- it owns the Audi brand -- but struggles in light trucks such as pickups and delivery vans.\n\nAs much as a combination of the two established automakers makes sense, a formal merger will be unlikely, if not impossible, because of the unique nature of each company's ownership structures.\n\nTwo classes of stock at Ford give the descendants of founder Henry Ford effective control of the automaker. His great-grandson, Bill Ford Jr., is the current chairman of the company and it's clear the Ford family is unwilling to give up that control.\n\nVolkswagen has about 20% of its shares owned by the German state of Lower Saxony, where it is based. That's a likely roadblock to a full merger as well said Rebecca Lindland, senior analyst for Cox Automotive.\n\n\"The ownership structures of the two companies are the one thing keeping them from a full-on merger,\" she said.\n\nEven without a full merger the two companies can get close enough to operate as a single automaker. Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi have been operating under such an alliance for nearly 20 years, sharing top executives, factories and other assets and holding stakes in one another.\n\nVW and Ford could buy joint ownership of a separate company that is working on new technologies such as electric and self-driving cars. GM has set up such a stand-alone company, dubbed Cruise, and has sold stakes in it to Softbank and Honda\n\nIn August Ford quietly set up its own Autonomous Vehicles stand alone business.\n\n\"As expected and intended, we're receiving significant interest from potential partners and financial investors,\" Ford CEO Jim Hackett told investors last month.\n\nThese kinds of alliances and joint ventures are the future of the rapidly changing auto industry, said Lindland.\n\n\"We're going to see a web of alliances that overlays the industry because we're facing such enormously capital-laden decisions that need to be made,\" she said.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl incendio Camp es el m\u00e1s devastador de la historia de California, pues ha quemado m\u00e1s de 44.000 hect\u00e1reas y no ha sido contenido\n\nEl incendio Camp virtualmente borr\u00f3 la ciudad de Paradise, hogar de m\u00e1s de 26.000 personas\n\nAl menos 31 personas hab\u00edan muerto hasta este lunes por los incendios Camp y Woosley en California\n\n(CNN) - Mientras los mortales incendios forestales, que se han cobrado al menos 31 vidas, siguen ardiendo en California, las autoridades tratan de ayudar a la gente a encontrar a cientos de desaparecidos.\n\nMichos de los desaparecidos son del condado Butte, donde arden los incendios m\u00e1s destructivos de la historia del estado.\n\nUnas 228 personas permanecen desaparecidas en el incendio Camp, dijo el sheriff del condado y forense, Kory Honea, a los reporteros este domingo en la noche.

Must go with Election Night!\"\n\nOn Arizona's race between Reps. Kyrsten Sinema (D) and Martha McSally (R), Trump tweeted this : \"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!\"\n\nHere's the thing: Nothing that Trump is alleging in these two tweets is accurate.\n\nFlorida is in the midst of an automatic machine recount that was triggered by the narrowness of the margins for both Scott (in the Senate race) and DeSantis (in the governor's race). Trump's allegation that \"large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere\" is either a) a reference to the high-profile -- and misunderstood -- story of a teacher in Broward County finding a box labeled \"provisional ballots\" (the box contained office supplies and zero actual ballots) or b) Trump's misunderstanding (purposeful or not) that the original vote count in Broward County took longer than some other counties in the state. Either way, what Trump is alleging is not accurate -- or at least not accurate given all publicly available evidence.\n\nIn Arizona, it's similarly hard to figure out what Trump is even talking about. I believe his \"SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH\" claim is related to potential discrepancies between the signatures on mail-in ballots and those the state has on file for voters. In those instances where a clear discrepancy is found, a call is placed to the voter to ascertain if they were, in fact, the person who had voted. ( This is a good explainer on the real story in Arizona .)\n\nThe point here is that in both circumstances, Trump is yelling \"FRAUD\" despite a decided lack of evidence to that end. What appears to be happening -- in both Florida and Arizona -- is that the election law is being followed. Is it a cumbersome process in both places? Absolutely! But that doesn't mean an election is being stolen from anyone. In fact, both Scott and DeSantis are still very likely to win -- as machine recounts very rarely produce huge vote flips, the sort of flips Democrats need to win those states. In Arizona, Sinema appears to be headed to a narrow but not razor-thin win. ( Sinema is ahead by 1.5 percentage points with more than 2.1 million votes counted .)\n\nTrump's approach is fact-free, yes. But that's nothing new.\n\nWhat IS important, though, is what Trump's baseless claims about the Florida and Arizona races tell us about how he will approach his own re-election race in 2020.\n\nWe already know that Trump is simply unwilling and unable to accept that he doesn't win -- or isn't the best or the most popular or whatever -- in every single situation. To do that, he often makes things up like that he had the largest inauguration crowd ever or that 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 election. Or that the 2018 election was \"very close to complete victory\" for him and Republicans.\n\nNow, fast forward to November 8 (or so) 2020. (The election is on November 3 in 2020.) And imagine that Trump has lost the White House as a result of a close loss -- a 1 percentage point margin -- in Florida. Is there ANY circumstance you can imagine where Trump doesn't claim fraud? Doesn't insist that the election is being stolen from him -- and, by extension, his supporters? Doesn't refuse to concede the race and instead seeks to invalidate the result?\n\nI can't. Not based on a) what we know about Trump and b) how he has approached the aftermath of the elections in Florida and Arizona. (REMINDER: Republicans are VERY likely to win both the Senate race and governor's race in Florida.) And such an unwillingness by a outgoing president to acknowledge his defeat could have consequences well beyond what Trump has wrought with his many other false claims over the past three years.\n\nIt's not great to have the President claim that he would have won the popular vote if not for millions of illegal votes. But it doesn't change the underlying political reality: Trump is President because he won -- with no questions or asterisks -- the Electoral College vote, and that is the way we choose presidents.\n\nIt's a very different thing if the President of the United States is defeated and refuses to acknowledge that fact because, well, he is incapable of seeing the damage he is doing to the peaceful transfer of power that makes American democracy a beacon of hope around the globe. An unwillingness to concede -- coupled with the likelihood that Trump would argue that the whole process had been rigged against him -- could create a major crisis, particularly given the unquestioning loyalty his supporters have shown for him in the first two years of his tenure.\n\nNow, this all could be a moot point if Trump wins a second term. But at the moment, Trump's approval numbers suggest he will face a very serious fight for another four years -- and he could very well lose. And that's when the irresistible force runs into the unmovable object: A documented loss on the one hand, Trump's unwillingness to acknowledge defeat on the other.\n\nThat would not end well -- for democracy.\n\nCORRECTION: This story's headline has been updated to correctly refer to the Senate race in Arizona.", "(CNN) \"Toy Story\" fans better buckle up because there's a new toy in town.\n\nPixar released a teaser for \"Toy Story 4\" on Monday and just when you thought you knew the whole gang -- Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Slinky Dog, Hamm the Piggy Bank and Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head -- along comes someone new.

children from sexual abuse , the president of the conference said in a surprise announcement Monday morning.\n\nIn announcing the decision to his fellow bishops, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo said he was disappointed by the Vatican's interference, which he said he learned of on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"At the insistence of the Holy See, we will not be voting on the two action items in our docket regarding the abuse crisis,\" said DiNardo.\n\nFor weeks, the US Catholic bishops have trumpeted a series of reforms they had hoped to make after what one cardinal called the church's \"summer of hell.\" Those reforms must be approved by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which gathers the country's bishops twice a year to debate and adopt new policies.\n\nThe Vatican's eleventh-hour intervention, ordered by its Congregation for Bishops, according to DiNardo, essentially puts the American bishops' reforms on hold.\n\nDiNardo, who looked shell-shocked Monday morning, tried to put a positive spin on the Vatican's decision, calling it a \"bump in the road.\"\n\nBut many bishops gathered in Baltimore through Wednesday were surprised and unhappy about the Vatican's decision, he acknowledged. Bishop Christopher Coyne of Vermont said the bishops had been \"thrown a little sidewise\" by Monday's announcement.\n\n\"We are not, ourselves, happy about this,\" DiNardo said during a press conference Monday in Baltimore. \"We have been working hard to get to the action stage, and we'll do it, but we have to get past this bump in the road.\"\n\nDiNardo also said that the text of the proposals for the bishops' meeting this week were finalized in October 30, which did not leave much time for the Vatican to raise objections or advise modifications.\n\nPope Francis met with his ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Christophe Pierre, on Saturday, according to the Pope's public schedule.\n\nPierre is in Baltimore and addressed the body of bishops on Monday morning, though he did not mention the Vatican's insistence that the US bishops delay their vote. In a brief interview afterward, he said the Pope is concerned about \"communion,\" the idea that the church moves together as a whole, rather than allowing national bishops conferences to make their own policies.\n\nThat goal, however, is in tension with the Pope's insistence that local church leaders are best equipped to understand and respond to the needs of their communities. Asked about the apparent contradiction, DiNardo called it \"quizzical.\"\n\nA Vatican spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPope Francis will convene a meeting of bishops from around the world in February to address the sexual abuse crisis, which has roiled the church on several continents, including North America, South America and Australia.\n\nThe bishops' well-laid plans\n\nThe Catholic bishops had been expected to debate and vote on several \"concrete measures to respond to the abuse crisis,\" according to a news release about the meeting in Baltimore.\n\nThose measures, according to the bishops' conference , included a hotline to report bishops accused of abuse or mishandling abuse cases, standards of conduct for bishops and \"protocols for bishops resigned or removed because of abuse.\"\n\nThe bishops can still debate those measures, but they will not taking binding votes on them this week, following the Vatican's intervention.\n\nDiNardo said the Vatican's instructions came in the form of a letter from its Congregation for Bishops, which he said had concerns about church law. Under canon law, only the Pope can hold bishops accountable. The congregation also wanted the US bishops to wait to take action until after the meeting of bishops in Rome next February.\n\nCatholic bishops in the United States have been heavily criticized for failing to hold themselves accountable for the sexual abuse of children, especially after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania released this summer found widespread evidence of abuse by priests and coverups by bishops.\n\nIn another scandal, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington and a powerful figure in the church, was demoted by Pope Francis after a man accused McCarrick of molesting him decades ago in New York. Since then, other men have come forward in media reports accusing McCarrick of molesting them while they were seminarians. McCarrick has denied the accusation from New York and is appealing his case at the Vatican.\n\nA number of Catholic bishops have said they are concerned that McCarrick was allowed to rise through the church's ranks despite persistent rumors about his conduct. DiNardo and others traveled to Rome this fall to personally ask the Pope for the Vatican's help in investigating McCarrick.\n\nImmediately after DiNardo made the surprise announcement on Monday, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago, one of the Pope's closest allies in the United States, said the bishops should still discuss the proposals, even if they are not approved this week.\n\nCupich also suggested that the bishops could vote on the new measures at an emergency meeting in March.\n\n\"We need as a conference, as brother bishops, to take up this issue for the good of the church in this country without delay,\" Cupich said.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) The Kardashians used their win Sunday night at the People's Choice Awards to shine a spotlight on those battling the California wildfires.\n\nThe family took a moment to reflect on the ongoing fires and last week's deadly mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.\n\nKim Kardashian West, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Kendall Jenner Kris Jenner, and Kourtney Kardashian joined together on stage to accept an award for their E! reality series.\n\n\"It's been a really rough week in our home in Calabasas, Hidden Hills, and [our neighbors in

right-wing group in England.\n\nAdam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court in the country's West Midlands region for being members of the extreme right-wing organization, National Action. The group was banned in 2016.\n\nAccording to the UK's Press Association news agency, the court heard that the couple gave their child the middle name \"Adolf\" after Hitler, because of Thomas' \"admiration\" for him.\n\nPhotos were also recovered from the couple's home that showed Thomas dressed in the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan while holding his son, according to PA.\n\nThe jury were also shown a tattoo Patatas has, which reproduces an intricate floor design from inside a former SS headquarters at Wewelsburg Castle in Germany, PA said.\n\nClaudia Patatas, 38, was found guilty of being a member of the banned far-right terrorist group National Action.\n\nRead More", "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

In fact, I've never even met the guy.\n\nI'm working out through Aaptiv, an app with dozens of coaches who lead pre-recorded, audio-only workouts. The app, which costs $14.99/month or $99.99/year, features a variety of beginner, intermediate and advanced workouts.\n\nAbout 200,000 users work out with Aaptiv, and the startup is growing fast. Last week the company announced an international expansion of the English-language app to 20 countries, and it plans to move into local languages in 2019.\n\nAaptiv is valued at $200 million and is backed by investments from Amazon, Disney, Warner Music and Bose. But the industry is crowded: An endless amount of workout apps and YouTube videos target people who don't want to fork over the cash for a personal trainer.\n\nSo Aaptiv hopes to stand out with its audio-only format. Founder and CEO Ethan Agarwal came up with the idea after identifying a need in his own workouts.\n\n\"I needed some kind of coaching that would work while I was running,\" Agarwal told CNN Business. \"The problem with videos is that I can't run down the street staring at my phone. That's why I started Aaptiv.\"\n\nThe app goes far beyond running: Courses are available for everything from yoga to strength training, voiced by a coach with current music playing in the background. The routines are designed for different settings like the gym, outdoors and home, and some require equipment like weights or a treadmill while others need no props.\n\nThe convenience and variety are big draws, but Aaptiv's audio-only format poses a major challenge: Because users can't see the exercises, they must rely solely on the trainer's verbal explanation to ensure they're doing the workout correctly.\n\nI experienced this problem whenever I tried a new workout. I understood the vast majority of the exercises, but about once a routine I would find I wasn't doing the movements the coach intended. And occasionally I was way off.\n\nCorrect form for a workout is key to avoid injury, noted Dr. Daniel Yadegar, a cardiologist at Weill Cornell Medical College who also uses Aaptiv. But he added, \"there are many people who work out on their own at the gym, without supervision, who take a similar risk. If used properly and with consistency, apps like this can be a great tool in achieving fitness goals.\"\n\nThe app's \"very vocal online community\" in its 32,000-strong Facebook page helps mitigate the risk of confusion and improper form, Aaptiv trainer Ackeem Emmons told CNN Business.\n\n\"If one person has a question about a particular exercise, then almost always lots of other users have the same question,\" Emmons said. \"And that tells us how we need to improve.\"\n\nUsers can also weigh in at the end of each exercise, as the app prompts them to rate the workout and leave feedback for Aaptiv's trainers.\n\nThose 22 trainers -- five full-time employees and 17 contractors -- develop their workouts with a quality-control team and record the audio sessions in a New York recording studio.\n\nAbout 4,000 personal trainers have applied for positions at Aaptiv, said CEO Agarwal.\n\n\"I heard about Aaptiv from a friend, and I thought these guys might put me out of business one day,\" said Emmons. \"So instead of waiting for that to happen, I applied to work with them.\"", "Photos: Season highlights The 2018 World Rally Championships is approaching its finale.

How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.\"\n\nIf the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.\n\nAnd the scans would be \"well set up for routine testing,\" according to Chiesa. \"It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.\"\n\nWhen healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.\n\nBut damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.\n\n\"What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,\" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.\n\nVascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found.

It cited a cabinet insider describing May as \"a ship's captain who can see an iceberg ahead but won't change course, even when members of the crew leap overboard.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sun columnist Trevor Kavanagh called her a pilot who has \"locked the cabin door\" and is sending everyone down together.\n\nBoris Johnson: 'Stage a mutiny'\n\nThe Daily Telegraph, which also pushed for Brexit during the 2016 referendum, led its Monday print edition with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson calling on the Cabinet to \"stage a mutiny.\"\n\nMay, he claimed, was \"on the verge of surrender\" to the European Union. Sunday's edition of the newsaper wasn't much more favorable to May, with members of parliament quoted as saying they would \"block May's Brexit plan\" even if she can convince her cabinet to back it.\n\nMuch of the focus this weekend was on Jo Johnson, Boris' brother and an opponent of Brexit, who quit as a government minister over May's plans on Friday and called Britain to hold a second referendum.\n\nTheresa May has '48 hours'\n\nThe Daily Mail, which had been known as a staunch supporter of Brexit until a slight softening in its line following a recent change in editors, declared that May had \"48 hours\" in the \"divorce battle\" to save the \"failing Brexit talks.\"\n\nOtherwise she would have to start preparing the country to crash out of the European Union without a deal.\n\nOne of the papers considered more balanced in its Brexit coverage, the Sunday Times, was similarly gloomy . It said May's Brexit deal was crashing as Europe \"turns off life support\" and that four of her anti-Brexit ministers were on the \"verge of quitting.\"\n\nThe anti-Brexit Guardian called May's plan \" under siege \" from her own party, and it quoted Labour Party members who said a second referendum could happen.\n\nLabour's Brexit policy, agreed at their party conference in September, is for all options to remain on the table, including a second referendum. Yet last week, party leader Jeremy Corbyn gave an interview to Der Spiegel declaring that Brexit could not be stopped.\n\nThe more measured Financial Times said Brussels and euroskeptics in May's Conservative party were turning \"up the heat\" and that her government was facing a \"fresh political headache.\"\n\nThe government tried to downplay talk of chaos on Monday. A spokesperson for May said there was nothing to suggest that other cabinet ministers were considering resigning from their positions over May's Brexit plans.\n\nMeanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told European government ministers Monday that intense negotiations were continuing but no deal had been reached yet.", "(CNN) The death toll from three car bombs detonated near a hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia has risen to 52 people, hospital officials told CNN Monday.\n\nAround 100 people were injured in the blast which happened near a hotel popular with visitors to the country and international journalists.\n\nMohammed Yusuf, medical director at the Medina hospital in Mogadishu -- where many of the wounded are being treated -- told CNN five people died in the early hours of Monday morning at the clinic, while two others passed away at another hospital, he said.\n\nPeople gather in the street amid wreckage from car bombings in Mogadishu, Somalia.\n\nA former government official, a district police chief, and a journalist are among those wounded in the Friday incident.\n\nFive of the attackers attempted to storm the Sahafi hotel but were shot and killed by policemen.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) His \"24K Magic\" album and tour has been a success and now Bruno Mars is sharing his good fortune.\n\nThe singer will be providing 24,000 Thanksgiving meals to benefit those in need in his native Hawaii.\n\nMars is linking up with the Salvation Army's 48th annual Thanksgiving Dinner meal program to bring some magic to those in need.\n\n\"We are humbled and honored by this generous donation from Hawaii's own Bruno Mars,\" Major Jeff Martin, divisional leader of the Salvation Army Hawaiian & Pacific Islands division, said in a statement. \"Bruno is a shining example of how people in Hawaii step forward and take care of one another and we are grateful to him for his aloha and kokua.\"", "Beckham received the Fashion Icon Award at the E!

But now it's through the privilege of being able to empower women through my designs,\" she said. \"I've always been surrounded by strong, supportive women.

But he was also a romantic husband to Barbara, his wife of 22 years, an engaged citizen who befriended several US presidents, and a painter who embraced abstraction.\n\nGlimpses into Ol' Blue Eyes' life -- the public persona and his more private side -- will be on display at Sotheby's upcoming New York sale of the estate of Barbara Sinatra (who passed away last year) in December. Drawn from their residences in Beverly Hills and Malibu, and the house Barbara purchased in Rancho Mirage, California after her husband's death in 1998, the more than 200 lots range from professional memorabilia to personal items that cast a new light on the performer.\n\nFrank Sinatra with his fourth and final wife, Barbara Sinatra. Credit: Courtesy the Estate of Barbara Sinatra\n\n\"People think of Sinatra as an entertainer, a singer and actor, somebody who liked to have a lot of fun with his friends, and a drinker, but ultimately what this sale illustrates is that he was very politically engaged and intellectual,\" Mari-Claudia Jimenez, managing director of Sotheby's Fiduciary Client Group, said in a phone interview.\n\nThe last large major Sinatra auction was held by Christie's in 1995, when Frank and Barbara organized what they jokingly called a \"garage sale\" after they sold their Rancho Mirage home. That auction of 250 lots raised $2.07 million, far above the presale estimate of $1.5 million.\n\nThis December's auction has an overall estimate of $3.5 million, though Sotheby's is hoping the Sinatra mystique will pull in far more.\n\nThe singer and the showgirl\n\nBarbara, a former model and Las Vegas showgirl, was Frank's fourth and last wife. In her memoir, \"Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank,\" she recalled how her \"romantic husband went out of his way\" to make her feel \"loved and cherished every day, taking the time to express his feelings,\" leaving little notes and cards for her to find.\n\nThe couple first met as neighbors in the early 1960s, 10 years before he finally kissed her at a party thrown by Eva Gabor. They were married in 1976.\n\nHow do art auctions really work?\n\nFrank's proposal was convoluted. First, he threw two huge jewels onto the bed (including an emerald-cut 20-carat diamond) and told her to pick one. Then, after having the chosen stone set, he dropped it into a glass of champagne for her to discover.\n\nThe 20.60-carat engagement ring carries an upper estimate of $1.5 million and is the top piece of jewelry in the sale, though there are several other pieces of note, including classic designs by Van Cleef & Arpels, Bulgari, David Webb and Marina B -- one of Barbara's favorite designers.\n\nIn her memoir, \"Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank,\" Barbara Sinatra described how her husband went out of his way to make her feel \"loved and cherished every day, taking the time to express his feelings.\" Credit: Courtesy the Estate of Barbara Sinatra\n\n\"He loved buying jewels for her and spontaneously surprising her in interesting ways,\" Jimenez said. \"There was a time when he'd put bracelets and rings in her pockets for her to find. One time, they were watching television, eating popcorn and she found a diamond ring inside the popcorn box.\"\n\nAll the presidents' friend\n\nFrank Sinatra and John F. Kennedy at the latter's 1961 inaugural gala. Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nHaving first met John F. Kennedy as a young senator, Frank had actively campaigned for Kennedy's presidential bid in 1960 and helped plan his inaugural gala. The auction includes a dedicated copy of Kennedy's 1955 book \"Profiles in Courage,\" signed when he was still a senator, as well as a deluxe edition of the inaugural gala program and three volumes of Kennedy's public papers, containing messages, speeches and statements he made as president.\n\n\"The intellectual aspect of his relationship with various presidents is important. It wasn't just about being the entertainment director. I think he felt like politics was part of his civic duties and part of being a good American citizen,\" Jimenez said.\n\nThe auction also includes signed books by or photographs of Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\nFrank Sinatra with President Ronald Reagan, a personal friend who he tirelessly supported. Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nFrank supported Nixon in 1972 on feeling the Democrats had shifted too far to the left and they developed a close friendship, holidaying together. Ronald Reagan was another friend whose presidential campaign he supported tirelessly through fundraising galas, as well as a personal donation reportedly of $4 million. Nancy Reagan can be seen in the background of a photograph taken of the Sinatras as they cut their wedding cake.\n\nCome paint with me\n\nWhile the 1995 featured several impressionist paintings and works by American artists, the upcoming Sotheby's auction includes a few fine art paintings that the couple had kept. On offer are a 1973 Norman Rockwell portrait of Sinatra he had commissioned and posed for, and a 1938 Walt Kuhn oil on canvas, \"Girl With Turban (Zuleika),\" which took pride of place in the couple's living room and reminded Barbara of her days as a show girl.\n\n\"Girl With Turban\" (1938) by Walt Kuhn once hung in Barbara and Frank Sinatra's living room. Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nThe auction also includes several abstract works painted by Sinatra himself.\n\n\"He found painting relaxing and had constructed artist studios in all of his homes,\" Jimenez said. \"He would mostly give them to friends and a few have come to the market. The most well-known was a work that belonged to Ronald Reagan and was sold in 2016 for $223,500.\"\n\nJimenez notes that while Frank was more interested in collecting figurative works, as a painter he focused on abstract art, creating work in the style of artists he admired, like Piet Mondrian, Robert Motherwell and Kazimir Malevich.\n\n\"There is in the sale a couple of clown paintings that are meant to be more allegorical about how he felt as an entertainer wearing a mask on stage, but that is the only time really when he's done something more figurative,\" Jimenez said.\n\nThe estate sale will be offered over three separate events: Lady Blue Eyes: Property of Barbara and Frank Sinatra, Lady Blue Eyes: Online, and finally as part of the Magnificent Jewels sale.", "(CNN) A young woman who became pregnant after being raped by her stepfather is to go on trial in El Salvador accused of attempting to murder her baby, under the country's strict abortion laws.\n\nImelda Cortez, 20, gave birth to her stepfather's baby in a latrine in April last year, according to the Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL), which has been supporting her case.\n\nThe baby girl survived and Cortez was placed into custody, said CEJIL.\n\nCortez is due to face charges Monday of attempted aggravated murder, and if convicted could face up to 20 years in prison, her lawyer, Alejandra Romero, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Cortez denies the charges.\n\nEl Salvador has some of the strictest abortion laws in the world -- abortion is illegal under all circumstances, with no exceptions, even in the case of rape or where the woman's life is at risk.\n\npetition calling for Cortez to be freed has received almost 50,000 signatures.\n\nCortez grew up in an impoverished family in rural Jiquilisco municipality, southern El Salvador. From the age of 12 she was sexually abused by her 70-year-old stepfather, said the petition to free her.\n\nPaula Avila-Guillen, director of Latin America Initiatives for the Women's Equality Center who has spoken with Cortez's lawyer, told CNN that the young woman \"didn't understand that she had just given birth, so after she found herself bleeding she started screaming and was taken to the hospital.\"\n\n\"Later they found the baby who was completely healthy,\" said Avila-Guillen, adding that after Cortez was detained, the child was cared for by Cortez's mother who was still living with the stepfather.\n\n\"What makes Imelda's case even more outrageous is that she had been a victim of sexual violence by her stepfather since she was 12-years-old until she was 18, however she's been treated as a perpetrator and not a victim,\" said Avila-Guillen.\n\nEl Salvador's strict abortion laws\n\nIn the small, socially conservative Central American country, women who have an abortion, or simply miscarry, can face up to 50 years in prison.\n\nAt least 129 women were prosecuted under El Salvador's stringent anti-abortion laws between 2000 and 2011, according to the pressure group Citizens Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion.\n\n\"There are numerous similar cases [to Cortez] in which the authorities do not provide adequate medical attention and rather treat them [the women] as criminals,\" Morena Herrera, the group's head, said in a statement.\n\n\"It is very serious and sad to see that nothing changes in one of the most restrictive countries in the world in matters of sexual and reproductive rights, while women die and fill prisons for no reason,\" said Herrera.", "(CNN) Richard Ojeda, the former congressional candidate who lost his 2018 bid as a Democrat in southern West Virginia, is running for president in 2020.\n\n\"I'm Richard Ojeda and I'm running for the President of the United States of America,\" he announced Monday at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC.\n\nPrior to his announcement, Ojeda filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for President and teased the run in an email to supporters on Sunday night.\n\nOjeda's entry to the race is unexpected and highlights just how massive the Democratic field for President will be in 2020. Democratic operatives believe big-name candidates will announce presidential bids in early 2019, but fully expect candidates like Ojeda and others to explore a run starting in late 2018.\n\nOjeda's unique candidacy -- he is a former Army paratrooper who ran on the Democratic ticket as a populist and Trump critic in Republican West Virginia -- markedly over-performed how Hillary Clinton did in the state in 2016. Trump won the state's 3rd Congressional District by 49 percentage points in 2016. Ojeda closed that gap, losing by 12 percentage points earlier this month.\n\nRead More", "Paris, France (CNN) Maria Ressa, the CEO of the Philippine news website Rappler, said Monday that her reporters would not be silenced in the face of tax evasion charges, telling CNN that \"journalists are more important today than ever.\"\n\nRessa vowed to fight the charges from the Philippines Department of Justice for tax evasion, which many see as a thinly veiled attempt by President Rodrigo Duterte to muzzle the investigative news site.\n\n\"In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are, what our identity is, and for our young reporters who are on the ground, how clear and necessary our mission is today,\" Ressa told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout from Paris, where she is in town for a peace forum.\n\n\"Our democracy is in transition,\" said Ressa, a former CNN bureau chief and award-winning journalist. \"The mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now, and we'll continue doing these stories.\"\n\n'Fearless reporting' under fire\n\nRappler has been a consistent thorn in the side of the Duterte administration, closely documenting its so-called \"war on drugs,\" a widespread crackdown that has been condemned for encouraging thousands of extrajudicial killings.\n\nIn January, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.\n\nThis month, officials said Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network, a fund created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.\n\nOn Friday, the country's Justice Department said it had \"found probable cause\" to indict Rappler and Ressa on charges of tax evasion.\n\nJUST WATCHED Rappler CEO: Stripping of license is political Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Rappler CEO: Stripping of license is political 03:00\n\nThe company said it was not surprised by the move, \"considering how the Duterte administration has been treating Rappler for its independent and fearless reporting.\"\n\nRessa told CNN that the cases leveled against Rappler were \"because we are trying to fight impunity on two fronts.\" She said the first front was \"the drug war.\" And the second front, she said, was \"lies on social media\" that are \"actually the basis of many of the cases that were filed against us by the government.\"\n\nDuterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler, but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees, personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malaca\u00f1ang Palace , his official residence, over their coverage of his administration.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Duterte spokesman Salvador S. Panelo said the case was about whether Rappler \"violated the law.\"\n\n\"The Department of Justice has found probable cause, hence a case was filed against the media outlet,\" he said. \"If you violate the law, then you can not escape the wrath of its punishment ... the law may be harsh but it is the law.\"\n\nDuterte and Trump reading from 'same playbook'\n\nRessa said there were many similarities between Duterte and US President Donald Trump's approaches to the press, telling CNN that the leaders were reading from \"the same playbook.\"\n\n\"When President Trump called CNN and the New York Times 'fake news,' a week later President Duterte called Rappler 'fake news,'\" said Ressa.\n\nRessa added that the \"seeding of lies on social media\" was leading to \"authoritarian-style leaders using their power to push back against our old gate-keeping powers.\"\n\nIn the latest Press Freedom Index, the Philippines fell six places to 134th of 180 countries, with the report's authors warning that the \"dynamism of the media has ... been checked by the emergence of a leader who wants to show he is all powerful.\"\n\nDuterte aside, Rappler has attracted widespread praise for its coverage. Last week, Ressa was in the US to accept a Knight International Journalism Award from the International Committee for Journalists (ICFJ).\n\nIn a statement announcing the award, the ICFJ lauded Ressa

The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) The debate over Brexit among UK politicians has become so toxic that the Prime Minister and leader of the opposition have more in common with each other than they have with their own parties.\n\nWith just weeks to go before a Brexit deal needs to be signed, Theresa May's plans for leaving the European Union have hit a brick wall. Some believe that she has as little as 48 hours to reach an agreement with Brussels, or risk having to spend millions in preparation for a no-deal.\n\nIn 137 days, the UK will leave the EU, whether or not an agreement between the two has been reached. And given the deep divisions between politicians of all stripes in London and the fast-approaching deadline, a no-deal Brexit has never looked so likely a prospect.\n\nAn emergency meeting of May's Cabinet, scheduled for Tuesday, to approve the latest version of the deal has been postponed.\n\nBarely a day goes by without a Conservative MP proposing a different version of what Brexit should look like, and whether the final deal should be put to the British people in a second referendum.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, gave an interview to a German magazine over the weekend, declaring that Brexit cannot be stopped. This goes against his own Labour Party's official line.\n\nThe problem with Brexit, as the Prime Minister is finding to her cost, is that it has been impossible to find a blueprint for EU withdrawal that makes all factions in all parties happy -- or, more seriously, is not furiously opposed by at least one of those factions.\n\nIn any vote she puts to Parliament, she needs 320 MPs from all parties to back her. There are 150 Conservative MPs who are ministers and government aides and are therefore obliged to either vote with her or resign. This means she is far short of a guaranteed Commons victory. Given the state of revolt in her party at the moment, she has a lot of work to do.\n\nFor Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary in July, May's compromise Brexit plan -- known as Chequers -- gives Brussels too much control over the UK even after Brexit.\n\nJUST WATCHED Britain's Brexit agreement deadline is near Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Britain's Brexit agreement deadline is near 01:59\n\nIn his latest article on the subject, Johnson said Britain would be forced to \"remain in captivity\" by Europe because a safety mechanism, or backstop, would tie the country into a customs union with the EU indefinitely.\n\nThere are at least 50 Conservative MPs who feel the same way -- enough to cause trouble for the PM but, crucially, not enough to win an overall majority for a hard Brexit when the final deal is put to a vote in the House of Commons.\n\nJohnson's younger brother, Jo, has put himself at the head of the other side of the debate, inside the same party. Jo Johnson resigned as transport minister on Friday, declaring the Prime Minister's \"failure of statecraft\" was the worst since the Suez crisis, one of the most calamitous moments for the British government in the last century. He said May's Brexit plans were a choice between \"vassalage or chaos,\" and the risk of a damaging no-deal was so high that there should be a People's Vote -- a referendum on the final deal.\n\nThese Conservative MPs in the remain/soft Brexit camp are a smaller group than their Brexiteer colleagues, but, given May has no overall majority in the Commons, every MP's vote counts.\n\nEven putting aside the rebellious factions in the Conservative Party, the issue of Northern Ireland is proving to be the sticking point in Brexit negotiations between the British government and Brussels. There is still no agreement on whether the Irish backstop -- the mechanism that would ensure Northern Ireland remains inside the EU customs union after Brexit to avoid a hard border with Ireland -- should apply to Northern Ireland only or the whole of the UK, and whether there is a further safety clause -- a backstop to the backstop -- to allow the UK to end this commitment.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Democratic Unionist Party, whose MPs have 10 votes in the Commons and are the only reason May has a theoretical majority in Parliament, are vociferously opposed to any backstop that leaves the province cut off from the rest of the UK.\n\nAnd then there is Corbyn's Labour Party, the official opposition in the Commons, which has as much Brexit disunity in its own ranks as the Conservatives. The Labour Brexit policy, agreed at their party conference in September, is for all options to remain on the table, including a second referendum. Yet last week, Corbyn gave an interview to Der Spiegel declaring that Brexit could not be stopped.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisted that Brexit could, in fact, be halted if the deal on the table did not meet Labour's demands. There are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who would vote with their Conservative counterparts, but the rest of Labour's 257 MPs are unpredictable, ranging from those who are loyal to Corbyn to those who are loyal to the EU and will block Brexit at any cost.\n\nSome MPs want to revoke Article 50, the triggering mechanism which set the path to Britain leaving the EU on March 29, 2019, because Brexit is in such a mess.\n\nNeither main party is officially advocating this as a policy, but the lack of agreement on all sides leaves a stalemate which, effectively, means an orderly Brexit cannot go ahead. In the Commons, there is no majority for a hard Brexit, soft Brexit, a People's Vote or remain.\n\nIt is a parliamentary impasse verging on a constitutional crisis. Brexit can never be solved because too many people disagree with all possible outcomes.\n\nAnd so, in the absence of any deal, and without a revoking of Article 50, Britain crashes out of the EU on a no-deal basis -- a scenario that has alarmed national and international businesses and inside Britain's machinery of government and public services, due to the prospect of swingeing tariffs on goods at the border, miles of queued lorries and stockpiling of food and medicines by panicking householders.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

afternoon that the razor-thin races for governor , senator and agriculture commissioner will be reviewed in a series of recounts which were triggered because the margins in all three contests are under .5%.\n\nAccording to unofficial results filed by the counties, Republican Gov. Rick Scott leads incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by more than 12,500 votes, or about .15%. The spread in the governor's race is larger, with Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, for a lead of .41%. In the narrowest contest, Democratic agriculture commissioner candidate Nikki Fried's advantage stands at 5,326 votes \u2014 just .06% \u2014 over Republican Matt Caldwell.\n\nLawsuits, Lawsuits and more lawsuits\n\nAs the counting continues, the biggest daily developments in this story will likely be the flurry of lawsuits that can and will be filed from all the campaigns. There will be a pattern. Republican lawsuits will be designed to preserve the vote totals as they currently exist, the Democrat ones will be designed to expand the pool of available votes. That is not a good vs. evil comparison. It is a one side is winning vs. one side is losing comparison. Among the ones to expect: a lawsuit of some kind to allow Palm Beach County to extend their recount beyond the Thursday deadline (Read: CNN's Gregory Krieg's piece on the deadline here ). And could Gillum, who has yet to sue anyone, finally join the fray and either file a suit on his own, or join an existing legal battle?\n\nThe PR battle is almost as important as the legal battle\n\nThese lawsuits are expensive, important and do offer up the possibility of having a tangible impact on the vote count. That impact may not be nearly as important as what it does for the public relations battle both sides are playing. Case in point: Scott's two successful lawsuits against Palm Beach and Broward County. They had no real impact on the vote total, but it does allow the Scott team to respond that both County Elections Supervisors were found to be \"violating the Constitution\" whenever anyone asks them to point to real evidence of fraud. Those cases had nothing to do with fraud. It was about releasing records that were eventually going to be released, but just a bit early. However, it certainly makes for a powerful talking point.\n\nWhat will the candidates do?\n\nYou will continue to see Scott's team use strong language to describe Nelson's role in this. \"Fraud\" & \"Steal\" will be a constant refrain. The Nelson team will continue to paint Scott as someone willfully attempting to prevent valid votes from being cast -- and even using his powers as governor to do so. (Democrats compared him to a socialist dictator Sunday night).\n\nTo keep an eye on: Will Scott go to DC next week for a photo-op with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Photo Op? His team says it is still being \"considered.\"\n\nNelson should be back in DC as the Senate resumes session. He has not been seen in public at all since the closing days of the election.\n\nAs for the gubernatorial candidates, expect DeSantis to attempt to be as far above the fray as possible. If he does anything (and we don't think he will), it will all be in a role as governor-elect. He knows his chances of losing are slim, and he has the restraint to not get in the way of things. Gillum has already made two high-profile public appearances with another one scheduled for Monday night. He is expected to make several more in the coming days. He will give a speech in Boyton Beach Monday night. This is largely to capture the captive national audience. They remain realistic (or clear-eyed) about the eventual outcome. His is of course, in search of a new job.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nIt is NOT easy to recount 8.5 million votes in this short of a window. A lot could go wrong. Already we've seen longer than expected periods of time to sort ballots and calibrate machines. Some counties will have no issues, others will struggle. There is also the chance that bins of ballots could go missing or machines could fry. All of those issues are on the table. Remember, none of that matters in the eyes of Florida law. The recount must be done by Thursday at 8 p.m. ET or the Saturday count stands.\n\nThere are a lot more voters\n\nWhy is Florida so bad at this? Didn't they figure this out after what happened 18 years ago? Some context here. First, Florida did fix these problems since 2000. The state overhauled its ballot process and machines, it set finite timelines for the completion of these tasks and made the recount laws clear and specific. But these laws were written when the expected pool of voters in Florida was around the 5 million mark. This election was at 8.5 million. It is a lot quicker and easier to recount 5 million votes than it is 8.5 million. Second, this was an extraordinarily close election. And there were three of these extraordinarily close elections. This is a perfect storm of difficulty and one even the best-run election systems would have a hard time with. Honestly, so far, despite the hyperbole and a few minor hiccups, this one has not really been that bad.\n\nWhat is the next big moment on the timeline?", "(CNN) \u2014 Taking myself out to a local Japanese restaurant for dinner shouldn't have been a big deal, but it became one before I even picked up my chopsticks.\n\n\"Table for one,\" I said to the hostess, who didn't return my smile.\n\n\"Just one?\" she asked.\n\nIt wasn't the first time I'd heard that question which, five months into widowhood, was beginning to grate. I wondered what could be so challenging about such a simple request.\n\nAbout midway to my table, she stopped: \"Only yourself?\"\n\nAt that point, I lost it a little bit.\n\nI told her this was the third time I was stating the number of people at my table, which would have been two, had my husband been alive and with me.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be mean,\" she said. \"I just have to make sure.\"\n\nWhy some women won't eat out alone\n\nTo be sure of what? In that moment, I understood why so many women I know won't eat out alone. Nobody wants to be thrown back to being the shy kid in the school cafeteria who can't find a place to sit.\n\nIronically, I'm used to feeling right at home in restaurants.\n\nFor 25 years, I was a food critic for \"Newsday,\" a major suburban New York newspaper, and I dined out at least five times a week.\n\nWhile working on a story or review, it never bothered me to eat out by myself, but that was mainly at lunchtime. For evening visits to restaurants, I went out with my husband and, often, another couple. I couldn't order all the dishes I needed to try by myself. Our friends' presence made it easier to try everything and stay undercover.\n\nI can see now that I was living in a \"couple bubble.\"\n\nI still want to eat out\n\nNowadays, I work as an independent restaurant consultant. On and off the job, I usually dine out with friends, both couples and singles. Nevertheless, I still want to be able to treat myself to a nice dinner out in my own company.\n\nOther solo diners -- a sizable contingent of America's restaurant-going population -- seem to be avoiding the kind of situation I found myself in. Many prefer places where they can order at the counter and seat themselves.\n\nSolo dining occasions comprise 27 percent of the total at fast casual restaurants -- places like MacDonald's or Burger King, according to a 2016 study of restaurant visits by The Hartman Group, a Seattle based market research organization.\n\nAt coffee shops, solo occasions comprise about half the total, while at quick-service restaurants like Panera Bread, they make up about 38 percent of the total.\n\nBut full-service restaurants reported that the number of solo dining occasions was too insignificant to quantify.\n\nWhat does this say?\n\n\"Dinner occasions tend to be more social (with others) and more indulgent, so that's where full service-type restaurants fit in,\" said Hartman Group senior director of marketing Blaine Becker.\n\nMaybe that's not true for everyone. While they might make up a small minority, people who like to treat themselves to a fine dining experience solo do exist.\n\nWomen eat out alone, sometimes\n\nWendy Richman, a freelance violist and adjunct professor of music at New York University, feels just fine indulging alone at full service restaurants, such as Vietnaam on the Upper East Side and Sushi Yasaka on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nHer comfort level at fine dining establishments varies with geography.\n\n\"In a lot of big cities, people don't even look twice when you're eating by yourself,\" she said. \"I eat out alone the most in New York because it feels like the easiest culture. In the South, I do it less because I get looked at a little more.\"\n\nRichman, who prefers a proper table to a seat at the bar, has also run up against the \"just one\" question, which she calls a micro-aggression. \"I want to be defensive, but instead I stand up taller and say yes, just me.\"\n\nHow to treat solo diners\n\nNobody is questioning solo diners at Brooklyn's Krupa Grocery in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood, which was recently named one of the top eight restaurants in the borough for dining alone by Brooklyn Magazine. Co-owner/manager Thomas Sperduto said his restaurant doesn't treat singles differently than other diners.\n\n\"We just seat them,\" he said, noting that he asks where they'd prefer, at the bar or at a table. \"Then I always make sure we de-set the table. It's awkward to leave a place setting when there's not going to be another person.\"\n\nIn the Long Island suburbs, a relatively short distance from Brooklyn, another kind of dining scene is dominated by couples and families. Single diners are a minority.\n\nWomen can face hassles\n\nWhile chef-restaurateur Tom Schaudel has trained his staff to be sensitive to single diners, most eating solo at his restaurants (Jewel in Melville, aMano in Mattituck, A Lure in Southold and Kingfish in Westbury) opt to sit at the bar, he said.\n\nSchaudel estimates the ratio of men to women at about 65% to 35%. He observes, though, that it's not always easy for women. \"I've seen women eat at the bar and men making them feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nRelated content How single-parent families are changing the way we travel\n\nOverall, then, do men have fewer hassles eating out by themselves?\n\nJohn Martillo, an aerospace engineer in Los Angeles, believes so. Martillo, who often takes himself out to eat when away on business, doesn't recall ever having been questioned.\n\nRather than feeling uncomfortable alone, Martillo relishes the time, always opting for a table. \"I'll bring a book, sit down, enjoy a nice steak, read and people-watch. I enjoy the heck out of it.\"\n\nWe all want to be able to enjoy the heck out of eating alone -- to sit at a good table and scope out the scene, focus on what's on the plate and feel free to not converse with anyone.\n\nSo what's stopping us? Are restaurateurs afraid of giving up seating to someone whose check will, naturally, be smaller than the one at a table for two?\n\nRelated content Solo travelers to Maldives have plenty to see and do\n\nA satisfied solo diner may have friends\n\nThe truth is that most restaurant personnel aren't even aware the \"just one\" question might offend anyone. They should be told.\n\nAs a restaurant consultant, my professional advice to those who own eating establishments is to train your staff to treat solo diners with care and sensitivity. Anyone whose job it is to seat guests should show singles to the best tables available -- and do so cheerfully and unquestioningly.\n\nThis is not only the right way to behave; it also shows savvy business sense. After all, a satisfied solo diner may show up a week later with a friend or two. Or four. Or even six.", "\u0641\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0645\u0643\u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648, \u064a\u064f\u0648\u062c\u062f \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u062e\u064f\u0635\u0635\u062a \u062d\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0647\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646. \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629 \u060c \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0637\u0641\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0647\u0627 16 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u064b\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0639\u0649 \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0627\u0646. \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0646\u064a \u0647\u064a \u0637\u0641\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0635\u0628\u062d\u062a \u0623\u0635\u063a\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631\u0647\u0627, \u0648\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0639\u062f\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0633\u064a\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0647\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u060c 12 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) A British resident has died of rabies after getting bitten by a cat in Morocco, public health officials said on Monday.\n\nWhile there is \"no risk\" to the wider public, the victim's family, friends and involved medical staff are being monitored and provided with vaccinations if necessary, the health agency said.\n\nRabies, which is almost always fatal once symptoms appear, is an infectious viral disease which affects the brain and central nervous system. Initial symptoms include anxiety, headaches and fever, which can progress into hallucinations and respiratory failure, according to PHE.\n\nThe virus is transmitted to humans through animal bites or

Louvre Abu Dhabi museum has celebrated its first year of activity, during which it has attracted 1 million visitors. The museum opened on Nov. 11, 2017 as the result of a 30-year agreement between France and the United Arab Emirates, in a deal worth over of $1 billion\n\nInternational visitors accounted for 60% of the total, with India being the top nationality, followed by Emirati nationals, who are also the most frequent repeat visitors. France, Germany, China, the UK and the US are also among the most represented nationalities, along with countries from the Gulf Cooperational Council (GCC), which include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Comparatively, the Louvre in Paris, the largest art museum in the world, attracted 8.1 million visitors in 2017.\n\nCelebrations for the anniversary included a two-day symposium, \"Worlds in a Museum,\" in collaboration with \u00c9cole du Louvre, addressing the topic of museums in a globalized world. A planned concert by British pop artist Dua Lipa was canceled due to rainstorms.\n\nLouve Abu Dhabi's dome.

The latest one, \"Roads of Arabia: Archaeological Treasures of Saudi Arabia,\" opened last week and will continue through Feb. 16, 2019. Early next year, \"Rembrandt and the Dutch Golden Age\" will focus on Dutch masters with loans from one of the most important private collections in the field, New York's Leiden Collection.\n\nFour more international exhibitions have been announced for the museum's next season. \"School of Paris,\" (Sept. 12 to Dec. 7, 2019) depicts the dynamism of Paris in the first half of the 20th Century. \"The Thousand faces of Luxury\" (Oct. 31 to Feb. 15, 2019) will take visitors on a journey through luxury in the arts and society from Antiquity to the present days. \"Chivalry and Furusiyya\" (Feb. to May 2020) will immerse visitors in medieval chivalric culture, both in Islamic territories and the Occident, though literature, music and the arts. \"Charlie Chaplin. Cinema & Avant-garde\" (Apr. to July 2020) focuses on the work of Charlie Chaplin, not as a monograph but as a dialogue with the arts and concepts of that period.\n\nLouvre Abu Dhabi: The man behind the monument\n\nAmong the highlights in the museum's collection were masterpieces on loan from 13 French institutions, which include Leonardo da Vinci's \"La Belle Ferronniere,\" one of only 15 known paintings by the artist, a 1887 Van Gogh self-portrait and \"The Saint-Lazare Station\" by Claude Monet. Some of these loans have been returned at the end of the museum's first year of operation, but 40 more are coming in, including another Van Gogh, \"The Ballroom at Arles\" from 1888. The total number of loans currently on display is around 300.\n\nThe museum currently has some 300 pieces on loan.

The painting has been the subject of some discussion about its authenticity and reservations about the restoration work that's been done on it, and the museum has yet to display it after the Department of Culture and Tourism announced a delay earlier this year.\n\nThe Louve Abu Dhabi was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel. It sports a total of 7,850 aluminum stars on its signature dome, which is 180 meters (591 feet) in diameter and weighs over 7,700 tons. The building sits on a dry dock made from 503,000 cubic meters of sand and surrounded with pools. The complex includes a marina for private yachts to dock.\n\nWatch the video above to see Becky Anderson's interview with the museum's director Manuel Rabat\u00e9.", "Washington (CNN) Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith joked about going \"front row\" to a \"public hanging\" in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday morning, prompting her African-American opponent to call her comment \"reprehensible.\"\n\n\"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row,\" the senator is heard saying in the video.\n\nHyde-Smith faces former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in a runoff election on November 27 for the Mississippi Senate seat. The runoff election was triggered when neither she nor Espy received more than 50% of the vote total on November 6.\n\nHyde-Smith was appointed in April to fill the seat vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who stepped down due to health reasons. She became the first female senator to represent the state.\n\nEspy said on CNN's \"New Day\" Monday morning that the comments were \"disappointing\" and reflected poorly on the state.\n\nRead More", "London (CNN) It sold out in the US, and now the delayed launch of a \"bleeding\" vegan burger is causing huge excitement among UK vegetarians and vegans.\n\nOn November 12 the Beyond Burger, a soy-free, gluten-free vegan patty that \"changes color as you cook it,\" just like a traditional beef burger, hit the shelves at the UK's largest supermarket chain Tesco.\n\nThe burger is the brainchild of California-based vegan protein brand Beyond Meat, who say they added beet juice to the product to give it \"a red-meat appearance.\"\n\nIt is made completely from plants, unlike \" lab-grown\" meats in development elsewhere, and contains 20g of pea protein, potato starch and coconut oil.\n\nMassive demand saw the burgers sell out in stores following the US launch in May 2016, and UK consumers have been keen to try them.\n\n\"We see the growing global demand for delicious, plant-based proteins and are excited to serve that demand in the UK with the revolutionary Beyond Burger,\" said Seth Goldman, Beyond Meat's Executive Chair, in a statement.\n\n\"Bringing our innovative approach to merchandising to the UK, Tesco will sell The Beyond Burger in the chilled meat aisle alongside animal-based proteins.\"\n\nA pack of two patties will retail for \u00a35.50 ($7.07)\n\nBeyond Burger was originally scheduled to arrive in British stores in August, but that was delayed due to product shortages.\n\nNow vegans across the country can get their hands on two Beyond Burger patties for \u00a35.50 ($7.00) at 350 Tesco stores.\n\n\"FINALLY!! The wait is over and the Beyond Meat burger are now available in Tescos,\" wrote Instagram user vicsta_the_vegan.\n\n\"The Beyond Burger has been one of the most eagerly anticipated food launches of the year and we believe that this fantastic tasting patty will be a real game changer for anyone considering going vegan or trying a flexitarian diet,\" said Tesco Prepared Foods Selling Manager Martyn Doble in a statement.\n\nFlexitarians reduce their meat and fish consumption, predominantly eating plant-based foods. The diet is becoming more popular as people try to improve their health , but also as they become more environmentally conscious . Cutting down on animal protein has been shown to lower cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as risks of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.\n\n\"The most common reaction from those that have tried it is that they cannot believe it is made from plants,\" Doble added.\n\nAlongside the Tesco launch, the Beyond Burger is also starting to appear on restaurant menus around the UK.\n\nIn October, pub chain All Bar One and fast food outlet Honest Burger started to offer the patty at locations across the country.\n\nFrom December, vegans in London will also be able to get a Beyond Burger at specialist vegan fast-food restaurant Halo Burger.\n\nThe vegan patty has arrived in the UK at a time of growing interest in plant-based diets.\n\nIn November, research undertaken by UK supermarket chain Waitrose revealed that a third of British people now have meat-free or meat-reduced diets, with 13% identifying as vegetarian or vegan and another 21% identifying as flexitarian.\n\nExperts agree that if you are not ready to give up meat entirely, a flexitarian diet, which is predominantly plant-based, can help.", "New Delhi (CNN Business) The biggest seller of smartphones in India says it is having to hike prices because of the slump in the value of the country's currency.\n\nChinese electronics firm Xiaomi raised the prices of several of its new products on Sunday, citing the sharp fall in the Indian rupee this year as the main factor behind its decision.\n\n\"[The] rupee has depreciated against the dollar by nearly 15% since the beginning of the year, which has resulted in a significant rise in input cost for us,\" the company said on Twitter\n\nXiaomi added 500 rupees ($7) to the cost of its Redmi 6 smartphone and 600 rupees ($8) to one of its Redmi 6A variants \u2014 an increase of about 6% and 10% respectively.\n\nThose models now cost between 6,599 rupees ($91) and 8,499 rupees ($117).

California wildfires\n\nAt least 31 people have died so far in the wildfires ripping through California. Twenty-nine people died in Northern California's Camp Fire , now the most destructive fire in the state's history. It's burned 111,000 acres and pretty much wiped out the town of Paradise. It's 25% contained. There are still 228 people unaccounted for.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Southern California has killed at least two people. It's burned 85,500 acres and is about 15% contained. More than 300,000 people statewide have been driven from their homes because of the blazes. And conditions this week won't help firefighting efforts. Dry conditions feeding the flames are expected to continue into the week. Click here to find out how to help those affected.\n\n2. Midterm elections\n\nRecounting has begun down in Florida, sparked by narrowed enough margins in the races for governor, senator and agriculture commissioner. All this is supposed to be done by Thursday, but Palm Beach County's elections supervisor says it'll be \"impossible\" for her county to meet that deadline. If a county doesn't meet the deadline, the initial vote totals will stand as is. That's good news for the GOP -- their candidates are ahead -- but it would probably trigger lawsuits from the Democrats. (Gov. Rick Scott, the GOP Senate candidate, has already filed three election-related lawsuits.) Meanwhile:\n\nIn Georgia, the state Democratic Party and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' campaign filed a lawsuit asking for rejected absentee ballots and provisional ballots to be counted. They're still hoping to force a runoff in the governor's race.\n\nAnd in Arizona's Senate race, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema's lead over Republican Martha McSally continues to grow as the vote counting continues. Arizona's process of counting votes moves slowly because about 75% of the state's electorate votes by mail, and every ballot goes through a verification process.\n\nJUST WATCHED Florida county unable to meet recount deadline Replay More Videos ...

Armistice Day\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron slammed the concept of nationalism during his Armistice Day speech in Paris as the man who recently declared himself a nationalist -- President Trump -- looked on. Macron warned that the forces that led to the horrors of World War I were rising up again. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first ... we erase what a nation holds dearest,\" Macron said, not so subtly knocking Trump's \"America First\" doctrine. The President, speaking later at an American cemetery in Paris, didn't directly respond to Macron's remarks, instead sticking to a brief speech honoring the war dead. Trump and the first lady are back in Washington.\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron warns of the perils of nationalism Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron warns of the perils of nationalism 01:06\n\n4.

The country's long-term political instability is not helping matters. Violence against health officials and civilians by militant groups have hurt efforts to stop the outbreak, Congo's health minister said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Questions and answers about Ebola Replay More Videos ...

Australia strawberry needle scare\n\nThe woman accused of spiking supermarket strawberries with sewing needles did it for revenge, prosecutors in Australia said. My Ut Trinh was arrested Sunday. Police say she's the person responsible for some, but not all, of the at least 100 cases of needles or pins found in strawberries across the country earlier this year, causing a nationwide panic. Trinh, a former supervisor at a strawberry farm, felt she'd been mistreated by coworkers and had talked about getting revenge, police said. She's charged with seven counts of contamination of goods and faces up to a 10-year sentence if convicted. Australian authorities believe there were many copycat cases of tampering as well.\n\nMy Ut Trinh\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nPeople are talking about these. Read up.

and rhino products for \"medical\" purposes, a move wildlife activists said would be a setback to efforts to protect the increasingly endangered animals.\n\nIn an interview with state media published Monday, a senior official said \"three strict bans\" would temporarily remain in place on the import, export, and sale of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts.\n\n\"I would like to reiterate that the Chinese government has not changed its stance on wildlife protection and will not ease the crackdown on illegal trafficking and trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts and other criminal activities,\" State Council spokesman Ding Xuedong told the Xinhua news agency.\n\nHe said a previous circular issued by the State Council permitting the use of rhino and tiger parts by certified Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, \"has been postponed after study.\"\n\n\"Relevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts,\" Ding added. \"Illegal acts will be dealt with severely.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Following his furious physical altercation with Esteban Ocon in the aftermath of Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix, Max Verstappen has been ordered to complete two days of \"public service.\"\n\nThe Red Bull driver was incensed after a clash with Ocon, who was attempting to unlap himself, on lap 44 caused Verstappen to spin out and gifted the race lead back to Lewis Hamilton, who went on to win at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo.\n\n\"What a f*****g idiot\", Verstappen fumed over the team radio, before labeling Ocon an \"idiot\" again in his post-race interview.\n\nThe Dutchman confronted the Force India driver as they waited to be weighed, reportedly forcibly shoving him in the chest several times.\n\n\"The Stewards understood from Max Verstappen that he was extremely upset by the incident on track during the race and accepted his explanation that it was not his original intent to strike Ocon, but that he was 'triggered' and caused him to lose his temper,\" read the statement, detailing the F1 stewards' official verdict.\n\n\"While sympathetic to Verstappen's passion, the Stewards determined that it is the obligation of sportsmen at this level to act appropriately and as role models to other drivers at all levels and found that Verstappen failed in this respect.\"\n\nThere was a huge talking point involving Max Verstappen and Esteban Ocon at the #BrazilGP on Sunday \ud83d\ude2e\n\n\n\nBut this kind of thing has happened before in F1 - as the Verstappen family know only too well... pic.twitter.com/bmdHbDh5hV \u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) November 12, 2018\n\nThe 21-year-old will have to complete the two days of public service within the next six months at the direction of the FIA, motorsport's governing body.\n\nOcon was given a 10-second penalty for the incident, one of the harshest punishments available, eventually finishing in 14th place.\n\nThe Frenchman, for his part, was adamant he had done nothing wrong and insisted Verstappen should have left him space on the inside.\n\n\"I came out of the box, the first lap I stayed behind, the second lap the team said you can unlap yourself if you want,\" Ocon said.\n\n\"I was side by side and I couldn't disappear and then I saw he turned and we collided but what I am really surprised about is his behaviour after the race.\n\n\"We went on the scales he started to push me and wanted to punch me and stuff and this is not proper.\"\n\nBitter rivals\n\nThe pair's rivalry stretches all the way back to 2010 when they competed in karting and continued through to 2014 when Ocon won the European Formula 3 Championship.\n\n\"It goes back as long as 2010, 2011,\" Ocon told Autosport in March ahead of the 2018 season. \"[We were] not friends at all. It was a very intense fight. It came out a bit too much at some point.\n\n\"Now we have no problem at all, we speak well together and he is a cool guy. Back in the day it was very intense.\"\n\nVerstappen admitted that they \"didn't have that many positive moments with each other.\"\n\n\"At the time we didn't really like each other,\" he said. \"But that's part of the game. It's normal. I had the same thing with Charles Leclerc.\"\n\nHamilton's victory ensured that Mercedes won the constructors'-drivers' championship double for the fifth year in a row.", "(CNN) Faced with the new reality of a divided government in Washington, leaders of the influential conservative network founded by billionaire Charles Koch say they are launching a multimillion-dollar campaign this week to encourage Congress, business leaders and others to come together on issues such as trade, immigration and criminal justice reform.\n\nThe effort will include a renewed push to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants -- known as \"DREAMers\" -- from deportation, along with new lobbying to pass the First Step Act, which provides a path to faster release for inmates in the federal prison system.\n\nJames Davis, a network spokesman, cast the new campaign as a sweeping end-of-year effort that will deploy the network's influence and deep pockets to encourage lawmakers,

Monday called on both parties to turn down the temperature.\n\nThe Florida judge overseeing the lawsuit by Republican Senate candidate Gov. Rick Scott against South Florida elections officials warned lawyers on both sides of the fight to cut it out.\n\n\"I am urging, because of the highly public nature of this case, to ramp down the rhetoric. If someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities, they should report it to local law enforcement,\" said Broward County Chief Judge Jack Tuter. \"Everything lawyers are saying out there is being beamed out all over the country.\"\n\nNearly a week after Election Day, Florida politics has been consumed by the recount, with both parties dispatching high-priced lawyers and hordes of volunteers to monitor the laborious process. Much of the focus has been the state's US Senate race, where just over 12,000 votes separate Scott and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. But recounts have also been initiated in the races to be the state's next governor and agriculture commissioner. And the situation has escalated recently, with fiery rhetoric flying from state and national politicians looking to frame the debate as state and county election officials recount votes in offices and nondescript industrial buildings.\n\nRepublicans, including Scott and President Donald Trump, have in recent days alleged that there is \"fraud\" in the election process, despite repeated denials from the Florida Department of State. The Florida state Democratic Party, meanwhile, has compared Scott to a dictator.\n\nThe war of words between Scott's and Nelson's camps has escalated alongside increasingly testy exchanges between demonstrators, all while the clock is ticking toward a Thursday deadline. At the same time, Republicans and Democrats are mounting a furious legal and public relations battle through the media and judicial system.\n\nEven as his race is bogged down in Florida's recount, Scott is planning to travel to the nation's capital this week as part of his transition to the US Senate, according to a senior Scott campaign official.\n\n\"Senator-elect Scott will be traveling to DC this week to participate in some new-member orientation activities, including the photo, and will be voting in leadership elections,\" the official said.\n\nNelson on Monday called on Scott to recuse himself from the recount, saying in a video statement released by his campaign that the governor \"should remove himself from any role in the recount process so the people can have confidence in the integrity of the election.\"\n\nLater Monday, two voting rights groups and a Florida voter made a more official request, asking a federal judge to compel Scott to stand down.\n\nAlleging a \"substantial conflict of interest,\" the League of Women Voters, Common Cause Florida and voter Joanne Lynch Aye filed suit asking for a court to prevent Scott from \"engaging, in his capacity as Governor or using his authority as Governor, in any decisions, directives, control, or influence, either direct or indirect, over the processing and counting of ballots in the 2018 Florida election for U.S. Senate.\"\n\nScott's office did not immediately respond when called for comment.\n\nDeadline looming\n\nAfter election officials spent the weekend casting doubt over whether they would be able to finish the recount by Thursday, there was newfound confidence on Monday in Palm Beach and Broward.\n\nSusan Bucher, supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, told CNN on Sunday that finishing the recount by the Thursday deadline was \"impossible.\" But on Monday, she said she was \"fairly confident\" that the county would be able to meet the deadline for at least the US Senate race. The reason: The older ballot-counting machines in Palm Beach County are able to count only one race at a time, meaning that to do a full recount for the governor's race, election officials will have to redo the process.\n\n\"Right now,\" Bucher said, \"we are just working on the US Senate race.\"\n\nIn Broward, Brenda Snipes, the supervisor of elections, told reporters that the county intends to meet the Thursday deadline.\n\nThe legal fight\n\nAs volunteers rushed to complete the legally mandated review, Scott again upped the stakes by suing to require law enforcement officials to seize ballots and tallying machines in Broward and Palm Beach counties during any break in the action.\n\nJudge Tuter denied the initial motion in the Broward suit from Scott for an injunction seeking to impound machines and ballots. Instead, under the judge's supervision, the two sides agreed on three additional county deputies to assist the Broward division of elections on its recount. One officer will monitor onsite cameras, a second will monitor storage of USB drives and ballot boxes, and a third will manage the other two officers.\n\nThe suit was part of a larger developing Republican strategy to cast the recount as an opportunity for fraudsters to hijack the election. On Friday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it was not investigating anything related to the election after the Florida Department of State said there had been no allegations of criminal activity.\n\nScott and Trump have alleged, without evidence, that Democrats were conspiring to overturn the initial results. The President, alleging that \"many ballots are missing or forged,\" tweeted Monday morning that \"an honest vote count is no longer possible,\" and Scott accused Nelson of trying to \"commit fraud to try to win this election.\"\n\n\"No ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from DC will be allowed to steal this election,\" Scott told Fox News on Sunday morning, shortly before he launched a trio of new lawsuits.\n\nFlorida Democrats reacted to Republican legal maneuvering by comparing Scott to a strongman striking out at the infrastructure of the vote.\n\n\"Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\" the state party said in a statement. \"The Governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our Democracy.\"\n\nEugene Pettis, an attorney for controversial Broward elections chief Snipes, responded to the lawsuit by saying she had already secured the facilities.\n\n\"Dr. Snipes has taken multiple measures to make sure that the election machines and ballots are in safekeeping,\" Pettis said.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Pam Bondi is also pushing for increased law enforcement involvement.\n\n\"I fail to see how the Florida Department of Law Enforcement can legitimately refuse to investigate where there is reasonable suspicion that may lead to the discovery of criminal actions in the conduct of the 2018 election,\" she wrote in a Sunday letter to the department, which has pointed to the Department of State's declaration that there is nothing to investigate.\n\nBondi also addressed the Department of State, asking the Republican-appointed secretary to dig deeper and, \"when you find any indication creating a reasonable suspicion of potential criminal activity,\" report it to the law enforcement agency.\n\nSarah Revell, the communications director for the Department of State, replied to Bondi's letter by effectively repeating what the agency has been saying for days.\n\n\"Department staff continues to observe the administration of the election in Broward County,\" Revell said. \"Our staff has not seen any evidence of criminal activity in Broward County at this time.\"\n\nNelson lawsuit\n\nNelson's campaign is also gearing up for a legal challenge that could, perhaps more than any recount, lead to a fundamental shake-up of the race. Its lawsuit, which alleges that the state law requiring that signatures on mail-in ballots match those on record is unconstitutional, will have a hearing in federal court on Wednesday.\n\n\"If we are successful, that will add thousands of additional ballots that have so far gone uncounted and we believe have gone uncounted in violation of the US Constitution's guarantee of the right to vote and should be counted,\" Marc Elias, Nelson's top recount lawyer, told reporters on Saturday night, adding: \"We have sought a statewide remedy because we believe that all voters -- whether they voted for Sen. Nelson or for Gov. Scott -- should not be disenfranchised because an election worker doesn't believe that their signature in two different places are closely resembling.\"\n\nMore suits are likely as the week ramps up ahead of the 3 p.m. ET Thursday recount deadline. More would likely follow if a county fails to complete its review.\n\nPalm Beach County GOP Chairman Michael Barnett told CNN on Sunday that the county's potential failure to meet the deadline would be \"good news for Republicans because our candidates are ahead.\"\n\n\"If they're not able to meet the deadline, the secretary of state of Florida may go ahead and certify the elections for our candidates,\" Barnett said. \"In that case, you can bet your butt there will be lawsuits filed everywhere.\"\n\nRevell confirmed Barnett's prediction later Sunday, telling CNN that if a county does not submit new figures by Thursday afternoon, \"then the results on file at that time take their place.\"\n\nFlorida governor's race\n\nSunday also marked a return to the spotlight for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, who is trailing DeSantis as the recount kicks into gear but revoked his concession a day earlier and plans to aggressively pursue any possible avenue -- including new legal action -- if rumors of unduly uncounted ballots persist.\n\n\"I'm not here to ask for votes. I'm not here to campaign for votes. I'm not here to make a closing argument for what it means to become the next governor of the great state of Florida,\" Gillum, who is the mayor of Tallahassee, told supporters in Fort Lauderdale late Sunday. \"I'm simply here to say for the votes that have been cast, they ought to be counted. Every last single one of them.\"\n\nGillum then addressed supporters Monday at St. John Missionary Baptist Church in Boynton Beach, saying of Tuter, \"This is a judge that has said that this is getting out of hand.\"\n\n\"Why is it the case that we've got all this drama, all of these shenanigans, all of these allegations, where in court today the judge said to the governor, and to their attorneys, that they have to ratchet down their rhetoric?\" he said. \"This is a judge. This is a judge that has said that this is getting out of hand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, DeSantis has been very careful with his public posture in the wake of the recount. He has given only one statement, a taped video announcement directed to supporters, and has not held any events or press availabilities. Late Sunday, Scott's official schedule as governor was revised to include a note that he and DeSantis had met. Described officially as a \"meeting with Gov-Elect DeSantis,\" it took place in Naples, where the two discussed the upcoming transition.", "(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - \u201cAgrupar\u201d es un proyecto de agricultura urbana en Ecuador que promueve el cuidado del medio ambiente y una producci\u00f3n alimenticia saludable y ancestral.

Rosa Ram\u00edrez dijo a CNN que el huerto ha ayudado a los vecinos a cuidar su salud y explica: \u201cNo usamos ning\u00fan qu\u00edmico, solo utilizamos, por ejemplo, hierbas que salen de ramos porque ya hemos ido aprendiendo m\u00e1s\u201d.\n\nLa responsable de este proyecto, Alexandra Rodr\u00edguez, cont\u00f3 a CNN que la agricultura urbana es multifuncional y transformadora porque incluye a mujeres, adultos mayores, personas con discapacidad, estudiantes de escuelas y colegios, centros de atenci\u00f3n a menores y de rehabilitaci\u00f3n social. Seg\u00fan Rodr\u00edguez, la agricultura urbana tiene el objetivo de que \u201cseamos lo menos dependientes posibles de insumos externos, lo cual de por s\u00ed ya reduce costos y la mano de obra pr\u00e1cticamente es de la familia, la comunidad y los amigos. Desde ese punto de vista no tiene por qu\u00e9 ser una actividad imposible de practicarla, inaccesible, costosa\u201d.\n\nSeg\u00fan informe el m\u00e1s reciente del INCAE Business School sobre la agricultura como motor de desarrollo, exclusivo para CNN, la regi\u00f3n donde m\u00e1s creci\u00f3 esta actividad entre 2000 y 2016 fue Am\u00e9rica del Sur, superando a \u00c1frica, Asia y Am\u00e9rica Central. Este informe recomienda a los peque\u00f1os productores que se organicen en asociaciones o empresas para buscar una mejor rentabilidad y que puedan adaptarse a las nuevas tendencias, como la mayor participaci\u00f3n de la mujer en la fuerza laboral. Es algo que \u201cAgrupar\u201d ha incorporado abiertamente. Seg\u00fan Conquito, el 84% de la participaci\u00f3n en el proyecto es de mujeres y se han generado m\u00e1s de 100 emprendimientos asociativos.\n\nUno de los principales logros de \u201cAgrupar\u201d, seg\u00fan datos de Conquito, es el establecimiento de 17 bioferias abiertas de comercializaci\u00f3n de los alimentos 100% org\u00e1nicos donde se registra la venta directa entre productor y consumidor. CNN acudi\u00f3 a una de estas bioferias. Lourdes Maisincho y otras madres llevaron sus productos que trabajan junto a otros miembros de su familia. Maisincho cont\u00f3 que en su huerto trabaja con otros hermanos: \u201ccada uno nos dedicamos y tenemos nuestro pedazo de terreno y trabajamos para vender. Todos nos juntamos aqu\u00ed en el mercado\u201d.\n\nConquito agrega que estas bioferias han demostrado que en la ciudad hay m\u00e1s conciencia sobre el consumo de productos libres de agrot\u00f3xicos, por lo que es indispensable la capacitaci\u00f3n a los agricultores para que se certifiquen y mejoren sus pr\u00e1cticas agr\u00edcolas en un mundo que demanda mayor conciencia medioambiental y nuevas formas de hacer las cosas.", "(CNN)-- \u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645\u062a \u062d\u0631\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0648\u0645\u0629

incendios: 29 en el incendio Camp, en el norte, y 2 en el incendio Woolsey, en el sur\n\n(CNN) - Mientras el domingo aumentaba la cifra de v\u00edctimas mortales por los incendios forestales que arrasan los dos extremos de California, fuertes vientos cruzaban la entidad, llevando al l\u00edmite los recursos para el combate contra el fuego.\n\nAl menos 31 personas han muerto en los incendios: 29 en el incendio Camp, en el norte de California, y 2 en el incendio Woolsey, en el sur.\n\nEl incendio Camp - el m\u00e1s destructivo en la historia de la entidad y uno de los m\u00e1s mortales - pr\u00e1cticamente redujo a cenizas la localidad de Paradise, destruyendo miles de casas y estructuras.\n\nHay 228 personas desaparecidas como resultado del incendio, dijo Kory Honea, sheriff y juez de instrucci\u00f3n del condado de Butte, el domingo reunido con reporteros.\n\nEl incendio Woolsey sigue siendo un incendio de mayor intensidad y ha desplazado a cientos de miles de residentes a medida que avanza hacia el este. Entre los afectados hay varias celebridades.\n\n\"Esta no es la nueva normalidad, es la nueva anormalidad\", dijo el gobernador Jerry Brown sobre el papel del cambio clim\u00e1tico en los incendios.\n\nLos bomberos lograron avances para contener los incendios el s\u00e1bado, pero el regreso de los fuertes vientos un d\u00eda despu\u00e9s amenazaba ese progreso, especialmente en el incendio Woolsey.\n\n\"Tristemente, con estos vientos, esto a\u00fan no ha terminado\", dijo el domingo por la ma\u00f1ana Scott Jalbert, jefe de la unidad San Luis Obispo de Cal Fire.\n\nEl domingo, los bomberos consiguieron controlar llamaradas generadas por los vientos en el condado de Los \u00c1ngeles. Pero funcionarios advirtieron que las condiciones secas que alimentan el fuego continuar\u00e1n durante la semana.\n\nRecuento de da\u00f1os\n\nEstos son los datos m\u00e1s recientes sobre los incendios en California:\n\n\u2013 Incendio Camp: el mayor de los tres incendios, el Camp, ha quemado casi 45.000 hect\u00e1reas en el norte de California y hasta el domingo por la ma\u00f1ana hab\u00eda sido contenido en un 25%, de acuerdo con Cal Fire. Ha destruido aproximadamente 6.700 edificios, la mayor\u00eda casas.\n\n\u2013 Incendios Woolsey y Hill: en el sur de California, el incendio Woolsey se ha extendido a 34.600 hect\u00e1reas y hasta el domingo por la noche hab\u00eda sido contenido en un 15%, un 5% m\u00e1s respecto a la noche anterior. El incendio Hill, m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o, cubr\u00eda 1.800 hect\u00e1reas y hab\u00eda sido contenido en un 75%. Juntos hab\u00edan destruido unas 179 estructuras, pero otras 57.000 est\u00e1n en peligro, dijeron autoridades.\n\n\u2013 Evacuaciones masivas: m\u00e1s de 300.000 personas han sido obligadas a dejar sus casas en todo el estado. La mayor\u00eda son residentes del condado de Los \u00c1ngeles, donde 170.000 han sido evacuados.\n\nEn busca de m\u00e1s v\u00edctimas\n\nEl doloroso proceso de hallar a los desaparecidos e identificar a los muertos es un desaf\u00edo, dado que algunos de los cuerpos recuperados est\u00e1n tan quemados que es imposible reconocerlos.\n\n\"En algunos casos, los \u00fanicos restos que hemos podido recuperar son huesos y fragmentos de hueso\", dijo el sheriff Honea. \"S\u00e9 que miembros de la comunidad que han perdido a seres queridos est\u00e1n ansiosos, y s\u00e9 que las noticias de que hemos recuperado cuerpos puede ser desconcertante\".\n\nMuchos de los cuerpos recuperados en el incendio Camp fueron hallados dentro o cerca de casas o en veh\u00edculos, dijeron funcionarios.\n\nHoras despu\u00e9s de que comenzara el incendio, residentes que hu\u00edan de Paradise quedaron atrapados en el tr\u00e1fico mientras el fuego se acercaba. Algunos conductores abandonaron sus veh\u00edculos en medio del caos e intentaron escapar a pie.\n\nDeanna Hackney, Sara Weisfeldt, Ralph Ellis y Steve Almasy contribuyeron con este reporte.", "Allyssia Alleyne , CNN Written by\n\nOn Thursday, a well-known painting by British artist David Hockney is poised to smash the record for a work by a living artist sold at auction.\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" is set to be sold at the Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale in New York on for an estimated price of $80 million. The current record was set by Jeff Koons in 2013, when his \"Balloon Dog\" sold for $58.4 million.\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Courtesy Christie's\n\nAlex Rotter, co-chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie's, called the 1972 painting \"one of the great masterpieces of the modern era.\"\n\n\"David Hockney's brilliance as an artist is on full display with this monumental canvas, which encapsulates the essence of the idealized poolside landscape, and the tremendous complexity that exists within human relationships,\" Rotter said in a statement. \"With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history's most venerated artists.\"\n\nWorld's most popular artist\n\nHockney at 80: An encounter with the artist\n\nNow 81, David Hockney is regarded as one of the world's most popular artists . Well over a million visitors to his attended his last retrospective, hosted by Tate Modern, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Pompidou Center in 2017 and 2018, and his current auction record stands at $28.5 million.\n\nSwimming pools have been one of the artist's muses since he first moved to California from England in 1964.\n\n\"I always loved swimming pools, all the wiggly lines they make,\" he told CNN in 2017. \"If you photograph them, it freezes them whereas if you use paint, you can have wiggly lines that wiggle.\"\n\nWhy is art so expensive?\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" has long been in private hands (Christie's has not revealed the identity of the seller) but is still one of Hockney's most recognizable works.\n\nThe double portrait shows a young man standing on the pool's edge, looking down at submerged swimmer. The swimmer is based on Hockney's former lover, Californian artist Peter Schlesinger, with whom he had broken up a year prior. (A study for the painting sold for $2.1 million at a 2016 Sotheby's auction.)\n\nAhead of its sale in New York on Nov. 15, the painting was exhibited in Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles.", "(CNN) An additional 13 sets of human remains were discovered Monday in Northern California, bringing the death toll from the Camp Fire to 42, making it the deadliest wildfire in the state's history, the sheriff of Butte County said.\n\nThe increased death toll comes as first responders battle blazes on both ends of the state, and brings the statewide death toll to 44.\n\nFierce winds continue to threaten lives and homes in Southern California's Woolsey Fire, which has killed two people so far. The strongest Santa Ana winds in the south may bring gusts near hurricane force on Tuesday, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said.\n\nMeanwhile, firefighters made progress Monday in containing the Camp Fire, which razed the town of Paradise, where most of the dead have been found. Harrowing stories of escapes and close calls are trickling out of the region.\n\nResident Nichole Jolly said she thought her life was over as flames surrounded her car, filling it with smoke. Then, she called her husband, who urged her to run, she said.\n\n\"If you're going to die, die fighting,\" she said, tearfully recalling his words.\n\nOutside the vehicle, ash and hot embers stung her eyes and obscured her vision, she said. She felt around until she reached a fire engine that was hot to the touch. Firefighters pulled her inside, but they, too, were trapped, she said -- until a bulldozer came through and cleared a path to safety.\n\nJUST WATCHED Cell phone videos show drivers fleeing fire Replay More Videos ...

President Trump on Monday approved a request for a Major Disaster Declaration that will provide the state with federal resources.\n\nA Malibu resident who has lived through many wildfires said she has never seen one touch so many parts of the city at once.\n\n\"Every community neighborhood has been devastated,\" the woman told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS\n\nLatest developments by the numbers\n\n\u2022 Camp Fire: More than 52,000 have been evacuated and 1,385 are in shelters due to the Camp Fire. It has scorched more than 117,000 acres of Northern California, and destroyed more than 7,000 structures, including 6,453 single-family residences.\n\nAs of Monday night, it was about 30% contained.\n\n\u2022 Woolsey Fire: In Southern California, 57,000 structures are threatened by the Woolsey Fire. It has burned more than 93,000 acres, killed two people and destroyed at least 435 structures. As of Monday, it was about 30% contained.\n\n\u2022 The Hill Fire covered 4,531 acres and was 85% contained by Monday night.\n\nCauses of fires still being investigated\n\nThe death toll is rising as California state regulators investigate two utility companies that reported incidents close in time and location to the start of the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\nPreliminary incident reports submitted last week to the Safety and Enforcement Division of the California Public Utilities Commission provide a glimpse of conditions near the origins of the deadly blazes. Both utilities say they are cooperating with state investigators.\n\nAlmost 15 minutes before the Camp Fire began near Pulga, PG&E's said it experienced a transmission line outage about 1 mile northeast of the town.\n\nIn Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire began Thursday afternoon in unincorporated Ventura County, SoCal Edison reported that a circuit relayed out of the Chatsworth Substation about two minutes before the blaze broke out. The incident location in the report appears to be the same as CalFire's location for the fire's origin. But it's not clear how close they actually are to each other.\n\nSoCal Edison's report says, \"at this point we have no indication from fire agency personnel that SCE utility facilities may have been involved in the start of the fire.\"\n\nA CPUC spokesperson said the agency will incorporate the incident reports into its staff investigations to assess the compliance of electric facilities with applicable rules and regulations in areas affected by the fires.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nThe evacuees included celebrities who lost their homes in Malibu as well as first responders who are setting aside their grief to save others. While much of Malibu lies in ruins, the city's mayor pro tem, Jefferson 'Zuma Jay' Wagner, is recovering in a hospital after trying to save his home.\n\nAdding to the chaos, two wildfires started Monday in Southern California's Ventura County area. The Rocky Peak Fire has burned about 20 acres, officials said. The nearby Lynn Fire has scorched about 15 acres. While structures are threatened, firefighters expect to contain that blaze soon, Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said.\n\nSearch for missing people continues\n\nAbout 100 people are still unaccounted for statewide, authorities said Monday. Officials are hoping those people are safe elsewhere, but with wildfires still burning, the death toll is expected to rise.\n\nSo far, 42 bodies have been recovered from homes and vehicles in or near Paradise. The Butte County Sheriff's Office identified three of the victims as Ernest Foss, 65, from Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, from Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, from Magalia.\n\nIn Southern California, officials said two deaths in Malibu were related to the Woolsey Fire, bringing the statewide death toll to 44.\n\nButte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory L. Honea said his office is bringing in additional resources to expedite the identification and processing of human remains, including 13 coroner search recovery teams, 150 search and rescue personnel, cadaver dogs, two portable temporary morgue units, and a rapid DNA system.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol Chief Brent Newman asked for the public's patience as teams clear affected areas. As part of those efforts, CHP teams removed 60 abandoned cars and set up barriers around dangerous areas. He urged people trying to cross them so they can reach their homes to be patient.\n\n\"It is not a safe environment whatsoever,\" he said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said many residents are anxious to return to their homes or property to take stock of what's left -- herself included.\n\nShe is living in a motor home after losing her house to the Camp Fire. She has a roof and a bed but it won't work for much longer, she said. \"We're thinking about where to go next.\"\n\nShe, too, recalled fleeing her home in her car surrounded by flames so intense that at times she could feel the heat in her car. Trees and telephone poles were up in flames.\n\nWhile the blaze no longer appears to pose a direct threat to Paradise, Jones is concerned about marshaling resources for cleanup and recovery so people can return to what's left of their homes.\n\n\"My biggest concern is do we have the resources to clean up debris and get safety hazards out of the way so people can get to their property ASAP.\"", "London (CNN Business) 1. SoftBank's IPO plans: SoftBank is gearing up for one of the world's biggest IPOs ever. The Japanese company said Monday it plans to sell 2.4 trillion yen ($21 billion) worth of stock in its mobile telecoms unit.\n\nSoftBank ( SFTBY ) will also have the option of selling another 240 billion yen ($2.1 billion) of shares if investor demand is strong. That would make the IPO bigger than $23 billion.\n\nIt would be the world's biggest listing since Alibaba ( BABA ) went public in New York in 2014. The listing is set to take place on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 19.\n\nThe IPO is a key part of CEO Masa Son's efforts to reposition SoftBank as a global tech investor.\n\n2. Oil surges: Oil prices jumped early on Monday after Saudi Arabia said it would cut production next month.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in Abu Dhabi, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al Falih said the kingdom's oil output would fall by 500,000 barrels per day in December.\n\nMembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could reduce supply further next year.\n\n\"The consensus among all members is that we need to do whatever it takes to balance the market,\" Al Falih said. \"If that means trimming supply by a million [barrels per day], we will do it.\"\n\nBrent crude, the international benchmark, jumped as much as 2.4% to $71.80 per barrel. US crude futures were 1.6% higher, trading just above $61 per barrel.\n\nGlobal oil prices tumbled into a bear market last week, down more than 20% from their peak. Fears of a global economic slowdown and a decision by the United States to allow some countries to keep buying Iranian crude oil following the reintroduction of sanctions have hit market sentiment.\n\n3. Brexit troubles: The pound dropped as much as 1.2% against the dollar on Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May found herself under growing pressure over her plan for Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson, the former UK Foreign Secretary, said cabinet members ought to mutiny over the plan. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said May's plan would turn the United Kingdom into \"a vassal state.\"\n\nThe warning came just two days after Boris' brother Jo Johnson, an opponent of Brexit, resigned from the UK government over Brexit. He said the 2016 referendum campaign was based on a \"fantasy set of promises\" that could not be delivered.\n\nBritain is set to leave the European Union in March next year. A divorce agreement between the two sides has not yet been finalized, stoking fear among investors and businesses of a chaotic no-deal Brexit.\n\nEuropean markets opened mostly lower, except for London's FTSE 100, which got a boost from the weaker pound. The index contains many international conglomerates that benefit when the pound drops.\n\nStocks in Asia were mixed. Equities in China and Hong Kong were higher, while Korea and India recorded losses.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed 0.8% lower on Friday, but still ended the week 2.8% higher, its best week since March.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1% lower on Friday, while the Nasdaq dropped 1.7%.\n\nBefore the Bell newsletter: Key market news.

John Isner at Wimbledon this year created a bond between the pair, you would be wrong.\n\nIt was already there.\n\nFar from Isner hoping for revenge against the South African at this week's ATP World Tour Finals or Anderson keen on pulling another one over the American, they're chuffed to be making history together in London 11 years after facing off in college.\n\nNot since 1989 through John McEnroe and Brad Gilbert have two former university players lined up at the men's year-end championships.\n\nAnd besides playing college tennis, countless other similarities between the pair exist.\n\nTwo of the tallest players at 6-foot-10 and 6-foot-8 -- Isner holds the slender height advantage -- the South African and American are still two of the top servers in tennis.\n\nIsner and Anderson both won two titles this campaign and for each it marks their debut at the elite eight-player World Tour Finals.\n\nThree days following their titanic semifinal at Wimbledon in July -- the second longest grand slam match ever behind Isner's 11-hour win over Nicolas Mahut at the same venue in 2010 -- they achieved career-high rankings inside the top 10.\n\nJUST WATCHED The Late Rise of Kevin Anderson Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The Late Rise of Kevin Anderson 03:40\n\nAnd both are longstanding members of the ATP's Player Council.\n\n\"It is really great that John and I, two former NCAA tennis players, are both in this year's finals,\" Anderson, who beat Dominic Thiem 6-3 7-6 (10) Sunday to begin the Lleyton Hewitt group at the indoor O2 Arena, told CNN Sport.\n\n\"I think that is a testament to how much your game can develop by playing college tennis. Qualifying for this tournament has been one of my biggest goals for a few years now, so obviously I'm very proud to achieve that for myself and I'm very happy for John to achieve that milestone as well.\n\n\"John is a really great guy who I've gotten to know over the years,\" added Anderson, who recollected that he once shared a hotel room with Isner during a tournament in tennis' minor leagues.\n\n\"So my respect for him grew very naturally. We both love dogs and sports, our wives are friends, we know each others' coaches well, we've met each others' families.\"\n\nPhotos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance The marathon men: An unlikely bromance \u2013 American John Isner and Nicolas Mahut will forever be bonded together by their singles clash at Wimbledon in 2010 which became the longest match in tennis history. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance An emotional journey \u2013 Their \"marathon match\" lasted 11 hours and five minutes and stretched over three days.

Isner finally won 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance An unlikely bromance \u2013 Isner and Mahut embraced at the end of the game and nearly three years on from the match the pair are still close friends. Isner says of Mahut: \"He's one of the nicest, classiest guys on the tour.\" Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance Scores on the doors \u2013 The final set went on so long that it broke the scoreboard. Twice. It first became locked at its maximum 47-47, before it locked again at 50-50 and was reset. Spectators were asked to add 50 games onto the score. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance 'An absolute warrior' \u2013 Mahut was heartbroken in defeat and suffered another defeat when the pair were drawn to face each other the following year. The 2011 clash ended 7-6 6-2 7-6, took a full nine hours less and featured 149 fewer games.

To date he has won five singles titles on the ATP Tour but he's hoping success in some of the major tournaments will eclipse the \"marathon match\" that he's best known for. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance Team America \u2013 Isner is now the top ranked American player in the world and has become an important part of the country's David Cup team. He recently recorded victory over 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer when the USA took on Switzerland. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: The marathon men: An unlikely bromance Serb and volley \u2013 Isner made his first grand slam quarterfinal at the U.S. Open in 2011 and relishes the big stage: \"I think that's one of the main reasons why I beat Federer, I beat Djokovic and I almost beat Rafa at the French Open of all places. That's why you play this game -- to get a crack at those guys. Try to take it to them.\" Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nMemorable college match\n\nIsner won their two singles matches in the NCAA ranks, including 6-1 7-6 (1) during the national championships in 2007 when he helped his University of Georgia claim the team title over Anderson's University of Illinois at home.\n\n\"Our Wimbledon match I'm never going to forget,\" Isner told CNN Sport. \"But I'm never going to forget that one, either. We had 6,000 fans. It was a huge match. At that time it was the most pressure filled match I'd ever played.\"\n\nAnderson called it a \"really difficult\" loss but fondly remembers his college days as a whole.\n\n\"To this day we still give each other banter about our university rivalries,\" said Anderson.\n\nThe University of Illinois was where he met his wife Kelsey, who was part of the golf team and describes herself as the \"support team chairperson\" for her husband. They live in Florida.\n\nIn the pro ranks, Isner became the first of the duo to win an ATP title and crack the top 50, 20 and 10 in the rankings, which served as motivation for Anderson. Overall Isner owns 14 titles to Anderson's five, the biggest of which coming at the Miami Masters in March after a dismal 1-6 tournament start to his season.\n\nKevin Anderson (right) and John Isner hug at the net after their six-and-a-half hour Wimbledon semifinal in July.\n\nBut Anderson, 32, has also motivated Isner, 33.\n\n\"To see him continue to do so well in his 30s gives me a lot of energy to keep working hard and to try to match him and how hard he works and what he does on and off the court,\" Isner said.\n\n\"I actually saw how hard he worked when we were at college tournaments. You could tell his focus was to be a professional and a very good professional, and he's certainly accomplished that.\"\n\nPhotos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner Five years ago at Wimbledon, Nicolas Mahut (center) lost the longest match in tennis history to John Isner (left).

Isner says Mahut is \"a class act.\" Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner The loss extended a run of painful defeats for the Frenchman. In 2007, he lost to another American, Andy Roddick, in the final of the Aegon Championships at London's Queen's Club after squandering a match point. Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner There was more heartache for Mahut in the 2013 French Open doubles final. He and partner Michael Llodra lost to Americans Bob and Mike Bryan in a third-set tiebreak. Mahut wept afterward. Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner But Mahut said he built on the loss. And two weeks later, he won his first title on grass in the Netherlands. A month later, he made it two titles, triumphing on grass again in the U.S. Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner Fulfilling a lifelong ambition, Mahut made his Davis Cup debut for France at the not so tender age of 33 in March 2015 against Germany. He and Julien Benneteau clinched the first-round tie. Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: From 'unlucky loser' to winner It didn't stop there for Mahut. He collected his third title earlier this month, again on the Dutch grass at Den Bosch. That came after he reached the third round at the French Open.

I appreciate all the encouraging messages from everyone. Congrats to @KAndersonATP on the win and best of luck in the final. More importantly, thank you for your class and humility in victory. @Wimbledon see you next year.

It was really memorable,\" said Anderson.\n\nHis success hasn't come as a surprise to one of his former coaches at Illinois, Craig Tiley, now the longtime tournament director of the Australian Open.\n\nIt means so much for me to have played in the @Wimbledon final. There are so many positives and great memories I will be taking with me. Thanks to everyone from South Africa and around the world for your support and messages. It has been an incredibly special fortnight. pic.twitter.com/WxKGvl6bho \u2014 Kevin Anderson (@KAndersonATP) July 15, 2018\n\nTiley mirrored Isner when discussing Anderson's work ethic.\n\n\"Kevin has always been one of the hardest working players I've had the pleasure to work with, and I'd say he's well and truly among the hardest workers on the tour,\" Tiley told CNN Sport.\n\n\"It's tough to dedicate yourself to tennis week in and week out, and the pathway is rarely quick and straightforward.\n\n\"Kevin has never shied away from his goals and has also managed to overcome injuries and other setbacks. He has always surrounded himself with great people. Kelsey has a great understanding of the commitment needed to be a champion.\"\n\nWhether more university players emulate Isner and Anderson's achievements in the upper echelon of tennis remains to be seen. Of the seven former university tennis players in the men's top 100, Anderson and Isner are the lone two in the top 30.\n\nJUST WATCHED Isner eyes future grand slam Replay More Videos ...

But according to the World Bank, half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population do not use official financial services.\n\nProviding financial services for people without a bank account is Paystack's next aim.\n\n\"We're investing heavily in making available all types of local and regional payment channels beyond card payments to ensure that customers can pay however they feel most comfortable,\" Akinlade says.\n\nSome of its biggest investors are certain that by exploring offline payment systems like QR codes, Paystack can bring the rest of Africa into global online trade.\n\n\"Our investment in Paystack aligns with the kind of investments we look for -- those that will help extend our reach into the global commerce ecosystem as it changes and grows, and that will provide mutually beneficial business opportunities,\" said Otto Williams, head for strategic partnerships, fintechs and ventures for Visa in Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA), in a statement.\n\nPaystack says it's looking forward to launching in numerous African countries soon.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

"(CNN) Tiger Woods may have to battle a bit harder for his next major victory but a 15th title is \"not out of the realms of possibility,\" according to one of his best friends Notah Begay.\n\nThe former world No. 1 ended the 2018 season on a high with victory in the Tour Championship at East Lake for his first win in five years after overcoming four back surgeries.\n\nWoods, who will turn 43 on December 26, took his tally of PGA Tour wins to 80, two behind the all-time record of Sam Snead, but it is Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles that he has long coveted.\n\nMany thought his multiple back injuries had put paid to that, but Begay, Woods' college roommate at Stanford, says the pursuit of Nicklaus is back on the agenda.\n\n\"I think now the first win is out of the way he is focused on getting off 14 [major wins] and on to 15,\" four-time PGA Tour winner Begay told CNN Sport.\n\n\"I do not think that's out of the realm of possibility.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Tiger on track for

MUST WATCH Tiger on track for 15th major - Notah Begay 04:30\n\nWoods underwent spine fusion surgery in April 2017, paving the way for a remarkable comeback this season in which he briefly led the Open with nine holes to play before finishing sixth and came second at August's US PGA.\n\nHe scored three other top-five finishes, and led September's season-ending Tour Championship from start to finish..\n\nWoods famously won all 14 of his major titles when leading after 54 holes but Begay says he will have to get better at coming out of the pack on the final day if he wants to add to his total.\n\n\"I don't think he has as much firepower as he used to have and can go out there and dominate like we saw him in so many of his other major championships,\" said Begay, the only full-blood native American on the Tour.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a little tighter and in some cases he may have to come from behind after 54 holes which he hasn't really been very good at in his career.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Tiger Woods grabs first tour win in five years.

Hide Caption 11 of 11\n\nThe footage of vast crowds stampeding after Woods as he wrapped up his East Lake win were a throwback to his heyday in the early 2000s. TV ratings were up 206% on last year and the coverage yielded the highest rating for a non-major all year, third only to the Masters and the PGA Championship in which he chased home Brooks Koepka.\n\n\"Half the people watch because they're waiting for a train wreck or want to see him fail, and the other half want to be inspired and relive those historic wins that he had in '97 at the Masters or 2000 at Pebble Beach in the US Open,\" added Begay.\n\n\"Those are nostalgic-type victories that make people that are at different points in their lives remember just how fun sports and golf and Tiger Woods made watching golf.\"\n\nSince his last major victory at the 2008 US Open, Woods has gone through scandal in his private life, divorce, injuries and an issue with his medications for back pain which led to a driving-under-the-influence charge in May 2018.\n\nHis back story makes him even more compelling, says Begay.\n\n\"All of the distractions and challenges Tiger has had off the golf course not only brought in more people to take an interest in whether or not he's going to make the cut or make the putt or win the tournament and you see it in the TV ratings,\" he says.\n\n\"There's not a single player, not even close, that can drive ratings like Tiger Woods. He doesn't have to win, he just has to tee it up.\"", "\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649

millions of birds pass through our cities and towns on their trek south for the winter.\n\nFor me, though, the excitement about birds is year-round. Few things pull me out of a funk like the sudden appearance of a bluebird in my backyard, the vivid blue against a green magnolia tree like an exclamation point.\n\nI scramble for binoculars to get a closer look, and as I turn the focus wheel, my cloudy, scattered mind refocuses, too. The tiny indigo beauty rewards me with a chest puff, a rust-colored breast popping against the brilliant blue.\n\nThe sound of bird song and rustling leaves lead me to take a deep sip of fresh air, and the tightness in my chest disappears. My spirits, low since my mother's death, lift for now. I look skyward for the next flutter.\n\nBirding to calm the mind\n\nWhen you're birding, \"you're almost in a different world,\" said Heather Wolf, a bird guide for NYC Audubon in New York.\n\nIt's a skill of fine-tuned observation, which rewards the birder with a new perspective.\n\n\"All of the things that might be weighing you down in your daily life, it's an escape. You forget about them when you're birding,\" Wolf said.\n\nOn a recent fall Saturday, Wolf leads a group through Brooklyn Bridge Park, a mini birding oasis, complete with a stunning backdrop.\n\nShe leads the binocular-wearing birders through a paved path surrounded by foliage. You can hear the tweeting as birds dash between bushes or hop up tree trunks.\n\nWolf excitedly points out species along the walk: \"A phoebe just landed.\" \"Oh wow!! that's a woodpecker. It's a downy woodpecker. Everyone see that?\"\n\nPhotos: The joys of birdwatching Birdwatching \u2013 A bluebird is spotted in an Atlanta backyard on April 1, 2017.

Many of the birders on this walk are in their 30s, as birding increasingly draws a younger crowd.\n\nWhile 45 million Americans say they regularly observe birds, according to a US Fish and Wildlife survey, Audubon's research found that 9 million of them are between the ages of 18 and 35.\n\nCameron Shore, a 30-year-old architect, says he finds birding to be meditative -- better than even yoga -- because it's outside in nature.\n\n\"Just being able to move around and pick out a particular sound or a particular thing to watch, I find it to be more focusing than anything else,\" he said.\n\n\"I actually have a lot of difficulty calming down in the city, with all the background noise and just everything that's going on. It's a nice time to come out and spend an hour or two kind of in silence.\"\n\nEric Hazeltine, a software program manager living in Brooklyn, is on the walk with his pregnant wife.\n\n\"You really have to use all of your senses when you do it,\" he said. \"You can't even be listening to music or listening to podcasts. You have to keep your ears open and your eyes open.\"\n\nBirdwatching and your health\n\nstudy from the University of Exeter in England last year found that people living in neighborhoods with more birds and tree cover are less likely to have depression, anxiety and stress.\n\nThe study, published in the journal BioScience, surveyed more than 270 people from towns throughout southern England. Researchers found a positive association between the number of birds and trees in a neighborhood and residents' mental health, even after controlling for a neighborhood's poverty level and other demographic factors.\n\nThe study's author says the need for more exposure to nature comes at a time of unprecedented biodiversity loss, which includes more than 300 threatened bird species in North America alone.\n\nAnother study in the Journal of Environmental Psychology found that just listening to bird song contributes to perceived attention restoration and stress recovery.\n\nAnd beyond birds, there are hundreds of studies that show the health benefits of sustained exposure to nature, according to Dr. Nooshin Razani, a pediatrician and director of the Center for Nature and Health at UCSF's Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Within minutes of being in a natural setting things like cortisol, a stress hormone, improve,\" Razani said.\n\n\"Within 15 minutes, the ability to solve puzzles and cognitive benefits are seen. Even attention seems to get better. At around that time, blood pressure improves and so does pulse.\"\n\nRazani notes that a lifetime of regular exposure to nature -- whether walking in a park or camping in a forest -- is associated with improvements in cardiovascular disease and longevity.\n\nThen there are the health benefits of birding in a group, since multiple studies show that social connections and friendships are key to a long, healthy life. Sharing a hobby you're passionate about can connect you to others.\n\n\"A lot of times, when you're birding, you'll notice someone else with binoculars, and you can make new friends that way,\" Wolf said.\n\nAnd there's a huge birding community awaiting you.\n\n\"I follow a few people's blogs and Instagram to see what birds they're seeing,\" said Amanda Warco, a 33-year-old Brooklyn educator who goes birding with her husband. \"I like that it is a community and it's another way to get to know people who live around me that I probably wouldn't have any other interaction with.\"\n\nGrab some binoculars and look up\n\nYou don't have to take a trip to Costa Rica to go birding. You can do it in your own backyard. In fact, backyard birders are the largest group of wildlife watchers in the country ; 39 million Americans do it that way.\n\nOr you can explore your own city. Birding can take you to new neighborhoods.\n\n\"I really would encourage anyone to just take a closer look at the trees in your neighborhood, especially around fall and spring,\" Wolf said.\n\nBrie Stotler, a 39-year-old physician, hopes that as more Americans develop an interest in birdwatching, they'll become more concerned about the environment.\n\n\"Caring about the birds, you naturally start to think ... 'Well, do they have things to eat? Do they have a place to go?' And then that takes your thoughts to, 'What kind of parks do I have in the city?' or 'Are we preserving their natural habitat where they go to breed?' \"\n\nMy bird habit started with observing flashes of blue, red and yellow through my sunroom windows. My partner bought me some binoculars, and my interest grew.\n\nI was surprised to see so many colors and types of birds visiting every day. I ran to my bird guides to learn their names and match the pictures with my observations. Now, I know many of them by heart: robins, blue jays, Carolina wrens, titmouses, phoebes and my favorites, the tiny warblers, all 4 inches of them.\n\nThey flit so fast from branch to branch, often showing flashes of yellow, that it takes all my focus to capture them in my sights. This pulls into the moment, face to face with nature. Each bird has a sweetness, and their behavior becomes familiar and reassuring.\n\nNow, I photograph them, too.\n\nRecently, a surprise visit from a red-tailed hawk, whose soaring wingspan threw a shadow over my yard, drew me out of the house with binoculars to look skyward. His majestic soaring across the clouds lifted my spirit once again.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nAl menos 31 personas han muerto en los incendios: 29 por el incendio Campa y 2 por el incendio Woolsey\n\nLas casas de Neil Young, Robin Thicke y Gerard Butler son algunas de las que han sido arrasadas por el incendio Woolsey que afecta el norte de Los \u00c1ngeles, en el sur de California\n\n(CNN) - Los mortales incendios que se extienden en California, Estados Unidos, han obligado a la evacuaci\u00f3n de cientos de miles de residentes, incluyendo celebridades cuyos hogares se han perdido por el fuego.\n\nLas casas de Neil Young, Robin Thicke y Gerard Butler son algunas de las que han sido arrasadas por el incendio Woolsey que afecta el norte de Los \u00c1ngeles, en el sur de California, de acuerdo con publicaciones en internet hechas por las propias celebridades.\n\nButler public\u00f3 en Twitter una foto de los restos carbonizados de su casa en Malibu y agradeci\u00f3 a los bomberos por su valent\u00eda.\n\nReturned to my house in Malibu after evacuating.

They elected the first Muslim-American women -- one in Minnesota and another in Michigan. They voted in the first Native-American women -- in New Mexico and Kansas.\n\nEverywhere you looked on the map last Tuesday night, Democratic voters were backing women -- and oftentimes women of color.\n\nWhich brings us to the 2020 Democratic presidential race. And specifically to California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris is in her first term as a senator from the country's largest state. When she won in 2016, she made history as the first African-American woman and the first Indian-American woman to represent California in the Senate.\n\nStarting to get a sense for where we're headed here? We've always ranked Harris highly in these rankings -- due to the importance of California within the broader Democratic Party and the number of major donors in the state who would gladly help fund Harris' national ambitions.\n\nBut the 2018 election convinced us that Harris seems to be exactly what Democratic voters are telling the party and its politicians they want representing them going forward. A young-ish -- she's 54 -- non-white woman, Harris looks like the Democratic Party base these days. And if 2020 is anything like 2018, that's a very good place for her to be.\n\nAdd it all up, and we've got a new #1 on our 2020 rankings! Our full top 10 list is below.\n\nMichael Bloomberg (honorable mention): As he always seems to do, the former : As he always seems to do, the former New York City Mayor spent heavily from his own pocket to fund causes he believes in over the final weeks of the 2018 campaign . That he chose to run a series of national ads to do so shouldn't be lost on anyone. Bloomberg sees himself as a national figure and has always been desirous of a national platform. That desire, coupled with his party switch (he's a Democrat again) and his massive personal wealth, all suggest that Bloomberg is dead serious about running. The question is whether he -- a white guy from NYC -- is what the party is pining for.\n\n10. Beto O'Rourke: One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has : One of us (maybe even the one writing this blurb) has historically been very skeptical of the now-failed Senate candidate. Sometimes, though, out of the ashes of failure rises success. O'Rourke came the closest for a Texas Democrat to winning a Senate race in a generation. He only lost to Ted Cruz by less than 3 points . O'Rourke did so as an unabashed liberal who inspired millions of Democrats across the country. Importantly, he proved be a tireless worker, which could serve him well on the presidential campaign trail. Still, O'Rourke lost in 2018, was just a three-term member of the House and is man running in a party becoming dominated by women. We're more than just a little skeptical.\n\n9. Sherrod Brown: On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018. He represents a state that President Donald Trump won by 9 points in 2016, and Republicans recruited a credible challenger -- Rep. Jim Renacci -- into the race against him. It didn't work out that way, as Brown cruised to a win even as some of his fellow Democrats in states Trump carried were losing on Tuesday night. : On paper, Brown should have been among the most vulnerable Democratic senators in 2018.

Brown's victory speech openly called out his race as a blueprint for 2020. If you're looking for a dark horse, look no further than Brown, who has the record and the voice to sell liberal populism.\n\n8. Steve Bullock: Some politicians are coy about running. The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited : Some politicians are coy about running. The governor of Montana is the opposite of that. He's visited Iowa multiple times and New Hampshire as well. But showing signs of running isn't enough to get you on this list. One thing we like about Bullock is he has a lane that doesn't seem overly crowded ... yet. He's the outsider western governor in a party that is becoming more dominated by urbanites. That also means that his natural base within the party is very small. One other problem for Bullock is that most people have no clue who he is. In a crowded field, he may get buried before he ever has a chance to shine.\n\n7. Julian Castro: Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Like Bullock, Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and head of the department of Housing and Urban Development under then President Obama, is casting aside coyness. \"I'm likely to do it,\" Castro told Rolling Stone recently . \"I have a strong vision for the country.\" Given the rising influence of Hispanic voters within the Democratic coalition and Castro's proven star power -- his keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention was a tour de force of political oratory -- he's someone to keep an eye on.\n\n6. Bernie Sanders: The case for Sanders remains as obvious as it ever was. He came in second in the 2016 presidential primary, maintains a high favorable rating with Democrats and he's quite progressive in a party moving to the left. Yet, it seems like : The case for Sanders remains as obvious as it ever was. He came in second in the 2016 presidential primary, maintains a high favorable rating with Democrats and he's quite progressive in a party moving to the left. Yet, it seems like his moment may have passed . Sanders placed a distant second in CNN's October poll on the Democratic primary , despite high name recognition. There's no sign that he has solved his problem of attracting black voters. Additionally, Sanders might be a victim of his own success. There will likely be other Democrats running this time around who are outsiders (such as Bullock) or are very liberal (such as Harris).\n\n5. Cory Booker: Here's how you know the New Jersey senator is a very likely presidential candidate. : Here's how you know the New Jersey senator is a very likely presidential candidate. On a trip through Iowa (DING) last month to stump for candidates up and down the Hawkeye State ballot (DING DING), he said this: \"This might be the Midwest, I grew up in the Northeast, but folk are folk.\" (DING DING DING). Folk are folk! Booker has been somewhat outshined as the rising star within the changing Democratic Party by Harris, but he is a gifted orator and someone who seems to want it badly. Both of which matter in the grind of a presidential primary.\n\n4. Amy Klobuchar: A lot of people will disagree with putting the Minnesota senator this high on the list, but hear us out. Democrats are desperate to win back the Midwest. If they are, then doesn't it make sense to nominate someone who just won reelection to the Senate from a key Midwestern state by 24 points. It was by far the biggest win for any Democratic Midwestern senator. We're reminded of : A lot of people will disagree with putting the Minnesota senator this high on the list, but hear us out.

It was by far the biggest win for any Democratic Midwestern senator. We're reminded of another Midwestern senator who won his last election before running for president by a wide margin. What does Klobuchar offer the base? She gives them a calm but prosecutorial demeanor that she could use to fight Trump. That served her well during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings . Not being a fire-breathing liberal could hurt her in the primary, however.\n\n3. Joe Biden: Take a poll today in any early voting state like Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina and the former vice president will be on top. Take a national poll of the Democratic field and Diamond Joe will be No. 1, too. And he sure looks like a candidate despite saying he won't make up his mind until early 2019.

In the final days of the 2018 campaign, Biden, hoarse from shouting, held 12 rallies for Democratic candidates -- uttering classic Bidenisms like \"It's time to get up. Remember who in the hell we are. This is America.\" So why isn't Biden at the top of our rankings? Because he's in his mid-70s, is a white male and has spent his entire adult life in politics. It's not clear to us that profile sells in this coming Democratic primary.\n\n2. Elizabeth Warren: The senior senator from Massachusetts continues to remain near the top of our list for obvious reasons.

Yet in her first big test of her 2020 potential candidacy, she came out behind . She was hoping to prove to detractors that she had Native-American ancestry , but her low percentage of Native-American DNA was mocked. Trump dismissed it. The test was also an unwelcome distraction during the closing weeks of the 2018 campaign. Warren will no doubt have the chance to recover. It was a weak start, however.\n\n1.

Harris looks like the right fit for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary voter. She'll be well-funded.

Harris has been seen as a 2020 candidate since the day she announced she was running for the Senate. It now not only looks like she will make those expectations come true, but that she will start the race in a very strong position.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story's graphic incorrectly identified Julian Castro.", "This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one's life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) What if you could live longer just by doing more of what you love to do most?\n\nIt's an attractive theory that finds its evidence in a community on the island of Okinawa that's nicknamed the Village of Longevity because its residents have the highest life expectancy in the world. They also largely share a devotion to a Japanese philosophy known as ikigai, over-simply translated as the happiness derived from being busy at some activity that holds meaning and purpose for them.\n\nOgimi, the friendly village of 3,000 of the world's longest-living people, is known for its slow pace, ocean views, community gatherings, personal vegetable gardens and residents who smile, laugh and joke incessantly. They also take great pride in living to 100 and beyond. They have fewer chronic illnesses than most people, including cancer and heart disease, and their rate of dementia is well below the global average.\n\nThe answer is probably a combination of factors that include the usual suspects: diet, movement/exercise and having friends and community. What these \"blue zone\" areas of longevity and happiness around the world have in common are residents who curate a simple life with few possessions, plenty of time outdoors, staying active with friends, getting enough sleep, and eating lightly and healthily.\n\nWhat the long-lived Japanese add to this list is ikigai, a concept that is, at times, used synonymously with purpose, passion, meaning, mission, vocation and drive. If you brew all those notions together and distill its contents, you get ikigai.\n\nFinding your ikigai\n\nIkigai has been drawn in books and articles as the center of a Venn diagram in which your answers to these questions all overlap: What do you love? What are you good at? What can you be paid for? What does the world need? When you find the answer that fits all four questions, that's your ikigai.\n\nAnother way of defining your own ikigai is to simply ask yourself: Why do you get up in the morning? Or, what motivates you?\n\nOr as Viktor Frankl put it, \"Why do you not commit suicide?\" Frankl, a psychiatrist and neurologist, is the creator of a type of therapy infused with spiritual themes known as logotherapy. He was also the author of \"Man's Search for Meaning,\" about how his experience surviving the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz taught him that a purpose-driven life is the answer to overcoming obstacles and sorrows.\n\nKen Mogi, a Japanese neuroscientist and author of \"Awakening Your Ikigai: How the Japanese Wake Up to Joy and Purpose Every Day\" equates the ethos for ikigai to the famous British government slogan from World War II posters: \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"\n\nFrankl's logotherapy aims to help patients find their purpose in life. (\"Logos\" is the Greek word for \"meaning.\") If you feel anxious or empty, it's because you are having an existential crisis, Frankl argued. Logotherapy tends to be more forward looking rather than, say, looking for roots of discontent in your childhood.\n\nTherapy is one way to find your ikigai, which is the \"existential fuel\" that motivates us to live long and happy, as Garc\u00eda and Miralles put it. Less expensive than therapy is asking yourself the question \"what is the meaning of my life?\" and pursuing activities that support your answer.\n\nEven more simple is the question \"what do I love doing most?\" Your ikigai may lie in the activities that tend to induce a state of being fully and delightfully immersed in that action, what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called \"flow\" and Abraham Maslow called \"peak experiences.\"\n\nDr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, suggested another question to get at your ikigai: \"If money were no object ... what would I regret not having done with my life?\"\n\nThere's no single way to learn your ikigai, and the individual answers are even more varied. Your ikigai may be devotion to friends, cooking, being a good parent, writing, scientific inquiry, fighting climate change, drawing, helping your neighbors and on and on.\n\nGarc\u00eda and Miralles interviewed elderly residents of Ogimi, Japan, about their individual ikigai, and their answers included, \"I plant my own vegetables and cook them myself,\" \"getting together with my friends\" and \"making things with wicker.\" Ikigai doesn't need to be lofty or complicated, and it's better not to stress about it. Ikigai is largely just the activity that will blissfully keep you busy until the end of your days. (And by pursuing it, you'll probably have more of those days.)\n\n\"You need to find your ikigai in the little things. You've got to start small. You need to be here and now,\" Mogi writes. \"Most crucially, you cannot and should not blame the environment for a lack of ikigai. After all, it is up to you to find your own ikigai, in your own way.\"\n\nOnce you do that, even if you don't live to age 100, your life may feel longer because you are more fully engaged with it while you are here.\n\nAnd living with purpose will encourage other behavior that promotes longevity. \"Having ikigai would induce you to lead a healthier lifestyle, with more exercise, increased social activities, and life-long learning,\" Mogi wrote to me in an email.\n\nI also asked Mogi about his own personal ikigai. \"I used to chase butterflies and study them as a kid. Now, going for a run in the morning is my ikigai. Connecting to people of different backgrounds, going over the borders of language, ethnicity, and nationality, is probably the greatest ikigai of my life now,\" he wrote. \"So ikigai can be small and big, both of them equally important in one's life. Ikigai is a spectrum.\"\n\nAs I think of my own ikigai, the activities that give me the most flow are creative ones, mostly writing (you are reading my ikigai!), storytelling and sharing experiences with my wife and kids. I like to think that these pursuits will have a wider impact on the world, too. If I could spend every day for the rest of life pursuing those activities, I'd die very happy and apparently very old.\n\nYou and your ikigai: Till delayed death do you part\n\nOnce you find your ikigai, there is really no reason to ever retire from it. The Japanese apparently don't even have a word for \"retire.\" It's the not retiring from your purpose-driven life that seems to be the key factor of longevity and happiness on Okinawa.\n\nIt's not as easy as that sounds, of course. \"Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning,\" Garc\u00eda and Miralles write. \"Powerful forces and incentives (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don't let them take over your life.\"\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nInstead, they advise, follow your curiosity and intuition, which are the paths back to ikigai, as is self-awareness. Find the activity you love, surround yourself with people you love, and stay true to that internal compass.\n\nMogi has more advice on keeping your ikigai engine running smoothly. His five points boil down to: focus on the details, accept yourself, rely on others, enjoy pleasure and stay present.\n\n\"There is a passion inside you, a unique talent that gives meaning to your days and drives you to share the best of yourself until the very end,\" Garc\u00eda and Miralles write.\n\nOr, great mythology teacher Joseph Campbell summed the more than 1,000 words of advice in this story into just three: \"Follow your bliss.\"", "(CNN) \u2014 Ever dreamed of tying the knot in a fairytale castle in Italy ?

The battlements have protruding iron balconies, glass floors and slit windows that overlook a verdant canyon -- an idyllic background for sunset photo sessions.\n\nThis is no ordinary Italian hilltop hamlet.\n\nRoccascalegna's castle shoots out of a shard-like horizontal basalt cliff. The rocky outcrop sits between flower meadows dotted with olive trees and barns.\n\nIt's a peaceful slice of heaven.\n\nIn the quaint village below, where peculiar purple fig trees and tiny pomegranate bushes sprout from massive rocks lining the streets, you're more likely to come across strutting hens than people.\n\nPirate invasions\n\nRoccascalegna's sleepiness belies a troubled past. Over the centuries it's fallen prey to barbarian invasions, enemy troops and pirate incursions from the coast.\n\nThe area was ominously known as Death Valley. Now it's seeking redemption.\n\n\"The castle, abandoned for ages, was a ruin where sheep and dogs slept,\" says Giangiordano. \"Look at it now -- it's a gem.\"\n\nDespite the area's beauty, Roccascalegna hasn't attracted the attention of the tourists populating other parts of Italy in their hundreds of thousands.\n\nRelated content Where to see Europe's best hilltop towns\n\nThere are just a few bars and B&Bs. Old stone cottages have been given a makeover while a few crumbling ones are on the market at \u20ac20,000 (about $22,000).\n\nThe overhanging castle can be reached by foot only, which makes the venue even more exclusive.\n\nRoccascalegna is surrounded by meadows and olive groves. Comune Roccascalegna\n\nThere are no roads leading there. Cars are parked at the entrance of the village and guests need to climb old donkey trails made of rough stones carved from the hill's jagged rocks.\n\nTo facilitate access the mayor is offering to help as wedding planner. There's also transport and logistics assistance with public minivans placed at guests' disposal.\n\nGiangiordano can also coordinate catering services with premium local products. Guests should prepare to have their waistlines destroyed -- the rustic local food is delicious but high in calories.\n\nNo high heels\n\nA local grandmother makes traditional wedding cakes. Silvia Marchetti\n\nSpecialties on the party menu include pallotte cace e ova (meat balls with grated Pecorino sheep cheese and eggs), Pizza Scima, (a white wine and olive oil flat bread), arrosticini lamb skewers, fiadone ricotta cheese pie and crespelle sweet-and-sour waffles.\n\nPane porchettato, a large bread dough stuffed with boneless pork roast, is a recipe patented by a grandmother who runs the village bakery.\n\nShe also makes traditional local wedding cakes such as taralli, huge sugar-powdered biscuits shaped like a princess crown that are gifted to the bride and guests.\n\nIf there's a catch, it's the dress code limitations. The hike to the castle can be tough and brides would struggle to make it to the altar in a long-train wedding gown.\n\nA stone staircase is the only way to reach the castle. Silvia Marchetti\n\nTrekking or running shoes are highly recommended. Barefoot, even better. Even donkey hooves have been known to get stuck in between the rock steps.\n\n\"One couple couldn't stop laughing,\" says Marcello Giangiordano, the castle's keeper and guide and no relation to the mayor. \"The bride was wearing a long silk pink dress and peep-toe stilettos. The groom, barefoot, swept her up in his arms and carried her all the way up to the altar.\"\n\nThose who make the climb are rewarded by breathtaking views and lungfuls of clean air.\n\nHeadless ghost\n\nRock arches lead to the banqueting hall, a former cellar where armies stacked food during sieges. Inside the prison tower, lights shine in former medieval toilet seats.\n\nFinger foods are served in spooky rooms showcasing torture objects. The underground dungeons are shaped like Dante's Inferno: the nastier the crime, the deeper the cell.\n\nRelated content 10 things Italy does better than anywhere else\n\nThe venue comes with its own guest. It's said to be haunted by the headless ghost of Baron Corvo de Corvis, who enforced the evil medieval right of sleeping with all newlywed village girls until an angry husband stabbed him to death.\n\nFor centuries the baron's bloody hand print stained the castle walls. His armor is on display, without its helmet.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Fear of a global economic slowdown and a decision by the United States to allow some countries to keep buying Iranian crude oil following the reintroduction of sanctions have hit market sentiment.\n\nBP ( BP ) CEO Bob Dudley said the Saudi cut represented \"quite a bit of oil.\"\n\n\"That probably would adjust sentiment and get [prices] back into a corridor with less volatility,\" he told CNN Business.\n\nA senior OPEC source said the cartel and other major producers are discussing cutting production by as much as 1.2 million barrels per day. A decision could be taken at the next OPEC meeting in Vienna on December 6.\n\nA cut of that magnitude would reverse a decision in June by OPEC and Russia to pump over a million barrels per day more to make up for the expected loss of Iranian exports.\n\n\"The size of any potential cut will depend on how much oil demand growth slows down, how much Iranian supply falls due to US sanctions, and how fast US supply rises,\" said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS.\n\nSaudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminal.\n\nRussia appears to need more convincing that it should be cutting production.\n\nRussia's energy minister Alexander Novak said in Abu Dhabi on Sunday it was too early to make a decision to reverse course and cut supply.\n\n\"We're going to do everything we can to keep supply and demand inventories within a reasonably narrow band, \" Al Falih said on Monday, during a debate moderated by CNN Business' Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios. \"We hope that markets will calm down.\"\n\nCrude prices jumped by as much as 2% on the prospects of reduced supply from OPEC. US crude oil futures were trading around $60.80 per barrel, $1.50 higher than on Friday.\n\nThe United States last week said eight jurisdictions \u2014 China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 would be able to continue buying Iranian oil for six months without fear of US penalties under sanctions on trading with Iran.\n\n\"The sanctions on Iran have turned out to be a damp squib for the time being with the Trump administration granting exemptions,\" said Devesh Mamtani, head of investments and advisory at Century Financial, a brokerage firm in Dubai. \"The exemptions have even surprised Saudi Arabia as oil supplies from Iran are likely to spike in the coming days,\" he added.\n\nUAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who is also OPEC president, said the cartel wouldn't allow the market to become oversupplied.\n\n\"We will assure you that when we meet in December we will go to the market with the solution that will ensure market stability,\" he said.", "02:19\n\n\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0635\u0646\u0639\u062a \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0648\u0644

That would make it the world's biggest IPO since Alibaba ( BABA ) went public in New York in 2014.\n\nThe IPO is a key part of CEO Masa Son's efforts to reposition SoftBank ( SFTBY ) as a global tech investor. It will effectively split the company in two, allowing investors to choose between its mobile unit and its tech investment business, which includes a big stake in Alibaba.\n\nSon has turned himself into a kingmaker in the global tech industry after launching the $93 billion Vision Fund last year, with nearly half the cash coming from the Saudi government. The fund has made big investments in dozens of startups such as WeWork and Slack.\n\nSoftBank has also poured money into high-profile tech companies like Uber and its Chinese rival Didi Chuxing.\n\nSelling shares in the mobile division will raise billions of dollars for Son to hunt down more major deals.\n\nSoftBank will also have the option to sell another 240 billion yen ($2.1 billion) of shares if investor demand is strong, which would put the size of the IPO above $23 billion.\n\nThat would make it the second biggest stock market listing of all time, just above Agricultural Bank of China's offering in 2010, according to Dealogic data.\n\nThe numbers could still change. SoftBank says its price of 1,500 yen per share is tentative and a final decision will be taken on December 10.\n\nAt that price, the IPO would value the mobile division at 7.2 trillion yen ($63 billion). SoftBank will still own at least 60% of the business following the listing.\n\nOne risk for the IPO is a damaging price war among Japan's mobile operators.\n\nThe shares will start trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 19.\n\nSoftBank first announced plans for the mobile IPO earlier this year, but didn't say how much money it hoped to raise.\n\nA new risk for the business emerged less than two weeks ago: a damaging price war among Japan's mobile operators.", "Photos: What a shot! 33 amazing sports photos Cameron Wake of the Miami Dolphins sacks New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold in the second quarter of their game on November 4 in Miami, Florida.

Los afectados reportan falta de aire y cansancio porque a su coraz\u00f3n le cuesta bombear la sangre al cuerpo.\n\nUna de las causas actualmente es la insuficiencia de las v\u00e1lvulas, particularmente de la v\u00e1lvula mitral, que controla el flujo de sangre en el lado izquierdo del coraz\u00f3n. Cuando la insuficiencia es grave, el coraz\u00f3n puede agrandarse.\n\nSe estima que este mal afecta a m\u00e1s de dos millones de personas en Estados Unidos. Esta falla provoca que la sangre fluya al rev\u00e9s a la hora del bombeo, lo que significa que no llega eficientemente al resto del cuerpo.\n\nSin embargo, el nuevo dispositivo, llamado MitraClip, mantiene unida la v\u00e1lvula defectuosa y le ayuda a trabajar correctamente y a bombear la sangre hacia afuera del coraz\u00f3n. Ha arrojado resultados prometedores en el estudio.\n\nDe acuerdo con los autores, hay f\u00e1rmacos para aliviar los s\u00edntomas de la insuficiencia de la v\u00e1lvula mitral, pero se desconocen sus efectos a largo plazo. La cirug\u00eda tambi\u00e9n es opci\u00f3n y puede ser la cura, pero puede tener complicaciones graves porque los pacientes suelen ser de edad avanzada y m\u00e1s fr\u00e1giles.\n\nLa implantaci\u00f3n del MitraClip es poco invasiva: el dispositivo se transfiere a trav\u00e9s de una incisi\u00f3n peque\u00f1a en la ingle y se ha demostrado que reduce el tiempo de recuperaci\u00f3n y hospitalizaci\u00f3n, seg\u00fan el estudio.\n\nPara medir la eficacia del dispositivo, Greg Stone, profesor de Medicina del Colegio de M\u00e9dicos de la Universidad de Columbia (EE. UU.), y su equipo reclutaron en Estados Unidos y Canad\u00e1 a 614 personas con insuficiencia card\u00edaca e insuficiencia mitral secundaria (cuando la v\u00e1lvula mitral no sella bien) de moderada a severa que segu\u00edan teniendo s\u00edntomas pese a estar en tratamiento farmacol\u00f3gico. La forma secundaria de esta afecci\u00f3n es cuando el ventr\u00edculo izquierdo del paciente est\u00e1 da\u00f1ado, lo que impide que la v\u00e1lvula funcione correctamente.\n\nDe los participantes, se implant\u00f3 el nuevo dispositivo a 302 y 312 fueron el grupo de control. Entre los que recibieron el MitraClip se registr\u00f3 un 32,1% menos hospitalizaciones al a\u00f1o en los a\u00f1os dos a\u00f1os posteriores.\n\n\"La tasa anual de hospitalizaciones por insuficiencia card\u00edaca en 24 meses fue de 35,8% por paciente por a\u00f1o en el grupo en el que se implant\u00f3 el dispositivo, a diferencia del 67,9% por paciente por a\u00f1o en el grupo de control\", escribieron los autores.\n\nLa mortalidad general por cualquier causa, en esos dos a\u00f1os, tambi\u00e9n fue un 17% menor entre los pacientes a quienes se implant\u00f3 el dispositivo (29,1%), a diferencia del grupo de control (46,1%).\n\n\"Es impresionante lo positiva que es esta nueva terapia para los pacientes que tienen un coraz\u00f3n muy d\u00e9bil\", dijo Michael Acker, jefe de la Divisi\u00f3n de Cirug\u00eda Cardiovascular de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad Estatal de Pensilvania. Acker, quien no est\u00e1 relacionado con la investigaci\u00f3n, se\u00f1al\u00f3 que los hallazgos del estudio eran mucho m\u00e1s alentadores que los resultados de un ensayo parecido que se public\u00f3 en agosto.\n\n\"De entrada, es muy emocionante\", pero agreg\u00f3 que se necesitan m\u00e1s estudios para entender las diferencias entre los grupos de poblaci\u00f3n de cada investigaci\u00f3n.\n\nLa t\u00e9cnica del MitraClip se prob\u00f3 por primera vez en 2003 y en octubre de 2013 recibi\u00f3 la aprobaci\u00f3n de la Agencia de Alimentos y Medicamentos de Estados Unidos (FDA, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) para el tratamiento de la insuficiencia mitral primaria (o degenerativa), de acuerdo con los investigadores de la Universidad de Washington. Su uso para el tratamiento de la versi\u00f3n secundaria de este trastorno sigue bajo investigaci\u00f3n y no ha recibido la aprobaci\u00f3n de la FDA.\n\nEste nuevo estudio fue parte del ensayo COAPT

thousands of residents to evacuate, including some celebrities whose homes have been lost to the blazes.\n\nNeil Young, Robin Thicke , Gerard Butler and Miley Cyrus are among those whose houses were ravaged by the Woolsey fire raging north of Los Angeles in Southern California, according to the entertainers' respective online posts.\n\nButler posted a photo on Twitter of the charred remains of his Malibu home and thanked firefighters for their courage.\n\nReturned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California. Inspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters. Thank you @LAFD . If you can, support these brave men and women at https://t.co/ei7c7F7cZx . pic.twitter.com/AcBcLtKmDU\n\nThicke posted a statement on Instagram thanking firefighters and volunteers who \"risked their lives trying to save our home.\"\n\nA post shared by Robin Thicke (@robinthicke) on Nov 11, 2018 at 12:47pm PST\n\nCyrus said on Twitter that she was \"completely devastated\" by the fires affecting her community.\n\n\"I am one of the lucky ones. My animals and LOVE OF MY LIFE made it out safely & that's all that matters right now. My house no longer stands but the memories shared with family & friends stand strong. I am grateful for all I have left. Sending so much love and gratitude to the firefighters and LA country Sheriff's department! \"\n\nA subsequent tweet pointed to ways people could help those affected by the fires.\n\nCompletely devestated by the fires affecting my community. I am one of the lucky ones. My animals and LOVE OF MY LIFE made it out safely & that's all that matters right now. My house no longer stands but the memories shared with family & friends stand strong. I am grateful for \u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 12, 2018\n\nIn a post on his official website decrying the impact of climate change, Young said \"I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.\"\n\nThe Woolsey fire is one of three major blazes burning across California. As of Sunday night, the fire had spread to 85,500 acres and was 15% contained.\n\nTogether with the smaller Hill fire, which spans 4,531 acres, the Woolsey fire has so far destroyed 179 structures, but fire officials say another 57,000 are threatened. The Hill fire was 75% contained as of Sunday night.\n\nThe third fire, Northern California's Camp fire, is the most destructive in state history and one of the deadliest . That blaze virtually burned the town of Paradise to the ground, destroying thousands of homes and structures. Some 228 people are unaccounted for.\n\nAt least 31 people have died in the fires: 29 in the Camp fire and two in the Woolsey fire.\n\n'The new abnormal'\n\n\"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal,\" Gov. Jerry Brown said of the role of climate change in driving the fires. \"The chickens are coming home to roost, this is real here.\"\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby echoed Brown's sentiments, noting how widespread the fire destruction has been across the state.\n\nThe southern part of the state used to be able to rely on help from their counterparts up north around this time of the year, Osby said, when the threat of fire was much less prevalent in those communities. But that's no longer the case.\n\n\"And as evident by the Camp Fire in Northern California -- which is larger than this, more structures have been lost than this, more lives have been lost -- it's evident from that situation statewide that we're in climate change and it's going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Osby said.\n\nFirefighters on Sunday contained significant flare-ups in wind-prone canyons along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and Bell Canyon in Ventura County, Osby said.\n\nUnfavorable conditions are expected to persist into Monday, threatening new flare-ups that could reach beyond containment lines, Osby said.\n\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward . That leaves a lot of dry vegetation to feed fires.\n\nOsby urged those in mandatory evacuation zones to leave, warning that they can get in the way of firefighting efforts.", "(CNN)-- \u062a\u0633\u0628\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0637\u0645 \u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0629 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u062c\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0639\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0631\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u062d\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0646.\n\n\u0648\u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \"\u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0635\u0628 \u0623\u062d\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0630\u0649 \u0646\u062a\u064a\u062c\u0629 \u0644\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0648\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0641\u0649 \u0641\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0628\u0623\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c.\n\n\u0648\u0644\u0641\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \"\u0643\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u062c\u064a\u062f\u0629\". \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u062f\u062b \u0642\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEn un video de Xinhua se pueden ver dos J-20 rugiendo por encima de una multitud en el Airshow China mostrando cuatro misiles de largo alcance en su interior\n\nHong Kong (CNN) - La Fuerza A\u00e9rea de China dej\u00f3 lo mejor para el final de su feria a\u00e9rea bianual de Zhuhai, donde este domingo fueron presentados por primera vez en p\u00fablico sus nuevos aviones de combate furtivos, o stealth, con cargas completas de misiles.\n\nEl J-20 de doble turbina, considerado como la respuesta china a los F-22 y F-35 de Estados Unidos, se estren\u00f3 en febrero en la flota de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea del ej\u00e9rcito chino.\n\nUn reporte del a\u00f1o pasado del China Power Project del Centro de Estudios Estrat\u00e9gicos Internacionales suger\u00eda que el J-20 podr\u00eda representar un desaf\u00edo estrat\u00e9gico para componentes clave de la flota a\u00e9rea estadounidense, como los aviones cisterna para reabastecimiento de combustible, as\u00ed como aviones de alerta temprana y de comando y control, si contara con misiles aire-aire de largo alcance.\n\nEl domingo, los J-20 exhibieron dicha capacidad en lo que la agencia estatal china Xinhua describi\u00f3 como una \"demostraci\u00f3n a\u00e9rea impresionante\" durante el \u00faltimo d\u00eda de la feria a\u00e9rea de seis d\u00edas, Airshow China, donde el ej\u00e9rcito chino muestra y comercializa su material militar.\n\nEn un video de Xinhua se pueden ver dos J-20 rugiendo por encima de una multitud en el Airshow China mostrando cuatro misiles de largo alcance en su interior.

In addition, he has stoked conspiracy theories about stolen elections in the wake of Florida's latest vote counting controversy and has threatened to use the mechanisms of government to investigate Democrats if they investigate him.\n\nAnd he has stepped up his assault on the press, including by confiscating the White House pass of CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who asked multiple, challenging questions of Trump during a White House news conference.\n\nAll of this came days after Trump used his power as commander-in-chief to dispatch troops to the border to meet what he said was an imminent criminal invasion from a migrant caravan that is yet to materialize.\n\nThe President's moves, with the prospect of more to come, have precipitated a surreal moment in politics, with Washington veterans debating whether a constitutional crisis is looming \u2014 or whether it is already here.\n\nDoes the acting AG threaten the rule of law?\n\nThe current epicenter of the debate concerns Whitaker, the former chief of staff to fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions who took his boss's job.\n\n\"He should never have been appointed and ... it does violence to the Constitution and the vision of our founders to appoint such a person in such a manner to be the chief legal officer in our country,\" the likely next House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nGrowing questions over Whitaker's position will hike pressure on the President to swiftly nominate a permanent attorney general. But that nominee will face an inquisition from the Republican-led Senate over their positions on the Russia probe.\n\nWhitaker's critics fear he will refuse to sign off on subpoenas Mueller might request, narrow the mandate of his investigation or suppress the special counsel's final report.\n\nHis appointment has raised fears that the President intends to use him to derail the Russia investigation. That is a realistic possibility since Trump already admitted in an NBC interview last year that he fired FBI Director James Comey because of the investigation -- a move that critics say in itself amounts to an abuse of power and obstruction of justice.\n\nWhitaker appears unlikely to heed calls to recuse himself from the probe given a decision by Sessions to do so sparked Trump's fury and poisoned his tenure.\n\nIt may fall to the new Democratic House majority, therefore, to act as a check on any attempts by Trump to use Whitaker to interfere with Mueller, despite the President's challenge to legal norms represented by his appointment.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nThe President has frequently made claims of massive voter fraud in the United States, despite the fact that all available evidence suggests that it is not a significant problem.\n\nSo it is no surprise that he has leapt into action to proclaim that Florida's latest vote controversy is a flagrant example of Democratic larceny at the polls.\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" Trump tweeted Monday morning after having spent the weekend in Paris.\n\nAn honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\n\nNo one is disputing the Sunshine's State's unfortunate tendency to trigger election controversy. And answers are overdue about the stewardship of elections in Broward and Palm Beach counties for instance.\n\nLawyers for Democratic and Republican candidates are now launching dueling campaigns. Each side has every right to make their case after the state's Republican secretary of state ordered recounts to begin given thin margins.\n\n\"Every vote should be counted, but, by gosh, not let fraudulent or anti-Constitutional behavior prevail,\" Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who ran the Republican Senate midterm campaign, said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nBut Trump seems to be reacting not to evidence of fraud, but to vote counts that are narrowing the gap between Democratic Senate and gubernatorial candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum and the presumed Republican victors.\n\nThus the Florida controversy marks the latest occasion when he is prioritizing his personal interests over a President's duty to protect the nation's democracy.\n\nBut by intervening personally in the race, the President is casting doubt on the integrity of the election and potentially risking long-term damage to America's political system itself, which relies on public consent.\n\nHis furious intervention contrasts with the reaction of President Bill Clinton during an even higher-stakes confrontation in Florida, the bitterly contested recount in the 2000 presidential election, eventually handed to George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore by the Supreme Court.\n\nClinton took steps to avoid politicizing the process, reasoning that America's system depended on him staying out of it.\n\n\"I don't think I should be involved in that,\" Clinton said soon after the disputed election.\n\nTrump's intervention 18 years later is one reason why his critics fear he is oblivious or disdainful of traditional norms governing presidential behavior.\n\nLashing out at scrutiny\n\nThe Democratic capture of the House guarantees an uncomfortable period of investigation and oversight for the White House that the Republican majority deemed unnecessary during his first two years in office.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nIn the latest worrying sign for the President, top Democrat Rep. Jerrold Nadler told Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that Democrats would examine hush payments to women who allege past affairs with Trump that may infringe campaign finance laws.\n\n\"That might very well be an impeachable offense,\" Nadler said.\n\nTrump has denied the alleged affairs.\n\nThe President already reacted with fury to the notion of a new era of scrutiny from Democrats, promising a \"warlike\" posture if it took place, and hinted he could use the mechanisms of government to investigate them during a news conference last week.\n\nThe President also acted in a way many observers fear raises First Amendment questions by taking the unprecedented step of confiscating Acosta's permanent White House press pass after he questioned the President on the migrant caravan.\n\nHow deep is the crisis?\n\nEvents of the last few days point clearly to an escalating challenge by the White House to political conventions and guardrails, one that could further sharpen if Trump's reshuffle of top officials rids him of remaining restraining influences.\n\nIt is more difficult to assess whether the President's actions have already tipped the nation into a constitutional crisis or whether the system of checks and balances has kept him on the right side of that line.\n\nAfter all, two years after he was elected, voters did decide to introduce new accountability in Washington with a Democratic House after Republicans gave no sign they were willing to rein in the President's excesses.\n\nThe courts have tempered some of Trump's most radical ideas, watering down a Muslim travel ban he authored early in his presidency. Trump's new use of executive power to limit asylum claims, in an apparent contravention of international law, will soon get its own day in court.\n\nBut political systems need to be nurtured constantly if they are to remain healthy. And the President's rhetoric on the Florida controversy especially seems to edge close to the danger zone.\n\nOne veteran observer, Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff for Clinton and defense secretary under President Barack Obama, believes the nation's institutions are standing firm.\n\n\"I think ultimately the institutions that our forefathers put in place are strong enough to be able to survive any administration,\" Panetta said Thursday on \"The Situation Room.\"\n\nBut the fact that the question is even relevant is testimony to the darkening mood in Washington.", "Thelma and Bill Swisher are both US Navy veterans and have been married for the last 72 years.", "(CNN) A 50-year-old woman sabotaged Australian supermarket strawberries with sewing needles in an alleged act of workplace revenge, prosecutors told a Brisbane court Monday.\n\nMy Ut Trinh has been charged with seven counts of contamination of goods and faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted.\n\nTrinh's arrest Sunday followed at least 100 reported cases of sewing needles or pins found in strawberries across the country earlier this year, sparking nationwide panic.

A security guard, wrapped in navy shawls and a purple balaclava ushers us in, where the grounds lay deserted and still. A sense of unease is palpable among the tiny stream of early morning worshipers walking in.\n\nIt's been 10 days since Asia Bibi, a Catholic woman, was acquitted on charges of blasphemy by Pakistan's Supreme Court on the October 31.\n\nBibi, a mother of five from Punjab province was sentenced in 2010 after she was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Muhammad during an argument a year earlier with Muslim women over drinking water. She was handed a death sentence and was on death row for nearly eight years before her acquittal.\n\nAccusations of blasphemy have seen a surge in mob violence across parts of Pakistan.\n\nThe country's strict blasphemy laws are a topic of great sensitivity in Pakistan; accusations of blasphemy have seen a surge in mob violence and lynchings in pockets of the country.\n\nThe supreme court's judgment was lauded by liberal activists and lawyers across the country with Amnesty International calling for a \"clear message\" to go out that \"blasphemy laws will no longer be used to persecute Pakistan's long-suffering religious minorities.\"\n\nStill, the acquittal saw thousands of protesters take to the streets in anger at the Supreme Court's decision. Demonstrators called for Bibi to be hanged, and attacked the judges, the media, the army and any man or woman who dared defend her case\n\nAn agreement has been reached between the government and the protesters following a lockdown of three days, but a bitter feeling of anxiety remains in the air.\n\nSupporters of the Pakistani religious Islamist group Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) gather during a protest rally against the release of Asia Bib in early November.\n\nTehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a right-wing Islamist group, also only agreed to call off the protests on the condition that it would not prevent the group from handing in a petition to the Supreme Court to place Bibi on the country's exit control list.\n\nIf approved it would mean that Bibi would not be permitted to leave the country. Her whereabouts are currently unknown, as she has been moved from her jail to an undisclosed location.\n\nWhile speculation is rife about the safety of Bibi and her family, there are larger conversations at stake regarding the protection of Pakistan's tiny Christian minority.\n\n\"Just want the situation to go away\"\n\nAt the Cathedral in Pakistan's garrison town of Rawalpindi, CNN is asked to visit in the early hours of the day to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the site. Mothers shuffling in to drop off their kids at the neighboring convent avoid our gaze, looking away when we ask them about Asia Bibi's case.\n\n\"Please don't name us,\" one says. \"But we are Christians and if Muslims aren't safe from these conversations then we are nothing to these people, we respect the judgment of the Supreme Court and that is paramount, I just want this situation to go away and for this tension to be lifted from our shoulders.\"\n\nOne of the elder Christian gatekeepers at St Joseph's tells CNN that he is \"grateful for the presence of the military close to the church.\" However, he notes that the sense of fear has \"begun to haunt him\" since the capital went into lockdown after the acquittal.\n\nCNN tried to speak to members of the Christian community within parts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi but everyone approached was unwilling to speak for fear of retribution citing the charged emotions in the air in the aftermath of Bibi's acquittal.\n\nAround 50 percent of individuals accused of blasphemy in Pakistan are non-Muslim.\n\nThe shadow of blasphemy laws\n\nRomana Bashir, a Christian rights activist based in Islamabad tells CNN that while the country's blasphemy laws have severely impacted Muslims, the difference is that \"unfortunately when a Muslim is accused it's just an accusation on one person.\"\n\nShe added that when someone from the non-Muslim world is accused, \"the entire community is branded and labeled with the crime.\"\n\nPakistan's Christians make up only 1.59% of its population of more than 200 million, but as Peter Jacob, the executive director for the Center for Social Justice in Lahore says the impact of blasphemy laws on minorities is hugely disproportionate, with 50% of those accused being non-Muslims. Bashir adds that the lives of these individuals are tossed into a whirlwind of uncertainty.\n\n\"When you are accused you cannot live in the same place, your family is under threat, your entire locality is under threat, you must run, you must leave everything you love behind. The impact is very severe,\" she said.\n\nThe crime of blasphemy can carry the death penalty in Pakistan.\n\nClimate of fear\n\nWhen Bibi's acquittal was announced, havoc erupted on the streets of Pakistan; roads were blocked with massive containers, rioters attacked cars with rocks and burnt tires, and anarchy and rage spread throughout the population.\n\nJacob tells CNN that his organization registered cases in which rioters asked travelers to divulge their religion, and if the revealed they were Christian, \"they were taken out of their cars and beaten up.\"\n\nWhile the state provided extra security to churches and schools, Jacob revealed that \"the mental and psychological scars\" inflicted on the Christian community will endure in the \"current climate of fear.\"\n\nWhile major militant-backed attacks on Christians have decreased, activists tell CNN that the main issue facing the community is systematic bias within Pakistani society. According to Bashir, in 2014, in an attempt to fill quotas for minorities in government jobs, Christians were regularly offered low-skilled positions such as sweepers and office laborers, rather than higher-level roles.\n\nSchool textbooks still rarely mention the achievements of minority Pakistanis, while in the province of Punjab members of the Christian community occupy most of the slums in the region.\n\nBashir also tells us that according to research by her organization, the Peace and Development Foundation in Rawalpindi, there has been no attempt to politically engage minorities in recent years, with the number of allocated seats in parliament for minorities remaining static. Yet the overall number of seats has increased in the past decade, \"automatically decreasing the representation of minorities.\"\n\nChristians were targeted in Pakistan following the acquittal of Asia Bibi.\n\nBridges of harmony are burning\n\nBashir has worked for numerous years promoting women's and minority rights and religious tolerance. In 2012 she was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as an adviser for the Commission for Religious Relations with Muslims.\n\nShe has stated that there had been a lot of build up in the trust between Muslim community leaders and members of the Christian and other minority communities in recent years. That trust, she says, has been jeopardized by the uneasy atmosphere in the aftermath of the recent protests in the country.\n\n\"People on both sides are now afraid to come forth, there is no middle ground for discussion, there is no air for reconciliation, it's like the bridges of harmony have been burnt in the aftermath of acquittal,\" she said.\n\nThe whereabouts of Asia Bibi are currently unknown, shrouded in secrecy for her safety and survival. Unable to be free in her homeland, she must now escape under cover to far away lands offering her asylum and the promise of a more secure life. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, at least forty other people are reportedly on death row or serving life sentences for blasphemy.\n\nIn the shadow of this uncertainty, Asia's fate is one which many Christians in Pakistan hope to avoid.", "Philadelphia (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden lamented the \"demeaning\" nature of today's politics while presenting an award to President George W.

It's the second time company's rocket , which is less than 60 feet tall, has done that.\n\nRocket Lab's rivals have not yet pulled off an orbital launch, which means it is at the front of an increasingly crowded pack of rocket startups that want to launch smallsats for businesses and researchers.\n\nOther prominent companies in the dedicated smallsat launch industry include Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit and SpaceX veteran Jim Cantrell's Vector.\n\n\"[My team] built a beautiful machine,\" Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck told CNN Business on Sunday.\n\nWhy smallsats?\n\nJust as cell phones have shrunk, similar technological advancements have made satellites smaller and more capable.\n\nBut rockets have not downsized, and smallsats have been forced to hitch rides with much larger payloads on powerful rockets, like SpaceX's Falcon 9 or Russia's Soyuz rocket.\n\nSmallsat companies are often forced to wait long periods for free space aboard a rocket.\n\nRocket Lab and a slew of other startups aim to change that by flying smaller, less powerful rockets. The companies want to mass produce the rockets and offer far more frequent trips to space.\n\nSunday's Rocket Lab mission included payloads for customers like Spire Global, which collects data about ships and planes around the globe, and Fleet Space Technologies, which aims to connect remote devices to the internet.\n\nBeck, the Rocket Lab chief, told CNN Business that Australia-based Fleet Technologies was delayed for more than a year waiting to get its payload into orbit. Fleet reached out to Rocket Lab about a month ago, and the company's satellite was able to get on board the Electron by Sunday.\n\n\"That's really what it's all about. That's how we're going to make space accessible,\" Beck said.\n\nPaying for a dedicated launch vehicle, like Rocket Lab's Electron, can be more expensive for smallsat operators than hitching a ride on a larger rocket.\n\nBut Beck said many in the industry are willing to pay for the convenience of an Electron rocket. When the company is going at full speed, he says Electrons will be flinging satellites into space on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nRocket Lab's third flight is planned for next month, and its fourth is slated for January 2019. The company hopes to complete 16 launches next year.\n\nSizing up the competition\n\nRocket Lab's competition may not be too far behind.\n\nVirgin Orbit, a firm under Branson's Virgin Group, wants to launch smallsats by early next year. Its system launches a rocket from under the wing of a Boeing 747 in midair.\n\nVector, the brainchild of former SpaceX executive Cantrell, is also planning an inaugural orbital flight within the next few months.\n\nDozens of other startups are waiting in the wings. Experts suspect there will eventually be a shakeout in the market and there's no guarantee Rocket Lab will survive.\n\n\"Going first doesn't necessarily mean you win,\" Steve Isakowitz, CEO of nonprofit research group The Aerospace Corporation, told CNN Business in a recent interview. \"Can they get to market? Can they sustain it through production? And do they have the customer base?\"\n\nBeck, the Rocket Lab chief, said he thinks the market is headed for a \"brutal consolidation\" over the next 12 to 18 months that will leave just a few companies. And he's confident Rocket Lab will be one of them, he said.\n\nThe company, which Beck says is close to turning a profit, has raised $148 million in venture capital and is building factories capable of making one rocket per week.\n\n\"Anybody that owns a rocket company and tells you it's smooth sailings from here is living in a different world,\" Beck said. \"But we've been successful and there will be more to come. It's all about scaling now and continuing to lead.\"", "Washington (CNN) Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema's lead over Republican Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona's Senate race grew Sunday as some GOP figures continued to distance themselves from President Donald Trump's claims of misconduct.\n\nSinema led by 32,169 votes as of 5 a.m. ET on Monday, CNN results show. That puts her ahead by 1.5 percentage points with more than 2.1 million ballots counted.\n\nOn Saturday, Sinema campaign manager Andrew Piatt continued to express a belief that there are more Democratic ballots left to be counted than Republican ballots.\n\n\"McSally can hope for a miracle tomorrow night but the data show it won't happen,\" he said in a statement.\n\nMcSally campaign CEO Jim Bognet offered a drastically different take.\n\n\"The latest release provides compelling evidence that the remaining uncounted ballots are favorable to Martha.

Every one of those ballots goes through a verification process that involves matching voters' signatures on their ballots' envelopes with their voter registration forms.\n\nElections officials in two densely populated counties typically allow voters up to five days to help \"cure\" problems when signatures don't match.\n\nArizona Republicans filed a lawsuit that was quickly resolved with a settlement Friday that required all 15 counties in the state to follow the same procedure as Maricopa and Pima counties.\n\nThat seemed to satisfy McSally's camp and Republicans in the state. In a statement, McSally said she'd \"won an important battle\" to ensure rural voters receive equal treatment.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump used reports of the dispute to cast doubt in the fairness of Arizona's election, suggesting there had been \"electoral corruption\" even though there is no evidence to support Trump's claim.\n\n\"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH,\" Trump tweeted Friday. \"Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election?

Han estado recolectando muestras en frascos y usando agua embotellada o de manantial, aunque el gobierno local y estatal les aseguran que era segura.\n\nSin embargo, tras una solicitud de Ley de Libertad de Informaci\u00f3n y una investigaci\u00f3n de un a\u00f1o, CNN ha encontrado nueva informaci\u00f3n que puede arrojar dudas sobre esas garant\u00edas.\n\nEl gobierno estatal estaba agregando una sustancia a uno de los cuatro pozos de la ciudad, tratando de regular las bacterias de hierro naturales que pueden dejar manchas de color rojo o dep\u00f3sitos de \u00f3xido en el agua. La sustancia, conocida como HaloSan, no fue aprobada por la Agencia de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental de los Estados Unidos para desinfectar el agua potable.\n\nLEE: La contaminaci\u00f3n nos est\u00e1 volviendo tontos, dice un estudio\n\nEl alcalde de la ciudad dice que todos los pozos de la ciudad fluyen en un sistema que se distribuir\u00e1 por todo el lugar.\n\nLa Agencia de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental (EPA) y el estado de Carolina del Sur han confirmado a CNN que ahora hay una investigaci\u00f3n abierta sobre c\u00f3mo sucedi\u00f3 esto, aunque ninguna entidad comentar\u00eda sobre el objetivo de la investigaci\u00f3n o lo hallado.\n\nNo est\u00e1 claro cu\u00e1les podr\u00edan ser los efectos de HaloSan en las casi 3.000 personas que viven en esta comunidad rural muy unida, pero un grupo de aproximadamente 40 residentes cree que el agua es la culpable de las enfermedades que dicen que est\u00e1n sufriendo.\n\nEl producto qu\u00edmico se usa normalmente como desinfectante para piscinas y spas, pero varios expertos contactados por CNN dijeron que no pudieron encontrar otra instancia en la que se agreg\u00f3 a un sistema de agua potable.\n\nAlgo est\u00e1 claro: el estado de Carolina del Sur aprob\u00f3 su uso, y no deber\u00eda haberlo hecho.

"(CNN) The election overseer for a critical county in Florida confirmed to CNN on Sunday what observers in both parties had begun to predict: There is no way Palm Beach County's machine recount will be finished by the Thursday deadline.\n\n\"It's impossible,\" said Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher in response to CNN asking if officials would be able to finish the full recount on time.\n\nThe prediction came as a rare point of agreement between Democrats and Republicans in the state, who have engaged in a tense fight since Tuesday's election brought tight margins in statewide races.\n\nSarah Revell, the communications director for the Florida Department of State, told CNN's Ana Cabrera that if a county does not submit its results by deadline, \"then the results on file at that time take their place,\" she said.\n\nRevell added that Florida law does not give the secretary of state the authority to grant extensions.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

English Premier League with an emphatic 3-1 victory over Manchester United Sunday that emphasized the current gulf in class between the two city rivals.\n\nCity's victory was sealed by a memorable team goal from Ilkay Gundogan, the German finding the net after a 44-pass move to send his side two points clear in the standings ahead of Liverpool, which beat bottom club Fulham 2-0 earlier in the afternoon.\n\nDavid Silva opened the scoring for Manchester City in the Manchester derby with his third goal in three home games at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nDavid Silva, scoring for the third straight home match for City, put Pep Guardiola's team ahead in the 13th minute after it had dominated the early proceedings against a lackluster United visitor missing the injured Paul Pogba.\n\nGuardiola later said he was unhappy with his side -- \"the first half was not so good\" -- for failing to press home its advantage, but early in the second half came a second goal.\n\nA one-two between Riyad Mahrez and Sergio Aguero saw the Argentina striker produce a fierce shot that David de Gea could not keep out in the United goal.\n\nSergio Aguero blasts home Manchester City's second goal early in the second half under challenge from Victor Lindelof of Manchester United.", "(CNN) After months of negotiations, Qatar has delivered $15 million to Gaza, with the intention of paying salaries for Gaza's civil servants and easing the humanitarian situation.\n\nThe money, sent by cash in three large suitcases, was brought into Gaza through Israel on Thursday by Qatar's envoy to Gaza, Mohamed Al Emadi.\n\nPublic broadcaster Israel TV was the first to show a picture of the suitcases and a government source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the picture's authenticity.\n\nImages from Gaza over the weekend showed Palestinians civil servants lining up to receive the cash, with some people fanning $100 bills in their hands. Hamas ordered post offices to remain open on Friday and Saturday -- the normal weekend in Gaza -- to handle the cash disbursements, a Hamas spokesman told CNN.\n\nPalestinians gather to receive the cash that was brought into Gaza through Israel on Thursday by Qatar's envoy to Gaza.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday at a power plant in Gaza, Al Emadi said: \"The policy of the state of Qatar in support of the Palestinian cause during the past years leaves no room for doubt or explanation.\"\n\nThe cash transfer comes just a few weeks after Qatar began sending urgently needed fuel into Gaza to power the coastal enclave's power plant. The fuel supply increased the electricity in Gaza from about four hours a day to eight hours in an effort to alleviate the humanitarian crisis there.\n\nA spokesman for Hamas, Abdel Latif al-Qanua, told CNN on Sunday: \"These Qatari efforts that started months ago ended successfully in the past 48 hours.\"\n\nHe said the money would be used to pay for salaries, while also contributing to medical care of the wounded after often violent clashes along the Gaza border.\n\nNegotiations for the financial package to Gaza began months earlier, following the Palestinian Authority's decision to cut salaries of employees in Gaza last year, an Israeli government source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The sanctions against Gaza were an attempt to put economic pressure on Hamas to relinquish control of the coastal enclave to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn late June, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman met Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Cyprus to finalize the financial arrangement, according to Israeli news site Walla! News. Lieberman had been in Cyprus for a trilateral meeting with the Greek and Cypriot defense ministers.\n\nRight-wing Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who has been critical of any arrangement with Hamas, acknowledged the communications between Liebermann and al-Thani when he said on Israel Radio on Sunday that the two were at the \"height of their contacts\" in July.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Israel-Gaza crisis Israel-Gaza crisis \u2013 Palestinians in Gaza celebrate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday, August 26.

I think at this time, this is the right step.\"\n\nBennett denounced the transfer of millions to Gaza as \"protection money\" on Israel Radio.\n\n\"In the short term, you make the other side used to the fact that it can use violence to move its interests forward,\" he said.\n\nBennett has advocated a more hard-line approach toward Hamas, particularly since the start of weekly protests along the fence that separates Gaza and Israel. More than 200 Palestinians have been killed by gunfire since March. One Israeli soldier has been killed and hundreds of fires have been set in Israel by flaming kites and balloons launched from the coastal enclave.\n\nPalestine Liberation Organization officials also slammed the transfer of money, while Palestinian Authority officials reached out to the Qatari government to express their opposition, saying it encouraged division between Palestinian factions.\n\nAhmad Majdalani, a PLO Executive Committee member, said: \"Qatari finance of Hamas is a smugglers' and mafia method. Since when does Israel care about Hamas?\"\n\nMajdalani accused the United States of orchestrating the payment, adding that Hamas was working to be a part of the Trump administration's peace proposal. Both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have repeatedly rejected any proposal put forward by the United States.", "Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program \"The Dean Obeidallah Show\" and a columnist for The Daily Beast.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nFollowing a small firestorm last weekend -- when SNL's Pete Davidson mocked Republican Dan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL wounded in Afghanistan -- the two came together in a sincere plea for unity.\n\nSeeing these two join in a message of reconciliation was moving. But the question has to be asked: Can we, in the time of Donald Trump, find common ground between those who oppose him and those who support him? It's an issue that I and many others wrestle with.\n\n\"SNL\" offered us some guidance on how we might be able to achieve just that.\n\nThe controversy that led to Saturday's \"moment of Zen\" began last week when Davidson, during the Weekend Update segment, told jokes about several Republican candidates running for office.\n\n\"SNL\" mocking people in politics is what the show does best. But in this instance, Davidson, whose father was a firefighter killed on 9/11 , showed a picture of Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of his war injuries. Davidson joked, \"You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate for Texas and not a hit-man in a porno movie.\"\n\nThen he added a line that made it worse , saying \"I'm sorry. I know he lost his eye in war -- or whatever.\"\n\nWell, the backlash was swift , with many on social media going after Davidson -- and the National Republican Congressional Candidate even demanding an apology.\n\nCrenshaw, though, pushed back against the idea that an apology was necessary , stating, \"I want us to get away from this culture where we demand an apology every time someone misspeaks.\" He did note that veterans across the nation \"probably don't feel as though their wounds they received in battle should be the subject of a bad punchline.\"\n\nThat sentiment was a welcome breath of fresh air in a time when the slightest insult is met with instant outrage.\n\nBut Davidson still felt compelled to apologize , opening his appearance on Weekend Update this week with these words: \"I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It was a poor choice of words. The man is a war hero, and he deserves all the respect in the world.\" The comedian added, \"And if any good came of this, maybe it was that for one day, the left and the right finally came together to agree on something. That I'm a d---.\"\n\nAt that point, Crenshaw, who won his congressional race in Texas on Tuesday, made a surprise appearance where he accepted Davidson's apology and then delivered some good-natured jokes at Davidson's expense. One of the best was when Crenshaw joked about Davidson, \"He looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person.\"\n\nAfter a few more jokes, Crenshaw then delivered his own heartfelt plea, \"There's a lot of lessons to learn here. Not just that the left and right can still agree on some things. But also, this: Americans can forgive one another.\" Crenshaw went on to remind people of the sacrifice of our veterans and those \"we lost on 9/11, heroes like Pete's father.\"\n\nIt was a beautiful moment, unlike anything I can recall on \"SNL\" -- and I worked on the show's production staff for eight seasons.

Rather than trying to one up each other or score political points with their respective audiences, they made a sincere attempt to connect in a respectful and playful manner.

That is why we are today joining with a bipartisan group of more than 60 eminent American leaders to warn that the Hungarian government is about to hit another milestone in its move away from democracy -- by ejecting a leading university from its capital. And we are calling for a tough American response.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban, seems set on evicting from his country the renowned Central European University (CEU), a joint American and Hungarian institution of higher education. He has denied CEU the certification it needs to continue to operate and, unless the Hungarian government relents by December 1 , CEU will be forced to relocate to Vienna. While chances of a deal are slim, Michael Ignatieff, the president and Rector of CEU said , \"Even at this late hour, we are still seeking a solution that allows us to remain in Budapest...\"\n\nCEU was founded after the end of the Cold War, when Europeans and Americans came up with the idea for an \"international university that would help facilitate the transition from dictatorship to democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union,\" according to its website.\n\nAs a result, Central European University was established in 1991. CEU is based in both Budapest and in New York (at Bard College). From its inception, CEU served as an American-style university that helped us to build better bilateral ties based on shared values. It has granted degrees in history, philosophy, political science, business and law.\n\nNonetheless, Orban has lashed out at CEU for some time, launching a series of draconian measures that has finally culminated in the demand that the university leave the country. In April 2017, the Hungarian Parliament changed the Higher Education Law to drive CEU out. The law was dubbed \"Lex CEU\" by some because it was seen as a transparent effort to make CEU's operations illegal.\n\nIn September 2017, Hungary seemed to reach an agreement with New York State, where the university is registered, but after Orban's sweeping election victory the following spring, CEU was told not to expect a deal to be signed.\n\nOrban claims to be fed up with CEU's liberal ideology. He has been outspoken about his determination to tear down liberal democracy. \"The new state that we are building is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state,\" Orban said\n\nWe acknowledge that vibrant and sometimes raucous debates take place between liberals and conservatives over matters such as curricula and faculty hires. Yet higher education institutions of all stripes are part of a foundation essential to democracy.\n\nThere's more, though. It seems clear that Orban has also been motivated by the fact that his foil, George Soros, helped to found CEU. In seeking re-election last spring, Orban needed an enemy, and so he used Soros as his bogeyman in a campaign redolent of anti-Semitism . And after Orban won, he vowed \" moral, political and legal revenge .\"\" against his enemies, with Soros, who he sneeringly called \"Uncle George,\" and CEU prominent among them.\n\nTo its credit, the Trump administration has not gone along with this. It has followed its new policy of \"principled engagement\" by reaching out to Hungary as an ally, while signaling that CEU was an important priority . Ignatieff, in a press release, thanked the US Ambassador to Hungary David Cornstein as well as the Department of State, Congress, the Governor of New York, and the New York State Education Department for their vigorous efforts to secure an agreement certifying CEU for continued operation in Hungary. The #IStandWithCEU hashtag is even on the embassy website.\n\nStill, despite the fact that this is a priority for the US and the bilateral relationship, Orban seems determined to deal the final blow on December 1. If and when Hungary kicks out CEU, it would be a black eye for the administration, and a bewildering rebuke for America from a key Central European ally.\n\nThat is why as co-chairs of the bipartisan Transatlantic Democracy Working Group, we are joining with a bipartisan group to take a stand for CEU, academic freedom and, in a broader sense, for democracy. In our statement , we call for consequences for the bilateral relationship because of the failure to act in good faith with the United States to protect our joint interest in the CEU.\n\nWe commend the stance our government has taken so far. For the US government understands, as do we, that this is not only another tear in Hungary's democratic fabric. With CEU, Orban is banishing an institution with roots in the United States.\n\nWe believe the State Department and White House should publicly state that they are downgrading the level of meetings below the current level of regular access with Hungarian officials. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should hold off on meeting again with his Hungarian counterpart, as he did in May , until Hungary demonstrates reciprocal principled engagement. The Trump administration must also publicly censure Hungary for its attack on academic freedom -- the latest in a series of assaults by the Orban government on Hungary's democratic culture.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe also urge Congress to stop the fawning public appearances with Orban, exert oversight in holding hearings, passing resolutions and appropriating increased assistance to independent civil society and media in Hungary.\n\nWe do not propose any of this lightly. Hungary is a NATO ally. We believe, however, that the software of the alliance is as important as the hardware, and that if NATO is to sustain itself, it must remain a club of not only shared interests, but also of common democratic values.\n\nThe US has so far stood with Hungary as an ally while pressing Orban to do the right thing on CEU. In shuttering the university, Orban is defying our goodwill. We fear the government of Hungary would be taking another serious step toward democratic bankruptcy as well.", "Story highlights Lewis Hamilton wins Brazilian GP\n\nMercedes clinches constructors' title\n\nAngry Max Verstappen finishes second\n\n(CNN) Max Verstappen labeled Esteban Ocon an \"idiot\" and was accused of trying to punch the Frenchman in a post-race fracas after their collision cost him likely victory in Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix won by Lewis Hamilton.\n\nRed Bull's Dutch star had to settle for second place with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen third in a nail-biting finish at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo.\n\nVerstappen looked to have his second straight F1 victory secured when he overtook Hamilton on lap 39 of 71 and moved clear on fresher tires, but five laps later came the incident that was to change the course of the race.\n\nOvertaking Force India's backmarker Ocon, Verstappen was taken by surprise as the Frenchman tried to unlap himself -- causing the two collided and sending the leader spinning off.\n\nVerstappen responded with an expletive-ridden rant over race radio but then set about chasing down five-time champion Hamilton for the second time.\n\nLAP 43/71\n\n\n\nOCON HITS VERSTAPPEN! \ud83d\ude31\n\n\n\nEsteban tries to unlap himself on his former F3 rival but spins out the race leader in the process!

In increasingly safe Republican statewide strongholds like Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, the GOP was able to rely on its base to knock off Democrats in the Senate, and anti-immigrant ads may have helped. But the battlegrounds of the House are increasingly trending in the opposite direction.\n\nThe most competitive districts are growing more diverse. Candidates who might have won in the past by courting their base alone faced a changing electorate filled with voters who rejected this approach to immigration.\n\nVirginia offers two prime examples. Of the 300 largest counties in America, Virginia's Loudoun County saw the biggest increase in foreign-born residents between 2010 and 2016, adding more than 37,000 -- a 68% increase in just six years. More than 24% of all residents in the county are foreign-born, and many already are or will soon become voters.

Then it was a stately gesture to illustrate an alliance he's done little to cultivate. After a midterm election drubbing , it was an opportunity to retreat and regroup.\n\nYet by the time US President Donald Trump departed Orly Airport on Sunday, 44 hours after he arrived, the reasons for his trip to Paris had become largely obscured. It did less to bolster the transatlantic partnership than to expose its cracks . The 3,800 miles the President put between himself and Washington did little to buffer the boiling political crises back home\n\nAnd it was decidedly gloomier than the procession of tanks and troops Trump originally envisioned rolling through Washington on this date more than a year ago.\n\nOfficials scrambled to put something together and set a tentative date of November 11. But when estimates for Trump's military parade soared to nearly $100 million , officials realized they needed a backup plan to convince Trump a parade was too exorbitant. In the end, they persuaded him that dozens of other world leaders would be in Paris for the commemoration, and he needed to be, too.\n\nBut if Trump came to Paris expecting a parade that echoed the one he witnessed last summer, he was disappointed. The events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I were solemn and stately, and the wet streets of Paris were largely empty as the procession got underway Sunday.\n\nMissed moment?\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron on Trump cemetery controversy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron on Trump cemetery controversy 01:44\n\nAs early as Saturday afternoon, the reasons for Trump to be in Paris at all had become obscured. Homebound at the US ambassador's residence after foul weather forced the cancellation of a trip to an American burial ground, the President was invisible as his European counterparts memorialized the World War I slaughter across the former Western Front.\n\nThe White House declined to say how he spent the empty hours, though Trump tweeted in the evening he'd had \"some very productive meetings and calls for our country today.\"\n\nThe dire political predicament weighing on Trump cannot have been far from mind, despite the thousands of miles separating Paris and Washington.\n\nFresh off a midterm election that cost his party control of the House of Representatives, Trump kept an eye on his domestic difficulties while abroad. He accused election officials of rigging the vote in two US Senate races, repeated his claim that he does not personally know the man he tapped to become the acting attorney general and threatened to cut federal aid while blaming the deadly wildfires in California on \"poor\" forest management\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly visits the Aisne Marne American Cemetery near the Belleau Wood battleground, in Belleau, France, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori)\n\nOfficially, the reason for scrapping the journey to the Aisne-Marne American cemetery came down to safety: the President's Marine One helicopter cannot fly in low cloud cover, a decision that is made by military and security officials and not the President. But there did not appear to be a backup plan and the President did not make any statements of regret at not being able to visit the cemetery.\n\nLate Sunday, the White House defended the President's decision not to attend, citing concerns about disrupting traffic.\n\n\"A car ride of two-and-a-half hours, each way, would have required closures to substantial portions of the Paris roadways for the President's motorcade, on short notice,\" said press secretary Sarah Sanders. \"President Trump did not want to cause that kind of unexpected disruption to the city and its people.\"\n\nThe optics were undeniably bad, partly because the episode only appeared to confirm the suspicions of Trump's critics that he is uninterested in carrying out the traditional duties of the commander in chief. While reasonable-sounding to those familiar with presidential travel logistics, the White House's explanations for the cancellation appeared inauthentic to casual observers.\n\nWhite House officials were confident early Sunday that those criticisms would evaporate after the President's appearance at the Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial, where more than 1,500 American soldiers are buried. His remarks, they said, would be the highlight of the trip. Trump addressed the crowd mutedly for roughly 10 minutes before leaving for the airport.\n\nIf the weather imbroglio was concerning him, it did not show.\n\n\"You look so comfortable up there under shelter as we're getting drenched,\" he called out to a group of American veterans. \"You're very smart people.\"\n\nNationalism in the crosshairs\n\nEarlier Sunday, as world leaders gathered under misting rain at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Trump opted to head directly to the Arc de Triomphe, where the ceremony was being held. Driving down a deserted Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, a topless female protester breached the barricade lining the famous Parisian avenue and came within feet of the President's motorcade before she was apprehended by French security officials.\n\nThe dozens of other leaders who met at the French President's residence beforehand arrived in coach buses moments later, leaving Trump out of a striking scene as they marched down the street together with black umbrellas held over their heads, led by Macron. The White House said the President arrived separately because of \"security protocols.\"\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and flashed Trump a thumbs up before taking his place on the riser.\n\nThe imagery may have been rooted in logistics, but as France and its European partners fret about the alliance forged with the United States in bloody conflict a century ago, it mattered. Trump has shown little appetite for strengthening the relationships that have underpinned transatlantic relations since the end of World War I, instead lambasting traditional US partners on trade and the cost of security.\n\nHe's shown more affinity for strongmen leaders who have eroded democracy in their countries, like Putin, with whom he spoke at a lunch on Sunday, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who sat alongside him at dinner on Saturday.\n\nThat's left leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Macron, who put forth well-publicized displays of unity this weekend, to urgently warn of backsliding into history's darkest moments.\n\nJUST WATCHED Macron warns of the perils of nationalism Replay More Videos ...

With Trump -- a self-declared \"nationalist\" -- seated stone-faced in front of him, Macron delivered a stinging rebuke of the US President's \"America First\" agenda\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" Macron said. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying 'our interests first; who cares about the others?', we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great, and what makes it essential \u2014 its moral values.\"\n\nMacron later warned that \"the old demons\" have resurfaced, declaring that \"giving into the fascination for withdrawal, isolationism, violence and domination would be a grave error\" for which future generations would hold them accountable.", "Washington (CNN) White House aides face a complicated dynamic in managing the activities of the first lady and first daughter, The New York Times reported Sunday.\n\nThe challenge of managing that relationship -- and any potential issues -- has manifested itself in the two women's separate trips to Africa, according to the Times report\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump took her first solo international trip to Africa in October, visiting Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt in a week and touting her \"Be Best\" initiative.\n\nThe President's daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, is planning a trip to Africa in January, intent on highlighting her interest in economic empowerment, according to the Times.\n\nFor the first lady's trip to Africa, her office asked West Wing officials to allow her space to showcase the work she was doing, which included a photo of the first lady holding a child, two people briefed on the conversation told the Times.\n\nTwo days later, Ivanka Trump posted a video to Instagram of her trip to North Carolina after it was hit by Hurricane Michael, which ended with a similar visual of her holding a young child.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, who the Times reported was supposed to help manage the relationship between the two women's offices, was alerted about the video and later discussed it with Ivanka Trump's staff, the newspaper said, citing two people familiar with the talks.\n\nThe first lady and first daughter view their jobs differently and coexist with little overlap in their roles, according to the Times. They have rarely appeared together and have not hosted a joint initiative organized by their staffs since Melania Trump's move to Washington, the newspaper noted.\n\nThe two joined President Donald Trump on a trip to the Vatican to meet with the Pope, the President's first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia last year, and recently to visit the Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting last month.\n\nIvanka Trump's friends say she has \"noticeably bristled\" when posed questions she views as a first lady's responsibilities and has expressed that she's in the White House to tackle policy issues, the Times reported.\n\nA friend of Ivanka Trump told the Times that the first daughter was attempting to avoid stepping on the first lady's toes when she referred to certain duties as within the East Wing's realm.\n\nThe first lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, did not directly address the Trumps' relationship, telling the Times in a statement: \"The office of the first lady is focused on her initiatives and works independently, but we often collaborate on a variety of projects with the West Wing and have a very positive working relationship.\"\n\nA White House official who spoke to the Times only on the condition of anonymity said there is no tension between Melania and Ivanka Trump and that the two have a \"great relationship.\"\n\n\"As strong independent women, each has their own unique portfolio but they always support each another personally and professionally,\" the official told the newspaper.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Boca Juniors y River Plate empatan 2-2 en el primer partido, de dos que habr\u00e1, por la final de la Copa Libertadores 2018.

facility after Democrats raised concern about the uncounted votes.\n\nThe uncounted ballots have emerged as one of many battles over the fiercely contested Florida elections that moved this weekend into a recount phase.\n\nSuzy Trutie, a spokesperson for the county's supervisor of elections, told CNN there were 266 ballots in the shipment and that the votes will not be counted. Florida law requires all ballots sent by mail to arrive at the election facility by 7 p.m. on Election Day, and these ballots did not meet that standard, Trutie said.\n\nThe US Postal Service said in a statement on Friday that it was operating in \"close coordination and partnerships with election officials at the local, county and state levels.\" But as of Sunday morning, it still did not confirm ballots had not been provided in time to local election officials.\n\nBy law, all ballots for federal races must be kept by an elections board for up to 22 months after the election, which means the ballots will not be destroyed and could theoretically be brought into a potential court case.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 Un sismo de magnitud 4,0 sacudi\u00f3 la zona andina de Per\u00fa, en la ma\u00f1ana de este domingo, seg\u00fan reportes del Servicio Geol\u00f3gico de Estados Unidos (USGS, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).\n\nEl foco s\u00edsmico estuvo localizado a 47,5 kil\u00f3metros de profundidad y el epicentro estuvo ubicado a 3 kil\u00f3metros al noreste de Pisac, en la regi\u00f3n Cusco, al sur de Per\u00fa.\n\nEl movimiento tel\u00farico se sinti\u00f3 en Cusco, la capital de la regi\u00f3n del mismo nombre.

But it's also not relevant.\"\n\n\"People disagree on the Constitution,\" she said. \"That's why we have a US Circuit Court system and, indeed, a United States Supreme Court. They are there to interpret the law, and they disagree about the Constitution regularly.\"\n\nGeorge Conway, a Washington attorney and finalist for the role of solicitor general in the early days of the Trump administration, made his interpretation of the law clear on Thursday, a day after Trump's appointment of Whitaker , writing with Katyal: \"A principal officer must be confirmed by the Senate. And that has a very significant consequence today. It means that Mr. Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It's illegal.\"\n\nThey added, \"And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\"\n\nRead More", "\"This is going to happen again,\" he said. \"It's likely to happen again.

We have reached out to the White House and gotten no response.\"\n\nCNN previously said the move to bar Acosta \"was done in retaliation for his challenging questions.\"\n\nThe White House originally claimed that Acosta placed his hands on an intern who tried to take a microphone from him. Press secretary Sarah Sanders called it \"inappropriate behavior.\" The video showed otherwise. CNN called Sanders' explanation a lie.\n\n\"She provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened,\" the network said.\n\nAbrams, the attorney, on Sunday said if the White House claims that Acosta \"choked or touched this women \u2014 that's a very good reason\" to revoke his pass. But, \"it seems to be untrue,\" Abrams said.", "(CNN) North Korea has become a focal point of US foreign-policy discussions, but having been called a \"hermit kingdom,\" one suspects many Americans know relatively little about the reigning family's brutal history -- or how that came to be. Given that, National Geographic Channel's \"Inside North Korea's Dynasty\" feels like a timely public service, pulling back the curtain on \"the story of the Kims, a family of dictators.\"\n\nThe four-part documentary, scheduled over two Sunday nights, analyzes North Korea's \"strange psychology,\" rooted in the indignities suffered under Japanese occupation before the end of World War II. Part I is thus devoted to Kim Il Sung, a guerrilla fighter who came to power and solidified his hold over the country after Korea's arbitrary division along the 38th parallel.\n\nFilled with rich detail, the documentary features harrowing accounts from those who lived through those years, such as an interview with a commando who participated in a failed raid intended to kill the South Korean leader, which prompted the execution of the soldier's parents.\n\nThe narrative proceeds to the unexpected rise of son Kim Jong Il, initially seen as long shot to assume power. He's described as \"a spoiled rich kid, raised like a prince,\" who loved movies (including a particular fondness for James Bond films) and used propaganda as the means to become his father's heir. That includes an utterly bizarre interlude in the late 1970s when he kidnapped South Korean director Shin Sang-ok and his movie-star wife, Choi Eun-hee, who were forced to work in North Korea before the couple escaped.\n\nNot for the faint of heart, the special chronicles a series of horrors, including mass starvation, using executions to squelch labor unrest and the terrorist bombing of a South Korean airliner, as North Korea chafed at having been denied a chance to help host the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.\n\nRead More", "Shawn Turner is a Distinguished Terker Fellow at the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Despite all appearances leading up to last week's midterm elections, the Republican Party is not inherently racist. That will come as a surprise to many of my Democratic friends, and for good reason.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly disparaged and insulted people of color, even before taking office almost two years ago. From denigrating Judge Gonzalo Curiel , to asserting \"very fine people\" were among neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, to attacking the intellect of African-Americans, the President has embraced the power of racism.\n\nTrump's flirtations with open bigotry became more pronounced leading up to the midterms, as he rallied his base by proclaiming, to rousing applause, that he is a nationalist . He threatened to end birthright citizenship , and endorsed a campaign ad that paints Latinos as murderous criminals.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Republicans in elected office were unable or unwilling to mount any semblance of a full-throated condemnation of Trump's bigotry and race-based threats. On the campaign trail and in the press, they found refuge in suggesting that the President was misunderstood or that his comments should not be taken seriously\n\nWhen the pressure to rebuke the President intensified, some mustered the courage to admit they would not have chosen those words, or suggested that Trump was just trying to motivate his base.\n\nDespite the President's shameless efforts to turn racial animus into votes, and the cowardice demonstrated by Republican leaders, it would be wrong for Democrats to label the GOP as racist.\n\nThe mainstream Republican Party is, in fact, made up of decent, hardworking Americans who believe in a core set of conservative values. Those include strong national security, lower taxes, adherence to free market principles, and limited government. They want their rights under the Constitution protected, the rule of law upheld, and individual freedoms respected. And whether we share their worldview or not, these ideals form the foundation of their Americanism.\n\nConservatives who fit this description will tell you, with heartfelt sincerity, that their core values do not and will not ever include racial intolerance or bigotry. They believe that the legitimate principles of conservatism transcend race, ethnicity and gender and contribute to the prosperity of all Americans.\n\nNonetheless, many mainstream conservatives continue to be confounded by the GOP having a clear, discernible and persistent race problem.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, 84% of African-American voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 8% align themselves with Republicans. Among Hispanics, 63% affiliate more strongly with Democrats, compared to 28% who lean toward the GOP. The numbers are virtually identical for Asian-Americans, who prefer Democrats over Republicans 65% to 27%. Exit polls from the midterm elections also show people of color voted overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats.\n\nBut the numbers painted a drastically different picture when minorities were asked specific questions about their ideology, including how large government should be and how much businesses should be regulated. When the American National Election Studies used this approach in a 2012 survey , it found 47% of African-Americans identified as liberal, while about 45% identified as conservative.\n\nAs someone who grew up attending a largely black Southern Baptist Church, I saw firsthand how social conservatism was a core value -- while voting was about electing Democrats.\n\nInstead of questioning why people of color with conservative values vote for Democrats, Republicans should ask why so many people with white skin and racist values embrace the GOP.\n\nFor far too long, there has existed an uncomfortable relationship between the GOP and those who pander to intolerance , including the President himself.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut for all the decent, upstanding conservative Americans who reject racism and all it represents, it may be time to reconsider this unseemly union. I know it's not an easy sell, especially among politicians unwilling to leave votes on the table. They know that an outright and unequivocal rejection of all forms of bigotry, racism and intolerance would alienate a good number of voters.\n\nAs the 2020 presidential election season kicks into full gear, it's time for mainstream conservatives to stop wondering why people of color disproportionally vote for Democrats. The answer is clear. For many conservative minorities, they see no place for themselves in a political party that both tacitly accepts and openly disparages people of color. When this reality shifts, so will the racial makeup of the GOP.", "(CNN) The votes are in and the people have spoken.\n\nThe annual People's Choice Awards, which honor popular film, TV, music,

Chairman Graham?\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's closest allies in Congress may soon take over the critical Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is in line to wield the Judiciary gavel if the current chairman, Iowa's Chuck Grassley, decides to lead the Senate Finance Committee instead, CNN's Manu Raju reports.\n\n\"He's expressed concerns about the way the Russia investigation has been conducted, the way the Clinton email investigation was being conducted,\" Raju said. \"So we'll see if he brings a counterbalance to the House Judiciary Committee, which next year is going to be very aggressive in investigating the President.\"\n\nAs chairman, Graham would also help shepherd any possible Trump Supreme Court nomination -- and there may be a key difference between him and the President on that topic.\n\n\"He told me after the Kavanaugh confirmation that if there's a vacancy in 2020, he's reluctant to move forward with a nominee, to hold to the precedent\" that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell established in 2016 when he refused to consider the Merrick Garland nomination. \"We'll see if he ultimately stands by that, if it actually happens.\"\n\n2. Utah moves left\n\nUtah voters showed signs of a progressive streak on Election Day: Voters there approved referendums to expand Medicaid and to legalize medical marijuana.\n\n\"This is an extremely conservative state, one of the most conservative states in the country,\" the AP's Julie Pace said. \"But voters there still passed two ballot initiatives that tend to be favored by more liberal voters.\"\n\n\"This is really a fascinating example of two initiatives that were stalled by deeply conservative lawmakers in the state, and then it went to the voters, who ultimately pushed both of these issues over the finish line,\" Pace said.\n\n3. Pink wave on Capitol Hill\n\nAt least 102 women were elected to the House last week, smashing previous records. And Politico's Rachael Bade said it could have a very real impact in the halls of Congress.\n\n\"Many of them are young mothers,\" Bade said. \"They are putting nursing stations around the Capitol. They are talking about putting diaper-changing stations in lawmaker bathrooms. They're basically doing a reassessment to make sure it is a friendly work environment for mothers.\"\n\nAll those young mothers and millennial men entering Congress will have another impact too: They'll drag the average age of the next Congress down by a decade.\n\n4. Trump 2020 gears up\n\nThe midterms are over, but don't expect Trump to stay off the campaign trail for too long, reports The Washington Post's Josh Dawsey.\n\n\"They're already eyeing places to go in January, and they have $106 million or so in the bank,\" Dawsey said. \"The President was looking at his numbers in all these districts he was campaigning in, comparing them to 2016, trying to come up with a schedule for 2020 events that would benefit him.\"\n\n5. A 2020 GOP primary?\n\nAnd from CNN chief national correspondent John King:\n\nYou can get to 40 names, even more, if you jot down a list of Democrats who are going to spend time in the next weeks and months deciding whether they want to run for President and whether they could do what it takes to mount a credible effort.\n\nBut how many Republicans are having that same conversation?\n\nThe big 2018 midterm shifts do expose serious demographic issues for Trump and his party as we move from 2018 into the early days of the 2020 cycle. But for all the GOP's problems, base loyalty to the President is not among them -- so any potential GOP challenger understands it is the steepest of hills. At least based on everything we know today.\n\nSome Republicans say it is a fight that must be fought, regardless of the odds. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona is in this camp. He told Politico on Friday that he hasn't ruled out a 2020 challenge but said there are others who would be good candidates, too.\n\nOne of those he mentioned is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is the first potential Trump challenger due to pop up in one of the early states on the 2020 nomination map.\n\nKasich is due in New Hampshire on Thursday to speak at a dinner honoring the First Amendment and a free press. The irony there is obvious given Trump's constant attacks on the media.\n\nIn a brief conversation the other day, it was clear Kasich was reviewing the 2018 results in fine detail; he had informed observations about big shifts in the suburbs toward the Democrats and about deep-red areas dominated by working-class white voters.\n\nAs for the New Hampshire visit, Kasich says he is keeping a commitment made well in advance of the midterm vote and that it is far too early to talk definitively about 2020. But the visit will get him some attention and allow him to spend time with loyal veterans of his unsuccessful 2016 primary run to get a sense of the Granite State landscape now.", "\u064a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0635\u0639\u0648\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u0628\u062f\u0621 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645. \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631\u060c \u0644\u062a\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0636\u062e \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u062a\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0631. \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0646\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u0646 \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0643\u064a\u0641 \u064a\u062f\u0639\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u060c 11 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nUna estatua en bronce de un gato fue hallada entre 100 estatuas de madera\n\nLas tumbas con docenas de momias de gatos se remontan a las dinast\u00edas quinta y sexta\n\n(CNN) - En Egipto, un masivo cementerio de gatos y una colecci\u00f3n de escarabajos momificados fueron hallados durante una excavaci\u00f3n arqueol\u00f3gica en Saqqara, inform\u00f3 este el Ministerio de Antig\u00fcedades de dicho pa\u00eds.\n\nSe descubrieron siete tumbas durante la misi\u00f3n arqueol\u00f3gica, que comenz\u00f3 en abril.

El tuit de Donald Trump, presidente de Estados Unidos, culpando a la \"grosera mala gesti\u00f3n\" en los devastadores incendios forestales de California est\u00e1 provocando indignadas reacciones entre las principales asociaciones de bomberos, pol\u00edticos y celebridades.\n\nEn una serie de tuits este s\u00e1bado, Trump dijo que los mortales y potentes incendios forestales en California son el resultado de un manejo forestal \"deficiente\" y amenaz\u00f3 con recortar la ayuda federal.\n\n\"No hay ninguna raz\u00f3n para estos masivos incendios forestales, mortales y costosos en California, excepto que el manejo forestal es muy deficiente\", escribi\u00f3 Trump en Twitter. \"Cada a\u00f1o se dan miles de millones de d\u00f3lares, con tantas vidas perdidas, todo debido a la mala gesti\u00f3n de los bosques. \u00a1Ahora hay que remediarlo o no m\u00e1s pagos de la Reserva Federal!\", agreg\u00f3.\n\nThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nSu tuit provoc\u00f3 la ira de los l\u00edderes de las organizaciones de bomberos, que acusaron al presidente de llevar a la pol\u00edtica a una catastr\u00f3fica debacle.\n\nEl incendio conocido como Camp Fire, al norte de California, ha matado a 23 personas y ha quemado m\u00e1s de 42.490 hect\u00e1reas. El incendio de Woolsey cerca de Los \u00c1ngeles ha quemado m\u00e1s de 33.700 hect\u00e1reas y el incendio de Hill en el condado de Ventura m\u00e1s de 1833 hect\u00e1reas.\n\n\"Sus comentarios son imprudentes e insultantes para los bomberos y las personas afectadas\", dijo Harold Schaitberger, presidente de la Asociaci\u00f3n Internacional de Bomberos.\n\nEl presidente de Bomberos Profesionales de California dijo que el mensaje es un ataque a algunas de las personas que combaten los devastadores incendios.\n\n\"El mensaje del presidente que ataca a California y amenaza con retener la ayuda a las v\u00edctimas de los incendios catacl\u00edsmicos est\u00e1 mal informado, es inoportuno y degradante para los que sufren, as\u00ed como para los hombres y mujeres en las l\u00edneas del frente\", dijo Brian K. Rice. \"Desde mi punto de vista, este ataque vergonzoso en California es un ataque contra todos nuestros valientes hombres y mujeres en las l\u00edneas del frente\", agreg\u00f3.\n\n'Los incendios no respetan la pol\u00edtica'\n\nEl senador estatal Henry Stern, un dem\u00f3crata de Los \u00c1ngeles, dijo que los incendios no tienen que ver con la pol\u00edtica o las jurisdicciones.\n\n\"Sin embargo, los incendios no respetan la pol\u00edtica, por lo que le rogar\u00eda al presidente que busque una declaraci\u00f3n de desastre mayor y no haga de esto un incidente pol\u00edtico\", dijo Stern. \"Tenemos muchos partidos, muchos puntos de vista aqu\u00ed, y realmente no se trata de pol\u00edtica, se trata de personas\", indic\u00f3.\n\nVarias celebridades tambi\u00e9n respondieron al tuit de Donald Trump.\n\n\"Esta es una respuesta absolutamente cruel\", escribi\u00f3 la cantante Katy Perry. \"Ni siquiera hay pol\u00edtica involucrada.

But Amazon's eventual arrival in Northern Virginia and Queens has already sent shockwaves through two surrounding real estate markets.\n\nMara Gemond , a longtime Arlington, Virginia, realtor, never did much business in the dingy cluster of office buildings next to Reagan Airport known as National Landing (formerly Crystal City) \u2014 until news broke last week that Amazon would probably be splitting its 50,000-employee second headquarters between there and Long Island City in New York. (Amazon confirmed the location of HQ2 Tuesday.)\n\nAll of a sudden, the two-bedroom condo in a 1980s-era building that had been sitting on the market for nearly three months with no offers, even after a price cut, had a flood of interest. Gemond did eight showings in one day, for people who wouldn't tell her why they were interested \u2014 but who she suspects were either investors looking to flip the property or rent it out at an inflated rate, or people from companies planning to locate near Amazon if it moves in.\n\n\"It feels like that moment in a horse race where all the horses are lined up in the starting gate,\" says Gemond. \"They're just antsy and ready to get going, they're waiting for that gate to be lifted.\"\n\nIt's not just her. The real estate listing website Redfin found searches in the first six days of November grew 345% from the same period last year in National Landing and 659% in Long Island City.\n\nRead More",

Jerry Nadler told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nWhitaker, who was appointed last week by President Donald Trump after the President fired former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has come under attack by Democrats for his public criticisms of the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"Well, the questions we will ask him will be about his expressed hostility to the investigation,\" Nadler said. \"How he can possibly supervise it when he's expressed, when he's come out and said that the investigation is invalid.\"\n\nWhitaker, formerly Sessions' chief of staff, called Mueller's appointment \"ridiculous\" and \"a little fishy\" on a radio show in 2017 before his appointment to the Justice Department. In a CNN op-ed written last year , Whitaker also argued that Mueller is \"dangerously close to crossing\" a red line following reports that Mueller was looking into Trump's finances.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n(CNN) Four years ago, the world greeted the centennial of the start of World War I with idle curiosity \u2014 a bygone catastrophe from a time of dukes and empires, dangerous grudges and doomed alliances.\n\nOn Friday, an angry and rattled President Trump, who himself has upended international alliances and made friends with dictators, headed to France for a weekend of ceremonies and parades marking the Great War's end.\n\nHeads up, wrote CNN's Nic Robertson.\n\nAfter seeing his party lose the House in the midterm elections, Trump arrived for the peace commemoration \"having just opened new hostilities back home, where he threatened his adversaries -- should they not conform to his desires -- that he will take them down. \" World leaders stayed silent and wary. They \"have watched Trump's downward drift from the democratic principles they hold sacrosanct,\" he said, \"and have learned to adjust their measure of Trump.\"\n\nAs for the bromance between Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron, that's over, wrote. Trump trash-tweeted Macron upon arrival Friday and is skipping his Peace Forum. Macron, his popularity slipping, had a tricky task, Vinograd said. \"If Macron openly attacks nationalism, he knows that he'll also effectively be criticizing\" the American President.\n\nFrench activists planned to float the baby Trump blimp near the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nToday, \"with many right-wing leaders in Europe mimicking the tactics and rhetoric of the war's worst legacy -- dictators,\" she warned, the liberal world order needs to be on high alert.\n\n----------\n\nAliens?\n\nA photo illustration shows the first interstellar asteroid: `Oumuamua.\n\nDon Lincoln, a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, was skeptical. Just because we can't explain the object's gravity-defying speed doesn't mean there isn't a perfectly good reason for it, Lincoln wrote. He quoted the late astronomer Carl Sagan: \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\" What is hot-dog shaped, a half-mile long and hurtling strangely through space ? Is it -- an interstellar probe sent by aliens? A couple of well-regarded Harvard astronomers speculate about the mysterious object, called Oumuamua, in an upcoming paper., a senior scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, was skeptical. Just because we can't explain the object's gravity-defying speed doesn't mean there isn't a perfectly good reason for it, Lincoln wrote. He quoted the late astronomer Carl Sagan: \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"\n\n------------\n\nSessions sacked\n\nAnd what might Whitaker try to do? Look no further than an August 2017 opinion piece Whitaker himself wrote for CNN about special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Honig suggested. It's titled \"Mueller's investigation of Trump is going too far.'\"\n\nDavid Cole, national legal director of the ACLU, , national legal director of the ACLU, wants you to shed no tears for Sessions , who \"oversaw a Justice Department that systematically undermined civil liberties and civil rights.\" But in recusing himself from overseeing Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Cole wrote in the Washington Post, Sessions did the right thing by standing up to the President on the constitutional principle that \"no one is above the law.\" It cost him.\n\n----------\n\nMidterm wave came on slowly\n\nRainbow wave: Hajo de Reijger, The Netherlands\n\nShan Wu saw a \"cleansing\" David Gergen, and the heartening engagement of millennials, is all good news for democracy. It may not have been the tsunami that some were hoping for, butsaw a \"cleansing\" blue wave in Democrats' decisive recapturing of the House in the midterm elections, while Republicans tightened their grip on the Senate. A \"huge breakthrough made by women,\" marveled, and the heartening engagement of millennials, is all good news for democracy.\n\nVan Jones: \"the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the Deep South to the Midwest.\" Call it a \"rainbow wave,\" wrote: \"the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the Deep South to the Midwest.\"\n\nNayyera Haq.

But Democrats shouldn't overplay their hand , warned. Attempts to discredit Trump will \"instead arouse conservatives of all kinds, who understand the annihilating intent of liberalism better than the Democrats and commentators think.\"\n\nEdward McCaffery suggested, House Democrats should use their new power Rather than just subpoena Trump's tax returns,suggested, House Democrats should use their new power to propose a \"real, and fiscally responsible, middle-class tax cut -- one that gives real benefits to working Americans and is paid for by asking for some payments from the wealthiest, who can now, like Jared Kushner, avoid all taxes.\"\n\nVan Jones, \"that UN monitors would likely declare a stolen election if the contest were held in another country.\" Even at week's end, there was no closure on the midterms. The Senate and governor's races in Florida were headed for recounts. In Georgia, officials counted thousands of absentee ballots to determine whether Republican Brian Kemp's vote total in his contest with Democrat Stacey Abrams would stay over 50%; if it doesn't, the race would be headed for a runoff election. Kemp was dogged by accusations he suppressed the vote -- \"misconduct so brazen and unethical,\" wrote, \"that UN monitors would likely declare a stolen election if the contest were held in another country.\" Don't let him get away with it , he pleaded.\n\nTakeaways for 2020?\n\nJulian Zelizer. They should seek coalition candidates, look to the new Democratic governors to dismantle GOP-erected obstacles to minority voting, Robby Mook, who ran Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, \"The midterms have provided Democrats with a massive opening to take back the White House,\" wrote. They should seek coalition candidates, look to the new Democratic governors to dismantle GOP-erected obstacles to minority voting, and think purple -- don't sweat the unflippable red states. And, who ran Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, offered tips of his own for taking on the President . One of them: \"Your vision of change must be bigger than a rebuttal of Trump's latest tweet.\"\n\nSpanking is just a euphemism for 'hitting children'\n\nElizabeth Gershoff, a human development expert. \" It also doesn't accomplish what you think it's accomplishing, wrote, a human development expert. \" The more children are spanked , the more likely they are to be aggressive or to engage in delinquent behaviors like stealing.\" That is why the American Academy of Pediatrics published a statement Monday saying: Don't do it. Instead, says Gershoff, tell your child what you expect and praise good behavior.\n\nAlexa, was the Amazon HQ2 a hype?\n\nAmazon spent the last year making cities coast to coast jump through hoops for the (dubious, to some) honor of being chosen as the site of the company's second headquarters. This week both the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times reported the possible winners: Long Island City, Queens, and the Washington suburb of Crystal City. \"It's telling,\" writes Jill Filipovic, \"how quickly most of the potential locations in red states fell out of the running.\"\n\nThe hostility of conservatives to funding education and public transportation \u2014 both key to a young, techie workforce \u2014 was likely not lost on Amazon, she wrote: \"Liberal cities in liberal states had a built-in advantage.\" Bottom line: \"GOP claims of business-friendliness, and Amazon's own narrative of its progressive values\" don't scan.\n\nThousand Oaks massacre\n\nLZ Granderson. On Wednesday night an ex-Marine gunman shot dead 12 people at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, a town west of Los Angeles. \"If it's a mental health issue, \"There are no safe places, no safe days, no safe times,\" lamented. On Wednesday night an ex-Marine gunman shot dead 12 people at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, a town west of Los Angeles. \"If it's a mental health issue, do you think we'll address it? \" he asked. \"If it were about how he got or kept his gun, is there an obtainable solution readily available?\"\n\nAs the parent of a college-age son, when Granderson sees \"the pain and sense of helplessness of others during these tragedies, it registers.\"\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg, in the Washington Post, said she's had it with politicians who g, in the Washington Post, said she's had it with politicians who \"invoke the 'good guy with a gun\" as the solution to gun massacres. The truth is, cops are regularly killed as they rush in to stop mass shootings; in Thousand Oaks, it was Ron Helus, a sergeant in the Ventura County Sheriff's Office. Nevertheless, Hollywood has profited off the supercop image. \"They should be ashamed,\" she wrote. Cops know the difference between this \"fairy story\" and real life, she said. They want better gun laws.\n\nAnd finally, Freddie", "(CNN) Almost every subgroup of women in CNN's national exit polls moved towards the Democratic Party, including white women, Latinas, white college-educated women, white non-college-educated women, Democratic women and independent women. The only groups that are inconclusive or stayed the same on a national level were African-American women and Republican women.\n\nThis is the first time since 1984 that Democrats have won control of the House without winning men, and the largest margin for Democrats among women in exit polling history (which dates back to 1976 for the House).\n\nAll election cycle, journalists and pollsters alike have noted how pronounced the gender gap has become on the generic ballot. Days before the election, 62% of women likely voters nationally said in a CNN poll conducted by SSRS that they'd support the Democratic candidate compared to only 48% of men who said the same. Exit polls suggest the final vote will largely mirror that result, with 59% of women saying they supported the Democrat compared to 47% of men.\n\nWhile women have been steadily moving towards Democratic candidates, men have remained more the same, nationally. They did vote more Democratic in 2018 than in 2016, but around the same as they voted in 2012. Men may have moved towards Democrats in this election, but not in any amount we haven't seen before.\n\nWhite women have been getting more Democratic both on the national level and in most states polled since 2012 -- that includes Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Texas and West Virginia. In the 2012 presidential election, 56% of white women voted for the Republican Party nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 14 percentage points more than voted for President Barack Obama, according to CNN exit polls that year. In 2014, the same margin voted for a Democratic House candidate in the midterms. In 2016, 55% of white women voted for a Republican in the House election, a 12-point lead over Democrats.\n\nIn 2018, the same percentage of white women voted for a Democrat as voted Republican -- 49%. That's a drop from a 14-point lead for Republicans in 2012 to a net even currently among white women. This trend towards Democratic candidates among white women also occurred in key states where Democrats did not win statewide races on Election Day, like Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia. Several races, including Senate races in Arizona and Florida remain in question. As of this writing, the Democrat leads in Arizona and the Republican leads in Florida.\n\nWhite women still voted for the Republican more than for the Democrat in many key states, but less so than in recent elections. In Texas, 71% of white women voted for Republican John Cornyn over Democrat David Alameel for Senate in 2014 (a 44 percentage point difference). In 2016, more white women voted for President Donald Trump than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 37 percentage points.\n\nIn Texas' 2018 exit poll, 60% of white women voted for Republican incumbent Ted Cruz, only 21 percentage points more than voted for Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke. Though that is still a big Republican advantage, it has certainly shrunk -- from a 44-point lead in 2014 for Republicans to a 21-point lead in 2018.\n\nWhite men also voted slightly more Democratic than usual in 2018. But while white women went from 56% support for the GOP in 2014 to to 49% support for the GOP in 2018, white men shifted only four percentage points, from 64% in favor of the Republican candidate in 2014 to 60% support for the Republican candidate this year.\n\nWhite college-educated women, a more specific subgroup, have moved even more Democratic in every key battleground state polled (including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Texas) and nationally since 2014. In 2014, white college-educated women voted for the Republican candidate by four percentage points more than the Democratic candidate, and in 2016, they supported both candidates equally. But in 2018, 59% of white college-educated women voted for a Democratic candidate in the House, 20-points more than voted for the Republican.\n\nThe only state in which white women didn't stay the same or become more Democratic was Georgia, where white women have been moving towards Republicans since 2014 -- voting for Republican Nathan Deal by 41 percentage points over Democrat Jason Carter in the gubernatorial election. In the 2018 exit polls, 75% of white women voted for Republican Brian Kemp, 50 percentage points more than voted for Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nIn Georgia exit polls, 97% of African-American women voted for Abrams, a sizable increase from both the 2014 gubernatorial election in Georgia and the 2016 presidential election. In 2014, African-American women voted for the Democratic candidate for governor at 89% and 10% for the Republican candidate -- a 79-point advantage for Democrats. In 2018, among African-American women, Abrams, who would be the nation's first African-American woman governor, had a 95-point advantage.\n\nIndependent women is another subgroup in Georgia that has moved toward Democrats; they supported the Republican Deal in 2014 by 10 percentage points more than Carter compared to breaking for for Stacey Abrams at 53%, eight points more than voted for Kemp.\n\nNationally and in every key race state polled except Texas and Arizona, independent women have been moving towards Democrats (Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada). In 2012, when Democrat Charlie Crist and Republican Rick Scott were running against each other for Florida governor, independent women supported Crist by only two percentage points. In 2016, the Democratic advantage moved to seven points in the presidential race between Clinton and Trump. In 2018, 59% of independent women voted for Democrat Bill Nelson, 20 points more than those who voted for Republican Rick Scott. Scott leads in the race, but it appears to be headed for a recount.\n\nNationally, independent men are one of the few groups of men that appear to be moving more Democratic. Independent men voted Republican by 19 percentage points more than Democratic in 2014 and 12 points more in 2016. In 2018, independent men voted for the Democrat over the Republican by seven points, a 26 percentage point shift from 2014 to 2018 -- even larger than the 21 percentage point shift in that period among independent women.\n\nDemocratic women, most of whom voted with the base to begin with, did so slightly more nationally, and in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, and Nevada in 2018 than they did in 2016. Republican women haven't moved much in almost all states, except for Florida. In Florida, Republican women have moved ever-so-slightly towards the Democrats since 2014.\n\nWhat explains this shift is very much up for debate. There are likely many factors at play, possibly including the MeToo movement, Trump's combative rhetoric and the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is undeniable that a shift of women toward Democrats helped elect more women than ever before to Congress this year. Eighty-one percent of women who voted in 2018 said that it's important to elect more women to public office, even higher among women who voted for a Democratic candidate for the House (97%).\n\nWomen were also much more likely than men to use their vote for Congress to oppose Trump -- 43% of women said so compared to 31% of men. Trump isn't on the ballot this year, but many Americans still said their vote was in opposition or support of the President, and it was clearly of more importance to women than men.\n\nAnother big factor in women's vote was sexual harassment. Eight-seven percent of women said sexual harassment is an important problem in our country today while slightly fewer (80%) of men said the same.", "Thousands plan to march through the streets of Paris to protest President Trump as he visits the city to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.

Divided government: Wall Street initially celebrated after the midterm election delivered divided government. The Dow soared 545 points Wednesday after Democrats won control of the House from the Republicans.\n\nInvestors, always the cynical bunch, figure Washington won't be able to mess things up with disruptive legislation (like a minimum wage hike) or by repealing laws that the markets like (see: massive corporate tax cuts).\n\nVeteran traders even have a mantra for this thinking: gridlock is good. History generally backs it up. The stock market has performed just fine under a divided government. Recall that much of the bull market took place under President Barack Obama and a Republican-led Congress.\n\nBut Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, cautions that the S&P 500 has only gained an average of 3.5% in the 12 months after a midterm election that resulted in a split Congress with a Republican president. And more than a third of the time the market lost ground.\n\n\"Even though gridlock may be good, it ain't great, and investors would be wise to temper their enthusiasm for the year ahead,\" Stovall wrote in a report.\n\nThe Republican-led Senate and White House will need to reach agreements with Democrats leading the House on raising the debt ceiling and funding the government.", "Columbus, Ohio (CNN) \u2014 Military museums across the United States and around the world often offer visitors glimpses of world wars, commemorating the men and women who sacrificed their lives for their country.\n\nThe National Veterans Memorial and Museum has a broader goal: to represent veterans -- not just war.\n\nWar stories are present, of course, but they aren't primary. Instead, there's attention given to the decision to serve, training and boot camp, the sacred oath, deployment and personnel roles, separation from friends and family, survival, sacrifice and homecoming.\n\nColumbus, Ohio's capital and largest city, is the base for the new National Veterans Memorial and Museum. It's an $82 million project that started in 2012, and it first welcomed visitors on October 27, 2018, roughly two weeks before the Veterans Day holiday. (Veterans Day is November 11; in 2018, it will be observed on Monday, November 12).\n\nThe museum received a national designation from Congress and President Donald Trump earlier this year.\n\nMuseum participants, veterans whose stories are told through the various installations, and organizers believe that the narratives shared here haven't yet been told, not in this way, not this thoroughly.\n\nThank you for your service\n\nThe 53,000-square-foot facility sits along the Scioto River in downtown Columbus. The structure -- envisioned by the late John Glenn and created by architecture and design firm Allied Works -- includes an outdoor ceremonial space and rooftop sanctuary in the center of concentric concrete rings.\n\nThere's enough open, uncrowded indoor and outdoor space for events and gatherings and for moments of quiet, individual reflection.\n\nThe National Veterans Memorial and Museum got its national designation from Congress and President Donald Trump in 2018. Brad Feinknopf\n\nThe museum's installations indicate that it is neither a war memorial nor a military museum. It is a space dedicated to the stories and experiences of all veterans. Theodore Roosevelt, a war hero, is in the museum, right next to someone you can't find in a history book.\n\nAfrican American, Hispanic, Asian, men, women, poor, rich, famous politicians and virtually unknown people from every era -- from the Revolutionary War to the war in Afghanistan -- are represented and honored here.\n\nThough many civilians might find it challenging to draw similarities across these wide-ranging periods of history, the NVMM stitches these stories together through video interviews, audio recordings, touchscreens, handwritten letters and a time line.\n\nThe military may not be a taboo topic, but it also isn't the most accessible.\n\nThe exhibitions throughout the NVMM strive to not only honor veterans but also to educate civilians. Fewer men and women in service than ever before (less than 1% of the population, in fact) means fewer conversations about the military in general.\n\nWorld War II, for example, saw 16 million people serving. In 2018, there are less than three million members of the Department of Defense, which includes those on active duty, reserves and in personnel roles.\n\nThe museum hopes to educate and inspire young people in its honoring of veterans. Brad Feinknopf\n\nGuy Worley, president of Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, wants the museum to \"connect, inspire and educate\" young people. Because the majority of the population in the United States hasn't served in the military, Worley believes it's important to foster an understanding between the groups.\n\nThe late Sen. Glenn was instrumental in bringing the NVMM to fruition and ensuring its place in educating the nonveteran community about how and why we enjoy our freedoms.\n\nChoosing to serve\n\nBecause veterans' stories are complicated and nuanced, the museum takes visitors on a multileg journey. The intention is not to convince people to enlist but to educate them on what it means to serve and maybe even to inspire different acts of service.\n\nCol. Tom Moe, USAF retired, left behind a wife and 3-month-old daughter when he set off for Vietnam. Moe was a prisoner of war for more than five years, but his homecoming is as much a part of his journey as the torturous years he endured as a prisoner.\n\nHe's been involved in the NVMM from the beginning and believes it's essential for those who have no contact with the military to \"really understand the impact that veterans have on society, the positive impact.\"\n\nMoe's decision to enter the Air Force can be traced back to family members who fought in World War II. Moe says he wanted \"to try to do for the people in Vietnam what my dad and relatives had done to liberate Germany and Japan and so forth ... \"\n\nWhen Moe stands before a replica of his war trunk in the museum, he pauses before acknowledging the role his wife, Chris, a civilian, played in his service. It's one of many elements in the museum attempting to \"show the family side\" that he believes can help connect veterans and civilians.\n\nVisitors stopping at the war trunks can open the lid and hear both Col. Moe and Chris, his wife of 53 years, speaking. Photographs of the couple through the years string together a cohesive narrative.\n\nThe history of the military is featured in a timeline installation that sits opposite interactive features. Brad Feinknopf\n\nEvery role counts\n\nJaspen Boothe, a disabled Army veteran who served for 17 years, first as an 88 Mike (or truck driver), and then as a human resources officer in the ROTC (a college program that prepares young adults for the military), says she was surprised to be asked to be a part of the museum's creation.\n\n\"Why do you want to interview me? Why do you want me to be a part of it?\" she wondered.\n\nNot having deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan, Boothe says she didn't hold what many consider a \"sexy\" military job.\n\nIt was just a few weeks ago that Boothe was reminded of this yet again. On a recent flight, Boothe's veteran hat prompted the man sitting next to her to inquire about her status. When she told him what she did, Boothe says the conversation abruptly stopped -- the man had no interest in hearing about her desk job.\n\nIt was a cancer diagnosis that kept Boothe behind a desk and not in the field, but she doesn't view her role as one of diminished importance and doesn't think anyone else should either.\n\nAfter the NVMM made its intentions clear -- to be a museum depicting the total military experience for anyone of any role, gender, rank and era -- Boothe was on board.\n\n\"I think that everyone who's worn the uniform has a story, and it's important that all those stories are told,\" Boothe says.\n\nFor her, the decision to serve her country had a lot to do with honor, a word that deserves to be spoken with care. Boothe believed that if she pursued the \"challenging and honorable\" profession, proving wrong the single mom stereotype, her son would \"know that he could accomplish anything that he wanted to as well as long as he was dedicated and disciplined to the task.\"\n\nThe museum strives to tell the whole veteran story \u2014 not just one of war. Brad Feinknopf\n\n'We're all green here'\n\nJason Dominguez, who served in the Marines and deployed to Iraq, has also been an active participant in the museum since its inception. Like Moe, Dominguez was inspired by the people who came before him. As far back as he can remember, he wanted to serve his country.\n\nWhat he found in the Marine Corps was a diverse group of people from various backgrounds and circumstances who shared at least one thing in common: the decision to serve.\n\n\"We're all green here. We're all green,\" Dominguez says, thinking back to his early days in the Marines, where all the \"colors of the rainbow\" existed together. In spite of these outward differences, Dominguez says the only thing that mattered was that they were in it together, solving problems and overcoming challenges.\n\nSimilarly, tangible items such as real war packs, uniforms and personnel trunks, may appear different from the outside, but they're more alike than different. Museum visitors can try on pieces of the various military uniforms and pick up the heavy military packs carried by soldiers as they take notice of themselves in the full-length mirror that is also a part of this intimate interactive.\n\nAs Dominguez and his wife, Raven, walk through the museum, she expresses surprise as she comes across a Civil War sack. \"That's crazy,\" she exclaims wide-eyed.\n\nDominguez stops at the footlocker exhibit. \"I love seeing footlockers from the different eras,\" he says pointing to Iraq's plastic locker and another sturdier one from the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Honey, I miss you. How are the kids? Can't wait to come home. The food stinks. I'm cold, send me more socks.\" Relatable thoughts, needs and wants. Veterans can empathize, and civilians can sympathize.\n\nRelated content Veterans Day Fast Facts\n\nTaking the Oath\n\nVisitors can linger on the historic time line to the left as they make their way around the circular museum space, or they can take their time with the many interactive components on the right, closer to the periphery of the space.\n\nThis is where the Taking the Oath section lives.\n\nDominguez remembers taking the oath. He likens it to getting married.\n\n\"You're making a commitment to something that's bigger than yourself,\" he says, adding that \"there are many who are born under our flag, but there are a few who actually choose to become a part of it.\"\n\nComing home\n\nInstead of displaying stories of war and commemorating the men and women who fought and stopping there, the NVMM continues the narrative. What was it like for soldiers to return home after the fight? What do those reunions look like?\n\nMoe's homecoming, for example, meant, in part, reintroducing himself to his daughter. It meant returning to Chris, who'd been responsible for raising their daughter for years by herself.\n\nAbout that return: Moe never faltered in his belief that it would happen.\n\n\"I never had any doubts that I would come home,\" Moe says, growing emotional when he talks about friends who weren't as fortunate. To him, the museum memorializes the fallen, the men and women who died for their country.\n\nThese losses are the most meaningful piece of Moe's service. Not his survival as a POW, not his resilience in the face of a complicated and emotional time in the US. Not his work post-service for Notre Dame's ROTC program. No, it's the men and women he lost. The lives America lost.\n\nRelated content What D-Day means in the age of Trump\n\nBoothe's experience differs from Moe's, and yet it too, like so many individual pieces of the veteran experience, shares a common denominator: compassion.\n\nThe founder of Final Salute , an organization dedicated to providing safe and suitable housing to homeless women veterans and their children, Boothe saw firsthand the lack of supportive services available to women veterans and decided to do something about it.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

last as they took the overall team title before clinching the 16th and final leg of the individual LGCT at the Al Shaqab Equestrian Facility in Doha on Saturday.\n\n\"Just can't quite take it in to be honest,\" Maher told LGCT television after racing to his fourth individual win of the season in a nine-horse jump-off in 35.50 seconds.\n\n\"Everytime I go on him, he fills you with so much confidence that you can do anything,\" said Maher, who also won in Madrid, Saint Tropez and Rome. \"He believes in me, and I believe in him. And he makes things that should be impossible, possible.\"\n\nRead More", "(CNN) As the death toll from wildfires ravaging both ends of California climbed on Sunday, powerful winds swept through the state, stretching firefighting resources to the limit.\n\nAt least 31 people have died in the fires: 29 in Northern California's Camp fire and two in Southern California's Woolsey fire.\n\nThe Camp fire -- the most destructive fire in state history and one of the deadliest -- virtually burned the town of Paradise to the ground, destroying thousands of homes and structures.\n\nThere are 228 people still unaccounted for as a result of the blaze, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea told reporters Sunday evening.\n\nThe Woolsey fire continues to be a major blaze, displacing hundreds of thousands of residents as it moves east, including several celebrities. Firefighters on Sunday managed to contain flareups generated by high winds in Los Angeles County. But officials warned that the dry conditions feeding the fire are expected to continue into the week.\n\n\"This is not the new normal, this is the new abnormal,\" Gov. Jerry Brown said of the role of climate change. \"The chickens are coming home to roost, this is real here.\"\n\nThe toll\n\nHere's the latest on the fires:\n\n\u2022 Camp Fire: The largest of the trio, the Camp Fire has burned 111,000 acres across Northern California and is 25% contained as of Sunday morning, according to Cal Fire. It's destroyed an estimated 6,700 buildings, most of which were homes.\n\n\u2022 Woolsey and Hill fires: In Southern California, the Woolsey fire had spread to 85,500 acres and was 15% contained Sunday night, up from 5% the night before. The smaller Hill Fire covered 4,531 acres and was 75% contained. Together, responsible for the destruction of 179 structures, but another 57,000 are threatened, according to fire officials.\n\n\u2022 Massive evacuations: More than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide. The majority of those residents are in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nWinds, climate change provoking fires\n\nFirefighters made headway in containing the fires Saturday, but the return of powerful winds a day later threatened that progress, especially for the Woolsey fire. Officials warned gusts would peak at around 40 mph.\n\n\"Sadly, with these winds, it's not over yet,\" Scott Jalbert, chief of Cal Fire's San Luis Obispo Unit, said Sunday morning.\n\nCelebrities Neil Young, Robin Thicke and Gerard Butler were among those who lost their homes. Butler posted a photo on Twitter of the charred remains of a home and thanked firefighters for their courage. Thicke also posted a statement on Instagram thanking firefighters and volunteers who \"risked their lives trying to save our home.\"\n\nReturned to my house in Malibu after evacuating. Heartbreaking time across California. Inspired as ever by the courage, spirit and sacrifice of firefighters. Thank you @LAFD. If you can, support these brave men and women at https://t.co/ei7c7F7cZx. pic.twitter.com/AcBcLtKmDU \u2014 Gerard Butler (@GerardButler) November 11, 2018\n\nIn a post on his official website decrying the impact of climate change, Young said \"I have lost my home before to a California wildfire, now another.\"\n\nResources, including dozens of fire trucks and thousands of firefighters, are pouring in from out of state.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

Hide Caption 93 of 93\n\nFirefighters on Sunday contained significant flare-ups in wind-prone canyons along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and Bell Canyon in Ventura County, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. Conditions are expected to persist overnight and Monday, threatening new flare-ups that could reach beyond containment lines, Osby said.\n\nHe urged those in mandatory evacuation zones to leave, warning that they can get in the way of firefighting efforts\n\n\"We must remain vigilant and not let our guard down,\" Osby said.\n\nOsby and other officials echoed Brown's sentiments about the threat of climate change.\n\nThe southern part of the state used to be able to rely on help from their counterparts up north around this time of the year, Osby said, when the threat of fire was much less prevalent in those communities. But that's no longer the case.\n\n\"And as evident by the Camp Fire in Northern California -- which is larger than this, more structures have been lost than this, more lives have been lost -- it's evident from that situation statewide that we're in climate change and it's going to be here for the foreseeable future,\" Osby said.\n\nThough the state's drought has eased slightly, it's still abnormally dry, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward . That leaves a lot of dry vegetation to feed fires.\n\nCrews searching for the dead\n\nCrews on the scene of both fires are combing through blackened ruins of homes. The number of dead more than doubled late Saturday, and continued to rise on Sunday.\n\nSo far, 29 bodies have been recovered in or near Paradise, a town of about 26,000 that's been all but leveled by the Camp fire. Of the six discovered Sunday, five were in homes and one was in a vehicle.\n\nOn Sunday, officials confirmed that two deaths in Malibu were related to the Woolsey Fire, bringing the statewide death toll to 31.\n\nSheriff deputies walk through a neighborhood destroyed by the Camp Fire on November 10, 2018 near Paradise, California.\n\nThe painstaking process of finding the missing and identifying the dead is challenging, with some of the bodies recovered burned beyond recognition.\n\n\"In some cases, the only remains we are able to recover are bones or bone fragments,\" Honea, the Butte County sheriff and coroner, told reporters. \"I know that members of the community who are missing loved ones are anxious, and I know that the news of us recovering bodies has to be disconcerting.\"\n\nMany bodies recovered from the Camp Fire were found inside or near homes or in vehicles, officials said.\n\nYuba County Sheriff officers carry a body away from a burned residence in Paradise, California, on November 10, 2018.\n\nHours after the fire broke out, residents fleeing Paradise became trapped in gridlock traffic as the fire closed in. Some drivers abandoned their vehicles in the chaos and attempted to escape on foot.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

of the rust-colored water coming from their taps. They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled. But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment.", "\u0639\u0627\u0635\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0637\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062f\u062f\u064a, \u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0645\u0639 \u0633\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u062a\u0631\u0646\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u062a\u0632\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0648\u062a\u064a\u0631\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062e\u0637\u0637 \u0644\u0637\u0631\u062d 5G \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 2019 \u060c \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0644\u0644\u0643\u0648\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u062a\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0636\u0648\u0646 \u062b\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0642\u0637, \u062a\u062d\u062a\u0636\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0643\u0646\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062c\u064a\u0627 \u0628\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0623\u064a \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u062e\u0631.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u060c 11 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u064a\u0631\u0646\u0631\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0645 \u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0641\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b\u064b\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0629, \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u062e\u0628\u0623 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0645\u062f\u0629 30 \u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u060c \u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645 \u0644\u0645\u062d\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0648\u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0627.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f \u060c 11 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) Australian police say they have arrested a woman in connection with an investigation into needles found in supermarket strawberries earlier this year.\n\nA 50-year-old woman was arrested Sunday after a \"complex investigation\" into the alleged contamination of strawberries in Queensland, the Queensland Police Service said in a statement.\n\nShe is expected to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday.\n\nThe arrest follows at least 100 reported cases of sewing needles or pins found in fruit across the country.\n\nThe needles were found in strawberries in all six Australian states and in at least six different brands.

It's been fueled by Trump himself, who has proudly identified himself as a nationalist as he advances an \"America First\" agenda.\n\nIn his address, French President Emmanuel Macron -- who has emerged as Europe's most vocal sentry against a global tide of nationalism -- repeated his warnings.\n\n\"Patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism,\" he said through a translator. \"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\n\"I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death,\" he said. \"History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"\n\nIt was impossible to view his remarks as anything less than a rebuke of Trump, who has proudly espoused an \"America First\" foreign policy. Speaking later at an American cemetery in Paris, Trump did not directly respond, choosing instead to stick to a brief speech honoring the war dead.\n\n\"Each of these marble crosses and Stars of David marks the life of an American warrior -- great, great warriors they are -- who gave everything for family, country, God and freedom,\" Trump said in the 10-minute speech, which was the centerpiece of his visit to Paris for the armistice centenary.\n\nTrump arrived separately from other foreign leaders to Sunday's armistice centenary ceremonies, which occurred under gray skies and cold drizzle. His counterparts, including Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, convened at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace before traveling together in motor coaches to the Arc de Triomphe. They walked in a large group to the event site under black umbrellas.\n\nInstead, Trump pulled up in his own vehicle and walked in separately, due to \"security protocols,\" according to the White House. A topless protester breached a police barricade and ran toward Trump's motorcade before being apprehended. Russian President Vladimir Putin also arrived separately and walked in solo, flashing Trump a brief thumbs-up as he took his place among the leaders.\n\nThe ceremony in Paris was the largest of events across Europe and in the United States commemorating the armistice . Queen Elizabeth II led members of the royal family -- including William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- at the Cenotaph in central London for a solemn ceremony.\n\nIn Washington, the role traditionally played by the President at Arlington National Cemetery was assumed this year by Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie who placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\nThe armistice that took effect at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 ended what was then the war meant to end all wars. When conflict broke out on the continent two decades later, the United States was again pulled into bloody battle, cementing its role in maintaining European security.\n\nVisiting Paris this week, Trump has bemoaned the cost to the US of helping maintain European security, insisting countries here do more to protect themselves. The cost of securing Europe is a reliable b\u00eate noire for Trump, one he's railed against on the campaign trail and in meetings with his counterparts.\n\nHis actions have raised questions about the state of longstanding US relationships.\n\nThe man who was once his top European partner, Macron, now appears to have become just another world leader subject to ill-timed insults and jabs. Trump's other counterparts -- British Prime Minister Theresa May and Germany's Merkel -- have also been subject to ridicule.\n\nTrump did not appear overly eager on Saturday to dispel the notion he is uninterested in bettering US-Europe ties. During a morning meeting with Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, the effusive expressions of bonhomie that once colored the two men's relationship were gone, replaced by wooden expressions of cooperation.\n\nLater, the President canceled a planned visit to an American cemetery 50 miles outside of Paris. The White House cited the rain, which sometimes grounds the President's Marine One helicopter.\n\nHe remained out of view for most of the afternoon, even as fellow leaders -- including Macron, May, Merkel and Trudeau -- fanned out across the French countryside to mark the solemn anniversary at hallowed locations along the former Western Front.\n\nOn Sunday, the President to make up for the cancellation, which drew criticism and accusations he was ignoring the sacrifice of American military personnel who died in World War I.\n\nFollowing the ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe -- which featured a review of troops, musical performances and Macron's address -- Trump attended a lunch for all the world leaders.\n\nAfterward he traveled the short distance to Suresnes American Cemetery, perched on Mont Val\u00e9rien with a panoramic view of the French capital.\n\n\"Through rain, hail, snow, mud, poisonous gas, bullets and more, they held the line and pushed onward to victory,\" Trump said of the soldiers who died for the allied cause a century ago. \"A great, great victory. A costly victory but a great victory.\"\n\nTrump was due back in Washington by Sunday evening.\n\nThe visit to Paris came about after Trump scrubbed plans for a military parade in Washington, deeming the $90 million price tag too steep . He originally devised the parade having been inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in Paris last year, which featured tanks, troops in formation and aircraft flyovers.\n\nSunday's ceremony occurred in the same vicinity but wasn't be as overly militaristic; it was intended to commemorate the end of war and not the practice of it.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

year on November 11, Americans honor the 19.6 million active and former US service members who have gone to war.\n\nHere are ways to go beyond saying \"thanks for your service\" and truly make a difference in a veteran's life -- on this day and throughout the year.\n\nVolunteer\n\nThis online tool identifies volunteer opportunities at local VA offices. You can also join the Volunteer Transportation Network to help veterans get to appointments at VA medical facilities. You can also find ways to help veterans and their families on VolunteerMatch\n\nSend a care package or a letter\n\nOperation Gratitude has sent more than 2 million individually addressed care package to the military community. The packages go to current military members as well as veterans, wounded warriors and their caregivers. As more American troops return to civilian life, the Operation Gratitude veterans program has been growing. It also has a letter writing campaign encouraging everyone to write handwritten letters of gratitude to veterans.\n\nSupport veterans suffering from PTSD\n\nCoping with post-traumatic stress disorder can put stress on not just veterans but also their families and friends. More than a third of all Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have or will experience PTSD. And veterans of past wars are still dealing with the ghosts of their time in the service.\n\nIf you know a veteran who might be dealing with PTSD, you can connect them with helpful resources. The VA offers the PTSD Coach Online to help veterans learn to manage symptoms, come up with ways to cope and find professional help. The National Center for PTSD provides a Veterans Crisis Line by phone at 1-800-273-8255, by text at 838255 and by online chat at this link: Confidential Veterans Chat\n\nSponsor a service dog\n\nService dogs can help veterans living with PTSD and other disabilities regain control, independence and mobility. Freedom Service Dogs of America match highly specialized service dogs with service members needing assistance in their transition back to civilian life.\n\nPuppies Behind Bars is a program in which prisoners train companion dogs for veterans with PTSD. Donors can sponsor a dog and receive updates on the dog's training and life with its veteran.\n\nDonate travel points\n\nThe Fisher House operates the Hero Miles Program , using donated frequent flier miles to bring family members to the bedside of injured service members. Hotel points can also be donated to provide hotel rooms for families of the veterans when a Fisher House is not available. The Fisher House Foundation has a network of homes on the grounds of military and VA hospitals around the country. These homes help family members be close during the hospitalization of a loved one for a combat injury, illness or disease.\n\nHelp veterans on the streets\n\nA phone call can also make difference in the life of a veteran who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Call 877-4AID-VET, or 877-424-3838, to connect with help at the VA. This service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs' Stand Down program is designed to help homeless veterans \"combat\" life on the streets. Stand Downs are usually one- to three-day events that provide food, shelter, clothing and health screenings to homeless and unemployed veterans. To find a Stand Down program in your community, contact your local VA hospital\n\nBuild a home for severely injured vets\n\nSeverely injured veterans often come home needing a place to live that better accommodates their physical disabilities. Building Homes for Heroes builds specially modified homes for veterans that help them live independently. These homes are provided at no cost to the veterans. The organization also provides financial planning services.\n\nHonor the greatest generation\n\nThe Honor Flight Network helps veterans of the \"greatest generation\" make a free pilgrimage to the World War II Memorial on the National Mall in Washington. You can volunteer to escort these men and women on the flight to see this memorial. Honor Flight also helps terminally ill veterans who served in any conflict visit memorials to those wars in Washington as well.\n\nShare their stories\n\nSo many veterans' stories have been left untold, but the Library of Congress is collecting the tales from veterans of every war through the Veterans History Project . If you are related to a veteran or know one who has a story to tell, the Library of Congress wants to hear it. Help veterans share their stories before it's too late.\n\nLet them know they matter\n\nBy telling a veteran how much you appreciate their service, you are letting them know their decision to serve our country makes a difference. It's a simple gesture, but it can make an impact. And so many veterans have never heard the words \"thank you.\" If you know a veteran or see someone in a military uniform, say something. It may make his or her day and yours.\n\nBethany Hines contributed to this report.", "(CNN) President Donald Trump's tweet blaming \"gross mismanagement\" for the devastating California wildfires is sparking a backlash from top firefighters' associations, politicians and celebrities.\n\nIn a series of tweets Saturday, Trump said the state's deadly wildfires are a result of poor forest management and threatened to cut federal aid.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" Trump tweeted. \"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

The Woolsey Fire near Los Angeles has killed at least two and has scorched 83,275 acres. The Hill fire in Ventura County has ravaged 4,531 acres.\n\n\"His comments are reckless and insulting to the firefighters and people being affected,\" said Harold Schaitberger, president of the International Association of Fire Fighters.\n\nThe president of the California Professional Firefighters said the message is an attack on some of the people fighting the devastating fires.\n\n\"The President's message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines,\" Brian K. Rice said.\n\n\"In my view, this shameful attack on California is an attack on all our courageous men and women on the front lines.\"\n\nRice also said Trump's assertion that California's forest management policies are to blame \"is dangerously wrong.\"\n\n\"Wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation, high winds, low humidity and geography,\" he said.\n\n'Fires do not respect politics'\n\nState Sen. Henry Stern, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said fires aren't about politics or jurisdictions.\n\n\"Fires do not respect politics, though, so I would beg the President to pursue a major disaster declaration and not make this a political incident,\" Stern said. \"We have many parties, many views out here, and it's really not about politics, it is about people.\"\n\nA number of celebrities also responded to Trump's tweet Saturday.\n\n\"This is an absolutely heartless response,\" singer Katy Perry tweeted. \"There aren't even politics involved.

After a slight hesitation, Crenshaw played along.\n\n\"This is Pete Davidson. He looks like if the meth from 'Breaking Bad' was a person,\" he said. He then said that Davidson looked like a \"Troll doll with a tapeworm.\"\n\nBut away from the laughs, Crenshaw used the opportunity as a teaching moment.\n\n\"There's a lot of lessons to learn here,\" he began. \"Not just that the left and the right can still agree on some things, but that also that Americans can forgive one another.

Over the coming weeks we will be profiling the four finalists for the 2018 award.\n\nTasked with designing a music school in Tokyo, architect Tomohiko Yamanashi sat down with tutors and students to determine what they wanted from their new campus. He found that their priorities -- sunlight, natural ventilation and visually open practice spaces -- were completely at odds with how most music institutes are designed.\n\n\"Usually, architects put a central corridor in the building, dividing both sides into same-sized lesson rooms,\" he said in a phone interview. \"As a result, the atmosphere of the building is very similar to that of a prison.\"\n\nSo Yamanashi, who works at the Japanese architecture firm Nikken Sekkei, decided to entirely defy expectations of what a music school should look like.\n\nThe Toho Gakuen School of Music, in suburban Tokyo. Credit: Nikken Sekkei\n\nHis design's boxy concrete exterior is softened by glass-walled practice spaces and generous use of wood. Instead of linearly-arranged, isolated rooms, the architect opted for what he called a \"porous\" layout -- one that that encourages sound, light and people to flow freely throughout.\n\nThis unconventional approach appears to be vindicated: The Toho Gakuen School of Music was last month named among four finalists in the RIBA International Prize, a biennial award honoring the world's best new buildings.\n\nCreating atmosphere\n\nThe orthodoxy of music school architecture emerged, in part, from rational design concerns: A desire to sound-proof practice rooms often results in thick walls and the sacrifice of natural light.\n\nBut Yamanashi believes that having sound escape is not only bearable -- it's desirable.\n\n\"Architects worry too much about acoustics,\" he said. \"If you walk around the corridors and there is no sound leaking from the lesson rooms -- I hate that kind of image. Sound leaking from room to room is a very big problem, but sound leaking out to the corridor is actually very important for creating atmosphere.\"\n\nThe glass-walled practice rooms increase natural light and encourage eye-contact between musicians. Credit: Nikken Sekkei\n\nAcoustic engineering nonetheless played its part. The 62,000-square-foot school is fitted with ceiling panels and timber cladding that prevents \"flutter\" echoes (which occur when noise bounces between two reflective surfaces).\n\nYamanashi also adjusted the size and proportions of each practice room to match the needs of specific instruments, from large rooms for drums to the intimate settings preferred by the school's violin tutors.\n\nDiscovering Japan's remote 'art island'\n\nThe use of glass walls, rather than concrete ones, allows the sound of music to float through the school's public spaces. But the layout ensures that practice spaces never touch, ensuring they remain insulated from one another.\n\nAnother consequence of clear walls is that students can -- unusually, for a music school -- see one another practicing. This too has its benefits for students, Yamanashi said.\n\nNatural light enters the basement floor via sunken gardens. Credit: Nikken Sekkei\n\n\"When you play in an orchestra, the most important thing is eye contact between the musicians. But usually, if you're in a prison-like space, there's no eye contact between the players. I wanted to make some kind of transparency.\n\n\"Students have to spend such a long time in the lesson rooms,\" he added. \"If we can give them some kind of vista or spacious atmosphere, it helps them relax.\n\nTextural considerations\n\nThe school's unconventional layout is reflected in its bold, pixelated exterior. Just like its floor plan, the building's concrete facade comprises a collection of interlocking squares and rectangles of varying size.\n\nThe architects opted for textured concrete, rather than a smooth surfaces, to give the exterior a more organic appearance. Credit: Nikken Sekkei\n\nIn turn, the exterior then reflects and interacts with the texture of the neighborhood. Chofu, a Tokyo suburb located about 12 miles from the city center, is a largely residential area made up of small houses, so Yamanashi broke up the school's outer surfaces to help assimilate them with their surroundings.\n\n\"We aimed to create a sense of scale and an appearance that matched the surrounding detached houses,\" he said. \"We wanted (it to look like) random and natural scenery at a glance, like an old village.\"\n\nRather than relying on monolithic planes of smooth concrete, Yamanashi gave the school's outer faces a rough, fragmented texture to integrate them with the local architecture.\n\nGlass and wood soften the appearance of the building's concrete frame. Credit: Nikken Sekkei\n\n\"With that kind of effect, concrete starts to look more softened -- like soil,\" he explained. \"For me, that's very important, because around (Chofu there) are many many Japanese-style houses made from wood and soil.\"\n\nYet, for all the considerations made by Yamanashi and his team, the recently opened building once stood on the brink of obsolescence. According to the architect, a change in school management during construction threatened to halt the project. Even after the new regime agreed to persist with his unorthodox design, it was only on the grounds that it would serve as a temporary home before being converted into storage space.\n\nBut now, Yamanashi said, the building's future is secure. Plaudits from the architecture world will only have helped his case.\n\n\"I visited the head of the school, and he told me that they had decided to use our design as a graduate school, so it will survive -- it's a result,\" he said. \"Students and staff like our facility very much.\"", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Sweat poured down the leather flaps of his helmet. No one in his tank moved or even whispered.\n\nIt was March 6, 1945, and Smoyer was part of the Allies' last push into Nazi Germany. The lanky 19-year-old with a mop of curly hair was part of a tank crew that had crawled into the German city of Cologne for what would become the US Army's biggest house-to-house fight in Europe. The Germans called it \"Endkampf,\" the final battle for their homeland.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I give you Cologne,\" Smoyer's commander announced over the radio. \"Let's knock the hell out of it!\"\n\nSmoyer didn't need any added motivation. Before he entered the shattered city, he'd received word that his cousin and his wife's brother had both been killed in the war. Those bastards are going to pay, he vowed.\n\nClarence Smoyer during the war. He gained a reputation for deadly accuracy as a tank gunner.\n\nNow he intended to fulfill his promise. His M26 Pershing tank had just been engaged in a shootout with a German tank at a sprawling intersection in the town's center. But then the enemy tank ducked behind a building. Smoyer searched for it, scanning a hellish urban landscape of rubble, sagging streetcar cables and collapsed buildings.\n\n\"Staff car!\" someone yelled over the radio.\n\nA black Opel streaked into the intersection. With orders to shoot anything that moved, Smoyer pressed the trigger. Bullets and tracers from Smoyer's gun smashed into the car; ordnance from another source also flew through the intersection. The car crashed into the sidewalk, and then Smoyer saw something that made the pit of his stomach fall out.\n\nThe car's passenger door swung open and a person with a light-colored sweater embroidered with flowers crumpled to the street. He saw a flash of curly brown hair.\n\nSmoyer's adrenalin turned to horror: Did I just shoot a woman?\n\nThe past can destroy the present\n\nSmoyer's question would force him to return to Cologne 68 years later. It would force him to reach out to an unlikely ally. And it would force him to deal with another question that may not be limited to war veterans: How do you atone for a terrible deed when you're not sure you've committed it?\n\nHow Smoyer answered those questions is the subject of an upcoming book, \"Spearhead: An American Tank Gunner, His Enemy, and a Collision of Lives in World War II.\" Written by Adam Makos, the engrossing book is a war story and a mystery.\n\nYet unlike other mysteries, this was one the main character wasn't sure he really wanted to solve -- at least not at first. Smoyer dreaded the answers because still more questions had lingered at the back of his mind for decades: Was that a woman? If so, why was she there? And perhaps most important: Did she survive?\n\n\"I often thought, 'Why the hell would somebody drive into a place like that,' \" Smoyer says today.\n\nSmoyer is now 95 and long retired from his job as a supervisor at an industrial cement plant. He was married to Melba, the woman who sent him homemade fudge when he was in combat, for 70 years before she died in 2017. They had two daughters.\n\nSmoyer with a US tank from World War II. German tanks had Americans outgunned, but Smoyer destroyed a feared German tank during a legendary battle.\n\nAnyone passing Smoyer on the street today wouldn't imagine that he fought in one the most legendary tank duels of World War II, says Makos. He destroyed a dreaded Panther tank, one of the most formidable weapons in the German arsenal. Yet Smoyer doesn't revel in war stories. He turns the channel when war movies come on. He closes the window when Fourth of July fireworks go off. He's a big quiet guy with a nervous chuckle.\n\n\"It was hard for me to believe that he was a legendary tank gunner in World War II because he was so gentle and calm,\" Makos says.\n\nSmoyer had good reason to turn away from the sounds of war. For those who fought in tanks, war was literally hell on wheels.\n\nThis is what they faced:\n\nMen who hadn't showered in three weeks were crammed together into small metal capsules. Shells that penetrated through tank hulls ricocheted inside like supersonic pinballs. Concussion forces from the impact of shells shattered men's bones and turned their bodies to jelly, with just the skin holding their corpses together. Tanks were called \"crematoriums on wheels.\"\n\n\"The mechanics and maintenance men used to cry when they came out from cleaning a tank,\" Makos says.\n\nSmoyer (top center) and his crew pause during a lull in the fighting. He thought he wouldn't survive the war.\n\nBut repressing those memories could also be lethal.\n\nSmoyer had seen it happen before.\n\nIn one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the book, Makos tells the story of Smoyer's company commander, Capt. Mason Salisbury.\n\nSalisbury had returned home from the war, graduated from Columbia Law School and become a lawyer at big New York firm.\n\nOne winter weekend, he stayed at his parents' mansion on Long Island. He played tennis and ate dinner with his family. That Monday morning, his father found him slumped in a car in the garage. The car had been running all night. Salisbury had killed himself at 30.\n\nHe'd left a note, saying he was depressed over the loss of his friends in battle.\n\nMakos wrote:\n\n\"After surviving more close calls with German shells than he could count, Capt. Salisbury had been stalked and cut down by the unseen killer. The mental toll of war.\"\n\nSmoyer discovers a vital clue\n\nSmoyer was losing the battle with that unseen killer. The mental toll of the war was eating into him.\n\nHe'd become a hero for his actions in Cologne that day. After his encounter in the intersection, his tank would go on to tangle with another German tank known as the \"monster\" -- the dreaded Panther. It had a gun so powerful that its shells could go through one American Sherman tank into the next.\n\nTank warfare was so grisly during World War II that American soldiers had a nickname for tanks: crematoriums on wheels.\n\nSmoyer and his crew destroyed that Panther, and the duel was caught on film by a combat cameraman. Journalists heard about the battle and interviewed and photographed Smoyer and his crew. One journalist wrote a piece about it called, \"Killing a Monster.\"\n\nBut as the years went by, Smoyer tried not to think about the war. He'd have flashbacks of battles, but he pushed those memories away. Yet one question never quite went away: What really happened at that intersection?\n\nOne day he got some answers. They came in his mailbox.\n\nA war buddy had sent him a VHS tape called, \"Scenes of War.\" It turned out that a combat cameraman had also filmed what happened in the intersection.\n\nSmoyer plopped the tape into his video player and started reliving a battle he had fought over 50 years earlier.\n\nHe saw the massive intersection again. The rubble. The car streaking through as bullets and tracers from his tank and the German tank zipped across the roadway. He saw the car crash again, a body tumbling out of the passenger side, a familiar flash of curly brown hair.\n\nIt was a woman.\n\nHe saw her stare vacantly into the sky as American medics tried to treat her. He saw her curl into a fetal position as one medic tenderly covered her with a blanket. He saw her blink as soldiers walked by.\n\nThe woman from the car fights for her life as American medics tend to her wounds.\n\nHis chest started to heave as he realized what he had done. At the time of the battle, he was too preoccupied with surviving the war to dwell on his actions. And he kept the memories at bay for years afterward. Now, he could no longer do that.\n\n\"I had forgotten about it for decades, the car was just a blur, and now the whole thing came back, clear as day,\" Smoyer says.\n\nSmoyer started having nightmares. He'd wake up swinging, afraid he'd hit his wife, Melba. He had to take medication to calm himself, but the nightmares kept coming. He could barely function in the day. He kept seeing the woman in his dreams.\n\nThe past was destroying his present.\n\n\"The war is over, I thought, why do I have to worry about this anymore?\"\n\nSmoyer couldn't change what he'd seen, but maybe he could lessen its sting. He acquired uncut footage of the battle from the National Archives and, with notepad in hand, scoured the film for another explanation.\n\n\"I prayed that I wasn't the one,\" Smoyer says.\n\nDoubts and denial crept into his mind. Maybe it wasn't his fault? Maybe the German tank had shot the woman?\n\n\"He was searching for a way he didn't do it,\" Makos says.\n\nNone of his war buddies could satisfy that search. The rest of his tank crew had all died of old age. Then another idea struck Smoyer. What if he could contact the German tank gunner?\n\nWhat if he was still alive?\n\nAn enemy becomes a comrade\n\nGustav Schaefer stood in a Cologne square on a frigid winter afternoon in March 2013, arms tucked behind his back, wondering why an American soldier wanted to talk to him.\n\nWho was this Clarence Smoyer?\n\nSchaefer was the gunner in the tank that had faced Smoyer 68 years earlier. Barely 5 feet tall, he'd been a teenager assigned to a tank because of his size.\n\nGustav Schaefer was the German gunner who faced Smoyer in the fight for Cologne. They shared a battle and a common nightmare.\n\nA Cologne journalist had contacted Schaefer, saying Smoyer wanted to meet him. Schaefer agreed but was nervous: What did he come all the way to Germany to talk about? Would he be angry?\n\nSmoyer spotted Schaefer and walked toward him, picking up the pace as he got closer. Smoyer reached out with an open hand as Schaefer timidly extended his.\n\nWhat Smoyer said next put Schaefer at ease:\n\n\"The war is over and we can be friends now.\"\n\nSchaefer hadn't been the prototypical Nazi soldier, Makos said. He was a farm boy from Northern Germany who'd been drafted. He actually grew up admiring the United States from afar, reading about \"cowboys and Indians\" and learning about Mickey Mouse. He said he had no animosity toward Jews. A Jewish neighbor had loaned his family a car once when they'd hit hard times and had never asked for anything in return.\n\n\"They didn't have electricity. He didn't have a radio. He only had a few books,\" Makos says. \"His big enjoyment was riding his bike to the train tracks to watch the trains go by.\"\n\nNow Schaefer was about to relive a painful drama with Smoyer.\n\nAfter pleasantries, they retreated to a hotel and shared evening beers. Smoyer told him why he'd sought him out. The next day they decided to confront their past. Together they walked to the scene where the car crashed, where the woman's body tumbled out.\n\nMakos was there to record what happened next.\n\n\"This is where I see her in my dreams,\" Smoyer told Schaefer, pointing to a lamppost.\n\nAmerican medics try to help the woman after her car was caught in the crossfire. This is the sight that stayed with Smoyer for years.\n\nSchaefer knew what Smoyer meant. He had seen the same film that Smoyer saw while watching a television documentary a decade earlier. He told Smoyer that he, too, kept having nightmares about the woman.\n\nThey began to talk as two old soldiers, recalling the battle.\n\nSmoyer said the intersection was a shooting gallery. He didn't have time to study the car. And that's when Schaefer said something that filled in the blanks for Smoyer:\n\n\"Well, that's why I shot it, too.\"\n\nIt turns out that both he and Schaefer had shot at the car. Smoyer no longer bore his guilt alone. Another soldier had reacted just as he had. It's what they were trained to do.\n\nSmoyer's eyes teared up. Then he became angry. Why, he wondered, would a civilian drive into the middle of a battle zone?\n\n\"It's war,\" Schaefer said. \"It's in the nature of it. It can't be undone.\"\n\nSmoyer, though, had his own surprise for Schaefer. He had learned who the woman was and what had happened to her.\n\nNow Smoyer and Schaefer were about to pay their respects to her.\n\nBoth started walking.\n\nThe woman in the car\n\nHer name was Katharina Esser, and she was 26. The youngest of four sisters, she was called \"Kathi.\" All her sisters had married and had families. She stayed home to care for her parents, and would often take her nieces and nephews to the park, pushing them on their scooters.\n\nKathi Esser, the woman caught in the crossfire, was a caretaker for her family. She looked out for her parents and cared for her nieces and nephews.\n\nEsser took night classes to get a degree in home economics. She worked as a clerk in a grocery store. The driver of the car that day was her boss, the owner of the grocery. Makos suspects that Esser and her boss had gone stir crazy staying in an air raid shelter and had decided to make a run for a bridge outside Cologne to safety.\n\nAll three of Esser's sisters had lost their husbands in the war.\n\n\"Life only has these (sad) things to offer us nowadays,\" Esser wrote in a letter to one of her family members after learning that one of her brothers-in-law had been killed in battle. \"I don't believe in a good outcome anymore.\"\n\nEsser, though, still had something to look forward to.\n\n\"She hoped that she would be a mother one day and have children of her own,\" Makos says.\n\nInstead, Esser died after being caught in the crossfire. She was buried in a church cemetery, just 200 yards from where she had fallen.\n\nSmoyer and Schaefer walked along a path to the church and stopped before a knee-high wooden cross. A plaque on the cross read, \"The Unknown Dead.\" Esser had been buried in a mass grave. At the time, people weren't certain of her identity. Her papers had been separated from her at the time of her death. But Germans were methodical record keepers. And one of her sisters had seen the film of her death and realized it was Kathi.\n\nAfter writing journalists and historians in Cologne, Smoyer had pieced together her identity and her final resting place.\n\nNow Schaefer knew, too. Both placed yellow roses on the grave. As Smoyer bent down to place his rose, he almost lost his balance. Schaefer grabbed his arm and steadied him.\n\nSmoyer told Esser he was sorry.\n\n\"Visiting the gravesite gave me a chance to apologize to Katharina, just me and her,\" Smoyer says.\n\nThe fate of Kathi Esser haunted the American and German soldiers who saw her fall before their tanks during the last days of the war.\n\nLater on the trip, Smoyer got another helping hand -- from Esser's family.\n\nThey heard he was in town and invited him to their house. They told him to be at peace and that their Kathi wouldn't have blamed him. One of Esser's nieces told him:\n\n\"The people who started this war are the ones who killed Katharina.\"\n\nSmoyer says the meeting with Esser's family \"brought me some comfort.\"\n\n\"War is hell,\" he says. \"No matter what side you stand on. A lot of young people get killed, but it's the leaders of the countries who should have to do the fighting on the front lines. If that happened I'm sure there wouldn't be wars anymore.\"\n\nSmoyer remained friends with Schaefer afterward, exchanging letters and talking on Skype. Schaefer died in 2017. Smoyer sent a bouquet of flowers to his funeral with the inscription:\n\n\"I will never forget you! Your brother in arms, Clarence.\"\n\nAnd both he and Schaefer never forgot the woman in their dreams. They said farewell to Kathi.\n\nThey used their past to save their present.\n\n\"You could write a textbook on how they healed from trauma,\" Makos says. \"They went to the scene and confronted what had happened. They paid their respects to her and apologized. And they honored her by trying to understand who she was.\"\n\nThe memories of tank warfare were so bad for Smoyer that he would turn off the television when war movies came on.\n\nSmoyer and Schaefer didn't just share their story for themselves, Makos says. They did it for Esser.\n\n\"They said we're not going to tell our war story. We're going to tell you about her. By doing so she could live forever.\"\n\nIt would be easy to imagine that Smoyer never sees Kathi in his dreams anymore.\n\nYet that is not the nature of war.\n\n\"It still hurts,\" he says. \"It don't go away.\"\n\nBut he says he rests easier at night now.\n\n\"I don't wake up swinging my arms anymore and I can sleep a full night,\" he says. \"I still see her in my dreams. I think I always will. I don't think she haunts me. It's different than that. It's not a nightmare anymore.\"", "French President Emmanuel Macron shares what he thinks he has in common with President Donald Trump, during an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria .
