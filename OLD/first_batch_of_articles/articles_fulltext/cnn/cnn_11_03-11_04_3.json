["(CNN) A teacher and student at a southeast Los Angeles, California, high school came to blows Friday afternoon, and it was all caught on video.\n\nThe footage from CNN affiliates KTLA-TV and KCAL shows Maywood Academy High School music teacher Marston Riley, 64, standing face to face with a 14-year-old boy at the front of a classroom when Riley punches him. It's at this point the two begin exchanging punches. The boy wound up on the ground wrapping his arms around Riley's leg. Riley, at this point, repeatedly punches him.\n\nThe brawl ends with students and what appears to be a campus resource officer trying to separate the two, but Riley continues to pursue the student. It is not clear when the short video started and if it caught the entire exchange.\n\nStudents told KTLA the fight began after Riley asked the student to leave the class because he wasn't wearing the proper uniform. The boy refused, students said, and video taken by another student shows the boy shouting profanity and a racial slur at Riley, who is black.\n\nThe boy, who has not been identified, was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for moderate injuries and later released, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Riley was arrested on charges of child abuse, the release said. He posted bond and was released Saturday. Riley has an arraignment scheduled for November 30.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's political action committee is unleashing yet another advertisement\u2014this one featuring himself, in a plea to voters on behalf of Democrats ahead of Tuesday's midterms.\n\nIt's his third recent national ad for the midterms but the first in which Bloomberg himself has appeared.\n\nUnlike previous ads the billionaire has funded this election cycle, the latest one features Bloomberg himself.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "Washington (CNN) The sons of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi issued an emotional appeal for the return of their father's body, in their first interview since he was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a month ago.\n\nSalah and Abdullah Khashoggi, who called their father \"courageous, generous and very brave,\" said they have endured weeks of anguish and uncertainty following his disappearance and death.\n\n\"I really hope that whatever happened wasn't painful for him, or it was quick. Or he had a peaceful death,\" Abdullah Khashoggi, 33, told CNN during a sit-down interview in Washington with his brother, Salah, 35.\n\nAuthorities in Turkey -- who say Khashoggi was murdered by a hit squad sent from Riyadh -- are still searching for the journalist's remains. Earlier this week, the chief prosecutor's office said Khashoggi's body was dismembered after he was strangled, while the Washington Post reported investigators were looking into the theory that the body was dissolved in acid. A source close to the Saudi Royal Palace has denied any knowledge of the body's whereabouts.\n\nWithout their father's body, the brothers say their family is unable to grieve or find closure.\n\n\"All what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi (cemetery) in Medina (Saudi Arabia) with the rest of his family,\" Salah said.\n\n\"I talked about that with the Saudi authorities and I just hope that it happens soon.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia has presented an evolving narrative about what happened to Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen, when he entered the consulate to get papers for his wedding; the journalist was preparing to get married for a third time. Authorities initially denied all knowledge of his fate before later admitting that a group of rogue operators, many part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's inner circle, were responsible. Riyadh has maintained that neither bin Salman nor his father, King Salman, knew of the operation to target Khashoggi.\n\nBut what has really come to trouble his two sons, their two sisters and their mother are the lies, they say, that have sprung up since Khashoggi's death.\n\nAbdullah and Salah say their father has been misunderstood and intentionally misrepresented for political reasons.\n\n\"Jamal was a moderate person. He was liked by everybody. He had differences and common values with everyone,\" Salah said, describing Khashoggi as a genuine, happy person and an \"amazing\" father.\n\n\"I see a lot of people coming out right now and trying to claim his legacy and unfortunately some of them are using that in a political way that we totally don't agree with.\"\n\n\"Public opinion is important... but my fear is that it's being over politicized. People are throwing analysis that may direct us away from the truth.\"\n\nJamal Khashoggi, looks on during a press conference in the Bahraini capital Manama, on December 15, 2014.\n\nKhashoggi was labeled as a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer and a dangerous Islamist in phone calls the Saudi crown prince had with Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, and John Bolton, national security adviser, according to reports in both the Washington Post and New York Times. The Muslim Brotherhood, considered a terror group in many Arab nations, but not the US or Europe, has long been seen as an existential threat by the desert kingdom's leaders.\n\n\"It's just labels and people not doing their homework properly, and reading his article and going in depth. It's easier to stick a label on him,\" Abdullah said, when asked about the Muslim Brotherhood claim.\n\nAsked how Khashoggi should be remembered, Salah replied, \"as a moderate man who has common values with everyone... a man who loved his country, who believed so much in it and its potential.\"\n\n\"Jamal was never a dissident. He believed in the monarchy that it is the thing that is keeping the country together. And he believed in the transformation that it is going through.\"\n\nReflecting on their father's career as a journalist, they say Khashoggi was \"like a rock and roll star\" when they were out with him in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"He was a public figure that was liked by everyone else,\" Salah said. \"You don't see that much in media, in print media.\"\n\nAbdullah Khashoggi (left) beside his brother, Salah Khashoggi (right) during an interview with CNN on Sunday.\n\nIf there is a frailty that comes with suddenly losing a parent, Salah and Abdullah, who is two years his junior, don't show it, but Salah's sunken, shadowed eyes show the strain.\n\nSalah, the eldest sibling, has been made the principal family point of contact by the Saudi government, meaning all of Khashoggi's relatives call him. It's a large family and a large emotional burden not eased by the absence of facts. He says he relies on news reports for updates about the investigation into his father's death.\n\n\"Our source is the same source that you have. It is a mystery. This is putting a lot of burden on us -- all of us. That everybody is seeking for information just as we do. They think that we have answers, and unfortunately we don't,\" Salah said.\n\nAbdullah, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, says he was the last of Khashoggi's children to see him alive. When he heard the journalist was going to be in Turkey he went to visit him and spent time with him and his fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. He saw their blossoming relationship and his father's happiness.\n\n\"He was happy. It was a very good opportunity for me to see him. We hung out in Istanbul, we had fun,\" Abdullah said. \"I was really lucky to have last moment with him. I feel very grateful.\"\n\nFollowing the murder, Abdullah was the first family member to visit Khashoggi's apartment in Virginia. There, he said, he found that his father had placed a photograph of his grandchildren, Abdullah's two children and Salah's daughter, by his bed.\n\nAbdullah says he realized how much his father loved his family, placing a photograph where he would see them last thing at night.\n\n\"That shocked me,\" Abdullah said. \"It put an emphasis on his gentle, tender side of loving his family, his grandkids. It's just something huge and it touched me personally and all the family when they knew about it.\"\n\nThe brothers say their father was planning to leave the Washington area and move to Turkey so he could be closer to his children and grandchildren.\n\n\"The main reason behind him choosing to live in Turkey is to be closer to his family. He has a very special relationship with all of his sisters. It's been hard for all of us to hear the tragic news,\" Salah said.\n\nSalah and Abdullah are suffering, but they are not lathered in self-pity. They're speaking publicly now to restore the part of Khashoggi's narrative that belongs to the family. But they say each day is tough, scouring the news for even the smallest detail about their father's murder.\n\n\"It's difficult, it's not easy. Especially when the story gets this big. It's not easy, it's confusing. Even the way we grieve, it's a bit confusing,\" Abdullah said. \"At the same time, we're looking at the media and the misinformation. There's a lot of ups and downs. We're trying to be emotional and at the same time we're trying to get the story -- bits and pieces of the story to complete the whole picture. It's confusing and difficult. It's not a normal situation and not a normal death.\"\n\nSalah, Abdullah and their sisters Noha, 27 and Razan, 25, all want to get on with their lives, they still live and work in the Middle East and have been put under an unenviable spotlight.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pictured shaking hands with Salah Khashoggi.\n\nSalah is due to go back to his banking job in Jeddah very soon, and fears how commentators on social media will react. He says his handshake with the Crown Prince shortly before he left Saudi Arabia two weeks ago was widely misinterpreted.\n\n\"I mean there was nothing, they were just over analyzing the whole situation,\" Salah said. \"I understand why they're trying to do that. They're trying to get as much information as they can out of anything, which is something that we're also doing. Sometimes they're just baseless claims, sometimes they just don't make any sense.\"\n\nSalah says he is waiting for the investigation to be over and for the facts to come out.\n\n\"The King has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice. And I have faith in that. This will happen. Otherwise Saudi wouldn't have started an internal investigation,\" Salah said.\n\nAsked if he was placing his faith in the King, Salah replied: \"yes.\"", "The sons of murdered Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi told CNN in an exclusive interview how important it is for their father's body to be returned to them soon, so they can give him a proper and Islamic burial.

View more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States. Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.\n\nThis week, I am joined by special guest Josh Campbell, a former supervisory special agent in the FBI, to examine the safety and security of the US elections in the run-up to the midterms.\n\nWe've been in all kinds of threat briefings in various secure rooms across the country. From identifying terrorist attacks in the US to mitigating gang activity and minimizing threats to Americans around the world, every threat briefing is different but shares some fundamental characteristics, including acknowledging that it's impossible to fully neutralize the threat landscape. This leads to an important prioritization of where and how to apply finite resources.\n\nElection security is no different. The public was made aware of Russia's ongoing attack on our democracy two years ago, and since that time new culprits have been named and new forms of election interference have come to light. A primary way of neutralizing foreign interference -- and domestic threats to our elections -- is by instilling confidence in American voters that their government takes election security seriously.\n\nThe continued spread of misinformation by government officials Americans think should be protecting them could both inspire further violence and help at least one hostile foreign power, Russia, with its message that our democracy is severely weakened.\n\nAs we head into midterms, one thing is certain: there are multiple, ongoing threats to our elections.\n\nSecuring our voters\n\nThreats against the physical safety of Americans are heightened during high-profile events -- such as elections -- and after high-profile attacks, like the Pittsburgh shooting, when individuals may be inspired to conduct attacks of their own. We are tracking threats to physical security. including politically motivated violence, hate crimes against specific voter groups and external terrorism attacks.\n\nOn the heels of an extensive pipe bomb campaign by a Trump supporter against key figures in the Democratic party, shots fired into a GOP office in Florida and hate crimes against Jews and African-Americans, we have more concerns about the physical safety of Americans heading to voting stations around the country. Physical violence or intimidation against voters is always a concern during election season, and in light of what's occurred recently, physical harm or intimidation against voters is even more worrisome.\n\nExternal terrorist groups may also seek to take advantage of the elections themselves because they believe an attack right before or during the elections would get a lot of coverage and be viewed as destabilizing.\n\nSecuring our votes\n\nOur election infrastructure remains woefully insecure.\n\nOur election infrastructure's designation by the Department of Homeland Security as critical infrastructure in 2017 was an important signal of both how vital this infrastructure is to our country, but also how vulnerable it is to attack.\n\nWe know that Russian government cyber actors sought vulnerabilities and access to US election infrastructure in 2016 in most states, even if it was primarily preparatory activity and \"basic research.\"\n\nWe have had two years to up our defenses -- and to try to deter interference -- but the Russians (as well as other actors) have also had two years to up their game and get better at accessing our systems. With this understanding, US intelligence agencies are on the lookout for similar tactics used in 2016, but they must also be aware that Russia has likely developed new means of attack.\n\nAccording to your administration, other countries with advanced cyber capabilities -- Iran, North Korea and China -- are also trying to interfere in our election, which could mean myriad complex cyber threats against this critical election infrastructure.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said we've been reducing risks and remediating vulnerabilities, but acknowledged in September that the threat remains. There are a series of threats to our physical voting infrastructure -- largely unchanged from 2016 -- which means there are significant opportunities for attack. State spending on election security upgrades will take place over five years, so improvements to cybersecurity and infrastructure upgrades won't be complete by the midterms.\n\nWe know that some of the most glaring vulnerabilities identified by election security experts -- including using paperless ballot systems -- remain unaddressed. The highly contested Georgia governor's race will rely on a highly vulnerable election system -- it's centrally run and has no paper ballot backup of any kind. And, physical voting systems in more than half of US states contain exploitable vulnerabilities that could allow hackers to compromise voting machines.\n\nDHS has also warned about the risks of voting over the internet. Despite this warnings, today only 19 states do not allow electronic transmission of ballots. And 19 states and Washington, D.C., allow some voters to return ballots via email or fax even though we know, for example, that the Russian government successfully penetrated the DNC and other entities using email phishing attacks before.\n\nCountering foreign influence operations\n\nWe remain convinced that our adversaries view the information domain as where they get the most bang for the buck. Information warfare doesn't cost a lot and it's highly impactful. Twitter alone has more users globally -- ready to access content instantaneously -- than America has Americans.\n\nAs the US intelligence community concluded in January 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his intelligence operatives to launch a campaign which included a concerted effort using fake online personas and troll farms to whip up, confuse and manipulate American voters.\n\nJUST WATCHED Woman indicted in US meddling mocks charges Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Woman indicted in US meddling mocks charges 01:45\n\nEmboldened by their successes in 2016, Kremlin operatives (and potentially others) are continuing their campaign of fomenting chaos amongst the American electorate by attacking our information. We know that social media platforms have taken steps to neutralize information warriors on their platform, including by identifying fake accounts, labeling content and shutting down foreign influence operators.\n\nJust last week, we learned Twitter deleted 10,000 bot accounts working to sow discord and discourage voters from going to the polls. Although an important, step, it's reactive and there are some verified accounts that are more dangerous than fake Russian ones.\n\nWe assess that the Russians think you're helping them whenever you spread misinformation . They also probably concurrently believe that amplifying your statements helps sow confusion in the US because Americans are confused about why you would, reportedly, present inaccurate information when they believe you know doing so helps Russia, creates serious domestic divisions and has the potential to motivate violence.\n\nFor more opinion...

After mocking Crenshaw, he took aim at Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, \"so I look fair,\" he said.\n\nCrenshaw, a Navy SEAL who did five tours of duty, lost his right eye when he was hit by an IED blast in Helmand province in 2012, according to his campaign website . Surgeries restored sight in his left eye. He recovered and ultimately deployed twice more.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629

Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"It's the economy, stupid.\" That famous phrase, coined by James Carville, one of Bill Clinton's strategists, was Clinton's guiding principle in his 1992 campaign to unseat President George H.W. Bush. This slogan reminded Clinton that the best way to win that election was to talk about the economy, since that issue moved voters. And it worked.\n\nFlash forward to the 2018 midterm election and Donald Trump's guiding principle can be best summed up as, \"It's the racism, stupid.\" Trump is playing on his supporters' worst fears of brown immigrants to scare them to the polls. And to be clear, talking about immigration policy isn't inherently racist, but fabricating lies to gin up fears of Latino immigrants is -- and that's exactly what Trump is doing.\n\nFor example, for the past few weeks, Trump has been ratcheting up the hysteria about the caravan of migrants who are making their way north from Latin America in search of a better life. Trump has dubbed this caravan an \"invasion of our country\" that's filled with \"Gang Members and some very bad people.\" In reality, there's little evidence to support that the caravan is filled with dangerous people.\n\nJust days ago, Trump said he could order up to 15,000 US troops to the border, making it seem like the caravan was rapidly approaching. He conveniently has left out that the caravan is nearly 1,000 miles from the US border and won't arrive for weeks.\n\nAnd, on Wednesday, Trump released a video featuring an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who killed two US police officers. In the video, he blames the Democrats for this man's crimes. The ad has rightly been slammed as racist . Fact checkers have also pointed out that it was full of lies, such as the claim the killer entered the country under a Democratic administration when, in fact, he last entered the United States under the George W. Bush administration.\n\nMany ask why Trump isn't focused on the economy given the solid economic numbers. Trump addressed that very issue Friday at his rally in West Virginia, saying: \"They all say, 'Speak about the economy, speak about the economy.\" Adding, \"Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy.\"\n\nIn reality, the economy isn't boring to Trump. This is a guy who loves to brag about positive economic numbers, as he did on Twitter on Friday and again on Saturday . In July , Trump even held a press conference to tout the quarterly GDP report that had just been released, declaring that it was \"amazing\" and \"historic.\"\n\nThe real reason Trump is not focused on the economy is because he knows his base very well and gets two big things about them. First, economically speaking, they're unlikely doing much better -- if at all -- since he took office. And two, fearmongering about immigrants energizes them.\n\nNow if Trump were giving a speech to his wealthy friends at his exclusive country club, there's little doubt he'd focus on economic numbers, because the rich have greatly benefited from the Trump and GOP tax cut. But it's a different story for working-class Americans. Almost two-thirds of Americans say they haven't seen any increase in wages as a result of the GOP tax cut. And when you factor in rising inflation, workers have only seen wages rise a paltry 0.8% in the past year. Gas prices alone have climbed over 30% since 2017, which can take a real bite out of working- and middle-class spending power.\n\nHow can Trump try to energize voters by telling them the economy is great when they don't have more money to spend? Trump gets that, so he's reverting back to playing on white anxieties regarding the browning of America -- which I like to refer to as racism. Or, for those who prefer the more academic term, fear of losing status.\n\nBut Trump didn't need an academic study to tell him that many supported him in 2016 because they felt \"a threat to their group's dominance in our country over all,\" as one political science professor explained it to the New York Times.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThat's why Trump's policies are largely designed to keep America white -- from his proposal to build a wall to clamping down on legal immigration (ending \"chain migration\") and even his early call for a total and complete Muslim ban, which likely helped him win the election. In fact, Trump tried to combine both anti-Latino racism with anti-Muslim bigotry last week when he claimed that there were \"Middle Easterners\" in the caravan, though he later acknowledged there was no evidence to support that.\n\nAnd Trump's racist appeal appears to be working , as new CNN polls show that GOP voters are increasingly ranking immigration as the top issue.

Now it has the US government in its corner.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration targeted Fujian Jinhua in a major escalation of its push against alleged economic espionage. On Thursday, the Justice Department charged Fujian Jinhua , along with a Taiwanese company and three Taiwanese individuals, with conspiracy to steal trade secrets from Micron. The charges move the government's attack on Chinese intellectual property theft beyond tariffs and tough talk.\n\nThe charges, along with a ban on American companies from doing business with Fujian Jinhua, gives Micron the \"upper hand\" in its tangle with the Chinese company, said Mehdi Hosseini, a semiconductor analyst at Susquehanna International Group. \"They now have more ammunition to make sure the memory industry in China is marginalized,\" he said.\n\nMicron's allegations\n\nMicron ( MU ), which was founded in 1978, is the largest memory chip maker in the United States and directly competes with the biggest players in the global market, according to Hosseini.\n\nIn recent years, the company has had to contend with a growing threat from China, which has made building successful homegrown semiconductor companies a pillar of its plans to become a global tech powerhouse. Fujian Jinhua has been building a $5.7 billion plant in southeastern China to get in the game, and it's far from the only player.\n\nMicron sued Fujian Jinhua and Taiwanese semiconductor company UMC in California federal court in December 2017. Micron claimed that as early as 2015, UMC and Jinhua devised a plan to get former employees of Micron's Taiwanese affiliate to steal Micron's trade secrets and deliver them to UMC, which would then pass them to Jinhua.\n\nAccording to Micron's complaint, UMC would get $700 million in research and development equipment and fees in return, as well as co-ownership in the resulting technology.\n\nFormer employees of the Micron affiliate in 2015 and 2016 successfully pilfered tech secrets from the company by uploading confidential data to their laptops, removable drives and Google drives before they left the firm, Micron said.\n\nThe case is still working its way through the court system. And Micron has since had to battle a countersuit in Chinese court from Jinhua and UMC, which filed a patent infringement suit against Micron in January. The court in July temporarily barred Micron from selling 26 products in the country including memory chips, memory sticks and hard drives.\n\nMicron said it only learned about the Trump administration's export ban after it was announced on Tuesday. \"Micron strongly supports global fair trade and the protection of intellectual property,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, after the Justice Department announced the charges against Fujian Jinhua and UMC, Micron's general counsel commended the agency's decision to \"prosecute the criminal theft of our intellectual property.\"\n\nUMC said in a statement Friday that it \"takes seriously any allegation that it may have violated any laws,\" and \"fully intends to respond to [the Justice Department] allegations accordingly.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Micron said it appreciated the government's legal action.\n\n\"This lawsuit corners new entrants out of China,\" Hosseini said. As China pumps billions into technology such as semiconductors, it's a vital edge.\n\nTrade war impact\n\nMicron's claims of economic espionage are given heft by the US government's lawsuit. But filing charges against the Chinese firm also serves a political purpose for the Trump administration.\n\nNegotiations with Beijing could be back on after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke on the phone Thursday and said they were willing to meet at the upcoming G20 summit in Argentina. A Bloomberg report early Friday said that Trump has asked officials to draft a trade deal with China ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe buzz could be a ploy to boost markets ahead of next week's midterm elections, according to Michael Every, head of Asia financial markets research at investment bank Rabobank. But should talks resume, the United States could find itself in a stronger position.\n\nFujian Jinhua probably can't operate without access to US software and technology, according to analysts.\n\n\"These actions are meant both to increase leverage in the current negotiations and as a deterrent to others,\" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The US isn't going follow the standard playbook any longer because it has only emboldened China.\"\n\nWhen the United States went after Chinese phone and telecom equipment company ZTE earlier in the year, it said it was the result of specific, sanctions-related violations. Implementing export controls with a sweeping national security rationale is different, according to Dan Wang, technology analyst at Gavekal Research.\n\n\"Unlike the ban on ZTE, the US action against Fujian Jinhua is no one-off penalty for a specific infringement, but part of a much broader policy drive,\" he said in a note this week, citing the US government's language.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Fujian Jinhua threatened the supply chain for essential military components.", "New York (CNN Business) For the first time, Amazon is offering free shipping on all US holiday orders in an effort to add new Prime members and juice the season's sales numbers.\n\nLast year, Amazon shoppers without Prime memberships had to spend at least $25 to earn free shipping, but Amazon is waiving the purchase minimum starting Monday to give \"customers even more convenient and faster delivery options,\" the company announced.\n\nThe National Retail Foundation forecasts holiday retail sales will climb by up to 4.8% compared to a year ago.\n\nAmazon's plan could overshadow holiday strategies from top competitors like Target, which offers free two-day shipping on all orders from November 1 to December 22.\n\nThe promotion, available only in the United States, will make hundreds of millions of items eligible for free shipping, Amazon said. By comparison, Walmart, one of Amazon's fiercest competitors, sells around 75 million products online.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Muchos de ellos se instalan en albergues de la Magdalena Mixhuca.\n\nPreviamente, las autoridades de Ciudad de Mexico habilitaron albergues para recibir m\u00e1s de 5.000 inmigrantes que, se espera, continuar\u00e1n llegando en los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas.\n\nPor otro lado en Tapachula, Chiapas est\u00e1 la caravana conformada, en su mayor\u00eda, por ciudadanos de El Salvador. Unos 1.500 ingresaron este viernes a M\u00e9xico por esta zona.\n\nEn d\u00edas anteriores, los migrantes en la caravana le han dicho a CNN que est\u00e1n huyendo de la pobreza y la violencia, y que no est\u00e1n disuadidos por los planes del gobierno de Trump de desplegar tropas en la frontera.\n\nLa caravana ha viajado alrededor de 30 a 50 kil\u00f3metros por d\u00eda, en gran parte a pie y tambi\u00e9n se montan en veh\u00edculos cuando es posible.\n\nEl Gobierno mexicano estima que unas 3.600 personas se dirigen al norte. Los organizadores de la caravana y los grupos de ayuda internacional, incluido ACNUR, han dicho que m\u00e1s de 7.000 personas conforman el grupo.\n\nLas autoridades mexicanas dicen que han comenzado a procesar solicitudes de asilo para m\u00e1s de 2.700 centroamericanos que llegaron con esta caravana. Y cerca de 500 hondure\u00f1os m\u00e1s han aceptado voluntariamente regresar a su pa\u00eds de origen, dijeron las autoridades mexicanas.", "(CNN) House forecast: Democrats will win 226 seats (and the House majority) while Republicans will win just 209 seats. A Democratic win of 203 seats and 262 seats is within the margin of error.\n\nThe final weekend of the long 2018 campaign is coming to a close.\n\nSometimes the final weekend brings clarity. This weekend brings no such thing. Instead, Democrats remain modest \u2014 though not runaway \u2014 favorites to gain House control.\n\nTwo generic congressional ballot polls released on Sunday put Democrats on the cusp of taking back the House. The ABC News/Washington Post poll puts Democrats up by 8 points. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal gives the Democrats a 7-point lead.\n\nA 7- or 8-point lead nationally also barely clears the line where Democrats want to be in order to get a majority of seats in the House. That line probably stands at about 6 points.\n\nGiven the accuracy of the generic ballot historically, it wouldn't be shocking for the polls to be off by 2-3 points. That is, the national polling still suggests that Republicans could maintain control.\n\nRepublicans can take some heart in the fact the the ABC News/Washington Post and NBC/Wall Street Journal polls suggest, if anything, a little momentum on the Republicans' side. The Democratic advantage on the generic ballot is down 5 points from the last ABC News/Washington Post poll and 2 points from the last NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.\n\nStill, we probably shouldn't read too much into \"momentum\" for a few reasons. Both of those polls are right about where the generic ballot average has been for the better part of the last six months . In other words, the prior polls (especially the ABC News/Washington Post poll) were a little bit of outliers compared to the average. These are right in line with them.\n\nAdditionally, there may actually be a sign that individual districts are breaking towards the Democrats. Professor Patrick Egan of NYU traced the New York Times/Siena College district polls and shows that polls conducted over the last week have been more Democratic compared to the district's partisan baseline than polls taken earlier in the campaign.\n\nOne such district is in the suburban New Jersey's 7th District. Republicans probably need to win that seat in order to maintain control. Instead, the Siena College poll found Democrat Tom Malinowski ahead of Republican Rep. Leonard Lance 47% to 39%. A previous Siena poll actually had Lance ahead by a point. The new poll in large part matches a Monmouth College poll released this past week that has Malinowski ahead by 3 points. (The Forecast has Malinowski winning by 3 points.)\n\nA plausible conclusion to reach is that the district polling is \"catching-up\" to the national polling in areas represented by incumbents. Another example of this phenomenon is in Illinois's 6th District. Rep. Peter Roskam's has regularly been called an underdog by race raters such as the Cook Political Report and Inside Elections. A Siena College poll in early September had Roskam ahead of his Democratic challenger Sean Casten 45% to 44%, while the latest Siena poll had him up behind 46% to 44%. ( The Forecast has Roskam losing by 2 points.)\n\nYou'll note though that neither of these forecasted wins are a particularly large margin. Indeed, the district polls, district forecasts and national polls agree that the district that puts Democrats over the top will not be won by a large margin. That means Democrats are still susceptible to a national polling error allowing Republicans to barely hold on.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

The film holds a 60% score on Rotten Tomatoes, and some reviews have been critical of the film's take on Mercury's life and sexuality.\n\nYet, a strong performance from Malek, which is producing some Oscar buzz, and the rocking soundtrack of Queen's greatest hits were enough of a draw.", "Washington (CNN) Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel declined on Sunday to address an incendiary immigration video shared last week by President Donald Trump, instead saying that, \"we know good people are trying to come into the country, too.\"\n\nThe online video, which was tweeted by Trump last Wednesday, accuses Democrats, without evidence, of plotting to help people it depicts as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.\n\n\"Listen, we know good people are trying to get into this country, too. They see the prosperity, they see the economic growth,\" McDaniel told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"They're coming to this country because they see it as a beacon of hope. We need to find a legal way to get people here, we need to find a way to fix our immigration system. Democrats won't work with us,\" she said.\n\nThe web video -- produced for the Trump campaign -- features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies.\n\nRead More", "Washington Robert Mueller could have some big announcements later this week. An indicted member of Congress still hopes to win re-election. And it might finally be time for Infrastructure Week. All that and more in this week's Inside Politics forecast.\n\n1. Can an indicted congressman win?\n\nGOP Congressman Duncan Hunter Jr. is one of two members of Congress running for re-election under indictment. But he's still favored to win in a district that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump. CNN rates the race as Likely Republican.\n\n\"It's one of the most conservative districts in California,\" CNN's Maeve Reston said, citing Hunter's early support of Trump in 2016.\n\n\"It's a real true test of the loyalty of Trump voters, whether they will stand behind him in this district that Trump won by 15 points.\"\n\n2. Trump's post-election spin\n\nIf a blue wave does indeed sweep Republicans out of power in the House, don't expect Trump to admit defeat.\n\n\"There's a tradition that presidents have a press conference the day after a midterm election to give their take on it,\" said New York Times reporter Michael Shear. \"In 2006, President Bush, after a very bad election for Republicans, said he had gotten a 'thumping.' And in 2010, President Obama said he had been 'shellacked' by the results.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine Trump saying anything like that, Shear said. \"So if he loses badly, what word does he use?\"\n\n3. Trump campaigns in 2018 with eye on 2020\n\nTrump is ending the campaign with a cross-country blitz, holding 10 rallies in five days. One goal: to help Republicans in close Senate races. But he also has his eye on 2020, CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports.\n\nOne way to tell? Look at the campaign posters. \"There have been very few signs for Senate candidates,\" Zeleny said. \"I was in Montana, and no Matt Rosendale signs -- all Trump signs. That's by design. It's 'The Trump Show.' \"\n\nAnd Trump advisers expect the show to go on, Zeleny said. \"This fall made him realize how much he loves rallies and how much he missed them. It's going to go on directly into 2020 without much stop at all.\"\n\n4. No joke: Infrastructure Week in 2019?\n\nSo, if Democrats win control of one or both chambers of Congress, would they collaborate on any issues with Trump?\n\n\"It might actually finally be Infrastructure Week,\" Washington Post reporter Seung Min Kim said. \"Senior White House officials are actually making overtures to key Democrats ahead of the midterms, to try to talk about an infrastructure deal.\"\n\nKim said a top Trump aide recently visited a top House Democrat with a message. \"President Trump wants to do something real and he acknowledges that it's going to require real money. And if Democrats do take back the House, they're going to need some legislative accomplishments.\"\n\n5. Mueller's next move\n\nAnd from CNN chief national correspondent John King:\n\nRoger Stone is telling anyone who will listen that Robert Mueller has it wrong. Stone is saying he did not coordinate with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign or try to pressure a friend into lying to the special counsel.\n\nThe Trump ally and veteran GOP dirty trickster made that case in a CNN interview the other day. He repeated it in what one friend described as \"nervous energy\" calls to friends and associates in recent days.\n\nStone believes the special counsel's office will seek an indictment. CNN reporting details emails and other evidence that question whether Stone coordinated with WikiLeaks -- and perhaps the Trump campaign -- about Democratic emails hacked and released late in the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe new reporting on Stone raises a bigger issue that has some of the President's friends and allies worried.\n\nMueller has been quiet for weeks. Justice Department guidelines urge prosecutors to be cautious in the 60 days or so before an election, so not to be seen as trying to influence voters. But with the election Tuesday, Trump-related investigations could climb back into the news. That includes the work of the special counsel and separate federal investigations in New York.\n\nThe worry on Team Trump is negative headlines coming at a time that is already pressure-packed. Democrats could capture the House. A wave of administration personnel turnover is about to unfold. And there are year-end pressures as Congress returns with big post-election spending issues and the President heads overseas.\n\nJust the name \"Mueller\" makes the President angry, a Trump insider said in a weekend exchange. If the election goes poorly for the White House, this source suggested the President will be on edge, anyway. And if the investigations then roar back into the news, \"I'm worried about a volcano.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nSin embargo, su conductor se entreg\u00f3 luego a las autoridades\n\nLa camioneta que las atropell\u00f3, una Ford F-150 de color negro, se dio a la fuga\n\n(CNN) - Tres ni\u00f1as y una mujer murieron este s\u00e1bado por la ma\u00f1ana cuando una camioneta conducido por un hombre de Wisconsin las atropell\u00f3 cuando su tropa de ni\u00f1as scouts recog\u00eda basura a lo largo de una carretera.\n\nOtra ni\u00f1a result\u00f3 herida y se encuentra en estado cr\u00edtico, dijo el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Lake Hallie.\n\nEl conductor de la camioneta Ford F-150 negra huy\u00f3, pero se entreg\u00f3 luego.

call off their engagement . But Grande put to rest that she has any animosity towards Davidson in a new song called \"Thank You, Next.\"\n\nGrande dropped the song just a half an hour before Davidson hit the \"Saturday Night Live\" stage.

She also sings about her exes Big Sean, the late Mac Miller and Ricky Alvarez.\n\n\"Thought I'd end up with Sean/But he wasn't a match/Wrote some songs about Ricky/Now I listen and laugh/Even almost got married/And for Pete I'm so thankful/Wish I could say thank you to Malcolm [Miller]/Cause he was an angel.\"\n\nThe song goes on to talk about the lessons she learned from each of her failed relationships.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The Egyptian interior ministry said Sunday that its forces killed 19 militants who it says were involved in Friday's deadly attack on Christian worshipers in the southern province of Minya.\n\nThe ministry said the men were killed in a shootout in a mountainous area in the western part of the province. Security forces tracked the men back to that area following the attack that killed seven Coptic Christian worshipers on their way to a monastery, the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry posted pictures of bodies it claimed were dead militants and the weapons found in their possession.\n\nFriday's attack on Coptic Christians was just the latest incident of violence against the religious minority, which is the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Last year, at least 28 people were killed when gunmen wearing fatigues and face masks opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians to a monastery.\n\nHundreds of mourners gathered Saturday for the funeral of the seven people who were killed Friday when gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians, Egyptian state-run media outlet Ahram Online reported.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams dismissed criticism from President Donald Trump on Sunday after he called her unqualified to lead the state.\n\n\"He's wrong,\" Abrams said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"As President (Barack) Obama pointed out, I am the most qualified candidate running.\"\n\nAbrams, a graduate of Yale Law School, was the minority leader in the Georgia State House of Representatives and is in a closely fought race against Georgia GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp to succeed Republican Gov. Nathan Deal.\n\nTrump said recently that Abrams was \"not qualified\" for the job, and Obama rebutted the point in a visit to the state, calling her the \"most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race.\"\n\nAsked why he did not believe Abrams was qualified, Trump said to \"take a look at her past\" and \"what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state.\" He did not elaborate on what he was referring to or provide further evidence on his attack against Abrams.\n\nRead More", "Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams responds to news that the office of her opponent, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, says it is launching an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party after what it calls a failed hacking attempt of the voter registration system.", "(CNN) Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp set off a political firestorm when his office, two days before an election in which he is a candidate, announced on Sunday morning that it had opened an investigation into the Georgia Democratic Party in connection with what it described as an attempted hack of the state's voter registration system.\n\nBut that initial advisory lacked key details about how Kemp's office was made aware of potential security vulnerabilities in the state's electronic voter information page, which the secretary of state oversees. A series of email chains obtained by CNN indicate that, rather than taking part in any alleged \"hack,\" the Georgia Democrats had simply passed along information regarding security concerns from a concerned voter to a private cybersecurity firm, which in turn shared its concerns with Kemp's office.\n\nDemocrats in the state have vehemently denied the allegations from Kemp's office, which also raised fresh criticism of Kemp's dual role as both the Republican nominee for governor and the state's chief election official.\n\n\"It's wrong to call it an investigation,\" Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams told CNN on Monday . \"It's a witch hunt that was created by someone who is abusing his power.\"\n\nKemp will face off against Abrams on Tuesday in the state's high-profile and close race for governor. Democrats and advocacy groups have previously argued that Kemp has a conflict of interest in overseeing an election he is also running in, and some have called on him to resign.\n\nThe latest controversy began with an early morning announcement from Kemp's office claiming there had been a \"failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system\" and that the secretary of state's office has opened an investigation \"into the Democratic Party of Georgia on the evening of Saturday, November 3, 2018.\"\n\nThe bulletin provided no evidence for the claims.\n\nLater Sunday, however, CNN obtained a series of emails the Secretary of State's office said led it to level the accusations of hacking into its voter registration system by the Georgia Democratic Party. The emails refer to findings by a voter who said he had discovered potential vulnerabilities in the state's voter information page and its online registration system.\n\nThat voter, Richard Wright, took his concerns to the Georgia Democratic Party's voter protection hotline to alert authorities, according to his lawyer, David Cross. Cross told CNN Wright is not affiliated with any political party and does not want to speak to any media right now. He also said that Wright has some software background, but is not a hacker.\n\nAccording to Cross, Wright -- the voter whose findings prompted accusations of attempted hacking -- was looking up his own registration information on the state's My Voter Page when he discovered he could access other people's information too. The system, he found, doesn't verify who's making the query and, for that reason, it appeared to him that voters' private information could be accessed and that voter registrations could even be edited by anyone on the site.\n\nWright went over his concerns with Cross, who has battled with Kemp over similar issues before, including a 2016 lawsuit that alleged cyber security vulnerabilities in Georgia's voting system, at 3 p.m. on Friday. Unclear on the implications of what Wright had found, Cross brought in a cyber security firm to look at the website. While that firm couldn't verify the vulnerability either, they too saw a potential for concern, Cross told CNN.\n\n\"If Richard Wright had never contacted the Democratic Party on Saturday morning,\" his lawyer, David Cross, told CNN, \"no one would be talking about the Democratic Party. It's only because Wright alerted them that Kemp draws it back to them.\"\n\nCandice Broce, the spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office told CNN on Sunday night that there were no vulnerabilities in the system, said the system is secure and that representatives from Kemp's office were meeting on Monday with authorities of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, FBI and Department of Homeland Security. The federal agencies, she said earlier, had been immediately alerted of her office's concerns.\n\n\"The State of Georgia has notified us of this issue. We defer to the State for further details,\" a DHS official said in a statement to CNN. The FBI declined to comment.\n\nAbrams told CNN on Sunday night that she believed Kemp had lied to voters over the seriousness of what had been discovered.\n\n\"Brian Kemp once again is trying to cover up for his failures in cybersecurity by blaming someone else,\" she said. \"We have nothing to do with this and I'm sad that instead of owning up to his responsibility, he's once again misleading Georgia.\"\n\nHer remarks echoed what the state party had said earlier in the day, when it called the allegations \"another example of abuse of power\" by Kemp.\n\n\"This political stunt from Kemp just days before the election is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor,\" the state party's executive director, Rebecca DeHart, said in a statement.\n\nIn the emails obtained by CNN, there is an exchange between a volunteer in the party's voter protection program and its director in which they refer to findings by a voter -- Wright -- who said he had discovered potential vulnerabilities in the state's voter information page and its online registration system.\n\nThe emails refer to an attachment that Kemp's office said was computer programming code. Kemp's office received the chain of emails from a representative of a cybersecurity expert who the Georgia Democratic Party asked to evaluate the potential vulnerabilities. The expert noted the computer programming code was possibly tantamount to \"a massive vulnerability.\"\n\nCNN has not viewed the code.\n\nAs his office's accusations began to circulate, Kemp's campaign lashed out at Democrats for \"trying to expose vulnerabilities in Georgia's voter registration system.\"\n\nBefore the details of how Kemp's office became aware of the specific concerns were made public, Abrams, the state's former House minority leader, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that any investigation now was an attempt to distract voters two days before the election.\n\n\"I've heard nothing about it, and my reaction would be that this is a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties and have forced him to accept absentee ballots to be counted and those who are being held captive by the exact match system to be allowed to vote,\" Abrams said Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments and from the fact that he's part of a nationwide system of voter suppression that will not work in this election because we're going to outwork him, we're going to out vote him and we're going to win,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats and advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have accused Kemp of using his position to suppress the minority vote through purges of the voting rolls and what they have described as an overzealous enforcement of already strict laws.\n\nA federal court issued an injunction barring the state from rejecting absentee ballots whose signatures don't directly match those on voters' registration. An appeals court declined Kemp's request to end the injunction late last week.\n\nKemp has denied those allegations and, when asked during a debate last month, said he would not recuse himself in case of a recount. Recent polling finds the candidates in a dead heat. If neither wins an outright majority, there will be a runoff on December 4.\n\nConcerns over Georgia voters' information security are not new. Kemp has been accused in a federal lawsuit of failing to safeguard his state's voting system as secretary of state and allowing a massive breach in 2015 that exposed 6 million registered Georgia voters' records and other sensitive election information.\n\nMarilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance and a plaintiff in the suit, said in August that it remained unclear if Georgia's election system was infected with malware or potentially breached by foreign hackers.\n\nThe coalition's lawsuit sought to force the state to implement paper ballot-based voting so results could be audited. Georgia is one of only a handful of states that currently use voting machines statewide without paper trails.\n\nKemp responded by assuring that Georgia's voting equipment \"remains accurate and secure\" and that the \"hysteria\" behind pressuring Georgia to switch to a paper ballot system is based on \"misinformation.\"", "(CNN) It's one of racing's holy grails, but the Melbourne Cup remains a mystical prize for British trainers.\n\nPlenty have tried, but it's as if there is a curse on the British in Australia's famous \"race that stops a nation.\" Hoping to break that spell this year is Magic Circle, trained by Ian Williams.\n\nAnother strong European contingent will descend on Melbourne for Tuesday's showpiece, but instead of the power houses of Godolphin or John Gosden, it is the less-heralded Williams who will be spearheading the British attack.\n\n\"It's a national event and is very exciting to be involved in,\" Williams told CNN Sport.\n\n\"To have a runner in such a race is a great privilege and to have a horse good enough to compete in such a race is an even bigger privilege.\n\n\"This year's event is probably one of the most competitive races the Melbourne Cup will ever have seen.\n\n\"And, of course, to win a race like this would be a huge accolade.\"\n\nMagic Circle, ridden by Fran Berry, won at Sandown Park in May.\n\nWilliams trains not out of the Flat racing heartlands of Newmarket or Berkshire's Lambourn Valley, but in Alvechurch in the West Midlands.\n\nNot quite as racing-glamorous perhaps, but perfectly placed as he became the first trainer to win at every racecourse -- Flat or jump racing -- in the UK.\n\nMagic Circle just heard the Winx result.

for a public vote on the country's Brexit deal, amid growing concerns that the United Kingdom will exit the European Union in March without an agreement.\n\nDozens of business heavyweights -- including Waterstones book store managing director James Daunt, and Wahaca restaurant co-founder Mark Selby -- signed the letter published in the Sunday Times , calling for a \"People's Vote\" on Brexit.\n\nThey said the proposals being discussed by the government and the European Commission were \"not nearly as good as the current deal we have inside the EU.\"\n\n\"The uncertainty over the past two years has already led to a slump in investment, which will make our country poorer,\" said the letter.\n\nIt also warned that the country was facing either \"a blindfold or a destructive hard

It may be the most important question facing voters Tuesday.\n\nAnd how about you, Ai-Jen Poo?\n\nAn America that honors families, said the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, who is a child of Taiwanese immigrants. With cruel immigration policies, \"the people who control our government have put a series of moral choices before us. How do we really value family and the well-being of children -- all families and children?\"\n\nAn America that protects \"rights, protections, equality and justice,\" wrote Alyssa Milano. \"Voting is how we prove that our country is so much kinder and bigger and better than that man in the White House.\"\n\nBut political scientist Carol Swain warned against sweeping into office \"a leftist's counterfeit remake of our nation,\" especially after \"President Trump has quietly checked off the accomplishments he promised to the American people,\" including a booming economy.\n\nTime for a reality check, wrote LZ Granderson: \"That restlessness in the pit of your stomach isn't there because the sky is falling\" since Trump. \"It's there because social media has pushed the clouds away, the sun is shining, and you're made uneasy by the clarity of who we really are and what we've always been.\"\n\nThe fear campaign\n\nAs the hugely consequential midterm election loomed, the word of the week was fear.\n\nThe nation was horrified in the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre. But as families were burying their dead-- and reckoning with the specter of murderous American anti-Semitism--President Trump, Fox News and the far-right fanned conspiracy theories about race and immigration into the overheated election cycle. They invoked their all-purpose Jewish bogeyman, the investor and philanthropist George Soros.\n\nKate Maltby: white supremacists see Jews, Hispanics, black people and Middle Easterners as the Other, threatening their status. Naturally, wrote: white supremacists see Jews, Hispanics, black people and Middle Easterners as the Other, threatening their status. The President needs to do more than condemn the individual actions of racist killers. \"He needs to repudiate the conspiracy theories that fuel their bloodlust.\"\n\nNicole Hemmer wrote that wrote that we might have seen Pittsburgh coming . In last year's violence in Charlottesville, \"the anti-Semitism part of the story quickly disappeared. Most analysis centered on Confederate statues and anti-black racism...a core part of the story.\" But \"lost sight of the specific history behind the Nazi flags that flapped beside them.\"\n\nAnd then on Thursday, the President tweeted an incendiary video about a murderous undocumented immigrant.\n\nDorothy Brown. She noted Justice Department stats that show whites had more to fear from one another when it comes to crime. But \"facts don't matter now; Trump has a midterm to win.\" \"Racism is a helluva drug,\" wrote law professor.

Geas tried to make his name in the mob by showing he was a cold-blooded killer. He did it\u2014and wound up in a prison with Whitey Bulger. But let's let Honig The homicidal Boston mobster Whitey Bulger, 89, was beaten to death on Tuesday--a day after he was transferred to a federal prison in Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. One suspect, the Boston Globe first reported, is a Massachusetts mafia hitman, Fotios Geas, known as Freddy. \"In 2011, I tried and convicted Geas, along with his brother Ty Geas and their mafia boss Arthur 'Artie' Nigro for a string of vicious murders,\" wrote, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. Geas tried to make his name in the mob by showing he was a cold-blooded killer. He did it\u2014and wound up in a prison with Whitey Bulger. But let's let Honig tell the remarkable story...\n\nThe \"caravan\" may just be a minivan\n\nAll week the President bounced around the country trying to fend off a \"blue wave,\" and whipping up fears over the dwindling group of migrants from Central America, most of them children, who are in southern Mexico and walking this way\u2014an \"invasion,\" Trump said.\n\nDavid Gergen and James Piltch. We should But that's a fallacy wrapped in a fiction, arguedand. We should take a lesson from Mexico. \"Since 2010, the flow of undocumented Mexican immigrants has decreased significantly.\" That's partly because life in Mexico improved, they wrote, and we should try to help Central America do the same -- \"create better and safer opportunities for the citizens of these countries. We should not cut aid; we should increase it.\"\n\nAlice Driver, traveling with the migrants, and pausing in Juchit\u00e1n, Mexico, , traveling with the migrants, and pausing in Juchit\u00e1n, Mexico, lamented how \"Trump has tried to erode\" faith in America as a \"refuge to those fleeing extreme violence and poverty.\" \"A hungry, tired mass of migrants with sunburned faces and bleeding feet\" is not something to fear.\n\nRich Lowry, in the National Review, said Trump may be distorting the caravan as a menace for midterm advantage, but he But, in the National Review, said Trump may be distorting the caravan as a menace for midterm advantage, but he \"gets the big point right: We have borders, and should enforce them.\"\n\nFox's Lou Dobbs problem?\n\nJen Psaki, Fox re-aired a segment of Lou Dobbs' show, in which Chris Farrell, from the conservative group Judicial Watch, said the \"Soros occupied State Department\" funded the migrant caravan. Fox Business later condemned the remarks. Democracy is suffering from the \" Hours after a gunman shot dead 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue, wrote, Fox re-aired a segment of Lou Dobbs' show, in which Chris Farrell, from the conservative group Judicial Watch, said the \"Soros occupied State Department\" funded the migrant caravan. Fox Business later condemned the remarks. Democracy is suffering from the \" partnership between a serial liar now occupying the oval office and a major news network that has evolved from the voice of the conservative movement to a forum for racist and divisive conspiracy rants,\" she says.\n\nAlisyn Camerota, who worked at Fox before coming to CNN. In a 2016 meeting with candidate Trump, he congratulated her on the move, but complained that now she was \"being mean\" to him. \"I tried to explain the role of the free press ...

in power.\n\nOn the eve of the 2018 midterms, unemployment is at a nearly 50-year low and there are more jobs than unemployed people to fill them, which bodes well for the party in power. Still, wage growth has been slow, and the rising tide hasn't reached everyone: Only 38% of respondents to a Bankrate survey from October said their personal financial situations had improved over the two years Donald Trump has been President.\n\nAnd here's the thing: The economy isn't a monolith. Conditions vary across congressional districts, many of which still have pockets of poverty even a decade into America's recovery from recession, and have industries that variably benefit or suffer from tax cuts, tariffs, and regulatory change.\n\nOn the whole, according to an analysis by the Economic Innovation Group, close districts are in more diverse, faster-growing, and relatively healthy parts of the country \u2014 characteristics that more closely resemble safe Democratic seats than Republican ones.\n\nThat's why we're taking a look at five tight House races in five different states to see how local economic conditions are playing, as each candidate seeks to turn statistics to their advantage.\n\nThe Kentucky 6th\n\nIn some ways, Kentucky's 6th Congressional district is a microcosm of the whole state. It contains its second-largest city, Lexington, and the wealthy Thoroughbred country that surrounds it \u2014 as well as poor, rural counties still looking for their next economic driver now that the tobacco industry has shrunk to almost nothing.\n\nDemocratic challenger Amy McGrath, a political neophyte who leans heavily on her 24-year career as a fighter pilot in the Air Force, has tried to capture both realities in her campaign against three-term incumbent Andy Barr.\n\n\"We've had a strong recovery that started several years ago and has continued, but the working average people just aren't feeling it, they're having a tough time making ends meet,\" says Kentucky political consultant Kathy Groob . \"That's the message I've been hearing from her.\"\n\nMcGrath put out a detailed, 30-page economic plan aimed at transitioning Kentucky's economy away from coal and towards renewable resources like solar energy and high-tech agriculture. It emphasizes federal investments in transportation and broadband, harkening back to New Deal-era electricity projects that brought Appalachia into the 20th century.\n\nWhile distancing herself from party leaders like Nancy Pelosi, she hasn't shied away from taking progressive stances like supporting immigrants and a higher minimum wage. And at a time when Republican Governor Matt Bevin is trying to pare back the Medicaid expansion pushed through by his Democratic predecessor, McGrath promotes the creation of a public option under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 pointing out that as a member of the military, she had government-provided insurance for decades.\n\nRepublican incumbent Barr, meanwhile, has held up his success in bringing millions of dollars into the state for treating opioid addictions, which have ravaged the district's workforce. Although most of his television ads have either focused on his constituent service or slammed McGrath for her stances on abortion and funding for a border wall, his one video about the economy centers on tax cuts passed last year.\n\nThat's not much insulation for another big issue facing the district: The trade war. Central Kentucky had scaled up its bourbon production to supply the thirsty Chinese market, and has been hit hard by duties imposed in response to Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel. Soybean farmers have been nearly locked out of the Chinese market as well.\n\nTaking heat on tariffs from McGrath in their only debate , Barr said that he supported a bill that would give more trade powers to Congress. But that may not end up speaking louder than his joint appearance with President Trump in October in the district. \"With Donald Trump and this congress, Kentuckians have found hope,\" Barr said.\n\nThe Texas 7th\n\nAlthough it may just look like a 13-lane highway lined with glassy office parks that fade into sleepy, low-slung bungalows, Houston's 7th District is the nerve center of the oil industry.\n\nEnergy giants like BP and Shell call the corridor home, and their engineers and project managers live in some of the state's wealthiest neighborhoods surrounding their corporate homes. These voters tend to be conservative, but also very pro-trade \u2014 something that Texas has seen the good side of, exporting $264 billion worth of goods in 2017\n\nOil and gas came roaring back from its two-year downturn and President Trump has done the industry many favors, but his brinksmanship on trade with Mexico and China have put Republican incumbent John Culberson in a tough enough spot that he skipped Trump's rally alongside Republican Senator Ted Cruz in Houston last month.\n\n\"Although they don't hold Culberson to blame for these trade issues,\" says University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus , \"the fact that the party become a stand-in for these policies may mean that those voters vote for a Democratic candidate, especially in a competitive cycle.\"\n\nAnd it is a competitive cycle. Democrats chose the relatively moderate Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a lawyer who has supported progressive social causes but also inoculated herself against charges of being against the oil industry by representing some of its largest corporate members.\n\nIn a district with a growing population of elderly voters, Pannill Fletcher has hammered Culberson on his many votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act along with its protections for pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut the key to this election may actually be in the top of the bizarrely G-shaped Seventh \u2014 less affluent neighborhoods that have welcomed enough Hispanic residents that they make up nearly a third of the district. Culberson has supported a zero-tolerance immigration policy that would deport all undocumented immigrants. According to campaign finance filings , his largest individual donor is the GEO Group, a private prison contractor.\n\n\"There are newer residents in the district's western tail who are struggling in a competitive economy,\" Rottinghaus says. \"They're more concerned about the minimum wage than tax cuts.\"\n\nThe Minnesota 1st\n\nOn paper, there aren't many places in America where the economy looks as healthy as in Minnesota's first congressional district, a double string of counties on the state's southern border that with few exceptions have an unemployment rate under 3%.\n\nThe district includes fast-growing cities like Mankato and Rochester, home to the elite Mayo Clinic and its nearly 35,000 employees.\n\nBut in the redder, more rural parts of the district, towns and counties have had a hard time hanging on to young people, meaning there are more jobs available than unemployed workers . Along with agriculture, the area has a large manufacturing presence, which according to an industry survey is still doing well financially but running into a growth ceiling because of the lack of labor.\n\n\"You have a changing economy, more and more consolidation of farms, workforce aging, residents leaving,\" says University of Minnesota political science professor Eric Ostermeier . \"So even though the unemployment rate is very low, you have this insecurity taking place in certain pockets.\"\n\nAlong with being more socially conservative, Ostermeier says, that leaves rural residents open to arguments about illegal immigration and a modern economy that has left them behind.\n\nRepublican Jim Hagedorn , the son of a former Minnesota congressman who's on his third run for the seat, is using that to make a play for the agricultural vote in an effort to flip the seat, currently held by Democrat Tim Walz, who's running for governor. In an interview with the Winona Chamber of Commerce, Hagedorn said his mission in Washington would be to support farmers and rural communities, and expressed confidence that Trump's trade policies would eventually open up export markets for their crops.\n\nHere again, Trump's trade policies may be more of a liability than an asset for the Republican. In a SurveyUSA poll of the district fielded in October, 53% of respondents said they disagreed with his tariffs, since farmers had ended up as collateral damage.\n\nHagedorn has tied himself to the President in other ways, appearing with him at a rally in Rochester and supporting his immigration policies, like a border wall with Mexico and and end to so-called \"sanctuary cities\" \u2014 despite the fact that immigrants are often the only new source of labor Minnesota has available.\n\nHis Democratic opponent Dan Feehan \u2014 an army combat veteran who became a schoolteacher and then a high-ranking Pentagon official under President Obama \u2014 has fended off false attacks that he favors \"open borders,\" when he has only said he supports a path to citizenship for those living here already.\n\nFeehan's support for universal health coverage, meanwhile, may help him in a district where 30% say healthcare is their top concern \u2014 especially in hospital-heavy Rochester. But Feehan is trying to cover his rural bases too, by saying he wants to promote investments in infrastructure, provide access to affordable secondary education in order to help people adapt to an evolving economy , and support renewable energies like wind and solar, which can be a lifeline for farmers when crops aren't paying the bills.\n\nThe Illinois 6th\n\nVoters in Illinois' Republican-held 6th district have little reason to be upset with what President Trump has done for their personal finances. With a median income as high as any we've looked at so far, businesses in the wealthy suburbs west of Chicago saw hefty tax cuts \u2014 but the relatively moderate voters in this traditionally blue state are increasingly frustrated at Republicans closer to home, giving almost any credible Democrat an opening.\n\n\"Illinois is lagging behind the US, but locally, there is a very strong sense that state government is dysfunctional and to blame,\" says University of Illinois political science professor Brian Gaines. \"National Republicans get some credit, and state-level politicians from both parties have failed.\"\n\nGaines says that incumbent Republican Representative Peter Roskam may suffer by association with Republican governor Bruce Rauner, who's the least popular state executive up for re-election this year, according to a poll by Morning Consult.\n\n\"If Roskam succeeds in making people think about taxes as they vote, I think he can win,\" Gaines added. \"The big drag for him is the weakness of support for Trump in Chicago suburbs, the poor showing by Rauner at the top of the ticket, and a general 'time for a change' sentiment.\"\n\nThat's why the 6-term congressman is trying to tie his opponent, scientist and businessman Sean Casten, to the powerful Democratic Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan on the stump and in campaign ads\n\nRoskam takes full credit for strong economic growth numbers, while distancing himself from President Trump, whose performance he rated as \"good on the economy, jumbling on other issues\" at a July debate.\n\nUnlike some Republicans, who may have noted polling that shows Americans overall see their recent tax cuts as skewed to the wealthy, Roskam talks up the law frequently \u2014 although its cap on the deduction for state and local taxes reduces benefits for people in relatively high-tax Illinois.\n\nCasten has private-sector cred, having co-founded a company with his father that used wasted heat from industrial facilities to generate power before he sold it in 2016. In the moderate, business-friendly district, he casts himself as practical and solutions-oriented , saying the tax cuts will exacerbate inequality and do nothing to move America towards modern industries that will buoy economic growth down the road.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like he's betting on that to carry the race.\n\n\"If you listen to him, he jumps from his personal expertise area of clean energy to generic Democratic issues like health care pretty fast,\" Gaines notes.\n\nThe Pennsylvania 1st\n\nMost of Pennsylvania's first district, which was refashioned this year from most of the former 8th district, falls within Bucks County. But Bucks County itself contains multitudes.\n\nThe lower part, on the border with Trenton, New Jersey, is more industrial and traditionally Democratic \u2014 the home of a U.S. Steel plant called Fairless Works that has shrunk to a shadow of its former self. Moving further north, the county gets more affluent and Republican, full of bedroom communities for people who work in Philadelphia or Princeton, New Jersey.\n\nChristopher Nicholas , a veteran Republican political consultant working on several state house races this cycle, doesn't expect that pattern to change much in this race, which pits incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick against Democratic challenger Scott Wallace in the newly drawn district, much of which went for Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\"Lower Bucks would be prime to go for Wallace. Upper Bucks would be prime to go for Fitzpatrick,\" Nicholas says. \"To me the big question is central Bucks \u2014 all those folks are Republican or Republican-leaning but really turned off by the President.\"\n\nThat's why Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent, is trying to run in as anti-partisan a way as he can. He touts his membership in the Problem Solver's Caucus, a bipartisan group of House members who try to advance non-ideological policies. He voted against the GOP's failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act last fall and says he doesn't want to touch Medicare or Social Security. He's brought in a boatload of union endorsements as well as support from the US Chamber of Commerce and National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nNow a professional philanthropist whose eponymous foundation has championed reproductive rights and environmental causes worldwide, Wallace's sharpest criticisms of Fitzpatrick have to do with his vote for the Republican tax cuts. According to an analysis by the Morning Call, Bucks County residents will likely lose more than the state average because of the tax bill's cap on the state and local tax deduction.", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama traded blow after blow as they crossed the country in the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nIn Georgia and Tennessee on Sunday, Trump touted a humming economy, and in a message designed to drive the Republican base to the polls, stoked fear of what a Democratic takeover of Congress would mean on cultural issues like immigration.\n\nIn Indiana and Illinois, Obama lambasted Republicans for \"blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying\" about their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with preexisting conditions. He accused Trump of fear-mongering over a group of migrants headed toward the US-Mexico border. And he cast Trump and the GOP congressional majorities as corrupt.\n\n\"America is at a crossroads,\" Obama said in Indiana. \"The character of our country is on the ballot.\"\n\nDemocrats are expected to make major gains in the House -- potentially taking majority control of the chamber -- and to win back governors' offices and state legislatures that the GOP used to draw districts and pass voting laws that locked in their congressional majority during Obama's tenure in office.\n\nThe current and former presidents crossed paths over the weekend in Florida and Georgia, with Obama visiting Miami and Atlanta on Saturday and Trump visiting Pensacola on Saturday and Macon on Sunday. The two states each have crucial governor's races with progressive, African American Democrats -- Georgia's Stacey Abrams and Florida's Andrew Gillum -- running against two staunch Trump allies, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp and former Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis. In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott is also challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nTrump rallies the GOP base\n\nBeyond the Southern battlegrounds, Trump's schedule was focused on turning out Republican voters in states he won in 2016 where the GOP hopes to knock off incumbent Democratic senators. He visited Montana on Saturday and Tennessee on Sunday; on Monday, he'll stop in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nHe largely stayed away from swing states and districts where the President is unpopular enough that a last-minute visit would have backfired and galvanized Democratic voters. But in Tennessee, he couldn't help but shout out the Republican Senate candidate in Arizona, Rep. Martha McSally, who faces Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\n\"Arizona -- McSally! McSally!\" he said. \"She's great. She's great! McSally, Arizona!\"\n\nHeaded into elections that will largely be a referendum on the first two years of his own presidency, Trump cast doubt on the prospect of a \"blue wave\" that would wipe out GOP congressional majorities.\n\n\"But you better get out and vote,\" he said. \"Otherwise I'm going to look very bad with this statement.\"\n\nTrump remained focused on a fear-mongering cultural message -- repeating his claims about a group of migrants hundreds of miles from the US-Mexico border posing a threat to the United States.\n\n\"You saw that barbed wire going up. That barbed wire -- yes sir, we have barbed wire going up. Because you know what? We're not letting these people invade our country,\" he said in Georgia.\n\nTrump also falsely claimed Democrats are urging \"caravan after caravan\" to head to the border and vaguely referenced conspiracy theories about the migrant group, saying, \"Ask yourself, how do you think they formed?\"\n\nObama courts minority voters\n\nObama, meanwhile, sought to turn out black voters in Gary, Indiana -- a city next door to Chicago where Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly needs strong turnout Tuesday -- and in his hometown of Chicago, where Democrats hope to oust a Republican governor and several House members.\n\nHe responded forcefully to Trump's rhetoric about the group of migrants, comparing it to Republicans stoking fears about Ebola prior to the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nObama told supporters in Gary, \"Don't be hoodwinked. Don't be bamboozled. Don't let them run the okey-doke on you.\"\n\n\"Because while they are trying to distract you with all this stuff, they are robbing you blind,\" Obama said. \"They'll be like: 'Look, look, look! Caravan, caravan!' Then they're giving tax cuts to their billionaire friends. 'Look, look, look! Whatever is the thing scary.' And then they're sabotaging your health care. You can't fall for it.\"\n\nObama cast the Trump administration and Republicans who have held control of all of Washington's levers of power for the last two years as corrupt.\n\n\"They promised they were gonna take on corruption in Washington. Instead they've racked up enough indictments to field a football team,\" Obama said.\n\nThe Democrats make their case\n\nTrump's potential 2020 Democratic rivals were on the campaign trail Sunday as well.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris was rallying support for House candidates in California. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was at home trying to help Sen. Bob Menendez past a corruption scandal and over the finish line. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was campaigning in her home state for her own re-election.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden campaigned in Pennsylvania, where Democrats hope to win several House seats while keeping a Senate seat and the governor's office.\n\nHe pointed to the recent synagogue shooting, as well as mailed bombs, and a grocery store shooting that targeted African Americans. \"We are in a battle for America's soul,\" Biden said in Harrisburg.\n\nIn Florida, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee in another marquee governor's race, responded to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue calling the race \"cotton-pickin' important\" at a campaign event Saturday for Gillum's Republican rival, Rep. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\"He should go back to Georgia, we'll take care of Florida,\" Gillum said, adding that he is seeking to end the race \"on a high note\" and give voters something \"they can vote for and not just against.\"\n\n\"And it seems that Mr. DeSantis and his supporters can't get my name out of their mouth enough, long enough, to talk about what they want to do proactively and affirmatively for the people in the state of Florida,\" Gillum said.\n\nGillum, accompanied by singer Jimmy Buffett, campaigned in West Palm Beach alongside Democratic Sen.

The Trump administration announced on Friday that temporary waivers have been granted for some of Iran's oil buyers, allowing them to keep buying oil from Iran even when sanctions return on Monday. It represents a softer approach than some feared.\n\n\"The decision to grant waivers is quite logical as too big an initial loss in supply would have pushed prices sharply higher,\" Damien Courvalin, head of energy research at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients on Thursday, \"going against the US administration's effort to keep a lid on gasoline prices.\"\n\nAnd third, Texas and Saudi Arabia have stepped up to the plate to ease fears of a shortage of oil. US oil output, led by the Permian Basin in West Texas, spiked above 11 million barrels per day in August for the first time ever.\n\n\"There's been astonishing production growth from the States,\" said Matt Badiali, senior research analyst at Banyan Hill Research, which specializes in oil and commodities. \"We're in uncharted territory.\"\n\nAll of this has silenced talk of $100 a barrel oil.\n\nThe oil plunge came just in time for the midterm elections in the United States. The national average gasoline price is down 3% over the past month, according to AAA . Prices at the pump lag behind oil, suggesting cheaper gas is on the way.\n\nBut some analysts are warning that oil prices are likely to renew their surge. Goldman Sachs and RBC Capital Markets are calling for Brent crude to end the year at $80 a barrel, 10% above current levels.\n\nCourvalin cautioned that Iran's oil shipments, which stood at nearly 3 million barrels a day in May, will keep dwindling as buyers wean themselves off. He expects exports to slide to 1.15 million barrels per day by year end and then 1 million in early 2019.\n\nThat could be a problem because there's substantial doubt that the United States and Saudi Arabia can make up for the lost Iranian barrels. Saudi Arabia's recent output hikes leave the kingdom with less room to respond to future problems.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is producing flat-out. They are maxed out,\" said Badiali.\n\nIn other words, there may be less firepower just as Iran's exports continue to shrink.\n\n2. Election day: The American midterm elections are happening on Tuesday. If Democrats take control of the House, The American midterm elections are happening on Tuesday. If Democrats take control of the House, what will happen to stocks\n\nOne fear is that a big win for the Democrats could lead to proposals to dial back President Donald Trump's tax cuts. Or at a minimum, this would end efforts to extend the tax cuts on individuals that are set to expire in 2025.\n\nCNN's Harry Enten predicts in The Forecast that Democrats will win a 17-seat majority in the House but Republicans will maintain their slight edge in the Senate. A rollback on Trump's tax bill likely won't happen -- but a new tax cut is equally unlikely. A split decision from the midterms would probably keep America's fiscal, trade and regulatory policies on the same trajectory.\n\n3. Goodbye October: October was a October was a frightening month for investors around the world, so investors are cheering that it's finally November.\n\nFears about slowing growth, trade wars and higher interest rates all pushed global markets sharply lower. So, what's in store for this month? Brian Belski, chief investment strategist for BMO Capital Markets, recently told CNN Business he thinks October was just a \"correction within a very large secular longer-term bull market.\"\n\nThe US economy is still enjoying brisk growth and Corporate America is making gobs of money, even if it's at a slower pace.\n\nRising rates weighed heavily on the markets the past couple months, however, so investors will be closely watching the Fed, which meets Wednesday, for any signs of faster or steeper interest rate hikes.\n\n4. Digital earnings: Etsy, Yelp, Zillow, TripAdvisor, GoDaddy and Match Group all report earnings this week.\n\nIAC will report its quarterly finances on Wednesday. The Tinder-owner is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the dating app's co-founders over its valuation. Earlier this month, IAC asked a judge to throw it out because they argues the co-founders were months too late to file such a suit.\n\nThe company has been on a hot streak this year, partly because of Tinder's popularity. The stock is up a whopping 63% this year.\n\n5. Media mania: A catalog full of media earnings is due this week including reports from Altice, Paramount, Discovery, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Tribune Publishing, News Corp., AMC Entertainment, Gannett, McClatchy, E.W. Scripps and Walt Disney.\n\n21st Century Fox will also report earnings Wednesday, and investors will be keen to hear the latest on its Disney deal and what the \"New Fox\" will look like under Lachlan Murdoch. Fox's $70 billion sale of some of its entertainment division to Disney will be completed in the coming weeks. The \"New Fox,\" which will consist of Fox, Fox News and Fox Sports, is attempting to shield itself from cord-cutters and focus on live news and sports. The stock is up 30% for the year.\n\n6.

of blasphemy after almost eight years on death row, has fled the country in fear for his life, an associate told CNN on Sunday.\n\nAsia Bibi's acquittal last week prompted violent protests by the Islamist movement Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP), and on Friday her lawyer Saiful Malook told CNN he was concerned for his life.\n\nTwo days later, an associate who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CNN that Malook had left the country \"for Europe.\"\n\nSupporters of Tehreek-e-Labbaik chant slogans Wednesday during a protest against the acquittal of Asia Bibi in Lahore.\n\nHis departure comes as Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, begged the United Kingdom, the United States or Canada to grant his family asylum, in a video message seen by the Guardian.\n\nMasih also said he feared for his wife's safety in prison, and that the family had \"no security and are hiding here and there, frequently changing our location,\" in an interview with Germany's public broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW).\n\nHe added that the Supreme Court acquittal had initially \"created a ray of hope\" and that Bibi's family \"were excited that we would meet her soon.\"\n\n\"My daughters were dying to see her free,\" Masih told DW. But he said Bibi will now have to stay in prison until a review petition -- submitted by the Islamist movement TLP -- is decided.\n\nPakistani paramilitary soldiers stand guard outside the Supreme Court building in Islamabad on October 31.\n\nIn an effort to end protests, the government on Friday struck a deal with the TLP movement -- including agreeing not to oppose a review petition filed against the Supreme Court's judgment. The petition is not legally binding at this time.\n\nThe government also pledged not to oppose a TLP application to add Bibi to a list preventing her from leaving the country. And the government agreed to release everyone detained in connection with the protests.\n\nBibi's husband Masih told DW that the deal had \"sent a shiver down my spine.\"\n\n\"My family is frightened, my relatives are frightened and my friends are also frightened,\" he said, adding that the judges had \"delivered the verdict after taking into account all aspects of the case.\"\n\n'Taking revenge'\n\nBibi, a mother of five from Punjab province, was convicted of blasphemy in 2010 and sentenced to hang after she was accused of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during an argument a year earlier with Muslim colleagues.\n\nThe workers had refused to drink from a bucket of water Bibi had touched because she was not Muslim. At the time, Bibi said the case was a matter of women who didn't like her \"taking revenge.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, she won her appeal against the conviction and death sentence.\n\nThe TLP had previously vowed to take to the streets if Bibi were released, and large protests broke out in Islamabad and Lahore soon after the ruling was announced.\n\nUnder Pakistan's penal code, the offense of blasphemy is punishable by death or life imprisonment. Widely criticized by international human rights groups, the law has been used disproportionately against minority religious groups in the country and to go after journalists critical of the Pakistani religious establishment.\n\nBibi's case has attracted widespread outrage and support from Christians worldwide. Conservative Islamist groups in Pakistan have demanded the death penalty be carried out.", "\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0621 \u064a\u0636\u0627\u0647\u064a \u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629

morning.\n\nOr, more specifically, time to move clocks back one hour to mark the end of daylight saving time\n\nFor most Americans, when the clock struck 2 a.m. Sunday, it was 1 a.m. all over again, providing an extra hour to sleep, party or maybe go over that sample ballot before voting in Tuesday's midterms.\n\nThe change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time. The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa also do not recognize the change. (Florida lawmakers voted earlier this year to stop doing the time-change thing , but it still has to be OK'd by Congress before that takes effect there.)\n\nWhat it does\n\nFor those who have changed the digits on their clocks, the sun will seem to come up earlier in the morning and set earlier at night.\n\nNow there's lots of debate about whether this twice-a-year time change is even worth it. There are studies that say moving the clock ahead one hour in the spring to start daylight saving time puts you at a higher risk for strokes and heart attacks\n\nBut most of us really aren't that bothered by daylight saving time at all, according to a poll from Princeton Survey Research\n\nAnd there are some nice things about the move to standard time in the fall, beyond getting that extra hour. If we didn't set our clocks back, sunrise wouldn't be until 8:30 a.m. in many places. Falling back to standard time keeps the sunrise time a little closer to what we're accustomed to.\n\nHow it started\n\nThe idea for the time change came from legendary American inventor, statesman and founding father Ben Franklin who, in a 1784 letter to a French journal, suggested that Parisians could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they wouldn't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours.\n\nThe United States didn't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during World War I, again during World War II and then on a state-by-state basis in the years after the war. It became a national policy, with some tinkering, beginning in 1966. Dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well.\n\nOf course, the extra hour only lasts so long. Those who received it will have to give it back on March 10 when they \"spring forward\" and turn clocks ahead one hour.", "Jakarta (CNN) Divers searching for the wreckage of Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 can no longer hear a signal from the aircraft's missing cockpit voice recorder, the head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency said Sunday.\n\nDiving teams have been working to locate the device, commonly known as a black box, which could help investigators piece together the final moments of the brand-new Boeing 737 before it crashed, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nMuhammad Syaugi, head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency, Basarnas, told reporters in Jakarta Sunday that a \"ping\" from the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was heard Saturday but \"we don't hear the ping signal today.\"\n\n\"We checked that spot, located around 50 meters from the location of finding the first black box. But we can't find the CVR yet,\" Syaugi said.\n\nMeanwhile, the plane's first black box, the flight data recorder, was located Thursday, and investigators said it showed Flight 610 had performed 19 flights -- including its final flight.\n\nSix black box experts from four different countries were now analyzing the flight data recorder to piece together the last moments of the new Boeing 737 before it crashed.\n\nSyaugi said that the search operation had been extended and would continue through Wednesday.\n\nThe focus of continuing efforts will be to recover additional victim remains and to locate the CVR, he said.\n\nAnalysts say finding the cockpit voice recorder is imperative if investigators are to determine whether the crash has implications for other airlines collectively operating thousands of Boeing 737 flights around the world each day.\n\nThe ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610's flight data recorder was recovered from the Java Sea on Thursday.\n\nSearch for victims continues\n\nFlight 610 was supposed to take its passengers on a one-hour journey from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka. Instead it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff. The pilots had asked to turn around but didn't transmit an emergency call.\n\nAt least 65 body bags have been gathered since the start of the search-and-rescue operation, though each bag could contain remains of more than one person.\n\nInvestigators will have to rely on DNA samples to identify victims because of the condition and size of the remains found. Police have 181 DNA samples from victims' families and are working to match them to 272 human tissue samples.\n\nLisda Cancer, head of Disaster Victim Identification, told reporters Friday that just one person has been identified so far, a female, through a fingerprint.\n\nOn Wednesday, authorities started bringing relatives to the port to identify victims' personal belongings, which lay piled up next to cushions and other debris that appeared to be from the aircraft.\n\nEpi Syamsul Qomar, whose 24-year-old son was on the flight, broke down in tears when he recognized his son's shoe.\n\n\"I saw my son's black sneaker,\" he told CNN. \"I also saw his bank checkbook.\"\n\nBody bags are laid out at Jakarta's Tanjung Priok port on November 3.\n\nOne diver has died\n\nThe fast-moving currents and muddy waters of the crash site in the Java Sea have hindered recovery efforts since the plane came down Monday shortly after taking off from Jakarta.\n\nOn Saturday, Syaugi confirmed that one of the more than 100 divers involved in the search had died.\n\nSyahrul Anto, 48, was found unconscious Friday after his diving partner noticed he had disappeared, said Syaugi. He was immediately brought back to shore and was attended by doctors but Syaugi said that \"God had a different plan.\"\n\nAnto was a qualified, senior diver \"who devoted his life for our country,\" Syaugi said.\n\nSyaugi, who is responsible for the diving team, said those involved \"are very qualified divers, outstanding divers, with long experience. They are come from Navy special task forces, from the police, from the Basarnas team, and some are volunteers from diving clubs.\"\n\nIndonesian navy personnel searching for victims and fuselage of Lion Air Flight 610 Sunday.\n\nPilot reported plane issues\n\nThe jetliner had experienced technical issues the day before on another route, passengers aboard that flight revealed to CNN.\n\nOn Sunday the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft -- a new plane, which had only around 800 flying hours on the clock -- had flown Lion Air's Bali-Jakarta route and had experienced a significant drop in altitude, passenger Robbi Gaharu said.\n\n\"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" said Gaharu, adding that he had confirmed the height of the drop on a flight-tracking website. He said the drop felt like falling into \"a really, really deep hole.\"\n\nLion Air confirmed to CNN that the aircraft that crashed on Monday had been used to fly the JT43 Bali-Jakarta route the day before, and Indonesian authorities confirmed that the pilot on Sunday's flight reported a problem with one of the plane's instruments.\n\nCapt. Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi, managing director of Lion Group, said that all information had been handed over to Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Commission and he could not answer any questions about the fault because of a nondisclosure agreement signed to accommodate the investigation.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

harassing women in the area, according to police, and reportedly made misogynistic remarks on YouTube videos.\n\nIn one instance, he was accused of slapping, grabbing and shaking a 19-year-old woman's backside at a Tallahassee apartment complex's swimming pool, but the case was not prosecuted.\n\nScott Paul Beierle, 40, posed as a customer when he walked into Hot Yoga Tallahassee on Friday evening and fired a handgun without warning, police said.\n\nThe yoga students fought back, police said, but two women were killed and five people were wounded. The gunman had fatally shot himself by the time officers arrived, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.\n\nAuthorities say it's not clear why he carried out the attack. Investigators have not discovered any links so far between the gunman and the victims or the yoga studio, DeLeo said. On Saturday, police searched Beierle's home in Deltona and his electronic devices for clues.\n\nBeierle, who was staying at a local hotel before the attack, was visiting the city but was no stranger to Florida's capital. He graduated from Florida State University and police said he had been \"the subject of prior calls for service in the Tallahassee area related to harassment of young women.\"\n\nIn videos posted to YouTube in 2014, the man decried interracial relationships, slammed women who wouldn't date him and identified with \"involuntary celibates,\" or \"incels,\" according to The New York Times. CNN has not verified the man in the videos is the gunman.\n\nPast arrests\n\nA search of Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Leon County Circuit Court clerk records shows that FSU campus police arrested Beierle in 2012 on a battery charge and in 2014 on a trespassing charge. Tallahassee police arrested him in 2016, again on a battery charge.\n\nRecords from the first two cases were not immediately available, but the clerk's office said the charge in the 2012 case was dropped, and the 2014 case was disposed of via \"other pretrial intervention.\" A spokesman for the city of Tallahassee said he had no information on the campus arrests.\n\nIn a June 1, 2016, case, Tallahassee police responded to the clubhouse of an apartment complex swimming pool where a woman, 19, told an officer that a tenant at the complex had touched her butt, according to a police report.\n\nThe teen was at the pool alone sunbathing when the tenant, later identified a Beierle, sat down next to her and told her she had a \"nice butt,\" the report says.\n\n\"She thanked him and he offered to put sunscreen on it. She told him no thank you, she did not need it,\" the report says.\n\nHe then asked for her name, she obliged and Beierle \"then slapped her butt, and grabbed it then shook it\" before hastily exiting the pool area, according to the report.\n\nThe victim initially did not want to press charges, the report says, but changed her mind the next day. As detailed in a second police report, the responding officer returned to the complex to view surveillance video, which backed up the victim's allegations.\n\nBeierle was charged with battery. A Leon County clerk record indicates the case was dismissed in May 2017.\n\nGunman made misogynistic rants, reports say\n\nIn the videos, Beierle recounted instances in which he was rejected by women, The Times reported.\n\n\"Made one date, didn't show up,\" he said of one woman. \"Made another date, didn't show up. Kept making excuses. Ah, I could've ripped her head off.\"\n\nPolice said people fought the man who walked into a Tallahassee, Florida, yoga studio and opened fire.\n\n\"I don't think a female can ever understand the societal pressure that's put on an adolescent male to unburden himself of this stigma that society's put on him,\" he said. \"This virginity burden.\"\n\nThe videos had titles like, \"Plight of the Adolescent Male\" and \"Dangers of Diversity.\"\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Beierle was sympathetic toward Elliot Rodger , who killed six people and wounded 14 others in 2014 near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Rodger had written a manifesto in which he lamented his virginity, which he blamed on the \"cruelness of women.\"\n\nBeierle said that as an adolescent he could relate to \"this endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration,\" The Times reported.\n\nIf the man in the video is Beierle, it wouldn't be the first time this year an act of violence was perpetrated by someone who hailed Rodger.\n\nAccording to police, minutes before Alek Minassian killed 10 people in a Toronto van rampage, he posted a Facebook message, saying, \"All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!\" Minassian also stated his desire to \"overthrow\" all the \"Chads and Stacys,\" incel vernacular for good-looking men and women.\n\nMatthew Rodin, left, and Susan Turner comfort Melissa Hutchinson who rendered aid to some of the victims.\n\nThe incel movement is made up almost wholly of men who \"can't have sex despite wanting to\" and feel as if they're unfairly denied sex because they're unattractive or awkward, according to incels.me.\n\n\"In practice this goes beyond simply having sex and enters the realm of having no possibility of finding a partner, either to get validation, love, or acceptance from,\" the site states.\n\nDoctor 'touched countless lives'\n\nTallahassee yogis as well as the health care and college communities are mourning the two women killed in Friday's shooting: Maura Binkley, 21, and Nancy Van Vessem, 61.\n\n\"Although this shooting happened off campus, it has deeply touched the Florida State University family with two deaths and several injuries. To lose a faculty member and a student and have others injured in this senseless and violent way is absolutely devastating,\" Florida State President John Thrasher said in a statement Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday evening, FSU students and faculty came together for a vigil honoring Van Vessem and Binkley.\n\nThe crowd gathered on Langford Green on Sunday evening and held up battery-powered tea candles that flickered under an overcast sky as a small choir sang, \"Hymn to the Garnet and Gold.\"\n\nMaura Binkley and Nancy Van Vessem.\n\nBinkley \"knew how to work with people in a positive way,\" her father, Jeff Binkley, told CNN.\n\n\"She just radiated love for everybody. You could see her life shines through just about everybody she met. That's consolation to us.\"\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting in February, Binkley stood up against gun violence and went to the Florida Capitol to support the Parkland students as they lobbied for change.\n\n\"And she became a victim,\" Jeff Binkley said. \"It's a cruel irony. A cruel irony.\"\n\nThe young woman grew up in the Atlanta area and was attending Florida State University, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority.\n\nAfter spending the summer studying in Germany, Binkley was back for what would have been her last year in school. She planned to graduate in May with a double major in English and German, according to her family.\n\n\"It's an attack on good. It's an attack on peace. It's an attack on love,\" her father said of the shooting. \"It's an attack on the positive elements and values of life.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Multiple victims in yoga studio shooting Replay More Videos ...

Why are the caravans happening? Is this going to be the new thing out there?' \"\n\nBut Selee said one thing didn't come up as they tried to sort out the situation: the US midterm elections.\n\n\"I was in three meetings on migration where the caravan was talked about. ... Not one person mentioned that,\" Selee said. \"It's just not on anyone's mind.\"\n\nTweets from President Donald Trump, a rash of conspiracy theories and rapidly escalating political rhetoric in the lead-up to a major vote north of the border aren't what's piquing experts' interest in the large groups of migrants moving through Mexico.\n\nBut questions about what's happening, why it's happening and why it's happening now are.\n\n\"We're all trying to make sense of it,\" Selee said.\n\nExperts: US election has nothing to do with it\n\nExperts say many factors are likely contributing to migrants' decisions to leave Central American countries. But establishing exactly why more large groups appear to be forming now is more difficult to pinpoint.\n\n\"It's hard to explain all this. It's hard to figure out what the reason is,\" Selee said.\n\nBut there's one thing experts agree on.\n\n\"To see this as somehow timed one way or another to influence the US midterm elections is a mistake,\" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n\n\"It is, without a doubt, having an impact on shaping the pre-election climate, and President Trump is making absolutely conscious and concerted efforts to inject this issue into the campaign, where he knows the Republican base cares deeply about it, but I see the timing as a coincidence.\"\n\nMike Allison, a professor at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania who studies Central America, also said looking at the formation of migrant groups through the lens of US elections is missing the point.\n\n\"This is simply the latest manifestation of a crisis that's really affecting the entire Americas,\" Allison said, citing drug trafficking, organized crime, corruption and the absence of democracy as underlying causes. Climate change also has started to fuel more migration, he said, as drier conditions in some areas have decimated crops.\n\n'A human tragedy'\n\nCrowds started gathering outside a bus station in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, in mid-October, drawing attention from local TV stations as they prepared to make the trek to the United States. Local officials and the US Embassy in Tegucigalpa issued statements encouraging would-be migrants to turn back.\n\nBut the group continued on its journey, crossing through Guatemala and making it to Mexico.\n\nBy then, it had swelled in size -- numbering more than 7,000 people, according to estimates from authorities at the time.\n\nIn Honduras, President Juan Orlando Hernandez and his administration said political opponents trying to destabilize the government were behind the so-called caravan.\n\nAttention zeroed in on an activist and former congressman from Honduras who had been traveling with the migrants and posting updates about their journey. Bartolo Fuentes maintained he wasn't an organizer and described the group's formation as spontaneous.\n\n\"You are giving me some kind of superpower,\" he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol when asked whether he had organized the caravan. \"There are people in this march from places I've never even been to. ... It's absurd to think that someone can convince all these people. ... These are simply excuses because here the government doesn't want to recognize that we have a human tragedy that people no longer can bear.\"\n\nThe group's size, he said, represented an accumulation of the same number of migrants who would ordinarily leave Honduras bit by bit, usually in much smaller groups, in any two-week period.\n\n\"Every day people leave for the United States,\" Fuentes said. \"The difference is, they leave in hiding. No one notices.\"\n\nConspiracy theories surge\n\nThe group's size -- notably larger than those of other migrants who have banded together on the journey north -- drew swift attention in the United States, prompting threats from Trump to slash foreign aid if migrants didn't return home.\n\nThe absence of an organizer leading the group, or a clear explanation of how it had formed, left a void quickly filled by conspiracy theories, baseless claims and political attacks.\n\nTrump described the group's advance as an assault on US borders, argued its members were exploiting loopholes in asylum laws and claimed -- without evidence -- that Middle Easterners were in its ranks.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security said it knew of 270 migrants in the group with criminal histories but didn't specify how it learned that information.\n\nRumors spread through tweets and Facebook posts that were swiftly shared, amplifying the message. An investigation by USA Today found that the Soros conspiracy theory had spread to hundreds of millions of social media users.\n\nBut the seeds of these conspiracy theories didn't stay in the Twittersphere.\n\nThe suspect in the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue railed against Jews on social media, blaming them for the caravan's advance. Then he allegedly headed to the synagogue and opened fire.\n\nTrekking in flip-flops and broken sneakers\n\nAfter a week traveling with the caravan, CNN witnessed little, if any, organization.\n\nPeople joined and left the group at will. Exhausted by the journey, many decided to return home.\n\nMany migrants in the group told CNN they joined at the last minute after seeing messages on social media or local news stories that inspired them to leave behind a homeland where they had long ago given up on having a future.\n\nThey walked miles in flip-flops, rubber clogs and sneakers that were falling apart.\n\nFew appeared to have any funds. Most slept in the streets.\n\nThey told CNN they would have gone hungry if not for generous Mexicans and municipalities who offered them tamales and pineapple juice along the route.\n\nAnd they said they had no choice but to flee.\n\n\"There is no work anymore. The government took our lands,\" said Carlos Gomez, an out-of-work farmhand who said he's traveling to the United States to support his eight children back home.\n\nChantal Alejo, a 27-year-old transgender woman traveling with the group, said a post she saw on Facebook about the caravan made her immediately pack her bag for the journey.\n\n\"There's a lot of persecution,\" she said, \"and no work.\"\n\nThe big questions: Why? And why now?\n\nSuch motivations have spurred migrants traveling north for years. But the groups have been far smaller.\n\n\"This one really grew bigger than anyone could have expected,\" the Migration Policy Institute's Selee said.\n\nOne possible \"detonator,\" Selee said, was the caravan that crossed through Mexico in April . That group sparked Twitter tirades from Trump, which brought even more publicity, creating a \"demonstration effect,\" Selee said.\n\nIn the case of the large group that drew Trump's attention when it set out from Honduras last month, Allison, the professor, said it's possible other factors -- such as false rumors in a TV report about funds being available for food and transportation -- contributed to the group growing to such a significant size.\n\n\"Whether that's true or not,\" he said, \"you had probably thousands of people in Honduras who are considering going sometime in the next few months, or in the next year or two. It just changed their calculation about when the best time to go is.\"\n\nUsually migrants from Honduras pay smugglers thousands of dollars to guide them north. So the prospect of joining a group for free, and the reassurance of safety in numbers, is an enticing combination.\n\n\"On the one hand, it's got to be something really bad to make you walk from Honduras to the United States,\" he said. \"On the other hand, it's also, 'Hey, here's an opportunity for me, no matter how remote, that we might be able to get there without exposing ourselves to the financial risks and the personal risks that usually that would take.'\"\n\nAnother factor: political tensions in Honduras, where President Hernandez claimed victory after a disputed election last year.\n\n\"The political crisis isn't helping. I'm not sure it's the reason,\" Selee said. \"But it is both fertile ground for activists who want to organize people to leave, and it also may create one more element of instability.\"\n\nThe situation is complicated, Allison said.\n\n\"There are contradictory things that we're still trying to tease out about the root causes,\" he said.\n\nIn Honduras, for example, the murder rate -- one factor analysts typically cite when they study why people migrate -- has been declining.\n\nBut despite the lingering questions about these large groups forming, Allison said the most important thing to do right now isn't to pinpoint why they're leaving; it's to address the humanitarian crisis that's emerging as they make the trek\n\n\"These are people who really, with the information that they have available to them, have decided that this is their best opportunity. It's not something they take lightly. It's not something we should think they're being manipulated by Honduran politicians or US politicians to do,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to respond to what's happening with both compassion and level-headedness.\"", "(CNN) The man suspected of shooting two women at a Tallahassee, Florida, yoga studio had been accused of harassing women in the area, according to police, and reportedly made misogynistic remarks on YouTube videos.\n\nIn one instance, he was accused of slapping, grabbing and shaking a 19-year-old woman's backside at a Tallahassee apartment complex's swimming pool, but the case was not prosecuted.\n\nScott Paul Beierle, 40, posed as a customer when he walked into Hot Yoga Tallahassee on Friday evening and fired a handgun without warning, police said.\n\nThe yoga students fought back, police said, but two women were killed and five people were wounded. The gunman had fatally shot himself by the time officers arrived, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said.\n\nAuthorities say it's not clear why he carried out the attack. Investigators have not discovered any links so far between the gunman and the victims or the yoga studio, DeLeo said. On Saturday, police searched Beierle's home in Deltona and his electronic devices for clues.\n\nBeierle, who was staying at a local hotel before the attack, was visiting the city but was no stranger to Florida's capital. He graduated from Florida State University and police said he had been \"the subject of prior calls for service in the Tallahassee area related to harassment of young women.\"\n\nIn videos posted to YouTube in 2014, the man decried interracial relationships, slammed women who wouldn't date him and identified with \"involuntary celibates,\" or \"incels,\" according to The New York Times. CNN has not verified the man in the videos is the gunman.\n\nPast arrests\n\nA search of Florida Department of Law Enforcement and Leon County Circuit Court clerk records shows that FSU campus police arrested Beierle in 2012 on a battery charge and in 2014 on a trespassing charge. Tallahassee police arrested him in 2016, again on a battery charge.\n\nRecords from the first two cases were not immediately available, but the clerk's office said the charge in the 2012 case was dropped, and the 2014 case was disposed of via \"other pretrial intervention.\" A spokesman for the city of Tallahassee said he had no information on the campus arrests.\n\nIn a June 1, 2016, case, Tallahassee police responded to the clubhouse of an apartment complex swimming pool where a woman, 19, told an officer that a tenant at the complex had touched her butt, according to a police report.\n\nThe teen was at the pool alone sunbathing when the tenant, later identified a Beierle, sat down next to her and told her she had a \"nice butt,\" the report says.\n\n\"She thanked him and he offered to put sunscreen on it. She told him no thank you, she did not need it,\" the report says.\n\nHe then asked for her name, she obliged and Beierle \"then slapped her butt, and grabbed it then shook it\" before hastily exiting the pool area, according to the report.\n\nThe victim initially did not want to press charges, the report says, but changed her mind the next day. As detailed in a second police report, the responding officer returned to the complex to view surveillance video, which backed up the victim's allegations.\n\nBeierle was charged with battery. A Leon County clerk record indicates the case was dismissed in May 2017.\n\nGunman made misogynistic rants, reports say\n\nIn the videos, Beierle recounted instances in which he was rejected by women, The Times reported.\n\n\"Made one date, didn't show up,\" he said of one woman. \"Made another date, didn't show up. Kept making excuses. Ah, I could've ripped her head off.\"\n\nPolice said people fought the man who walked into a Tallahassee, Florida, yoga studio and opened fire.\n\n\"I don't think a female can ever understand the societal pressure that's put on an adolescent male to unburden himself of this stigma that society's put on him,\" he said. \"This virginity burden.\"\n\nThe videos had titles like, \"Plight of the Adolescent Male\" and \"Dangers of Diversity.\"\n\nAccording to the newspaper, Beierle was sympathetic toward Elliot Rodger , who killed six people and wounded 14 others in 2014 near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Rodger had written a manifesto in which he lamented his virginity, which he blamed on the \"cruelness of women.\"\n\nBeierle said that as an adolescent he could relate to \"this endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration,\" The Times reported.\n\nIf the man in the video is Beierle, it wouldn't be the first time this year an act of violence was perpetrated by someone who hailed Rodger.\n\nAccording to police, minutes before Alek Minassian killed 10 people in a Toronto van rampage, he posted a Facebook message, saying, \"All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger!\" Minassian also stated his desire to \"overthrow\" all the \"Chads and Stacys,\" incel vernacular for good-looking men and women.\n\nMatthew Rodin, left, and Susan Turner comfort Melissa Hutchinson who rendered aid to some of the victims.\n\nThe incel movement is made up almost wholly of men who \"can't have sex despite wanting to\" and feel as if they're unfairly denied sex because they're unattractive or awkward, according to incels.me.\n\n\"In practice this goes beyond simply having sex and enters the realm of having no possibility of finding a partner, either to get validation, love, or acceptance from,\" the site states.\n\nDoctor 'touched countless lives'\n\nTallahassee yogis as well as the health care and college communities are mourning the two women killed in Friday's shooting: Maura Binkley, 21, and Nancy Van Vessem, 61.\n\n\"Although this shooting happened off campus, it has deeply touched the Florida State University family with two deaths and several injuries. To lose a faculty member and a student and have others injured in this senseless and violent way is absolutely devastating,\" Florida State President John Thrasher said in a statement Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday evening, FSU students and faculty came together for a vigil honoring Van Vessem and Binkley.\n\nThe crowd gathered on Langford Green on Sunday evening and held up battery-powered tea candles that flickered under an overcast sky as a small choir sang, \"Hymn to the Garnet and Gold.\"\n\nMaura Binkley and Nancy Van Vessem.\n\nBinkley \"knew how to work with people in a positive way,\" her father, Jeff Binkley, told CNN.\n\n\"She just radiated love for everybody. You could see her life shines through just about everybody she met. That's consolation to us.\"\n\nAfter the Parkland shooting in February, Binkley stood up against gun violence and went to the Florida Capitol to support the Parkland students as they lobbied for change.\n\n\"And she became a victim,\" Jeff Binkley said. \"It's a cruel irony. A cruel irony.\"\n\nThe young woman grew up in the Atlanta area and was attending Florida State University, where she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority.\n\nAfter spending the summer studying in Germany, Binkley was back for what would have been her last year in school. She planned to graduate in May with a double major in English and German, according to her family.\n\n\"It's an attack on good. It's an attack on peace. It's an attack on love,\" her father said of the shooting. \"It's an attack on the positive elements and values of life.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Multiple victims in yoga studio shooting Replay More Videos ...

director for Florida's Capital Health Plan, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.\n\nShe was in charge of coordinating third- and fourth-year clerkship rotations in internal medicine at the school's medical school, according to the Florida State College of Medicine's website.\n\nIn a Facebook tribute, Big Bend Hospice in Tallahassee described her as \"a friend and a champion for end-of-life care.\"\n\nAt Sunday's vigil, Thrasher said Van Vessem's daughter said there had never been someone \"more selfless, more loving, supportive and fabulous\" than her mother.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "The daily drama of the Trump administration has triggered a surge of news consumption in the United States, but European media like Der Spiegel are experiencing a \"Trump bump\" as well.\n\nMathieu von Rohr, Der Spiegel's deputy foreign editor, says US President Donald Trump has dominated the news cycle.\n\n\"It's been a 24/7 news cycle regarding Trump. He is dominating Twitter, he is dominating the news. And he has, of course, dominated our Spiegel Online news website,\" the magazine's deputy foreign editor, Mathieu von Rohr, told CNN\n\n\"Trump still clicks, people are interested in those stories \u2014 and the same applies to our magazine stories and covers.\"\n\nAt Der Spiegel headquarters in Hamburg on Monday, journalists were working out how to cover the breaking news that longtime German Chancellor Angela Merkel was standing down as party chair after 18 years and would not seek re-election in 2021.\n\nIt is likely to be Germany's biggest political news story of the year, but on the foreign desk, von Rohr was looking to the US midterms elections next week.\n\nDer Spiegel's headquarters is seen in Hamburg.\n\nDer Spiegel is beefing up its staffing to support its six full-time correspondents in the United States for the vote. That wasn't considered during previous midterms, a biennial event in which Americans elect a new House of Representatives, as well as some senators and governors.\n\nBut these midterms are different . The elections are seen as a referendum on Trump that could strengthen or weaken his vision for a new world order.\n\nGermans love to hate Trump\n\nThe midterms are also a reminder that the president has been in power for nearly two years, and while interest in Trump spiked in Europe around his election, it has remained robust across the continent.\n\nUnlike in the United States, where Trump is a divisive figure, Germans overwhelmingly disapprove of the US president.\n\nThe Pew Center for Research's spring survey on global attitudes found a dramatic drop in confidence that Trump would do the right thing for the world in most European countries, when compared with Barack Obama.\n\nAt the end of Obama's presidency, Germany's confidence in the US president was 86%. Now German confidence in Trump is 10%. France went from 84% in Obama's final months to 9% now, while the United Kingdom dipped from 79% to 28%.\n\nYet the volume of online searches for Trump in the same countries is huge, according to data from analytics company SimilarWeb, which shows that Trump was by far the most searched-for person in the world over the past 12 months.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, more people searched for the American President than their own prime minister, Theresa May, or even Brexit, Google Trends data shows.\n\nBack in Germany, Trump was also more searched for than Merkel over the past year, according to SimilarWeb. This combination of disapproval and enormous interest in the president suggests an interesting dynamic \u2014 Germans love to hate Trump.\n\nHe has been the lead story in Der Spiegel many times. In one of the magazine's May editions -\u2014 with the cover of Trump as a middle finger \u2014 Der Spiegel devoted 16 pages to Trump stories, mostly related to the Iran deal. The landmark agreement was brokered by the Obama administration and European leaders, who took Trump's announcement as an affront.\n\nSusanne Beyer, Der Spiegel's deputy chief editor, defends her magazine's tough stance on Trump.\n\nDer Spiegel's deputy chief editor, Susanne Beyer, makes no apologies for the magazine's attention to Trump, nor its unflattering cartoons.\n\nShe defended Der Spiegel's most controversial cover, which depicted Trump wielding a knife and holding the bleeding head of the Statue of Liberty, as if he had just decapitated the powerful symbol of American freedom.\n\nThat image, next to the words \"America First,\" was published in February 2017 as Trump signed an executive order that barred people from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.\n\nSeveral politicians and newspapers in Germany criticized the cartoon as tasteless and violent.\n\nJohannes Unselt, a graphic designer at Der Spiegel, pulls up a controversial Trump cover.\n\n\"We stand by that cover. It's tough, but we believe that one has to be tough against Trump,\" Beyer said from her office, which looks out on the regenerated port area of Hamburg.\n\n\"That cover was done at the time after the Muslim ban and it is such an outrage to prevent people from entering the freest country in the world, ultimately because of their religion. So we thought, 'as tough as possible, as clear as possible.' After all, that is the language he speaks.\"\n\nA media 'obsession' with Trump\n\nTrump's travel ban and that cover seem like a lifetime ago, and a dizzying number of political developments have unfolded since. An investigation into the Trump campaign team's possible ties to Russia has produced indictments of former Trump campaign advisers.\n\nin 2018 that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid off by his lawyer to keep quiet before the 2016 election. Several senior White House officials have lost their jobs or quit. Adult film star Stormy Daniels publicly announcedin 2018 that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and was paid off by his lawyer to keep quiet before the 2016 election.\n\nThere are plenty more chapters to the Trump saga that haven't closed \u2014 and the foreign media are covering them all.\n\nRoland Schatz, founder and CEO of the Zurich-based analytics company Media Tenor International, points to the media's \"obsession\" with the Trump story as part of the reason for his rise and his continued prominence, even in Europe.\n\nStreet art of Donald Trump remains in one of the areas where protests were held during the G20 summit in Hamburg.\n\nHis company analyzed coverage from 100 global media organizations reporting on this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, and found that Trump received 15,000 of the nearly 76,000 mentions of people in relation to the conference.\n\nIn second place was the forum's chairman, Klaus Schwab, with just 1,900. He was followed by French President Emmanuel Macron, Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"Trump got almost all the visibility, and that was at the expense of a lot of great leaders,\" said Schatz. \"No one believed someone like Trump would win [the US election], and his actions now continue to give him a lot of visibility in the media.\"\n\nA view from inside the atrium of Der Spiegel's headquarters in Hamburg.\n\nFor Rodriguez, the artist behind Der Spiegel's provocative cartoons, his work on Trump is no obsession. He says he will continue to satirize the president until \"he is no longer a danger\" to the country.\n\n''There is nothing I like drawing about him. If he disappears tomorrow I would go back to drawing other things,\" he said.\n\nHe explained he was inspired to draw the cartoon of Trump decapitating the Statue of Liberty because the president had destroyed his personal American dream. He went to the United States as a boy on a boat fleeing Cuba, and the statue represented a land that welcomed outsiders.\n\n''I don't think the US is the same in the world's eyes anymore to what we used to be.

described the stakes of the Florida governor's election on Tuesday as being \"cotton-pickin' important\" at a campaign event on Saturday for Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis is running against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is African-American.\n\n\"Public policy matters. Leadership matters. And that is why this election is so cotton-pickin' important to the state of Florida,\" Perdue, a former governor of Georgia, told supporters in Lakeland. \"I hope you all don't mess it up.\"\n\nWhen asked on Sunday what his response was to Perdue's comment, Gillum laughed and told CNN, \"He should go back to Georgia. We'll take care of Florida.\"\n\n\"Listen, we're trying our very best to end this race on a high note,\" Gillum continued. \"As I have said throughout the campaign, we're working to give voters something that they can vote for and not just against.\"\n\nDeSantis' campaign did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Perdue's statement. In an email to Politico, which first reported the comments, a DeSantis spokesman said, \"We were happy to have (Perdue) in Polk County campaigning with us,\" but referred any questions to the secretary's office.\n\nEarlier this year, David Bossie, President Donald Trump's former deputy campaign manager, came under fire when he used the phrase \"cotton pickin'\" during an appearance on Fox News with an African-American guest.\n\nFox News host Ed Henry called the phrase \"obviously offensive\" and Bossie was reportedly suspended from the network over the comments.\n\nIn a statement, a Fox News spokesperson said \"David Bossie's comments today were deeply offensive and wholly inappropriate. His remarks do not reflect the sentiments of Fox News and we do not in any way condone them.\"\n\nIn a post written shortly after the Bossie incident, former Virginia Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote a response in part to Joel Payne, the strategist to whom Bossie made the remark. Webb wrote about the origins of the phrase \"cotton picker,\" and defended it as a long-used phrase in the South that had no racist connotation.\n\nDeSantis has faced criticism for his own past remarks, from the day after he won the August primary, when he went on Fox News to warn voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum in November. DeSantis denied his choice of words was racially motivated.\n\nThe comments from Perdue on Saturday were flagged by the liberal research group American Bridge and could further roil a contest that has frequently been visited by concerns over DeSantis' language and past affiliations, including one with a donor who called former President Barack Obama the n-word and another to anti-Muslim conservative political activist David Horowitz. DeSantis in August also left a racist Facebook group that listed him as an administrator, saying at the time he had been added to it without his knowledge.\n\n\"The congressman let us know exactly where he was going to take this race the day after he won the nomination,\" Gillum said during their first debate, hosted by CNN, on October 21. \"The 'monkey up' comment said it all and he's only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin.\"\n\nDuring their second meeting, DeSantis, when confronted with those unsavory connections claimed ignorance and lashed out at the moderator, asking, \"How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?\" before framing his refusal to apologize as defiance toward a hostile press.\n\n\"I am not going to bow down,\" he said, \"to the altar of media correctness.\"\n\nGillum, who had been watching on quietly, coldly dismissed DeSantis' explanation.\n\n\"My grandmother used to say, 'A hit dog will holler,' and it hollered through this room,\" he said, adding a moment later: \"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Gillum was targeted by racist robo-calls by a white supremacist group based in Idaho, which this week launched an attack on Stacey Abrams, who is also African-American and running for governor in Georgia.\n\nBoth DeSantis and Georgia GOP gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp immediately denounced the calls.", "(CNN) For its last show before the midterm elections, \"Saturday Night Live\" took on a familiar target: Fox News.\n\nThe cold open of NBC's variety show kicked off with Kate McKinnon playing Fox anchor Laura Ingraham as the host covered the march of migrants in Central America toward the US border.\n\n\"Good evening, I'm Laura Ingraham,\" McKinnon said. \"We're live from the Arizona border where a vicious caravan of dozens, maybe millions, of illegal immigrants are heading straight for you and your grandchildren.\"\n\nMcKinnon's Ingraham said that the liberal media was trying to label President Trump as a racist, but that \"except for his words and actions throughout his life\" that Trump isn't racist.\n\n\"All of a sudden the word 'nationalist' is bad,\" she said. \"The word 'white' is bad. The phrase 'white nationalist' is bad! When I hear the word, 'white nationalist' I just think of a fun Fourth of July barbecue that you don't have to call the cops on.\"\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)\u2014 \u0639\u0628\u0651\u0631 \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a\u060c \u0628\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0646\u062a\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0648\u060c \u0639\u0646 \u0634\u0643\u0631\u0647 \u0644\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0644\u062f \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628\u060c \u0644\u0625\u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0636\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d \"\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f - \u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0631\u0647\"\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0644\u0646\u062a\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0635\u0641\u062d\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u060c \u062a\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0631\u060c \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0642\u0627\u0644: \"\u0623\u0634\u0643\u0631 \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633 \u0628\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0628\u064a\u062a\u0633\u0628\u0631\u063a. \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0634\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u062d\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0639 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062a\u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \"\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062f\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f - \u0646\u062d\u0646 \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645\u0631\u0647\".\n\n\u0648\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0646\u062a\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u0646\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u064a\u0647: \"\u0627\u062f\u0639\u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0630 \u0633\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0626\u0646\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0623\u0643\u0645\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0636\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0647\u062f\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u060c \u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0627 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u064a\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u064a\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639 \u0648\u0646\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0626\u062c \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0636..\"\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0636\u0627\u0641: \"\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0643 \u0625\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0635\u0644\u062a \u062d\u0642\u0627..\"", "(CNN) Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue described the stakes of the Florida governor's election on Tuesday as being \"cotton-pickin' important\" at a campaign event on Saturday for Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis is running against Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is African-American.\n\n\"Public policy matters.

His remarks do not reflect the sentiments of Fox News and we do not in any way condone them.\"\n\nIn a post written shortly after the Bossie incident, former Virginia Democratic Sen. Jim Webb wrote a response in part to Joel Payne, the strategist to whom Bossie made the remark. Webb wrote about the origins of the phrase \"cotton picker,\" and defended it as a long-used phrase in the South that had no racist connotation.\n\nDeSantis has faced criticism for his own past remarks, from the day after he won the August primary, when he went on Fox News to warn voters not to \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum in November. DeSantis denied his choice of words was racially motivated.\n\nThe comments from Perdue on Saturday were flagged by the liberal research group American Bridge and could further roil a contest that has frequently been visited by concerns over DeSantis' language and past affiliations, including one with a donor who called former President Barack Obama the n-word and another to anti-Muslim conservative political activist David Horowitz. DeSantis in August also left a racist Facebook group that listed him as an administrator, saying at the time he had been added to it without his knowledge.\n\n\"The congressman let us know exactly where he was going to take this race the day after he won the nomination,\" Gillum said during their first debate, hosted by CNN, on October 21. \"The 'monkey up' comment said it all and he's only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin.\"\n\nDuring their second meeting, DeSantis, when confronted with those unsavory connections claimed ignorance and lashed out at the moderator, asking, \"How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?\" before framing his refusal to apologize as defiance toward a hostile press.\n\n\"I am not going to bow down,\" he said, \"to the altar of media correctness.\"\n\nGillum, who had been watching on quietly, coldly dismissed DeSantis' explanation.\n\n\"My grandmother used to say, 'A hit dog will holler,' and it hollered through this room,\" he said, adding a moment later: \"Now, I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Gillum was targeted by racist robo-calls by a white supremacist group based in Idaho, which this week launched an attack on Stacey Abrams, who is also African-American and running for governor in Georgia.\n\nBoth DeSantis and Georgia GOP gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp immediately denounced the calls.", "(CNN) When Simon Kindleysides crossed the finish line at the Virgin Money London Marathon this year, what followed was a blur -- but he became a \"superhero\" to his kids, and he set a world record in becoming the first paralyzed man to complete the race on foot.\n\nHe was the final finisher.\n\nWhen David Fraser crossed the finish line at the TCS New York City Marathon last year, it marked his 10th time completing that race, using his toes to push his wheelchair to the finish line.\n\nHe was the final finisher.\n\nWhen Amina Abdul-Jalil crossed the finish line this year at an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race, she never felt more proud.

MUST WATCH The history of running records 01:06\n\nThe world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance, Olympic medalist Shalane Flanagan broke the finish line tape at the New York City Marathon last year, becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.\n\nYet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia, director of the New York City Marathon , puts it, \"for every runner, there's a story.\"\n\n\"They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train,\" he said. \"Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring, from the first to the final finish.\"\n\nOn average, it takes bout 4\u00bd hours for men and women to complete a marathon, Ciaccia said, but that time can vary drastically among racers.\n\nIn honor of Sunday's New York City Marathon , where more than 50,000 people traveled through the five boroughs, here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.\n\nOne thing they have in common: They never gave up.\n\n'Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted'\n\nAs Simon Kindleysides, 34, took his first steps in the London Marathon in April, it felt as if magic was in the air.\n\n\"As we were walking toward the first mile, we actually started blending in with all the runners,\" he said. \"Everyone was on the streets, cheering, and that was a magical moment.\"\n\nAs time went on, the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking.\n\nSimon Kindleysides became the first paralyzed man to complete the 2018 Virgin Money London Marathon on foot.\n\nKindleysides, who is paralyzed from the waist down and typically uses a wheelchair , was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving.\n\n\"I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves, leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.\n\nBefore his paralysis, the London-based singer and dancer had \"always wanted to run a marathon,\" he said, but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year.\n\n\"Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted,\" Kindleysides said. \"You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on.\"\n\nDuring the London Marathon, the last two miles were the hardest.\n\n\"At that point, I was exhausted. It was freezing cold, and I was hurting and emotional,\" Kindleysides said, but he kept going.\n\n\"I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us, and I was raising money for The Brain Tumour Charity ,\" he said. \"I didn't want to let them down, myself down, and I thought if I'd get this far, I'd have to continue.\"\n\nSo he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.\n\nOnce Kindleysides crossed the finish line, a live news crew interviewed him, and \"I said, 'I need a full body massage and a J\u00e4gerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking,\" he said. \"My brain went mashed potato.\"\n\nThen, recovering at home, he shared his accomplishment with his three children.\n\n\"I was called RoboCop, Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine,\" Simon said.\n\n\"They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair, and now they say I'm their dad, the only one who has walked a marathon,\" he said. \"It was amazing, emotional, just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't.\"\n\nKindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year, including the London Marathon again.\n\nMeanwhile, a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.\n\n'Every year, I run the race for my wife'\n\nDavid Fraser, who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him, but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment.\n\nFraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does.\n\n\"My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year, and they couldn't believe I was the last one, because I had done many races. I had done 5K, I had done half-marathons, I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that,\" said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called Nightwarriors Fitness\n\n\"But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it,\" he said of his family. \"At the start of every marathon, I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race.\"\n\nDavid Fraser at the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon. He has participated in the race every year since 2007.\n\nCerebral palsy , a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement, impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.\n\nBefore 2007, he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding, but that year, his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race.\n\nHe has set out to finish it every year since.\n\n\"That next year, 2008, my wife developed stomach cancer, and now every year, I run the race for my wife,\" said Fraser, whose wife still attends his races.\n\nHe even developed a strategy: \"Ninety percent of the race, I do backwards,\" he said. \"Because when I go downhill, I go forward, but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain, I go backwards. ... I always run that way.\"\n\nOverall, Fraser said, \"The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done, really done, you now have to talk yourself back into it.\"\n\nFraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday, and he's looking forward to the race.\n\n\"All runners are out of their minds,\" he joked. \"Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it.\"\n\nAs for one runner in Atlanta, not only does she love it, it has been a \"lifesaver.\"\n\n'There's nothing I would change'\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil started running last year, around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\"I realized in that time, I don't think it was even the whole month, that I had gained 10 pounds, and I was just stressed, and I thought, 'I need to do something now, or this isn't going to end well,' \" Abdul-Jalil said.\n\nSo she joined a running group called Black Girls Run\n\n\"To be completely honest, it's been a lifesaver in a very real way, because I have major depressive disorder ,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Exercise may help reduce depression Replay More Videos ...

Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it.\n\n\"Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma,\" said the 41-year-old mother, who lives in the Atlanta area.\n\n\"And I'm not FloJo-built,\" she added, referencing late track-and-field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner , who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil was the final finisher at the 2018 The Race half-marathon in Atlanta.\n\nOver the 13.1-mile course, Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' \"Ride\" and Outkast's \"B.O.B.\"\n\nAround mile three, a medical director approached her, indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen, Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it, the medical director said.\n\nIn that moment, Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged.\n\n\"I wanted to cry and quit, and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head,\" she said. To keep her going, she thought about the running group, Black Girls Run.\n\n\"I literally went back to conversations that I've had,\" she said. \"Every time I said I can't do something, there was at least one or two other people that said I could.\"\n\nSo she kept going.\n\nJUST WATCHED \"Black girls run\" organize to fight obesity Replay More Videos ...

They even posted a live video of her finish on Facebook , to celebrate her as the last runner.\n\nA couple of days later, Abdul-Jalil watched the video, which has gotten more than 2,000 views.\n\nWith her depression, Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish, \"that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart,\" she said. \"There's nothing I would change.\"\n\nBefore the race, \"I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh, my God, what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again,\" she said. \"You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated.

The course was hilly, the summer heat was grueling, and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.\n\nJackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course, she said. They spoke as she continued on her way, and she made a friend.\n\nNext thing she knew, she was approaching the finish line, where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation.\n\n\"I no longer have any fear of coming last, and if there's a risk of coming second to last, I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line,\" Jackson said.\n\nAfter all, in that moment on the South Downs, she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time, the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have,\" said Jackson, who went on to run the New York, Boston, London, Chicago and Rome marathons, among dozens of others.\n\n\"I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ...

We want to use rap songs to fight against dictators,\" Dechathorn said.\n\nUnder Prayuth's watch, hundreds of activists have been arrested and prosecuted, political activity has been banned, and the sphere for robust public discourse has all but disappeared thanks to draconian laws that restrict online expression and increase surveillance and censorship.\n\n'Unprecedented' attention\n\n\"It is just about unprecedented for a music video of any kind in Thailand to accumulate so much viewership within a week,\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University.\n\n\"The song taps into collective and pent-up anxiety and frustration. Its lyrics are a litany of political ills and social injustice Thailand is afflicted with.\"\n\nThe song, which also confronts human rights abuses, poverty, access to healthcare, and government accountability, appeared to stoke the ire of the country's military leaders.\n\n\"When you listen to it, do you think it's true? Do you think it is that bad? Do you think I am that dictatorial?\" Prayuth reacted to the song Monday, saying to reporters\"When you listen to it, do you think it's true? Do you think it is that bad? Do you think I am that dictatorial?\"\n\nHe later gave a warning, saying on Tuesday that, \"Anyone that shows appreciation toward the song must accept responsibility for what happens to the country in the future,\" local media reported.\n\nWhile an investigation into whether the lyrics break any laws is ongoing , deputy National Police Chief Gen Srivara Ransibrahmanakul said Tuesday that there was insufficient evidence to charge the rappers for now.\n\nDechathorn said he can thank Thai authorities for the song's success. It was only after police began investigating the group that the song went viral.\n\nResistance as art\n\nAccording to Dechathorn, the underground rap community is growing in Thailand, and many artists are performing and producing songs to talk about the current situation in the country.\n\n\"We intend to release more political songs to tell what is going on Thailand,\" he said.\n\nAnd rappers aren't the only artists using their talents to criticize how the country is run. Masked graffiti artist Headache Stencil has made a name for himself satirizing the junta and its policies on Bangkok's walls.\n\nOne of his most recognized pieces is an image of Prime Minister Prayuth depicted as a \"lucky cat\" in style of a Japanese \"maneki-neko,\" with with its paw raised to beckon in money.\n\nThe Thai street artist who goes by the name of \"Headache Stencil\" walks next to his graffiti caricature of Thailand's junta chief depicted as a \"lucky cat\" with paw raised to rake in money, spray-painted on a fence in Bangkok.\n\nElection flip-flopping\n\nA major theme running through \"Prathet Ku Me\" is the issue of elections.\n\nDespite Prayuth promising to hold nationwide polls and restore Thailand to some degree of democratic civilian government, elections have been repeatedly postponed. After more than four years of military rule, a ballot is slated to be held in February 2019, eight years after the last elections.\n\nEven with a democratically elected government, the armed forces will effectively have the final say in the country's political future.\n\nThe military-drafted 2016 constitution -- the country's 20th since absolute monarchy ended in 1932 -- allows for an unelected prime minister and a third of the legislature to be appointed by the military.\n\nThere are also indications that supporters of Prayuth are seeking to keep him in office. In September, four key ministers in his Cabinet formed a new political party and that same month Prayuth told reporters that he was \"interested in politics,\" local media reported\n\nWith the military wanting to return to government legitimately, suppressing the rappers for their hugely popular song could risk alienating a big part of its voter base, according to Thitinan.\n\nBut by allowing it, more of Thai society will see this public display of the military government's shortcomings.\n\nThai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha speaks during a joint press conference at the Government House in Bangkok on Oct. 24, 2018.\n\n\"So the government is stuck between a rock and a hard place because it is an electoral vehicle, not just a usual post-coup caretaker cabinet. If it cracks down further on dissent like this song, it risks alienating voters. But if it accommodates, its flaws and misrule will be more exposed,\" Thitinan said.\n\nThe youth voice\n\nThe voters candidates will be hoping to win over are young people who came of age during the coup and subsequent military rule.\n\n\"Young people are more engaged now than during four years since the junta came to power,\" said Netiwit Chotipatpaisarn, a 21-year-old student activist who campaigns for education reform, democracy and free speech.\n\nThe popularity of the video, he said, is evident that it is getting harder for the military to control the people. \"If people are arrested or investigated, the dissenters will have more sympathy than ever,\" he said.\n\nPrayuth announced Tuesday that a ban on all political activity will be lifted by December. However in recent months the government has been increasing pressure on activists in the run up to the polls.\n\nIn September, five people were charged with sedition after police seized t-shirts that allegedly promoted the anti-monarchist \"Thai Federation\" movement.\n\nSedition is one of the most widely used instruments in the military government's toolbox for stifling dissent, activists said, and carries a maximum sentence of seven years.\n\nOthers include the Computer-Related Crime Act, which gives broad powers to authorities to restrict online speech, and the lese majeste law, which prohibits perceived criticism of the royal family.\n\nLast year, a military court sentenced a man to 35 years in prison for allegedly sharing videos and photos of the royal family on Facebook. And Thai student activist Jatupat Booyapatraksa was sentenced two years and six months for sharing a BBC article on Facebook that was deemed offensive to the monarchy.\n\nNetiwit, who along with 38 others were charged with sedition for violating a ban on public assembly earlier this year, said that there is concern among activists that the military government will simply refuse to hand over power following democratic elections.\n\n\"I am still afraid of what they will do,\" he said.\n\nStill, the public wave of support for Rap Against Dictatorship's anti-junta song could open up further avenues of popular dissent, which will have political ramifications, according to Thitinan.\n\n\"We could see its theme becoming a fault line of the next election,\" he said. \"It may become a vote for or against military government and all that it stands for.\"", "(CNN) Brent Taylor, the mayor of North Ogden, Utah, and an energetic and beloved figure in Utah politics, was killed Saturday in an incident in Afghanistan, where he was serving as a member of the state National Guard, the Pentagon announced Sunday.\n\nThe unexpected death of Taylor, who was months from finishing his tour and is survived by seven children and his wife Jennie, drew an outpouring of grief in Utah and on social media late Saturday.\n\nLast month on his 15th wedding anniversary, Taylor penned a post on Facebook about his \"rock star wife,\" who he said had been \"superwoman through birthing and raising seven children, and through four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed Sunday that Taylor was killed in the attack, but did not offer additional details of the attack.\n\nRepublican Gov.

In a new study, researchers at Boston University's CTE Center say that a variant of the gene TMEM106B may influence why some people experience more severe forms of the disease than others.\n\n\"Among people who have CTE, people with this [genetic] variation are 2.5 times more likely to develop dementia,\" said Dr. Jesse Mez , assistant professor of neurology at Boston University's School of Medicine. Mez was a co-author of the study, published Saturday in the journal Acta Neuropathologica Communications\n\nMez said the findings, though early, are a step toward better understanding of the disease. \"It helps us better understand biologically, mechanistically, what is going on in the brain in CTE.\n\n\"In understanding the mechanism and in identifying this genetic risk factor, we have new potential targets to develop therapies,\" he said.\n\nThe authors point out that their findings need to be further investigated in a larger group and replicated to make any definitive conclusions.\n\nProceed with caution\n\nDr. Sam Gandy , a professor of neurology and psychiatry and director of the Center for Cognitive Health at Mount Sinai in New York, said the findings were simply too premature and couldn't account for other genes that may be involved in the disease, like APOE4.\n\nGandy, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email that the findings were \"not ready for prime time.\"\n\nDr. Bennet Omalu , the pathologist who first detected CTE in professional football players, agreed that it was too early to make much of the findings.\n\n\"We need to tread carefully. The study shows that the gene may be associated with reduced risk for CTE, but CTE is a polymorphous and polyphenotypic and polygenetic disease, [and] focusing on one gene, which may reduce risk, may be a stretch,\" Omalu, who was also not involved in the new research, wrote in an email.\n\nMez and his team at Boston University are also looking at other genes that may play a role in CTE. \"If these other genes do have an effect, it will likely be independent and additive with the TMEM finding.\"\n\nMez added that it is \"likely several genes across the genome that contribute to CTE risk and severity, and in the future, considering all of them together will improve our predictive capability. \"\n\nToday, CTE can be diagnosed only after death. It's believed to result from repeated head trauma. In football, this can happen not just from hard hits to the head that result in concussion but from the repeated rattling of the brain inside the skull during tackles and falls to the turf. These repeated hits are known as subconcussive hits and can result in a buildup of a kind of protein called tau in the brain.\n\nEarly and longer exposure to repeated trauma is also considered to be a likely contributor to the disease. There is no treatment or cure for the disease.\n\nGene variant tied to less-severe CTE\n\nand compared them to the brains of 376 patients who did not have CTE. All the brains were part of the Mez and his colleagues evaluated the brains of 86 former football players who had CTE and no traces of other neurodegenerative diseasesand compared them to the brains of 376 patients who did not have CTE.

But those who had CTE and the gene variant had lower amounts of tau and reduced inflammation in the brain than those who had CTE but no variant.\n\nBoth inflammation and a buildup of tau in the brain contribute to the brain's degeneration.\n\n\"Among just those with CTE, that CTE-related outcomes were more severe, they were more likely to have dementia, and they were more likely to have advance neurodegeneration in their brain,\" Mez said.\n\nIn a study last year, Boston University researchers detailed finding CTE in the brains of 100 of 101 former NFL players. And although the presence of the disease is extremely high in the study, it is hard to extrapolate to overall prevalence among football players as well as the general public because the brains studied carried a potential bias: They were donated from relatives because the subjects had probably exhibited symptoms of the disease such as memory loss, confusion, depression and impulse control problems.\n\nLast week, the Concussion Legacy Foundation announced that 147 colleges have had former football players diagnosed with CTE.\n\nUnderstanding the difference\n\nDr. Geoff Manley , professor of neurosurgery at University of California, San Francisco, says the new research is a step in the right direction.\n\n\"This research, while early, suggests there may be some genetic risk factors. However, there was no difference between those with and without CTE. The TMEM106B gene has also been associated with frontotemporal dementia, suggesting potential overlap with a number of neurodegenerative diseases,\" Manley, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. \"More research is needed with large numbers of individuals with and without long-term issues to fully understand their cause and effect.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMez noted, \"We see a lot of former athletes who have similar levels of exposure.

Now, amid soaring rents and a plunging stock market, they are finding daily life increasingly difficult.\n\nThe past year has been especially tough.\n\nLike many middle-class investors, Wang dumped most of his shares in Chinese stocks after his portfolio suffered a 40% loss in just two years.\n\nUnable to afford a 37% rent increase, he left his old apartment in Beijing this year and moved to a cheaper apartment in Shanghai. But he still found the cost of living in China hard to handle.\n\n\"I can clearly feel that groceries are more expensive, especially in the second half of the year,\" he said.\n\nThe problem of economic distress among Chinese citizens is so common that there is a buzzword on China's cybersphere for people like Wang -- \"jiucai\" or leeks.\n\n\"I'm a typical leek that is picked in the stock market, rental market and as a consumer,\" said Wang.\n\nMiddle-class Chinese consumers call themselves \"leeks,\" the popular green vegetable used in a Chinese cuisine, to express their fears about the economy or financial issues online.\n\nIt's a self-deprecating term implying they are being played for suckers, just faceless vegetables harvested by big companies and the government, especially amid the escalating US-China trade war and slowing economy.\n\nTongue-in-cheek reactions such as \"the government is going to harvest the leeks again\" or \"we're being picked like leeks\" are common among members of the middle class.\n\nThe forgotten people\n\nChina's middle class has rapidly expanded over recent decades amid an enormous economic boom which showered the country's citizens with unprecedented wealth.\n\nAmid this rapid rise in living standards, President Xi Jinping laid out his vision for the \"Chinese dream,\" a propaganda term promising prosperity and an easy, affluent life.\n\nBut a slowing and uneven economy, threatened by US pressure, has caused growing worries for many across the country.\n\nOne of the best measures of cost of living in China, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen every month since May.\n\nThe recent China-US trade war has only stoked more uncertainty for the country's vulnerable middle class.

But when the stock market falls, the major players will survive while the average investors lose it all.\n\nWhen the \"harvested leeks\" are forced out of the market, fresh inexperienced leek investors will sprout up to repopulate the market in a very short time.\n\nThe middle class feels it is being \"picked\" by the government as well as the stock market, according to Zhang Lin, an independent economics commentator.\n\n\"The real 'leeks' are the same of group of the middle class whose interests are sacrificed amid the trade war,\" Zhang said. Among them are white collar workers in private sectors and owners of small to medium-sized businesses.\n\nTwo new laws in particular, adopted to reinforce state economic control after the outbreak of the trade war, have been seen as \"leek harvesting\" by online commentators, stirring fury and fear from the group.\n\nA new e-commerce law has taxed the country's lucrative online businesses such as taobao.com, from which some middle-class people have made a fortune, while a change in the collection of the mandatory social welfare fund has added to the financial burden on small businesses.\n\nChris Xing, who works for an internet start-up in Beijing, said the new policy has caused labor costs to rise and his company is struggling.\n\nHe said the interests of the middle class are being sacrificed to save the Chinese government from the brewing trade war, and Zhang agrees.\n\n\"(The government thinks) more needs to be squeezed from the private sector so that the state has the firepower to accelerate spending on infrastructure and investments ... to counterbalance the impact of the trade war,\" Zhang said.\n\n'Meat on the cutting board'\n\nAlthough the origin of the term leeks was related to finance, Chinese internet users have expanded it into the political realm to vent their frustration about political and social control.\n\n\"China's middle class ... lack power to change the law or to lobby with interest groups,\" said Zhang, \"Without rights, assets are unprotected, and middle class has to face more uncertainties.\"\n\nAs people worry about the imminent economic winter, with little clear end in sight to the US trade war, many are trying to save money, giving rise to a phenomenon called \"consumption downgrades.\"\n\nAn article titled, \"This generation of young Chinese, be ready for the bitter days ahead,\" has circulated widely on the Chinese internet in recent months.\n\nThe author, Ma Ning, says that \"things have changed\" since the years of \"consumption upgrade,\" back during the boom times of the country's economy.\n\n\"Yearly gym memberships are swapped for cheaper, monthly ones. Apps for second-hand goods trading reached a new high. Chinese pickle stock has risen 200% in the past year ... Even the avocados ... are not that popular anymore,\" she said in the piece.\n\nChinese state media claims there is no such thing as the \"consumer downgrade,\" saying consumers were just \"calmer and more sophisticated.\"\n\nBoth ordinary middle-class consumers in China's cooling economy, Wang and Xing, told CNN they are quietly changing their lifestyles.\n\nWang said he would think twice before eating out and opt instead for buying groceries in bulk and cooking on his own at home.\n\nXing, the Beijing start-up employee, said although he is able to swallow the rising costs for now, he would probably defer some big purchases.\n\nAmong the expenditures to be avoided is another child for and his wife.

Inmates will commonly put padlocks from foot lockers into socks and swing \"at the head or body of another individual,\" the Washington-based Corrections Information Council reported in October, citing several Hazelton inmates.\n\nWith the death of Bulger, whose killing came one day after he was transferred there from another prison , three inmates have now been killed there in seven months. Few details have been released and it's not clear whether a fuller prison staff would have made a difference.\n\nBut a union representing prison workers says the violence should highlight what it says are two major staffing issues: Dozens of authorized correctional officers' positions are vacant at the Hazelton prison complex, and, like at other federal prisons, staff such as maintenance workers and nurses are stepping in as guards when insufficient numbers of regular correctional officers are available.\n\nUS Penitentiary Hazelton in West Virginia, where Bulger was beaten to death October 30\n\n\"Federal prisons across the country are suffering from severe understaffing, and the situation is perhaps no more dire than at Hazelton,\" J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said after Bulger's death.\n\n'This kind of stuff happens on the regular'\n\nThe first two deaths at Hazelton led to October's congressional and watchdog inquiries.\n\nHazelton inmates Ian Thorne and Demario Porter were killed in fights with fellow inmates in April and September, respectively, DC congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton wrote to Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz last month.\n\nThorne and Porter had been DC residents, and their deaths caught the attention of the DC Corrections Information Council, which monitors facilities where district residents are incarcerated. Felons convicted in the District of Columbia are sent to federal prisons.\n\nThe council said it visited USP Hazelton on October 3 and interviewed 58 DC residents incarcerated there. Some of them said physical assaults happened at least once a day, and one recalled four stabbings there between February and August, the council said in a report to the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\n\"This kind of stuff happens on the regular,\" the report quotes the unnamed inmate as saying.\n\nAccording to data from the local AFGE chapter that represents Hazelton staff, violent incidents happen there frequently, if not daily. More than 130 violent incidents -- most of them fights between inmates -- were recorded this year through October 30, AFGE Local 420 Executive Vice President Justin Tarovisky said.\n\nInmates also told the council of assaults from staff, including that workers in the prison's Special Housing Unit \"beat, punch, kick, choke and stomp (them) where they know it won't show.\"\n\nHolmes Norton asked Horowitz in her letter to investigate the operations at Hazelton, citing reports of abuse in the council's report, as well as the two fatal inmate fights.\n\nThe BOP didn't immediately respond Saturday to CNN's questions about the council's report.\n\nTarovisky said the Bureau of Prisons takes accusations of abuse seriously, and that since he's been the local union's executive vice president, he's never known such allegations to have been true.\n\n\"My staff do not in any way beat\" prisoners, said Tarovisky, who also is a senior officer specialist at Hazelton. \"That's not going on.\"\n\nDays before Bulger's death, lawmakers alleged prison understaffing\n\nThe deaths of Thorne and Porter also caught the attention of West Virginia's US senators, Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito, and three other lawmakers, who wrote on October 25 -- five days before Bulger died -- that they were concerned about the Bureau of Prisons' \"failure to follow clear congressional directives to hire more full-time correctional officers.\"\n\nIn the letter to US Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the lawmakers said the April and September deaths at Hazelton were unacceptable.\n\nThey also wrote that Congress gave the BOP \"additional funds to support additional correctional officers for each housing unit at high security institutions\" since 2016.\n\nThe AFGE union says many prisons nationwide are understaffed, including those at Federal Correction Complex Hazelton, which includes the high-security USP Hazelton as well as three other facilities: The medium-security Federal Correctional Institution Hazelton; a women's prison; and a minimum-security satellite prison camp.\n\nThe complex has 403 correctional officers, but a further 42 officer positions are vacant, Tarovisky, the local union official, said.\n\nThe Hazelton prisons badly need those 42 positions filled, Tarovisky said. Shortages stress the staff's ability to, among other things, find contraband, he said.\n\n\"With another 42 officers, we might have found the weapons\" that were used in the April and September killings, he said.\n\n\"In my opinion, some things could have been averted\" with full staffing, Tarovisky said, referring to violence at the complex.\n\nThe BOP told CNN on Friday that it eliminated several thousand vacant, previously authorized bureau positions nationwide this year while trying to cut costs in line with the Justice Department's congressionally approved budget plan.\n\nThe bureau's count of vacant correctional officer positions at FCC Hazelton, 36, was lower than the union's. The bureau said it projects 21 of those 36 positions will be filled, though it did not say when.\n\n\"Regarding the recent incidence of violence at FCC Hazelton, the BOP has sent a team of subject-matter experts to the complex to assess operational activities and correctional security practices and measures to determine any relevant facts that may have contributed to the incident,\" a BOP representative said Friday. \"The team will make recommendations to the BOP's senior leadership to assist in mitigating any identified risks.\"\n\nTeachers, accountants filling in as guards\n\nThe lawmakers' letter also expressed concern about prisons' \"overreliance on augmentation,\" a term that describes the bureau's practice of using prison staff such as teachers and cooks for fill-in guard duty.\n\nThe legislators asked Sessions to update them on how the BOP was reducing the practice.\n\nAugmentation happens every weekday at FCC Hazelton, Tarovisky said. On Tuesday, the complex had five to 10 staff members filling in as correctional officers, Tarovisky said.\n\nThe BOP says all federal prison staff are law enforcement officers and are considered correctional workers first, even if their primary job there is something else.\n\nAll staff members are told upon being hired that they're expected to perform law enforcement duties; they're given the same amount of initial and continuing training as law enforcement officers; and they're paid accordingly, the bureau says.\n\nBut in their letter to Sessions, the lawmakers wrote that a Senate report accompanying the 2018 appropriations law included directions to the BOP \"to curtail its overreliance on augmentation and instead hire full-time correctional staff before continuing to augment existing staff.\"", "(CNN) Record-setting gymnast Simone Biles won the women's floor exercise gold Saturday at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nHer winning score was 14.933, a full point higher than her USA teammate Morgan Hurd, who won the silver medal.\n\nThe gold medal was Biles' 14th title in her career at the world championships, extending her own record for the most world titles for any gymnast in history, female or male.\n\n\"I think there's a lot to be proud of.

With a compliant GOP in control of Congress, he has encountered little resistance while embarking on one of the most aggressive uses of presidential power in recent history.\n\nIn ways that would make Richard Nixon blush, Trump has flexed his executive power to deregulate the economy, erode the Affordable Care Act and ramp up immigration restrictions. Trump has also broken almost every norm of presidential behavior as he stirs up the most extremist elements of his base. Overseas, the President has ripped apart international treaties, engaged in provocative behavior with his adversaries and cozied up to autocratic regimes such as Russia.\n\nThe key to President Trump's success has been the passive role of the Republican Congress when it comes to checking the White House. The election of a Democratic majority in Congress -- even if it's just the House-- would mark an important step in restoring some balance between the two branches.\n\nDemocratic control of either chamber would also allow the party to shape investigations, set the agenda and check the President in his legislative initiatives. If Republicans retain their hold on Congress, the party will likely feel emboldened to move forward with legislation and drop the Russia investigations, giving the President at least two more years of free rein.\n\nHow healthy are our democratic processes?\n\nPutting aside the question of election interference by governments overseas, the biggest threat to our democracy is homegrown. Since the Supreme Court knocked down a key section of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, the nation has witnessed a steady erosion of our democratic process when it comes to the right to vote.\n\nAn early voter casts his vote in Athens, Georgia, October 26, 2018.\n\nKansas and Numerous states, including Georgia Wisconsin imposed stringent voting restrictions -- some of which were struck down and contested -- based in part on false charges of widespread fraud. In an election where the margins of victory are likely to be narrow and voter participation will matter more than anything else, the impact of these laws could be immense. Election Day will provide a first look at the impact these laws have had on the heart and soul of democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, my podcast co-host Sam Wang has highlighted numerous measures on the ballot that have the potential to expand voting rights. In Florida, voters will decide whether to enfranchise 1.6 million ex-felons, while Michigan, Colorado and Utah will consider the creation of nonpartisan redistricting commissions. The success of these measures could offer an important counterpoint to voter suppression.\n\nIs the condition of the Democratic Party improving?\n\nThe Democrats are clearly excited and enthused, mobilized and angry. But there are still plenty of problems that plague the party. While everyone from Oprah to Joe Biden has been touted as a possible contender against Trump in 2020, the Democrats still lack a leader with the vision and stamina to succeed in a brutal campaign.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who appeared to be a possible frontrunner, prompted a swift backlash from members of her own party after releasing a video about her Native American heritage.\n\nA victory for the Democrats would provide a huge boost to the party's morale, and energize potential candidates for 2020. If they don't win either chamber, the next presidential election will look even bleaker, along with the future of key policies surrounding the Affordable Care Act, climate change regulation, gun control, the Dreamers and progressive taxation.\n\nWho will control redistricting after 2020?\n\nThe biggest story overlooked after the 2010 midterm elections was the success of Republicans at the state level. In his book \" Ratf**ked \", Dave Daley offered a terrific account of how the Republican national party invested in state elections.\n\nThe GOP vastly increased the number of state legislatures and gubernatorial seats that it held. The result was that the party controlled the redistricting that followed the release of the new census and drew solidly red districts. In other words, they built an electoral wall to keep Democrats out. Currently there are only 16 Democratic governors.\n\nThe 2018 midterms offer Democrats a chance to reverse this. Democrats are facing good prospects in a number of states, which could empower the party for the next round of redistricting, and of course offer them a chance to shape policy at the local level-- even with President Trump in the White House\n\nWhat are our national values?\n\nThe midterms will provide a measure of our national values in response to President Trump's controversial vision for the future of America.\n\nMore dramatic than anything has been his passionate embrace of a hardline position on immigration. After many Americans believed the fight for pluralism and diversity was over, the President has floated out white nationalism in a defiant stand against newcomers in our society.\n\nTrump is a one-man wrecking crew against what he considers \"political correctness.\" He has mocked the #MeToo movement and peddled anti-Muslim rhetoric , while his embrace of America First, a term loaded with negative historical connotations, flies in the face of former leaders who were committed to internationalism.\n\nFor more opinion...

His closing argument, a campaign ad suggesting that people who seek asylum in the US are murderers, made this choice clear. A vote for a Democratic Congress could be interpreted as a strong rebuke against Trump's rhetoric, while a victory by the Republicans would help legitimize the values of this White House.", "Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers tells CNN's Alisyn Camerota about his experience meeting President Donald Trump, saying that he was \"warm and consoling\" while visiting the synagogue in Pittsburgh.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl sol saldr\u00e1 m\u00e1s temprano por la ma\u00f1ana y se pondr\u00e1 antes por la tarde\n\n(CNN) - Es el primer fin de semana de noviembre.

MUST WATCH Lies, smears and scams plaguing social media 07:09\n\nTwo years later, what's changed? Are midterm voters being fooled by made-up stories? I've been talking with experts and scouring social media websites for answers. My impression is that the specific \"fake news\" problem is less pronounced this election season. But the threats have morphed and multiplied.\n\nHere's what I mean: I'm not seeing simplistic \"Candidate X said Y\" lies showing up in the newsfeed. Facebook has staffers and machines and fact-checking partnerships in place to reduce that pollution. Twitter has been taking action too.\n\nBut the online environment is still polluted. The sites are struggling to keep up with all the state-sponsored attacks, bot networks, hate speech posts, hyperpartisan memes and other problems. Russian trolls are still hard at work. The US government recently indicted a Russian woman for \"attempting to sow political and social discord ahead of the 2018 midterm election.\"\n\nSo the cliche is true: This is like Whack-a-mole, but the grand prize is a healthier democracy.\n\nTwitter stops voter suppression effort\n\nOn Friday evening, Twitter revealed that it had shut down a voter suppression effort that involved thousands of accounts, mostly posing as Democrats, that were discouraging people from voting.\n\nThat's not \"fake news\" as it was defined in 2016. But it's pernicious nonetheless.\n\n\"Misinformation is a problem, but it's not the 100% fabricated stories that we saw in 2016,\" Claire Wardle, the head of First Draft, told me.\n\nPoynter's International Fact-Checking Network director, Alexios Mantzarlis, agreed, but said \"I think the jury is still out.\" With that caveat in mind, he said \"the full-on viral 'fake news' of yonder is playing a somewhat secondary role compared to (A) misinformation pushed by and for openly political purposes and (B) bizarro conspiracy theories emerging from messaging boards and getting amplified wittingly or unwittingly by folks on Facebook/Twitter.\"\n\nMany of those bizarro theories have been about the Kavanaugh hearings and, more recently, the migrant \"caravan.\" The NYT's Kevin Roose caught another viral \"caravan\" hoax on Friday. It was not taken down until he publicly pointed it out. Anti-immigration hoaxes aren't about the midterms, exactly, but could affect the results since Trump is relying on immigration fears to fuel GOP turnout.\n\nThese \"stand-alone visual posts on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram\" disproportionately target female candidates and candidates of color, Wardle said. \"Taking advantage of the deep partisan divisions, much of the content is designed to reinforce positions and denigrate the other side, using dog-whistles, logical fallacies and false equivalency.\"\n\nBut \"currently there is little the platforms can do with his type of content,\" she said. \"It can not be fact-checked in a formal sense and some would argue that this type of content is 'politics as normal'. What we don't know is how to measure the drip, drip, drip of these divisive hyper-partisan memes on society.\"\n\nSome of the hoaxes are just harder to see\n\nCNN Business's own Donie O'Sullivan pointed out to me that \"a lot of the conversation has moved into closed Facebook groups.\" There are huge MAGA groups and huge Resistance groups -- \"total ideological echo chambers,\" he said.\n\nTow Center researcher Jonathan Albright seconded this point. Facebook is \"flooded with fake messages, astroturfing armies, Q garbage and anti-migrant posts,\" he told me. But it's \"all buried in groups and subpages.\"\n\nAlbright spent all day Friday going down these rabbit holes. He said he thinks it's ten times worse than 2016. He observed a \"major effort underway to push messages out FROM groups into rest of platform. Groups are polluted with fake accounts and duplicate profiles.\"\n\nSome smears start there, and then get mainstreamed by media personalities and politicians.\n\nCharlie Warzel, who covers the \"information wars\" for BuzzFeed, said \"what we are seeing more than anything else is the way that so much 'fake news' has rewired our discourse and reprogrammed (especially right wing) media.\"\n\nCase in point, scary stories about the \"caravan\" have been a staple of Fox News shows.\n\n\"Hyperpartisan spin which was relegated to MAGA FB pages (which published a lot of fake news in '16 cycle) has really made its way into mainstream discourse,\" Warzel said, citing the bogus \"false flag\" theories about the recent wave of mail bombs.\n\nMisinformation is coming from the top\n\nOf course, any conversation about this online pollution has to reckon with the president's role as the biggest polluter of them all. His Twitter account recently shared a video that was both racist and factually inaccurate.\n\nObama administration official turned CNN commentator Sam Vinograd argues that Trump sows discord in much the same way that Russian hackers try to do.\n\nTrump \"knowingly spreads content that is helpful to Russia because he thinks it is also helpful to him personally and politically,\" she said. Silicon Valley's efforts to combat \"combat fake news and bots and trolls are irrelevant\" when similarly divisive content is coming from the president's account, she asserted.\n\nThe Washington Post's Philip Bump made a similar point on \"Reliable Sources\" recently: \"You can't crack down on people for retweeting the president of the United States even though it's fake news.\"\n\nWhat are we missing now?\n\nThese problems don't stop at the US border. Misinformation and disinformation is spreading in a variety of ways all around the world. In the past few weeks, there have been headlines about WhatsApp hoaxes affecting the presidential election in Brazil; Saudi Arabian Twitter trolls spreading lies about Jamal Khashoggi; and Iranian Facebook pages stoking divisions in the US and the UK.\n\nEvery week, it seems, investigators or reporters or social media managers discover another scheme or propaganda effort.\n\nAnd O'Sullivan made a very important point to me: \"What will we learn about 4 or 8 or 12 months from now that the Russians or Iranians were doing before the 2018 midterms?\"\n\nHere's what he asked: \"Will there be something that the intel community, the platforms, and the media all missed? Are disinformation operatives in Tehran and Beijing and Moscow laughing at us right now getting all worked up about some ad disclaimers in Facebook? Have they innovated quicker than we can keep up?\"", "(CNN) In January of 2017, Jennifer Swenson and her daughter, Marit, were training for a half-marathon.

She published an article last month slamming the curriculum in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nHalpern-Felsher, who is also the founder and executive director of the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit , had been developing her own curriculum on vaping when she was approached by California education advocates who had gotten wind of Juul's curriculum in late 2017.\n\nShe recalled their message: \"You guys need to do something yesterday.\"\n\nWhat's in it?\n\nHalpern-Felsher said the Juul curriculum was \"completely missing the most important pieces\" of a bona fide prevention effort.\n\nFor example, it didn't discuss the role of industry and marketing in promoting nicotine use. And it touted mindfulness as a prevention tool, despite what she described as a lack of evidence that it works in this context. Some of the curriculum's exercises included guided meditation and swinging a pendulum over a piece of paper to discuss the \"power of the mind,\" she writes in the article.\n\nIn a version of the curriculum provided by Halpern-Felsher, teachers are referred to a primer video, which links to an Australian vaping company and says that people vape to \"reduce harm\" and \"save money\" over cigarettes. (The Stanford toolkit describes the former as a \"misperception.\"\n\nAt the end of the video: a popup box that says, \"New to vaping? We'll help you take those first steps.\"\n\nThe materials rarely mention Juul by name, Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nWhat they did mention, however, was her own work -- the Stanford toolkit -- which was referenced as a resource in Juul materials reviewed by CNN.\n\nShe became aware of this when a colleague falsely accused her of working with or receiving money from the company.\n\n\"That's when I said, 'wait, something's going on here,' \" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nOn the alert\n\nAlso named in Juul documents was the Spokane Regional Health District, which has its own tobacco and vaping prevention programs.\n\n\"The Spokane Regional Health District is listed as one of the resources on which they based their prevention initiative, which was of great concern to Spokane,\" Frances Limtiaco, program manager for the Washington State Department of Health's Tobacco and Vapor Product Prevention and Control Program , wrote in an emailed statement.\n\n\"However, we were never able to determine how this came to be,\" she added.\n\nThis prompted Limtiaco and her colleagues to send out an alert in March to Washington schools warning them that \"Juul Labs are piloting their prevention program ... to middle and high schools.\"\n\n\"The tobacco industry has a long history of sponsoring youth prevention programming that ultimately undermine evidence-based tobacco control efforts, and JUUL is no different,\" the alert said.\n\nNo schools or school districts responded to the alert saying they had received offers from the company, Limtiaco noted.\n\nA similar alert was sent by email in February by school health officials with the California Department of Education.\n\n\"People have said to me in the schools ... 'I'm concerned because I'm hearing about Juul trying to come to our schools and offering this money,' \" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\n\"There was a lot of confusion.\"\n\nDevices for vices\n\nThe Stanford and Spokane resources appeared in a December company memo outlining Juul's plans, which included \"designing alternatives to traditional prevention programs\" by culling from \"best practice resources.\"\n\nA Juul Labs spokeswoman, Victoria Davis, confirmed that the memo was a company document.\n\nAlso noted in the December memo is the progress the initiative had made: It had contacted 15 school districts in California, committed two schools to the program and engaged \"long-time educational leaders Wendell Greer and Bruce Harter to lead the prevention effort in schools and school districts.\"\n\nHarter and Greer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They served together as administrators of California's West Contra Costa Unified School District; Harter was its superintendent.\n\nEmails show that Harter attended a meeting in February to promote the Juul program at California's Tobacco Education and Research Oversight Committee. Meeting minutes show that Harter was there in person and Greer via teleconference.\n\nThe following day, health and education experts privately expressed concern about Juul's plans. One doctor described as \"problematic\" the company's plans to set up focus groups of student vapers:\n\n\"Why would you give this company access to kids like this?\" she wrote in the February email.\n\nSimilarly, Halpern-Felsher expressed concerns to CNN that the curriculum itself could yield important insights about e-cig marketing to the industry.\n\nFor example, one student questionnaire asks, \"What's appealing about using e-cigarette or JUULs?

E-cigarette use declined for the first time in 2016 but held steady the following year.\n\nHalpern-Felsher said consumers and health experts have been locked in a contentious debate; while some see it as a smoking cessation tool for adults, others say \"there's no good evidence there, period,\" she added.\n\n\"There's never been ... something so divisive in the public health world as vapes,\" she said.", "(CNN) The leading maker of e-cigarettes, Juul Labs, attempted to roll out an anti-vaping curriculum in schools earlier this year, offering school districts thousands of dollars and new technologies to implement it, according to documents and emails obtained by CNN.\n\nThe company abandoned these efforts in May, not long after its initial outreach, in response to a backlash from health and education advocates.\n\n\"Under no circumstance should anybody from the tobacco, nicotine, vaping industries be involved in or implementing tobacco prevention programs,\" said Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, professor of pediatrics in Stanford University's Division of Adolescent Medicine. She published an article last month slamming the curriculum in the Journal of Adolescent Health.\n\nHalpern-Felsher, who is also the founder and executive director of the Stanford Tobacco Prevention Toolkit , had been developing her own curriculum on vaping when she was approached by California education advocates who had gotten wind of Juul's curriculum in late 2017.\n\nShe recalled their message: \"You guys need to do something yesterday.\"\n\nWhat's in it?\n\nHalpern-Felsher said the Juul curriculum was \"completely missing the most important pieces\" of a bona fide prevention effort.\n\nFor example, it didn't discuss the role of industry and marketing in promoting nicotine use. And it touted mindfulness as a prevention tool, despite what she described as a lack of evidence that it works in this context. Some of the curriculum's exercises included guided meditation and swinging a pendulum over a piece of paper to discuss the \"power of the mind,\" she writes in the article.\n\nIn a version of the curriculum provided by Halpern-Felsher, teachers are referred to a primer video, which links to an Australian vaping company and says that people vape to \"reduce harm\" and \"save money\" over cigarettes. (The Stanford toolkit describes the former as a \"misperception.\"\n\nAt the end of the video: a popup box that says, \"New to vaping? We'll help you take those first steps.\"\n\nThe materials rarely mention Juul by name, Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nWhat they did mention, however, was her own work -- the Stanford toolkit -- which was referenced as a resource in Juul materials reviewed by CNN.\n\nShe became aware of this when a colleague falsely accused her of working with or receiving money from the company.\n\n\"That's when I said, 'wait, something's going on here,' \" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nOn the alert\n\nAlso named in Juul documents was the Spokane Regional Health District, which has its own tobacco and vaping prevention programs.\n\n\"The Spokane Regional Health District is listed as one of the resources on which they based their prevention initiative, which was of great concern to Spokane,\" Frances Limtiaco, program manager for the Washington State Department of Health's Tobacco and Vapor Product Prevention and Control Program , wrote in an emailed statement.\n\n\"However, we were never able to determine how this came to be,\" she added.\n\nThis prompted Limtiaco and her colleagues to send out an alert in March to Washington schools warning them that \"Juul Labs are piloting their prevention program ... to middle and high schools.\"\n\n\"The tobacco industry has a long history of sponsoring youth prevention programming that ultimately undermine evidence-based tobacco control efforts, and JUUL is no different,\" the alert said.\n\nNo schools or school districts responded to the alert saying they had received offers from the company, Limtiaco noted.\n\nA similar alert was sent by email in February by school health officials with the California Department of Education.\n\n\"People have said to me in the schools ... 'I'm concerned because I'm hearing about Juul trying to come to our schools and offering this money,' \" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\n\"There was a lot of confusion.\"\n\nDevices for vices\n\nThe Stanford and Spokane resources appeared in a December company memo outlining Juul's plans, which included \"designing alternatives to traditional prevention programs\" by culling from \"best practice resources.\"\n\nA Juul Labs spokeswoman, Victoria Davis, confirmed that the memo was a company document.\n\nAlso noted in the December memo is the progress the initiative had made: It had contacted 15 school districts in California, committed two schools to the program and engaged \"long-time educational leaders Wendell Greer and Bruce Harter to lead the prevention effort in schools and school districts.\"\n\nHarter and Greer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They served together as administrators of California's West Contra Costa Unified School District; Harter was its superintendent.\n\nEmails show that Harter attended a meeting in February to promote the Juul program at California's Tobacco Education and Research Oversight Committee. Meeting minutes show that Harter was there in person and Greer via teleconference.\n\nThe following day, health and education experts privately expressed concern about Juul's plans. One doctor described as \"problematic\" the company's plans to set up focus groups of student vapers:\n\n\"Why would you give this company access to kids like this?\" she wrote in the February email.\n\nSimilarly, Halpern-Felsher expressed concerns to CNN that the curriculum itself could yield important insights about e-cig marketing to the industry.\n\nFor example, one student questionnaire asks, \"What's appealing about using e-cigarette or JUULs? Why do students use them?\" Schools were to be instructed to submit these forms to \"JUUL consultants,\" documents show.\n\n\"We in the public health world ... got very nervous that that's how they're gathering data,\" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nThe company's strategy also included developing technology that might disable the vapes, including \"wireless nodes that alert school staff to use in schools,\" and an age-verification process that would require an adult's smartphone, according to the December memo.\n\nIn a February email that Halpern-Felsher shared with CNN, Harter said that Juul would be piloting these devices by the end of March.

But it's been tight-lipped about which locations might have the advantage. Bezos, Amazon's founder and president, has said the announcement will be made late this year.\n\nThe company received 238 proposals and selected 20 finalists in January.

Otros pa\u00edses europeos los rechazaron.\n\nPero por mucho que los liberales la aplaudieran por una conversi\u00f3n de sus ra\u00edces dem\u00f3cratas cristianas tradicionalmente cautelosas, sembr\u00f3 las semillas de su propia desaparici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica.\n\nMIRA: Angela Merkel no buscar\u00e1 la reelecci\u00f3n como canciller de Alemania\n\nDesde entonces, ha sido golpeada por el auge de la pol\u00edtica de extrema derecha a ra\u00edz de su pol\u00edtica de puertas abiertas. Sus oponentes hablan de temores de terrorismo, violencia y un choque de culturas.\n\nNo es solo Alemania donde el nacionalismo de derecha se est\u00e1 beneficiando a costa de los partidos m\u00e1s tradicionales. Est\u00e1 en toda Europa.\n\nEl Brexit es tan parte de su complexi\u00f3n como lo es la negaci\u00f3n del primer ministro de Hungr\u00eda, Viktor Orban, de las pol\u00edticas de intercambio de inmigrantes de la UE.\n\nLa instituci\u00f3n de posguerra est\u00e1 bajo la presi\u00f3n de los euroesc\u00e9pticos de todas las tendencias. Ya sea de Brexiteers, del nuevo gobierno de Italia, de la derecha de Hungr\u00eda o de Polonia, el cambio est\u00e1 llegando.\n\nTodos est\u00e1n intercambiando temores y aprovechando la ira que genera su ret\u00f3rica.\n\nPero eso no es nada nuevo en pol\u00edtica, entonces, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 tiene \u00e9xito ahora?\n\nLa l\u00f3gica dice que es porque hay un apetito por el cambio. Anthony Scaramucci, exdirector de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca, dice que Trump es una \"voz aut\u00e9ntica\", que no debe confundirse con mentiroso.\n\nMIRA: Simpatizantes de extrema derecha se manifiestan en Berl\u00edn en el aniversario de la reunificaci\u00f3n alemana\n\nMillones de personas en Estados Unidos tienen hambre de autenticidad.\n\nSea cual sea la atracci\u00f3n del nuevo enfoque de Trump, todav\u00eda est\u00e1 funcionando para \u00e9l. Su base es leal, y nada de eso se pierde entre los aspirantes a l\u00edderes de todo el mundo.\n\nAl igual que Trump, Bolsonaro tiene seguidoras femeninas, a pesar de su degradaci\u00f3n verbal de la mujer.\n\nAquellos a los que les gusta Bolsonaro lo hacen porque \u00e9l aborda temores m\u00e1s profundos: no el abuso por parte de \u00e9l, sino el miedo cotidiano a la violaci\u00f3n o el robo. \u00c9l dice que tiene una respuesta, y ellos la compran.\n\nNo importa que su respuesta no haya sido probada por ellos o que las generaciones anteriores hayan encontrado una ret\u00f3rica similar vac\u00eda o simplemente peligrosa y decisiva. En su mundo, sus respuestas son las correctas.\n\nEn Europa, al igual que en Estados Unidos de Trump, el temor de los votantes se debe a su falta de fe en la econom\u00eda que trabaja para ellos, temores basados en los inmigrantes y sus culturas cuestionables que invaden y roban empleos.\n\nC\u00f3mo resuena eso cuando la econom\u00eda, particularmente en Estados Unidos, est\u00e1 funcionando tan bien (seg\u00fan Trump), y con las tasas de desempleo en un nivel generacional bajo es otra cuesti\u00f3n.\n\nLo que indica es que el margen entre sobrevivir y caer en el camino se est\u00e1 reduciendo. El sue\u00f1o americano es perecedero, ya no es tan plausible para las masas como lo fue una vez para la generaci\u00f3n de sus padres.\n\nMIRA: Bolsonaro, Trump, Salvini: conoce el mapa de la derecha en el mundo\n\nTanto si eres Bolsonaro tratando de convencer a la clase media de que necesita protegerse de los pobres, o Trump y Orban convenciendo a los votantes de que necesitan proteger de los inmigrantes, el mensaje es mucho m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de vender si el costo de tomar la decisi\u00f3n equivocada en la casilla electoral te puede costar la vida o el sustento.\n\nEstamos observando c\u00f3mo se desgarra el orden mundial por los temores de un regreso a un orden mundial que nuestro actual orden mundial de posguerra fue dise\u00f1ado para prevenir.\n\nSuena complicado, pero no lo es.\n\nNo hay suficiente de todo para dar la vuelta. No hay suficientes personas que se ganen la vida digna en una econom\u00eda global. Entonces, estamos volviendo al nacionalismo proteccionista para aislarnos del d\u00e9ficit.\n\n\n\nEstamos huyendo del problema, no resolvi\u00e9ndolo. Pero es lo que siempre hemos hecho cuando el miedo se afianza.\n\nEl orden mundial que estamos viendo ahora es uno de los arreglos para una pelea. No estamos muy seguros de cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 la lucha o de d\u00f3nde comenzar\u00e1, pero estamos configurando los argumentos para ello y preparando nuestras defensas.\n\nComo con muchos argumentos, tiene un impulso propio.\n\nEstamos observando, conscientes de lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo, pero sin ver una manera de contenerlo.\n\nEso es lo que hace que la lenta desaparici\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Merkel sea a\u00fan m\u00e1s preocupante.\n\nEn una Europa turbulenta, proporcion\u00f3 un baluarte de sentido com\u00fan, una l\u00f3gica estable en una situaci\u00f3n cada vez m\u00e1s il\u00f3gica.\n\nLa temporada de su generaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica est\u00e1 menguando, y hay un escalofr\u00edo en el aire.", "Police have identified Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley as the women who were killed when a gunman stormed a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Florida, and opened fire.", "(CNN) A New York man was arrested and charged with hate crimes after anti-Semitic messages were found in a temple, police said.\n\nJames Polite, 26, faces multiple charges, including fourth-degree criminal mischief as a hate crime and second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime in connection with anti-Semitic remarks found at the temple and fires set at several locations in Brooklyn hours later.\n\nOn Thursday night, graffiti was found on four floors of the Union Temple in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood, some of which said \"Hitler,\" \"Jews better be ready\" and \"Die Jew rats we are here,\" the New York Police Department said.\n\nPolite was also charged with second-degree arson and second-degree reckless endangerment -- both hate crimes -- in connection with a fire set early Friday in the coat closet of a Yeshiva school on Hewes Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood and fires at six other nearby locations, the NYPD said.\n\nThe locations appear to be associated with the Jewish community in Brooklyn.\n\nA janitor at the Yeshiva school noticed the fire, which was likely set between 2 and 2:30 a.m., and called authorities, NYPD Sgt. Lee Jones said. Police apprehended Polite at the scene. He was taken to Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn for a psychological evaluation, Jones said.\n\nWhile Polite was at the hospital, police determined he was the same man wanted in connection with the anti-Semitic graffiti found at Union Temple, Jones said.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio attended Shabbat services at the temple Friday night as a show of solidarity.\n\nAfter the service, he told journalists the incident was a horrible act of hate and \"deeply disturbing to all New Yorkers.\"\n\n\"But it is particularly painful for members of the Jewish community who feel very vulnerable right now, who feel under attack,\" de Blasio said.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said he was directing the state's hate crime unit to investigate.\n\n\"The disgusting rhetoric and heinous violence in this nation has reached a fever pitch and is ripping at the fabric of America, and it must stop,\" he said. \"In New York, we have forged community through chords of commonality and we will always stand together against hate and discrimination.\"\n\nAs of Monday morning, Polite was still at Woodhull Hospital. He has not appeared in court, the NYPD said. No arraignment has yet been set, according to Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson for the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office.\n\nSuspect had troubles, mentor says\n\nPolite learned he had bipolar disorder after he entered a required rehabilitation program in 2015, according to The New York Times , who profiled Polite in December 2017. Polite smoked marijuana as a way to manage stress during college, according to the Times, and was placed on a \"health leave of absence\" before entering the rehabilitation program.\n\nFormer New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said she met Polite at a gay pride rally for Barack Obama in 2008. Polite had an internship with Quinn when she was on the council, according to Julia Schechter, a spokesperson for Quinn.\n\nQuinn tweeted that she and others have tried to help him as he went through the foster care and mental health systems and he dealt with homelessness.\n\n\"The actions he is accused of break my heart and devastate all of us who tried to help him get on solid footing over the years. And while he has experienced hardship that most people can't ever imagine, his actions are inexcusable,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Times story said Polite worked for Quinn on initiatives to fight hate crimes, domestic violence and sexual assault. Quinn was in regular contact with Polite, but more recently, he seemed incoherent in conversation. When he stopped responding to her messages a few weeks ago, she told the Times she knew something was wrong.\n\nPolite began living with foster parents, Jenny Levison and Josh Waletzky, six years ago, according to a joint statement from Levison and Waletsky. They said they supported Polite through his mental health issues and drug addiction and said they were \"deeply saddened\" by his arrest.\n\n\"As Jews and New Yorkers, we are profoundly shaken and feel personally impacted by these acts, and our hearts break for all who are impacted,\" Levison and Waletsky said. \"The acts perpetrated in our city come at a troubling time, when violence and acts of intimidation against Jews and other vulnerable communities is on the rise across the country ... we remain committed to building a fair and just New York and country \u2014 together with people of all faiths, races, ethnicities, and cultures.\"\n\nPolite had been a volunteer for Obama's first presidential bid, registering voters and canvassing neighborhoods in New York, the Times reported. An Obama spokesperson declined to comment on Sunday.\n\nPolite graduated from Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2018, according to a university spokesperson, Julian Cardillo, who did not provide additional details of Polite's time at the university.\n\nOther cities recently saw anti-Semitic acts\n\nSwastikas have appeared in at least a handful of US cities since a massacre in Pittsburgh in which 11 worshippers were killed.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a New York resident posted pictures of swastikas that had been scrawled on homes in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood.\n\nThe Nazi symbols also appeared on Navy property this week in Bucks County, near Philadelphia. Warminster Township Manager Gregg Schuster posted online that local officials have been in contact with the Navy to get the symbols removed.\n\n\"The use of the swastika is a cowardly act,\" he said. \"In light of what our neighbors in Pittsburgh recently went through, I hope we can refrain from using these symbols of hate. There is no place in Warminster for this disgusting act and I know our community will never accept this behavior.\"\n\nA swastika also was found scrawled on a piece of paper in an elevator Monday at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, according to CNN affiliate WHAM.\n\nAlso this week, authorities said a synagogue in Irvine, California, had been vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti.\n\nSomeone spray-painted \"F*** Jews\" early Wednesday on the wall of Beth Jacob Congregation in Irvine, police said.\n\nAnti-Semitic incidents have been increasing in the United States in the last few years, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nThe Rabbinical Assembly, an international association of conservative rabbis, said last weekend's shooting is a reminder that anti-Semitism \"is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades.\"\n\nThere were 151 anti-Semitic hate crimes complaints in the city of New York in 2017, according to a report on the police department website.", "(CNN) One woman was a renowned doctor with an illustrious career spanning decades.\n\nThe other was on the cusp of graduating college, eager to launch a career helping others.\n\nThey were separated by 40 years, but united by their ties to Florida State University and a shared love of yoga.\n\nBut the tranquility of their yoga studio was shattered last week when a gunman stormed in and opened fire , senselessly ending the lives of the two beloved women.\n\nHere's what we know about Maura Binkley and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem:\n\nMaura Binkley\n\nFlorida State University student Maura Binkley was a \"beloved sister,\" her sorority said.\n\nBinkley was a 21-year-old student at Florida State, university President John Thrasher said.\n\nShe grew up in the Atlanta metro area and was known to friends and family for her compassion.\n\nBinkley \"just radiated love for everybody,\" her father Jeff Binkley said.\n\n\"You could see her life shines through just about everybody she met,\" he said. \"That's consolation to us.\"\n\nBinkley was studying for a double major in English and German, according to FSU's website\n\nShe spent this past summer studying at the University of Wuppertal in Germany, the website said.\n\n'The experience is so rewarding and makes the world seem so small,\" Binkley told Florida State University News this summer.\n\nShe planned to graduate in May and was in contention for a Fulbright scholarship to study in Germany, her father said.\n\nBinkley had also applied for a position with Teach for America . On the last day of her young life, Binkley was working on a lesson plan and preparing for an interview with Teach for America.\n\n\"She was so excited,\" her father said.\n\nHis daughter had never been particularly political, he said. But she wanted to see change after the Parkland school massacre in February.\n\nAfter the shooting, Binkley went to the state Capitol with Parkland students and their families to lobby for change.\n\nShe later asked her father, \"Dad, what can I do? What can I do about this?\" he said.\n\n\"We talked about it, never dreaming that it was going to be us,\" Jeff Binkley said.\n\n\"She'd want to tell you that people just need to step back and think of losses of all types ... that emanate from our lack of ability to deal in any effective way with pervasive mental illness and the control and regulation of firearms,\" he said.\n\n\"She'd also say she wished nothing but peace and love and care for everybody,\" he added, choking up and hanging his head.\n\nThe yoga studio where she was killed had been there for years, he said, and was right above one of his favorite restaurants to eat with Maura when he was in town.\n\nBinkley's sorority, Delta Delta Delta, called her a \"beloved sister\" on its Facebook page\n\n\"As a leader in the (Alpha Eta) chapter, Maura embodied the Tri Delta woman -- brave, bold and kind,\" a statement from President Kimberlee Sullivan said. \"Our hearts are with her family, our sisters and the FSU community during this difficult time.\"\n\nDr. Nancy Van Vessem\n\nDr. Nancy Van Vessem was chief medical director for Florida's Capital Health Plan.\n\nVan Vessem, 61, was a doctor and chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, according to the Tallahassee Democrat . She was also a faculty member at Florida State, Thrasher said.\n\nAccording to the Florida State College of Medicine's website , Van Vessem was in charge of coordinating third- and fourth-year clerkship rotations in internal medicine on the school's Tallahassee campus.\n\nShe earned her medical degree from St. Louis University, the website said, and her research focus was \"restructuring health care for people with multiple chronic diseases.\"\n\nAt a vigil on FSU's campus Sunday night, Thrasher recalled Van Vessem's daughter saying no one was \"more selfless, more loving, supportive and fabulous\" than her mother.\n\nBig Bend Hospice in Tallahassee shared a tribute to Van Vessem on its Facebook page, calling the doctor \"a physician and leader who touched countless lives as chief medical officer at Capital Health Plan.\"\n\n\"Dr. Van Vessem was part of the Big Bend Hospice community,\" the statement said. \"She was our friend and a champion for end-of-life care.\"",

In the midst of this election, the first significant national vote since the election of Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh's nomination and confirmation battle only amped up the existing pressure on questions of gender, power, women's health and women in elected office.\n\nCNN Opinion asked thinkers to weigh in on 2018 as a Year of the Woman. The views expressed here are solely theirs.\n\nLaura Coates: The only thing coming to save us is a ballot in shining armor\n\nOne can be heard without being listened to. Women voters have long felt the impact of this nuance, and the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing exemplified it. Both sides of the political aisle preached that women, particularly women alleging sexual misconduct, should be heard. Cries for due process, notice of the charges against someone accused and meaningful opportunity to be heard echoed throughout both chambers of Congress and reverberated throughout the nation. The actual mechanisms to facilitate sound were provided: a microphone, a camera, and a platform. The intangible mechanisms of listening, however, were regrettably absent. Women noticed.\n\nHearing is passive and non-purposeful. Listening is an action. Women voters should and are demanding more than patronizing passivity. As was the case in the year following Anita Hill's testimony more than a quarter century ago, women are keenly aware (perhaps now more than ever) that they cannot afford to wait for receptive ears. Women are prepared and capable of voting for (or being elected by) those whose policies in practice reflect our collective values, strengths, empathy, intellect, and power.\n\nThe Venus symbol for women is thought to represent a bronze mirror atop a handle. For at least the past two years, women have held a mirror up to America and recoiled at its reflection. The democratic fairy tale doesn't exist. The only thing coming to save us is a ballot in shining armor. When we raise our voices on Election Day to ask the proverbial \"Mirror Mirror on the wall, who's the right candidate to listen to us all?\" - - a woman will respond.\n\nLaura Coates is a CNN legal analyst.

While I would love to believe that a larger female share of federal lawmakers will mean a better life for US women, I don't have the evidence to support this, especially considering women's record since the last year of the woman, 1992.\n\nI think this is because a lot of female politicians -- like a lot of male politicians -- mistake legalized abortion or free contraception for the sum of \"feminism,\" while failing to solve the problems women suffer most.\n\nTo date, however, both female and male politicians spend most of their time attending to middle-class and wealthier Americans. And I can't point to sustained, bold action on the part of female representatives on religious freedom or paid or flexible leave.\n\nI haven't given up hope that elected women will bring women's needs to the table more forcefully. I am only saying that their sex doesn't guarantee it, and that female citizens will not be absolved of their duty to agitate for what women need most.\n\nHelen Alvar\u00e9 is a professor of law at George Mason University who has published widely on issues of marriage, family, parenting and First Amendment religion clauses. Her recent book with Cambridge University Press is about putting children's interests first in US family law.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre: If 1992 was Year of the Woman, 2018 must be Year of Accountability\n\nThe year 1992 was the first election year to be proclaimed the \"Year of the Woman.\" It was the year after the Anita Hill hearings -- and the year when an unprecedented number of women ran for office. Illinois' Carol Moseley-Braun won her race, becoming the first black woman ever elected to the Senate. Along with her, a wave of women took political office.\n\nNow, in 2018, it's been 26 years since the \"Year of the Woman\" -- and yet, we still live in a country where women are treated as lesser, where medicine is designed often without women in mind, where maternal mortality rates are far higher than those of our peer countries. And where a man credibly accused of sexual assault and harassment can still be confirmed to the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2018, another \"Year of the Woman\" won't be enough. It isn't enough to elect women -- though we urgently should do that. And it isn't enough to believe women like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford if you still choose to confirm her alleged attacker to the Supreme Court.\n\nSo if 1992 was the \"Year of the Woman\", then 2018 must be the \"Year of Accountability.\" And in the \"Year of Accountability\", we must demand accountability from everyone who fails to support women and our needs, no matter their race, gender, or political party.\n\nWe will demand accountability from the 45 men who voted for Brett Kavanaugh, as well as Susan Collins and the four other Republican women in the Senate who joined her.\n\nWe will demand accountability from the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump.\n\nWe will demand accountability from every member of Congress and local government who fails to adequately address the maternal health crisis that disproportionately affects black women.\n\nIn 1992, the \"Year of the Woman\" was an important and consequential feat, bringing our country's electoral representation closer to our demographics. But we've learned from time and experience, and from our greatest teachers, that simply supporting women isn't enough. In 2018, women need more than just support and votes. We need full accountability.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre is the senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn. She is also a lecturer in international and public affairs at Columbia University.\n\nSally Kohn: Win or lose, women are changing politics, permanently\n\nSally Kohn\n\nNo matter what happens on Tuesday, the record number of women running for election this year is undoubtedly going to change politics permanently, for the better. But what's also significant is that many of the women running aren't conventional candidates. These aren't elite career politicians making their run at the next rung of politics. They're single moms and school teachers and public interest lawyers who want to make a difference for their communities and their countries.\n\nTake Kara Eastman , a Democrat running in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. Raised by a single mom, Eastman started the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance to ensure that children have access to homes free of lead and other environmental hazards. And she was on the board of her region's community college. She's running against an incumbent Republican who has vowed to gut the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Labor.\n\nOr consider Katie Porter , a Democrat running for California's 45th Congressional District. Porter has spent her career as a consumer protection attorney going after big banks financial institutions that cheat consumers. She teaches consumer law and was appointed a few years ago by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris to be the state's watchdog against big banks. Porter is running against a Republican incumbent who was an investment banker until entering politics 22 years ago.\n\nA community-based environmental activist challenging an anti-EPA climate-change denier and a banking consumer watchdog challenging a big-bank friendly career politician. These challengers aren't just changing politics because they're women. They're changing the game with their range of expertise and experience they bring to the table as candidates who represent real people and their concerns, not just special interest elites. Politics will hopefully never be the same.\n\nSally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \" The Opposite of Hate .\"\n\nVan Jones: Women of color are starting to get the respect that they deserve\n\nA scandal-tarred, extremist Republican. Accusations of sexual misconduct. A southern state where Democrats rarely compete. Attempts to suppress the black vote. A multi-racial, populist coalition putting in the work.\n\nThat was the scene in December 2017, when Doug Jones upset Roy Moore in a special election for Alabama's Senate seat.\n\nNow, with 2018 tagged as a successor to 1992's \"Year of the woman,\" that Alabama contest deserves a second look. In the wake of Jones' surprise victory, it quickly became clear who was responsible for it: black women. Black women put in the long hard volunteer hours. Black women got their families, friends, neighbors and churches to the polls. Black women voted 98% for Doug Jones.\n\nIt is really no surprise. Black women have been the backbone of the Democratic Party for decades. All that has changed is that women of color are starting to get the credit they deserve.\n\nThey are also in leadership roles. That is an overdue and welcome development. From Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts to Ilhan Omar in Minnesota to Stacey Abrams' historic bid for governor in Georgia, black women are not just singing in the choir but preaching from the pulpit.\n\nThat fact is even more true when you pull back the lens and look at the waves of all women of color -- Native American, Palestinian, Latina, more than I can mention -- determined to make history in November. In the GOP stronghold of Idaho, a young Democrat named Paulette Jordan could become the first-ever Native American governor.\n\nWith all the attention on the new \"Year of the woman,\" I hope we do not lose sight of the beautiful rainbow of women of color who are leading the charge and organizing behind the scenes. Whether or not a blue wave materializes, their voices and concerns deserve to be at the center of conversation in 2019 and beyond.\n\nVan Jones is the host of the \"The Van Jones Show\" and a CNN political commentator. He is the co-founder of #cut50 , a national, bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps\n\nCarrie Sheffield: Painting Republicans as anti-woman is backfiring\n\nCarrie Sheffield\n\nWomen are the backbone of American democracy. We made up 55% (far greater than men's 45%) of the 2016 electorate, and we are an undeniable force for social change. Women are running for office in record numbers this year, and when the Election Day dust settles, I'd wager we'll be positioned for historic impact on Capitol Hill and legislatures nationwide.\n\nIn 2014, when Democrats tried to project a phony \"War On Women\" mantra against Republicans, accusing them of holding women back, I found it ironic that on Election Night 2014, it was the first female combat veteran to be elected to the Senate -- Republican Joni Ernst -- whose victory tipped the balance of the Senate into Republican hands. Ernst is a fighter for women -- and for all people, both at home and overseas.\n\nWe're seeing Democrats reaching for this familiar but tired tactic in 2018, and I believe we'll see a similar outcome to 2014. America's women are smarter than to fall for a manufactured \"anti-woman\" narrative against Republicans, who are economically empowering America's middle class, both men and women. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, annualized, median weekly take-home pay was just $43,368 at Q3 in 2016, compared to $46,436 at Q3 in 2018. This is an increase of $3,068, which is a substantial raise of 7%. The weekly pay increase was roughly the same for women and men.\n\nCarrie Sheffield, a conservative commentator, is National Editor for Accuracy in Media, a citizens' media watchdog whose mission is to promote accuracy, fairness and balance in news reporting.\n\nTami Sawyer: Stacey Abrams is a game-changer for women like me\n\nTami Sawyer\n\nStacey Abrams is on the cusp of breaking one of the tallest glass ceilings in our country. Should her campaign to be governor of Georgia prove successful on November 6, she will be the first black woman governor in the United States. The possibility of this historic moment is breathtaking for all of us, but it is a particular game-changer for women like me, who grew up under a monolithic prescription for success.\n\nAs a girl and later as a woman, I was often told to wait until I was married or to go make more money or to lose weight. When I was in high school in the late 90s, my mom used to have \"the talk\" with me. \"Tam, you're a black woman, you have to work extra hard, dress impeccably, and be above reproach.\"\n\nBack then, I thought success included being a certain dress size, wearing your hair straight and long, getting married and having children. When Hollywood cast black actresses as successful working women, they looked like Robin Givens. I spent a ridiculous amount of money to add bundles of hair to my head. I tried every fad diet. When I got a little older, my heart sank with every friend's engagement and birth announcement that came my way. Even as I achieved recognition for my community and professional work, there were times that I still felt unfulfilled because I didn't look like Gabrielle Union in \"Two Can Play That Game\" nor have a husband and children like Rainbow on \"Blackish.\"\n\nLast fall, I was scrolling through Facebook when a video popped on my timeline. The video introduced me to Stacey Abrams: a Yale law school graduate, former deputy city attorney of Atlanta and then-Minority Leader of the Georgia House of Representatives. I was in awe as I watched, but not because of her enormous levels of success, but because Stacey Abrams looked like me. She wore her hair in a short natural style and she had curves and cushions like many Southern girls. And also like me, she was not married, had no children, and had student debt.\n\nAt the time, I was weighing the possibility of running for office in my hometown of Memphis for a second time. Stacey Abrams was a needed affirmation that my body type, my hair, my finances nor my marital status discounted my potential to lead or make change.\n\nStacey Abrams empowered me to see myself and my future through a different lens. I went on to run for office with renewed confidence. I won my election for County Commissioner in August of this year and I've never been prouder to stand tall and lead as a black woman than I am in this moment in time because of the rise of women like Stacey. On November 6th, I hope Stacey will be victorious and that her victory is even sweeter knowing she has broken the mold of success.\n\nTami Sawyer is a commissioner on the Shelby County Commission in Memphis and a social justice advocate.\n\nKurt Bardella: Weinstein didn't spark this movement, Donald Trump did\n\nKurt Bardella\n\nIn many ways, I think the fact that Donald Trump, an accused serial sexual harasser , got away with his abhorrent conduct and rhetoric to win the presidency helped ignite the #MeToo #TimesUp movement. The power dynamics used against women were no longer restricted to the shadows. In his words and actions, Trump put this behavior front and center.\n\nIt became clear to me things would be different from now on when the Women's March drew three times the turnout that Trump's inauguration did. This was a turning point. Passive resistance was not an option. The visual of half-a-million Americans uniting to support the empowerment of women would inspire a higher level of participation in the political process that is unprecedented and historic.\n\nThe events of the past few weeks have only fanned the flames of the women's movement in this country. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford facing a Senate Republican Judiciary Committee that was made up of all white men. Trump labeling multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a \"hoax.\" Trump attacking Stormy Daniels by calling her \"horseface.\" Trump attacking multiple female journalists accusing one of \"not thinking\" and telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins \"don't do that\" when she asked him a question.\n\nThe coming November midterms amount to a reckoning against all the men in Congress who have enabled Trump to continue degrading women and protecting those who oppress them. Make no mistake about it, this isn't the culmination of this movement, it's just the beginning of a process that will permanently change the political dynamics in this country.\n\nKurt Bardella is the former spokesperson for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and for U.S. Senator Olympia J.

More than 4 million people around the world joined the Women's March. In the last two years, according to the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation, 1 in 5 Americans have marched or protested. The number one issue motivating them is women's rights. The #MeToo movement has swept our culture, bringing stories of sexual assault and harassment out of the shadows.\n\nWomen's marches and protests have not stopped the Trump administration from following through with his threats to women's rights. He tried (and repeatedly failed) to overturn the Affordable Care Act and block patients from coming to Planned Parenthood for care with defunding efforts . He's since proposed a gag rule to prevent doctors and nurses who participate in the nation's family planning program from telling patients all their options when it comes to pregnancy. And he's appointed two blatantly anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court, one despite accusations of sexual assault and a national outcry against the nomination.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his allies in Congress have ignored women's outrage at every turn, attacking our rights and our ability to make our own decisions about our bodies and futures.\n\nDuring the last \"Year of the Woman\" election, the 1992 midterms, a record four women were elected to the US Senate, and a record 24 to the House. It was an important moment. But as then-Sen. Barbara Mikulski said , \"Calling 1992 the Year of the Woman makes it sound like the Year of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus. We're not a fad, a fancy, or a year.\"\n\nThis year, with our health and lives on the line, we need more than a moment. So we've built a movement. Planned Parenthood Action Fund is running its largest-ever midterm effort to turn out voters who believe in reproductive health and rights. November 6, 2018 will not just usher in \"The Year of the Woman.\" It will mark a shift in who holds political power in this country. Not only because a record number of women are running for office, but also because the vast majority of organizers, activists, donors, and voters for progressive candidates are women. And together, these women aren't giving up or backing down.\n\nDawn Laguens is the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\nJeff Yang: 2018 is the year of the women, plural\n\nJeff Yang\n\nI think the biggest difference between this year and 1992's \"Year of the Woman\" (and -- as Slate's Lila Thulin has pointed out -- the many years that have been dubbed \"Year of the Woman\" before and since) is the breadth of diversity among the candidates. Among the female candidates running serious races with real chance of winning are out lesbians and bisexual and transgender individuals. There are an unprecedented number of female military veterans and there are disabled woman candidates\n\nAnd where race and ethnicity are concerned, the number of nonwhite women running for office -- black, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and Native American -- has outstripped any prior electoral field . In short, while prior years might have deserved the designation \"Year of the Woman,\" in 2018 we are finally seeing the \"Year of the Women\" -- a plural, inclusive and intersectional representation that's poised to shatter our preexisting stereotypes of female leadership.\n\nJeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications, and the co-host of the podcast \"They Call Us Bruce.\" He co-wrote Jackie Chan's best-selling autobiography, \"I Am Jackie Chan,\" and is the editor of three graphic novels: \"Secret Identities,\" \"Shattered\" and the forthcoming \"New Frontiers.\"\n\nKristin Kanthak: In 2018, it's all about millennial women\n\nKristin Kanthak\n\nPart of the reason why incumbents in Congress nearly always win reelection is that really good candidates almost never run against them . But what if a new type of candidate started running, one who is motivated not by getting to win public office itself, but by having the opportunity to help their communities? These new candidates, according to a study in \" Political Psychology ,\" are more likely to be women.\n\nIt's no surprise that the GOP is on a collision course with demographics as their party ages. Millennials prefer the Democratic Party by nearly 60% , but as the youngest generation in the electorate, they are also the least likely to vote. Importantly, though, the question of how long the Republicans are safe remains almost entirely up to one group: Millennial women, 70% of whom identify most closely with the Democratic Party and who are most enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nIndeed, millennial women have likely already changed the political landscape with the record-breaking surge of women candidates running for office, not only because they are a different gender of candidate, but they may be a different type of candidate altogether.\n\nDemocrat Joe Crowley is perhaps the best-known of the 2018 class of heretofore-entrenched incumbents. He became a Congressman when his boss, the previous incumbent, hand-picked him in 1998. With a loss being inevitable, no high-quality candidates stepped forward until Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a political activist who had previously not considered running for office , decided \"on a lark\" to run because she wanted to affect change. She did not wait for the most strategic time to run. She just ran. And she defeated him soundly.\n\nRepublicans may also be robbing future turnout to pay for current turnout. Older women are much more supportive of #metoo than are older men, but no such gender gap exists for younger people. Being on the \"wrong\" side of #metoo may hurt the Republicans not only with women in the future, but with men, too.\n\nThe only question is how long it will take for millennials to start making their political mark. If some projections are correct and millennials vote in record numbers in this election, the future is already here.\n\nKristin Kanthak is an associate professor in the University of Pittsburgh's political science department. She is co-editor of the State Politics and Policy Quarterly, a political science journal focusing on state politics.\n\nKristin Rowe-Finkbeiner: The patriarchy fought back this year, but we're still strong\n\nKristin Rowe-Finkbeiner\n\n2018 has been a year when more women have recognized how intertwined gender, economic, and racial justice are -- that one doesn't happen without the others, so we must unite to rise together. It's also been a year of tremendous backlash\n\nFrom Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, to rolling back protections for women's healthcare provided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and even to a man on a plane groping a woman and trying to excuse his behavio r to officers with, \"the president of the United States says it's OK to grab women by their private parts\"; the backlash has been strong and ubiquitous.\n\nTo say the \"patriarchy\" has fought back from a place of fear is an understatement.\n\nIronically, the strength of that backlash is one of the best measures of the power of these intersecting concerns can have when women of different racial, regional, and economic backgrounds -- and their allies -- unite to rise together. That backlash only strengthens our resolve. Women are not giving up. 2018 is the year that the \"Decade of Women\" begins.\n\nIn our last midterm election , only 36% of eligible voters bothered to vote. This year, it's time to use the election as a launching point into a new era when having this many women on the ballot and winning primaries and elections is commonplace, not cause to deem it a \"Year of the Woman.\" That starts by making sure all our friends, family, and neighbors vote along with us, next Tuesday and in every election.\n\nFor more opinion...

And it's working: Applebee's US same-store sales increased 7.7% in the third quarter of this year, setting a 14-year record.\n\nWhile fast food brands are ditching artificial ingredients and offering healthier alternatives, Applebee's has embraced comfort food for a banner year.\n\n\"Americans are stressed,\" Cywinski told CNN Business.\n\n\"When stressed, they tend to go to comfort food ... and we're pretty darn good at comfort food,\" he said. \"That's the role we play.\"\n\n\"We look at ourselves as America's kitchen table,\" he said, noting that with about 1,800 locations, most Americans are within driving distance of a restaurant. \"We're that affordable indulgence.\"\n\nWhat went wrong\n\nA few years ago, Applebee's was struggling. The brand started selling seared and grilled items and serving smaller portions to chase a more health-conscious consumer.\n\nWith these initiatives, the brand was targeting just a small segment of their customers, the \"up-and-coming guest,\" said Brian Vaccaro, a restaurant analyst with Raymond James.\n\n\"They tried to pursue a customer who wasn't going to Applebee's anyway,\" said Stephen Anderson, a senior equity research analyst covering restaurants at Maxim Group. The strategy flopped and sales declined.\n\nApplebee's wants you to eat good in the neighborhood. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nApplebee's customers have an average household income of $70,000, the company said. About 30% of its customers are Millennials, but it also sells to Baby Boomers and Gen Xers. And it serves more families and black and Hispanic customers than its peers.\n\nThe brand struggled because it \"took its eye off its core guest and lost sight of who Applebee's is, and what Applebee's stands for,\" Cywinski said.\n\nCheap drinks and comfort food\n\nTo get Applebee's back on track, Cywinski hired a new leadership team. He convinced franchisees to contribute toward Applebee's advertising fund. He rolled out drink promotion after drink promotion: Dollaritas, Dollar Zombies and, most recently, $2 Bud Lights.\n\nAlcohol accounts for about 15% of Applebee's business, Cywinski said. It's important because stressed out customers may want a drink with dinner. And when people come to drink, they often order food.\n\nWhen it comes to meals, Applebee's is focusing on \"abundant value,\" Cywinski said. That means all-you-can-eat riblets and chicken tenders and creamy pasta dishes.\n\nApplebee's competitors Chili's and Olive Garden have also been performing well recently.\n\nWage growth and higher employment rates have helped the consumer environment overall, Vaccarro said. Those are \"all positive for casual dining,\" he noted.\n\nBut Applebee's has been \"significantly outperforming the industry,\" Vaccaro added. That may be because Applebee's has done such a good job of showing customers that it's about the value and the experience, he said.\n\nSkirting the health trend\n\nWith a bigger advertising budget, Applebee's poured money into campaigns that highlight the brand's renewed commitment to indulgent food. The ads are designed to make you laugh and make you hungry, Cywinski said. One video, promoting the new pasta dishes, shows close-up shots of decadent dishes while \"At Last\" by Etta James plays in the background.\n\nApplebee's is still offering healthier options, Cywinski said. But the brand is focusing on comfort food. Applebee's is about \"making people hungry [and] satisfying them,\" he said. \"So that doesn't mean small portions, it doesn't mean pursuing niche trends.\"\n\nThe company has found its sweet spots without leaning on trends.\n\n\"They're not going after the avocado toast Millennials,\" said Anderson. \"They're going after middle America.\"", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 (CNN) \u2013 \u0633\u064a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u060c \u0631\u062c\u0628 \u0637\u064a\u0628 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0628\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u062f\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0644\u062f \u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0635\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633\u060c \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0627\u0636\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0629.\n\n\u0648\u0633\u064a\u0644\u062a\u0642\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0646\u062a\u062f\u0649 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633 \u0644\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062a\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0633\u0639\u0649 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0639\u0627\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u063a\u0644\u0628 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0639\u0642\u062f \u0641\u064a 11 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631/\u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0648\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0631 \u0644\u06403 \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645.\n\n\u0648\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0634 \u0623\u0631\u062f\u0648\u063a\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0628 \u0642\u0636\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0639\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0628\u062c \u0648\u0625\u062f\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u062a\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0648\u0627\u062a\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u062b\u064a\u0642 \u0644\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0636\u0627\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0628\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0627\u0636\u0648\u0644.\n\n\u064a\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0629-\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u0647\u062f\u062a \u062a\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u0646\u0633\u0628\u064a\u0627 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u062c\u062a \u0623\u0646\u0642\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u062a\u062c\u0632\u0627 \u0644\u062f\u064a\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0623\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0646.", "Pittsburgh (CNN) In a short but impassioned sermon Saturday, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers blamed politicians for a rise in hateful rhetoric, saying it led to the massacre at his synagogue last week in which 11 Jews were slain in the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history.\n\nMyers said he delivered that message personally to President Donald Trump when he and first lady Melania Trump visited Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha synagogue, the site of the shooting here in Pittsburgh, on Tuesday.\n\n\"I said to him, 'Mr. President, hate speech leads to hateful actions. Hate speech leads to what happened in my sanctuary, where seven of my congregants were slaughtered. I witnessed it with my eyes.\"\n\nAccording to police, the man accused of the attack yelled that he wanted to \"kill Jews,\" in part because Jewish groups have been helping refugees settle in the United States.\n\nMyers was speaking at a \"unity\" Shabbat service at Congregation Beth Shalom in Pittsburgh, where members of all three congregations that met at Tree of Life, as well as other members of the city's Jewish community, came together to worship on Saturday morning.\n\nWearing a rainbow-colored prayer shawl and a Pittsburgh-themed yarmulke, Rabbi Myers made his distaste for Washington clear but also said he does not \"foist blame\" on the President or \"any one person\" for the attack.\n\nMyers also addressed criticism he has received from fellow Jews irked that he met with Trump, who has been accused of using anti-Semitic tropes and hateful rhetoric. Trump has repeatedly denied the accusations, noting that his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish.\n\n\"The scourge of anti-Semitism cannot be ignored, cannot be tolerated and cannot be allowed to continue,\" Trump said last week.\n\nMyers said members of the Trump administration, including the president's personal secretary and son-in-law Jared Kushner, have contacted him to offer support this week.\n\nBut after meeting with Trump, Myers said Saturday, some Jews accused the rabbi of \"going to the dark side.\" One even suggested that he get \"un-circumcised.\"\n\n\"I said, 'OK, you go first,'\" Myers said, drawing laughter from the congregation.\n\nMore seriously, Myers said he drew on Jewish tradition in meeting with the President, particularly the Bible's insistence on welcoming strangers. That was the message of the Torah portion that would have been read during the Shabbat service last Saturday had the gunman not stormed his synagogue, the rabbi said.\n\nA week later, more than 600 people filled Congregation Beth Shalom for the Shabbat service, including many members of the three congregations attacked a little more than a mile away at Tree of Life. Members of all three congregations took turns reading the portions of the Torah.\n\nNear the beginning of the service, the congregation observed a minute and 11 seconds of silence, commemorating the 11 Jews murdered on October 27.\n\n\"God did not have anything to do with this,\" Beth Kissileff said in a heartfelt speech at the unity service.\n\nA writer and wife of a rabbi at New Light Congregation, one of the three congregations that met inside Tree of Life, Kissileff drew applause when she continued, \"That is not our theology. Humans are given free will. We have a choice between good and evil. Some people choose to do evil. Our job is to make sure that those who choose evil don't have access to assault rifles.\"\n\nImpromptu Shabbat service right now in front of Tree of Life. Police barriers still block entry to the sanctuary. pic.twitter.com/1JKlxym5vY \u2014 Daniel Burke (@BurkeCNN) November 2, 2018\n\nAbout a mile away, in front of the still-closed Tree of Life Synagogue, its former rabbi, Chuck Diamond, led a Shabbat service outside on Saturday morning.\n\n\"This was a place that stood, for so many people, for joy,\" Diamond said. It was the site of bris ceremonies, bar mitvahs and weddings. The rabbi urged the survivors not to feel guilty, but to remember that they have been blessed with the gift of life.\n\nA makeshift congregation\n\nAs Friday evening fell, with police tape marking the barriers of their makeshift congregation , members of Pittsburgh's Jewish community welcomed the Sabbath outside of the Tree of Life synagogue.\n\nAbout 50 men locked arms and swayed, harmonizing in Hebrew under darkening skies, while police looked on and pilgrims laid stones and flowers at memorials for the 11 congregants who were slain. The building is still closed while police process the crime scene.\n\nMany of the women sang, too, though they stood off to the side. Children ran back and forth playing between their parents' legs. A father gently wiped tears from his teenage son's cheeks, consoling him softly as the congregation prayed.\n\nAt one point, the service was stopped to thank a member of the FBI who had helped the Chevrah Kadisha, the Jewish organization that helps prepare bodies for burial. Afterward, the congregation broke into \"Al Hanisim,\" a Hanukkah song that commemorates Jews' perseverance in the face of violent oppression. Though not normally a part of Shabbat services, no one had to ask why the song was appropriate to sing on this night.\n\n\"The Jewish people know from our history that, no matter how bad things seem, we can always pull together, we will always persevere,\" said Rabbi Sam Weinberg, principal of Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh, whose students helped organize the Shabbat service through text messages Friday.\n\n\"Six days after, right here,\" he continued, pointing at the Tree of Life synagogue that loomed nearby, \"the most horrible and terrible thing happened, we can still come together as a people and recover a little bit of the peace of Shabbat.\"\n\nThe service capped an emotional day in Pittsburgh as the city's Jewish community buried the last of their dead. As night fell, it seemed as if half of Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh's historically Jewish neighborhood, was walking home from Sabbath services, huddling together against the cold.\n\n'A circle no one wants to be a part of'\n\nThe last funeral for the 11 Jews killed a week ago was held Friday. Rose Mallinger, 97, was remembered for her strong will and commitment to Tree of Life.\n\nUnder the soaring vaults of Rodef Shalom's sanctuary, another of Pittsburgh's large and historic synagogues, Mallinger's family and friends praised her zest for life.\n\n\"She was 97, but she was not done,\" said Rabbi Myers, who led Mallinger's congregation at Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha. \"She had spunk.\"\n\nLater in the service, Myers said that \"an angel\" had visited him Friday morning, just as his spiritual strength was waning. That angel, he said, was the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning , pastor of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, where a racist gunman killed nine members in 2015.\n\nSome in the congregation gasped when Myers called Manning to the front of the Rodef Shalom on Friday.\n\nCongregants of various faiths gather Friday with the Rodef Shalom congregation in Pittsburgh.\n\nWearing a button commemorating the Charleston massacre, Manning said he traveled to Pittsburgh to offer moral sustenance, show solidarity and to \"pay it forward,\" after many Americans stepped up to support his church.\n\nAt Mallinger's memorial service, the pastor read Psalm 23 and told the congregation that his church \"mourns with you, is here with you and will always be here with you.\"\n\nAfter the service, a long line of mourners waited to speak with Manning, hugging him and tearfully thanking him for coming to Pittsburgh. One woman sobbed as she lamented a rise in white nationalism, while the pastor stoically consoled her.\n\nPittsburgh's Jews and his Charleston community share a common and tragic bond, Manning said in a brief interview afterward.\n\n\"We are part of a circle that no one wants to be a part of,\" he said. \"What we have to do, today, and every day, is to make sure that that circle doesn't get any bigger.\"\n\nManning was just one of many people across the world moved by last week's anti-Semitic attack.\n\nMyers said he received a call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.

Ahora Apple est\u00e1 haciendo un cambio para asegurarse de que no tiene que hablar tanto sobre ese problema.\n\nEn una conferencia telef\u00f3nica el jueves, los principales ejecutivos de Apple presentaron sus planes para dejar de revelar la cantidad de iPhones, iPad y Mac que venden cada trimestre. Es un movimiento que sorprendi\u00f3 a los analistas y solo aument\u00f3 el nerviosismo en torno a un informe de ganancias mixtas.\n\nMIRA: Tres gr\u00e1ficos para entender el problema de Apple con el iPhone\n\nDaniel Ives, un analista de Wedbush, calific\u00f3 el anuncio como \"asombroso\" en una nota para inversionistas el viernes por la ma\u00f1ana, particularmente porque Apple se encuentra en una \"coyuntura cr\u00edtica\". Dijo que Apple est\u00e1 tratando de compensar la desaceleraci\u00f3n del crecimiento de las ventas por unidad al cobrar m\u00e1s por su l\u00ednea de dispositivos.\n\nEfectivamente, en el per\u00edodo de tres meses que termin\u00f3 en septiembre, Apple vendi\u00f3 casi 47 millones de iPhones, lo que representa un crecimiento del 0% en el n\u00famero de tel\u00e9fonos inteligentes vendidos del a\u00f1o anterior. En los pr\u00f3ximos trimestres, la cantidad de iPhones que vende Apple podr\u00eda disminuir, pero probablemente no lo sepamos.\n\nLas ventas unitarias de Mac y iPad de Apple cayeron un 2% y un 6%, respectivamente, durante el trimestre en comparaci\u00f3n con el a\u00f1o anterior.\n\nSin embargo, los ingresos generales de Apple siguen aumentando de un a\u00f1o a otro. Eso es en gran parte porque la compa\u00f1\u00eda est\u00e1 subiendo los precios en todos los \u00e1mbitos. Apple gan\u00f3 8.000 millones m\u00e1s de d\u00f3lares vendiendo iPhones que un a\u00f1o antes (cuando vendi\u00f3 casi la misma cantidad de iPhones).\n\nApple ahora no tiene uno, sino dos tel\u00e9fonos inteligentes en el mercado, el XS y el XS Max, con precios que pueden superar los 1.000 d\u00f3lares. Apple tambi\u00e9n introdujo recientemente iPad Pros y MacBook Air m\u00e1s caros.\n\nMIRA: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Apple ya no quiere que sepas cu\u00e1ntos iPhones vende?\n\nEn la llamada con los analistas, el director ejecutivo de Apple, Tim Cook, trat\u00f3 de explicar la decisi\u00f3n de eliminar las cifras de ventas de las unidades a trav\u00e9s de una analog\u00eda de una tienda de comestibles.\n\n\"Si usted va al mercado y empuja su carrito hacia la cajera y ella dice, o \u00e9l dice, '\u00bfCu\u00e1ntas unidades tiene ah\u00ed?' \"No importa mucho cu\u00e1ntas unidades haya all\u00ed en t\u00e9rminos del valor general de lo que hay en el carro\".\n\nLo que importa ahora, en otras palabras, no es necesariamente cu\u00e1ntos dispositivos vende Apple de un trimestre al siguiente, sino cu\u00e1nto gana con los dispositivos que vende. Es una p\u00edldora dif\u00edcil de tragar para Wall Street.\n\n\"La eliminaci\u00f3n de las m\u00e9tricas de la unidad de informes para iPhone, iPad y Mac es significativa: la calle se obsesiona con ellos\", escribi\u00f3 Gene Munster, analista de Loup Ventures, en una nota el viernes.\n\nM\u00e1s que eso, la decisi\u00f3n una vez m\u00e1s genera preocupaci\u00f3n sobre cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 el pr\u00f3ximo gran motor de crecimiento para la compa\u00f1\u00eda m\u00e1s grande del mundo.

And nowhere is that clearer than in upstate New York.\n\nClaudia Tenney in New York's 22nd Congressional District and John Faso in the neighboring 19th District have taken markedly different approaches to the omnipresent President, despite both being two vulnerable Republican incumbents running in a year where Democrats are eager to deliver a powerful rebuke to Trump.\n\nThough the President won both districts in 2016, top Republican operatives believe the races are similar: Neither Republican is particularly well-liked at home, meaning Trump's popularity and the image of the Republican Party will be key to whether Republicans hold onto the districts.\n\nBut Tenney, a bombastic, conservative congresswoman known for her fiery rhetoric and propensity to often make head-scratching comments, has fully embraced Trump and made that strategy central to her campaign against Anthony Brindisi, an assemblyman from Utica. The district is more conservative than her neighbor -- Trump won the 22nd by 16 percentage points in 2016 -- and Tenney's rhetoric reflects those values.\n\nIn contrast, Faso, a more mild-mannered Republican, has eschewed some of Trumpism, voting against his tax plan and dismissing the President's role in his re-election bid. Despite that, he still has the President's support, as Trump tweeted an endorsement for Faso on Saturday.\n\nBut that has not kept one of the President's key political tactics -- the use of race -- out of Faso's contest against Antonio Delgado, an African-American Harvard law graduate and Rhodes Scholar.\n\nAds from the Congressional Leadership Fund and the National Republican Congressional Committee have focused on Delgado's brief career as rapper AD the Voice, labeling him derisively as \"big city rapper Antonio Delgado,\" questioning some of the lyrics in his songs and suggesting he would be more fit running in places like New York City or Los Angeles. The ads are dripping in race-based politics and use white voters to suggest Delgado doesn't understand the predominately white district.\n\nFaso has played coy with the ads, in part because they provide Republicans with a powerful way to question Delgado's ties to a district he moved to shortly before announcing his bid for Congress. In the span of five minutes on Friday, Faso told reporters here at the quaint Inn at Leeds that he didn't like a lot of the ads and distanced himself from them -- \"These are not my ads,\" he said twice -- while also endorsing the substance of the attacks.\n\n\"The fact is that my opponent has never owned up to his words and he just moved into the district,\" Faso said. \"His words matter and because he has no record in our district ... it is natural that people will ask, 'do these words reflect your views?'\"\n\nEach race will be closely watched on Tuesday, both as a sign of which approach to Trump fared better and whether Democrats, aiming to make inroads in areas that were wooed by Trump, will be able to crack the red wall the President created.\n\nRepublicans have been sounding alarm bells in each race: If Democrats are able to win either or both races, they said, it's almost a certainty that Democrats will control the House next year.\n\n\"If she loses this race,\" said Jim Brock, a Tenney friend and Republican operative, \"you can just say goodbye to Republicans controlling Congress.\"\n\nRepublicans say 'import,' Democrats say inspiration\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump admits Republicans can lose the House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump admits Republicans can lose the House 01:02\n\nDelgado, standing before an almost entirely white crowd at St. James' Episcopal Church in Hyde Park on Friday, addressed something that has been ubiquitous on television: His rap career.\n\n\"I know you have heard of one of my careers,\" he said, \"because you can't get away from it.\"\n\nIt got a laugh from a friendly crowd and the Democrat moved onto his platform, namely health care, where he wants to move towards Medicare for all, and campaign finance reform, where he rejects corporate PAC money. No one at the event asked him about the ads.\n\nDown the road, though, was a distinctly different speech to an almost entirely white audience.\n\n\"We sure don't need a new import,\" Faso told the Republican audience at an event featuring Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, \"to represent us in Washington, DC.\"\n\nThe divide makes something clear about the race to represent this district: Republicans are seeking to, in the words of Democrats, \"otherize\" Delgado, a candidate who was born and raised nearby in Schenectady, moved away to pursue a career but then moved back with his wife and kids to run for Congress.\n\nDelgado dismisses the attacks as not reflective of the people in the district.\n\n\"They (Republicans) have a low opinion of people in the district that they are assuming the people in this district could be swayed by hateful divisive approaches to campaigning,\" he said in an interview. \"It would be good if he (Faso) would denounce them. It would have sent the right signal. To me, it would have meant to be a leader.\"\n\nBut the ads have forced Democrats and Republicans alike to question why top GOP operatives believe attacks like those would work in their pastoral towns and hamlets.\n\nSitting in the church on Friday, it didn't take Katherine Baldwin long to answer that question.\n\n\"I mean, just look around,\" she said, noting the nearly all white audience. \"In our country and around the world, people are scared of what is other and different to them. There is not a lot of diversity in this district and as a white woman, I see that. I see that here, I see that at any event I have gone to.\"\n\nDemocratic operatives believe the ads have backfired. The attacks have enraged Democrats and boosted Delgado's fundraising -- allowing him to raise an astonishing $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2018 alone. And polls show the race deadlocked. But Republicans have stuck with the strategy for months, hoping it will make people question Delgado's roots.\n\nAt Faso's event, however, it wasn't clear that even strong Republican voters were that motivated by the ads. Some were even uncomfortable with them, they said.\n\nLou Barbaria, a 70-year-old retired law enforcement officer from Cairo, said he was voting for Faso because he believed Delgado \"would go against a lot of things I want.\" It has nothing to do, he said, with rap.\n\n\"Whatever, I was in a band when I was young,\" Barbaria said with a laugh. \"I mean, I wasn't in a rap band, but I did street corner doo-wop stuff. But I am sure there are things that I said on stage that might have offended.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed with Barbaria. Tom Andreassen, a 71-year-old Vietnam veteran from Leeds, said he didn't like \"what Delgado has done with his rap music.\"\n\n\"A leopard may change its colors,\" Andreassen said when asked if he thinks Delgado has changed, \"but it's not going change its spots.\"\n\nBut Andreassen's view was unique. More often, voters dismissed the rap attacks and instead knocked Delgado's views on health care or taxes.\n\nGail Kargle, a 74-year old from Cairo, made this clear: \"I like Delgado. I like his presentation. But I don't like what he stands for. But I have no problem with his rap. I have no problem with any of that.\"\n\nWhen asked if she likes rap at all, Kargle said no, but then took a long pause.\n\n\"I guess I do like Pitbull,\" she said with surprise. \"I'm 74 years old and I like him!\"\n\nThe see-saw in upstate New York\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump targets red-state Democrats Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump targets red-state Democrats 02:17\n\nVoters around Binghamton and Utica, the two population centers in Tenney's congressional district, could be forgiven for having a bit of whiplash.\n\nOver the last decade, voters have bounced from one party to the next in presidential and congressional elections, regularly see-sawing between parties. In 2008, the area backed Barack Obama. Four years later, Republican Mitt Romney won the district by one percentage point. But the real eye-opener happened in 2016, when Donald Trump shellacked Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points.\n\nFor Brindisi, the moderate state assembly member with deep ties in Utica, Trump's success in the area does not conflict with his candidacy as a Democrat. Instead of focusing on the President, Brindisi has run on hyper-local issues, including airing ads against the local cable company, and tries to avoid knocking the President.\n\n\"Most people in this district are fed up with Washington,\" the Democrat said. \"They are looking for someone who is going to represent the interests of the people back home.\"\n\nThat statement is true for many congressional districts. But Brindisi is happy to take that one step further, by citing Trump's 2016 attacks against Clinton to ding Tenney.\n\n\"I think many of the things he campaigned for when he was running in 2016, when he was running against Hillary Clinton, I could say the same things about Claudia Tenney,\" Brindisi said in his Binghamton campaign office. \"Trump would always say during the 2016 election there was a reason why the Wall Street banks and the hedge fund managers and the big financial institutions are supporting my opponent because they know the system will continue to be rigged in their favor if she is elected. I could say the same thing about Claudia Tenney.\"\n\nThat may be where Tenney's similarities with Clinton end, because her rhetoric is pure Trump.\n\nEarlier this year, she suggested that Democrats are more prone to carrying out mass shootings, she has questioned farmers who are worried about the trade war, and when a story was published about Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson buying a $31,000 dining room set for his office , Tenney blamed the \"deep state.\"\n\nBrock, a close friend who grew up with Tenney, said he believes it \"doesn't hurt\" the congresswoman to be rhetorically in line with Trump.\n\nBut what could hurt, voters said, was being viewed as not being the \"change candidate\" in a district that has clearly preferred exactly that.\n\n\"It is because he's never ran (for Congress) before, because he is new,\" Bridget Kane, a Democratic candidate for a local race around Binghamton, said to describe Brindisi's appeal.\n\n\"They were desperate for change\" in 2016, she added, and they are just as desperate now.\n\nPolls have shown Brindisi and Tenney, who declined repeated requests for an interview for this story, in a nearly deadlocked race, a fact that has beget considerable outside spending in the contest.\n\nAccording to a study by the Wesleyan Media Project, more than 12,000 commercials aired in the district between mid-September and mid-October -- the most of any district in the country at the time.\n\nIn order to win, Brindisi is clear-eyed about the fact he needs to win over Republican voters, and Tenney has been helpful on that front by turning off local Republicans like Yusuf Harper, a retired physician who runs an organic farm in Norwich, New York.\n\nBrindisi is the first Democrat Harder has ever volunteered for, he said, and, although there are issues that worry him about the left-leaning party, he can't bring himself to back Tenney.\n\n\"Yes, he is a Democrat and there is some risk there,\" he said. \"But the alternative is just not good.\"", "(CNN) The death toll in Italy has risen to 17 after a week of severe weather and flooding across the country, according to Italy's Civil Protection Agency.\n\nThe onslaught of strong wind and heavy rain over the past week devastated parts of Italy and led to the worst flooding Venice has seen in at least a decade.\n\nIn the northern region of Veneto, damage estimates have reached over one billion euros, and several villages have been cut off as a result of landslides.\n\nThe severe weather also wrought havoc on the environment, with dozens of hectares of forestry -- including the famous 'Violin Forest' -- decimated after winds reached up to 190 kilometers per hour (118 mph).\n\nRoberto Ciambetti, president of the Veneto Regional Council, told CNN that around 300,000 trees were flattened after winds swept through the Val d'Assa in the Asiago plateau.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) A white supremacist group that targeted Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum with racist robocalls is now targeting Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\n\nThe prerecorded phone message features a voice impersonating Oprah Winfrey, who was in Georgia on Thursday stumping for Abrams, and contains racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric.\n\nThe robocall went out to Georgia voters, but it is unclear how many received it.\n\nAbrams' Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, strongly denounced the automated call, calling it \"absolutely disgusting\" in a statement Friday.\n\n\"I stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry,\" Kemp said in a statement. \"These vile efforts to degrade and disparage others are contrary to the highest ideals of our state and country.

That's less than 4% of the total US population\n\n105,736\n\nThe number of immigrants ICE arrested in fiscal year 2017 who were convicted criminals. ICE says it's committed to targeting \"criminal aliens\" for arrest and removal. Advocates accuse ICE of inflating statistics about criminals by including minor charges such as traffic offenses in its tally.\n\n83,573\n\nThe number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not US citizens, according to the latest prison population report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics . That's less than 6% of the total prison population. The report says that the total number of inmates who are not US citizens could, in fact, be higher, noting that some states may have undercounted this figure and others did not provide information. A past report from the bureau cautioned that different jurisdictions use different definitions for \"noncitizens,\" at times basing the statistic on where people were born regardless of their citizenship status.\n\n21%\n\nAdministration officials have noted that roughly one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and that the vast majority of those people are in the United States illegally. They argue such statistics show the dangers illegal immigration poses to society. \"The illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero,\" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement earlier this year. \"Every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented.\"\n\nAdvocates have slammed statistics released by the administration. \"The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with -- illegal entry and illegal entry after removal,\" Tom Jawetz, the vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, told The New York Times last year . \"When you cook the books you shouldn't pretend to be surprised by the results.\"\n\n719\n\nThe criminal conviction rate per 100,000 immigrants in Texas. This number comes from a study by the Cato Institute , which uses figures from Texas in 2015 as a case study to look at how crime rates compare among immigrant and native-born populations.\n\n\"The criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans,\" Cato's Alex Nowrasteh wrote.\n\nAccording to the libertarian think tank's analysis, the rate per 100,000 residents in each subpopulation was 899 for undocumented immigrants, 611 for legal immigrants and 1,797 for native-born Americans.\n\n142%\n\nThis is how much more likely undocumented immigrants are to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans, according to a study of data in that state by economist John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center.\n\nThis study has been pointed to by the Justice Department and by a number of politicians and organizations who favor restricting immigration. It's also drawn sharp criticism from the Cato Institute and other researchers, who argue that the study misinterpreted data. Lott has stood by his research.\n\nAn analysis of the study and critiques by The Washington Post's Fact Checker was inconclusive.\n\n25\n\nThe number of years of crime and immigration data researchers looked at in a recent study published in the journal Criminology . \"Increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence,\" authors Michael Light and Ty Miller wrote. An analysis of data from 1990-2014, they said, suggests \"undocumented immigration over this period is generally associated with decreasing violent crime.\"\n\nThe authors noted that more research needs to be done, and that it's possible the data could be interpreted differently.\n\n\"Because we are using official crime statistics,\" they wrote, \"there is a plausible alternative interpretation: Increased unauthorized immigration results in fewer crimes reported to the police.\"\n\nIn a release from the University of Wisconsin-Madison announcing the study's findings, Light, a sociology professor, said it's important to look at data as the immigration debate continues.\n\n\"I think public debate divorced entirely from data is problematic,\" he said. \"There are reasons to think undocumented immigrants would increase crime, but the data doesn't support those arguments. It's telling us that has not been the case.\"", "(CNN) The US Navy has had 18 unsafe or unprofessional encounters with Chinese military forces in the Pacific since 2016, according to US military statistics obtained by CNN.\n\n\"We have found records of 19 unsafe and/or unprofessional interactions with China and Russia since 2016 (18 with China and one with Russia),\" Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the US Pacific Fleet, told CNN.\n\nA US official familiar with the statistics told CNN that 2017, the first year of the Trump administration, saw the most unsafe and or unprofessional encounters with Chinese forces during the period.\n\nAt least three of those incidents took place in February, May and July of that year and involved Chinese fighter jets making what the US considered to be \"unsafe\" intercepts of Navy surveillance planes.\n\nWhile the 18 recorded incidents only involved US naval forces, the Air Force has also had at least one such encounter during this period.\n\n\"Our continued presence in the region highlights our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific and demonstrates that the US Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,\" Christensen added.\n\nThe US Navy told CNN that, in comparison, there were 50 unsafe or unprofessional encounters with Iranian military forces since 2016, with 36 that year, 14 last year and none in 2018. US and Iranian naval forces tend to operate in relatively narrow stretches of water, such as the Strait of Hormuz, increasing their frequency of close contact.\n\nThe Navy averages hundreds of air and sea operations annually in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, and officials say they take such unsafe interactions seriously.\n\n\"Make no mistake, the safety of our forces is paramount, and any time there is an unsafe and/or unprofessional incident, we are concerned,\" a US Navy official told CNN. \"To address these incidents, the US responds through appropriate diplomatic and military channels.\"\n\nThe relative frequency of such interactions raises the possibility of a collision or clash that could spark a crisis or even a conflict between the two major powers.\n\nIn 2001, a collision between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese jet fighter led to a major diplomatic crisis between Washington and Beijing.\n\nThe most recent encounter with China took place last month while the Navy destroyer USS Decatur was sailing within 12 miles of two of the Spratly Islands as part of what the US calls a \"freedom of navigation operation.\"\n\nDuring that operation, a Chinese destroyer came within 45 yards of the US warship, forcing it to maneuver to avoid a collision. The US labeled the Chinese warship's actions unsafe and unprofessional, while Beijing said the US was threatening the safety and sovereignty of China.\n\nTensions over militarization of islands\n\nSecretary of Defense James Mattis is expected to meet Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Wei Fenghe, in Washington. Mattis has sought to cooperate with Beijing were possible while also pushing back on what the US sees as China's militarization of the South China Sea.\n\n\"We will cooperate where we can,\" Mattis said Monday at an event at the US Institute for Peace, while adding the US \"will confront them where we must, for example, freedom of navigation in international waters and that sort of thing.\"\n\nThe US has ramped up its criticism of China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea, emphasizing that the US military will continue to operate in that area to contest what the US views as Beijing's excessive claims.\n\n\"What we don't want to do is reward aggressive behavior like you saw with the Decatur incident by modifying our behavior,\" Joe Felter, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, told reporters last month while Mattis was traveling in the region.\n\n\"That's just not going happen,\" he added. \"We're going to continue to exercise our rights under international law and encourage all our partners to do the same.\"\n\nMattis said at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Singapore last month following a meeting with Wei: \"China's militarization of the South China Sea and aggressive action in international waters destabilizes the region and threatens shared efforts to promote security.\"\n\nThe US regularly sails vessels and flies aircraft in the South China Sea , but Beijing is particularly sensitive about the operations when they come near areas where the Chinese government has built islands and established military facilities on disputed maritime features.\n\nChinese warships will often shadow US vessels operating in the area, as they did last month while two US Navy ships were transiting the Taiwan Strait.\n\nThe Chinese military also kept a close eye on a recent joint US-Japan military exercise involving over 50,000 US and Japanese personnel,\n\nUS-China tensions have risen in recent weeks, with President Donald Trump accusing China of interfering in November's midterm elections and the countries embroiled in a high-profile trade dispute.\n\nBut on Friday Trump told reporters he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the two leaders wanted to work towards a trade deal and also discussed North Korea.\n\nThe Trump administration also recently sanctioned Beijing over its purchase of Russian weapons systems.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nPadres y alumnos se quejaron y dijeron que era \"racista\"\n\nLa idea fue criticada y el superintendente abri\u00f3 una investigaci\u00f3n al respecto\n\nMaestras de EE.UU. se disfrazaron de muro fronterizo con M\u00e9xico\n\n(CNN) - Incorporar el muro fronterizo de Donald Trump en un disfraz de Halloween es, en el mejor de los casos, cuestionable, especialmente si eres un maestro de escuela primaria.\n\nEso es exactamente lo que un grupo de miembros del personal descubri\u00f3 en una escuela primaria en Middleton, Idaho.\n\nMIRA: Acusan al Bayern de M\u00fanich de racismo por una foto de una fiesta de Halloween\n\nLas fotos, que se publicaron en la p\u00e1gina de Facebook del Distrito Escolar Middleton pero que luego se eliminaron, mostraron al grupo disfrazado de un muro con la frase \"Haz que Estados Unidos vuelva a ser grande\".

Berkshire Hathaway repurchased nearly $1 billion of its own stock in the third quarter after the company changed a rule that had restricted stock buybacks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway ( BRKB ), Warren Buffett's industrial and insurance conglomerate, said its net income jumped to $18.5 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Most of the gains came from its massive investment portfolio, though the value of its holdings are down slightly.\n\nThe company also saw a huge increase of cash on its balance sheet. Available cash soared to $36.5 billion at the end of September from $25.5 billion at the start of the year.\n\nBerkshire also reported a rare stock buyback of $928 million after the board in July removed strict limits that essentially prohibited share repurchases. The last time Berkshire bought its own stock was in December 2012.\n\nStock buybacks have been one factor helping fuel the market run to record highs in 2018. They also lower a company's overall share count, which in turn boosts earnings per share.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

they'll hail more from the parties' bases than in a presidential cycle -- means that the Trump factor will be on their minds at the polls.\n\n\"Both of these sides have been waiting for this moment since January 2017,\" professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University (and CNN contributor) Julian Zelizer told me about this year's midterm voters. \"These are people who have been encouraged or most aggravated by what's happening in the news.\"\n\nBecause of that, for campaigns this year ( and increasingly over the last few cycles ) it's less about how to win voters over, but how to get the ones you want to the polls. Case in point: Trump's hard pivot to the immigration issue in the last week of the election in an attempt to rile up Republican voters.\n\nCheck out the latest analysis from The Point with Chris Cillizza :\n\n\"It's clear he's trying to activate his base,\" UNI political science professor Chris Larimer told me this week.\n\nBut will that strategy activate his base, or encourage those who dislike him?\n\nAt least nationally, we have a picture of just how polarized voters are on Trump, thanks to polling from CNN and SSRS earlier this month. Among Democrats, 92% disapprove of Trump -- while 87% of Republicans approve of the President.\n\nIn key states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia on Election Day, the difference will ultimately come down to which side is bigger -- and who makes it to the polls.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

the upcoming midterm election.", "(CNN) Hundreds of mourners gathered Saturday for the funeral of seven people killed when unknown gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians in Egypt's Minya governorate, Egyptian state-run media outlet Ahram Online reported.\n\nSix of the victims were from the same family, according to Ahram. A dozen people also were injured in the attack, it said.\n\nThe group was heading to the Monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor, south of Cairo in Egypt's western desert, when Friday's attack occurred.\n\nIt's the latest in a number of deadly assaults against minority Christians in the Middle East's most populous country in recent years.\n\nLast year, at least 29 people were killed after unidentified gunmen opened fire on a bus carrying Coptic Christians to the same monastery, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northwest of the city of Minya. ISIS claimed responsibility for the massacre.\n\nRead More", "The famous infomercial product, My Pillow, has given it's endorsement to President Donald Trump. CEO Mike Lindell spoke at a Trump rally in his home state, Minnesota.", "Back in Montana on Saturday afternoon, he slammed Democratic Sen. Jon Tester over his role in sinking former White House physician Ronny Jackson's nomination to become the secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nTrump lamented the downfall of \"Doc Ronny,\" who withdrew from consideration back in April amid charges of improper conduct on the job. There is an ongoing Pentagon inspector general probe into the allegations.\n\n\"He might be a nice guy,\" Trump said of Tester, \"except he tried to destroy Adm. Ronny Jackson, who is the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you ever met. He tried to destroy him. And I've never forgotten it. And it's honestly one of the reasons I've been here so much.\"\n\nThe President's case for Matt Rosendale, Tester's Republican challenger, was less specific.\n\n\"I'm the only one that tells you the facts,\" Trump said, after telling falsehoods about GOP efforts to take apart Obamacare and, with it, protection for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He also scorned Democrats and touted his \"movement\" as a stop on the their agenda, \"pushing it way back to where it came from \u2014 it came from Hell.\"\n\nLike he has during the closing weeks of the campaign, Trump also sought to use the divisions exposed and escalated by the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to motivate Republican rallygoers in Belgrade, baselessly suggesting all of Kavanaugh's accusers were changing their stories. They are not.\n\nThe Democrats make their case\n\nBack east in Massachusetts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is expected to cruise to re-election next week, echoed former President Barack Obama's criticism of Trump's chatter about ending birthright citizenship with the swipe of a pen.\n\n\"He can't do that, he just can't,\" Warren told reporters. \"The President does not have the power to erase parts of the Constitution he does not like.\"\n\nAs the run-up to Election Day gains speed, the days have begun to blend into one. For Democrats in particular, Saturday's dramas began on Friday evening.\n\nThose who couldn't watch it live awoke to stories and viral clips of Obama lambasting his successor twice in a six-hour span at rallies for Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Florida, where he is running for governor, and Stacey Abrams, the former state House minority leader doing the same in Georgia.\n\nAt Morehouse College in Atlanta, Obama answered Trump's jab from earlier in the week, when the Republican President said Abrams -- owner of an estimable political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 -- was \"not qualified\" for the job that she and Georgia's GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp are at about even odds to win next week.\n\n\"Republicans -- they keep trying to diminish Stacey's remarkable accomplishments,\" Obama said, without mentioning Trump by name. \"She is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race. She's got an incredible track record of fighting for working families.\"\n\nBut on Friday night and Saturday morning, her campaign was forced to contend with a racist and anti-Semitic robocall targeting Abrams and Oprah Winfrey. The calls, which came from the same neo-Nazi group that previously attacked Gillum in Florida, were denounced by Kemp as \"absolutely disgusting.\"\n\n\"I stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry,\" Kemp said in a statement.\n\nAbrams' campaign wasn't impressed, and in a statement Saturday morning suggested Kemp's harsh words were undermined by his behavior on the trail and his scheduled embrace of Trump at a rally on Sunday.\n\n\"It is pathetic that after months of running racist, sexist attacks against Stacey Abrams, Brian Kemp has only now suddenly decided to find a conscience as polls are tightening and Georgia voters are making it clear that they reject the kind of hate he and his allies have been spewing around the state,\" spokeswoman Abigail Collazo said. \"These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking.\"\n\nBefore Trump touches down in Georgia, he is due on Saturday night in Florida \u2014 his second trip there over four days \u2014 for a rally in Pensacola, another traditionally Republican stronghold up in the state's Panhandle, and the next day in Tennessee to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nTrump gave a howling hint of what to expect over the campaign's furious final few days during a Friday stop in Indiana.\n\nReciting faithfully from what has become his midterm songbook, he touted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and issued yet another ominous -- and almost entirely fact-free -- warning about a group of migrants, hundreds of miles and weeks away in Mexico, headed for the US border in search of asylum.\n\n\"Between Justice Kavanaugh and the caravan, you people are energized,\" Trump enthused, a message he re-upped at length in Montana.\n\nTrump vs. Obama\n\nHe also took on Obama, who had hours before assailed him for, among other things, \"constant fear-mongering\" and chronic dissembling and telling outright falsehoods about the GOP's efforts, past and present, to dismantle the Affordable Care Act's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nIn Miami, Obama called it \"gall\" and \"chutzpah\"; in Atlanta, he labeled it \"some kind of gumption\" and \"some kind of nerve.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump responded to Obama's barrage by mocking the former president over what he described as a \"very small crowd\" in Miami. Later on, though, at a rally for Senate candidate Mike Braun in Indiana, the President struck a nastier note.\n\n\"It's no surprise that (Democratic Sen.) Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\" he said, placing an emphasis on the \"H,\" which stands for Hussein. The implication was clear enough and right in line with the tone of Trump's efforts to rev up conservatives.\n\nTrump's Saturday travel fit a familiar profile, with both rallies scheduled to support GOP candidates who are narrowly trailing in most recent polling and will need the base to turn out in force next week.\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis, who was boosted in his bid for the nomination by the President's endorsement, is hoping for another lift with his campaign running consistently off Gillum's pace. The Democrat took a brief break from the trail early Saturday morning in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, where he is the mayor.\n\nReturning to the trail, Gillum, an outspoken proponent of stricter gun control laws, said the killings in his city only upped the stakes of the coming election, while urging voters to \"reject the politics of Trumpism.\"\n\nEven as the campaign back-and-forth dominates the headlines, the beginning of the weekend also belonged to the grassroots liberal groups that have quietly been gearing up for a massive, final get-out-the-vote push.\n\nOne coalition initiative, aptly named The Last Weekend, will be put to the test now after months of organizing and promotion. Swing Left, which is leading the effort, and has raised more than $9 million for candidates in 84 swing districts this cycle, says its volunteers called and knocked on the doors of nearly 500,000 voters just last week.\n\nThey expect that number to skyrocket as Election Day nears.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Here's everything galactic you missed during Halloween and early voting.\n\nNASA happenings\n\nTwo historic NASA missions ran out of fuel this week: the 11-year Dawn mission to explore the two biggest objects in the asteroid belt and the nine-year Kepler Space Telescope mission that discovered thousands of exoplanets.\n\nAlthough both mission conclusions were expected, it's sad to see them come to an end. Luckily, the data they provided will lead to discoveries for years to come. And neither is on a collision course with Earth. Dawn will orbit the dwarf planet Ceres for decades, and Kepler is 94 million miles away.\n\nFarewell, brave voyagers, and thanks for all the science.\n\nBut let's give the Parker Solar Probe a hearty cheer for breaking a record and coming closer to the sun than any other spacecraft.\n\nHubble's awake; Opportunity isn't\n\nDespite our letter to the Mars Opportunity rover, it still hasn't awakened and responded to NASA's many messages since it became shrouded in a planet-encircling dust storm that began in May.\n\nNASA will continue to send more messages, and scientists hope that increasing winds will knock the dust off of Oppy's solar panels.\n\nMeanwhile, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope is back in business and making observations again.\n\nA gyro, or device that measures the speed at which the spacecraft is turning, had failed. This meant Hubble couldn't turn and lock on to new targets. A backup gyro turned out to be no help when it malfunctioned as well.\n\nThe backup was recovered, so expect more gorgeous images from the famed space telescope.\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which also had a gyro issue recently, is also back up and running\n\nShadows in space\n\nSpeaking of Hubble, the space telescope captured an image called a bat shadow 1,300 light-years away in the stellar nursery known as the Serpens Nebula.\n\nHubble is capturing the shadow of the ring created byHBC 672's bright light.\n\nSo what is it? A sun-like star, HBC 672, is surrounded by a big dusty debris ring. But Hubble can't see that ring. Instead, it's capturing the shadow of the ring created by the star's bright light. NASA scientists compared the large shadow to what happens when something small crosses in front of a flashlight beam.\n\n\"This is an analog of what the solar system looked like when it was only 1 or 2 million years old,\" explained Klaus Pontoppidan, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute. \"For all we know, the solar system once created a shadow like this.\"\n\nDon't get too close\n\nIf you were in space, the last thing you'd want to get too close to is a black hole, the terrifyingly destructive and insatiable garbage disposals of the universe. Once you're near one, you're really past the point of no return.\n\nMany astronomers assume that a supermassive black hole is at the center of the Milky Way, our galaxy. That's because they tend to lurk at the center of other galaxies, too.\n\nBut for the first time, material has been seen circling the drain, so to speak. The European Southern Observatory's GRAVITY instrument observed bright radiation flares around the disc belonging to Sagittarius A, this massive object at the galactic center.\n\nNew observations show clumps of gas swirling around about 30% of the speed of light on a circular orbit just outside a four million solar mass black hole.\n\n\"It's mind-boggling to actually witness material orbiting a massive black hole at 30% of the speed of light,\" said Oliver Pfuhl, a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics.\n\nIt makes for a trippy image, too.\n\nA Milky Way of stars\n\nHave you ever wondered why there are so many stars in our galaxy? It turns out that the Milky Way's halo was gifted -- well, kind of.\n\nGalaxies aren't exactly friendly neighbors in the universe. Instead, they tend to merge or cannibalize one another. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies, and astronomers are trying to figure out whether it grew after many small mergers or just a few large ones. Sometimes, the evidence of these mergers can be found using \"galactic fossils\" or just following an unusual stream of stars.\n\nNew data from the Gaia satellite mission, published this week, revealed that 10 billion years ago, the Milky Way merged with another large galaxy, Gaia-Enceladus. The stars from that galaxy make up most of the Milky Way's halo and helped shape its thick disk.\n\nThe stars donated by the merger stand out from the \"native stars\" of our galaxy because they're younger, the researchers said.\n\nAnd in about 4 billion years, the Milky Way will collide with the neighboring gigantic Andromeda galaxy. So there's that to look forward to.\n\nHey, Bennu!\n\nAfter two years of trekking through space for a date with an asteroid, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is sending images of the primitive asteroid Bennu.\n\nThe spacecraft and asteroid will have their official rendezvous in December. And then we'll have some photos with color filters on them. Can't wait to see the Instagram of that date.", "(CNN) Saudi Arabia is pushing back on reports that shortly before two Saudi sisters were found dead in New York it had ordered anyone related to them to return to the kingdom because they had sought political asylum.\n\nRotana Farea, 23, and Tala Farea, 16, were found dead October 24 along the banks of the Hudson River after their family last saw them nearly a year ago in Virginia. They had been in the United States for two to three years, police said.\n\nSaudi officials are looking into whether the sisters applied for asylum in the United States, a Saudi official told CNN.\n\nEarlier this week, The New York Times reported the Saudi Embassy in Washington had called the mother of the two sisters to inform her that her daughters had applied for asylum.\n\nBut Saudi Embassy spokeswoman Fatimah S. Baeshen disputed \"reports that we ordered anyone related to the Saudi sisters, Tala and Rotana Farea, God rest their souls, (who recently died tragically in NY), to leave the US for seeking asylum.\"\n\nCalling the claim \"absolutely false,\" Baeshen said in a Twitter post Friday, \"details are still under investigation and will be shared in due course.\"\n\nReports that we ordered anyone related to the Saudi sisters, Tala and Rotana Farea, God rest their souls, (who recently died tragically in NY), to leave the US for seeking asylum; are absolutely false. Details are still under investigation and will be shared in due course. \u2014 Fatimah S Baeshen (@FatimahSBaeshen) November 2, 2018\n\nThe sisters were Saudi citizens, and their nation's royal consulate general has been in contact with their family and has appointed a lawyer for the investigation.\n\nThe sisters had said they would rather kill themselves than return to Saudi Arabia, New York police said its detectives had learned. But so far, investigators have uncovered no evidence that the sisters were victims of foul play.\n\n\"At this point in time we have no credible information that a crime took place in New York City,\" Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said Friday, \"but it is still under investigation.\"\n\nShea said earlier this week that detectives have been in Virginia conducting interviews with members of the immediate family to shed light on \"what was going on in the two young ladies' lives.\"\n\n\"We've made significant progress in piecing together pieces of this puzzle to find out what happened,\" he said.\n\nThe sisters were last seen by their family in Virginia on November 30, 2017, Shea said.\n\nBefore their disappearance, the sisters were living in some kind of \"shelter-like\" facility due to abuse allegations that came up. Shea did not elaborate or give further details on those reports, which he said had not been corroborated.\n\nAccording to Shea, investigators believe the sisters left Fairfax, Virginia, on either August 23 or 24 and took different methods of transportation, including Uber, to New York, where they arrived on or about September 1.\n\nUntil their bodies were discovered, the sisters stayed at high-end hotels, went shopping and ordered food on a credit card until police believe \"the money started to run out,\" Shea said. The credit card was maxed out.\n\nIn video police have seen, the sisters were in \"apparently good health\" as recently as a week before their bodies were found on the riverbank, duct-taped together in a way that appeared to be \"keeping them together,\" Shea said, but was not meant to bind them.\n\nInvestigators have also spoken to an eyewitness who came forward Wednesday and told police he saw two girls sitting in a playground park adjacent to the Hudson the day the bodies were found.\n\nThe witness was out exercising at about 7 a.m. when he saw two girls sitting about 30 feet apart with their heads in their hands, praying.\n\nShea described the witness as a \"credible source\" who told police the encounter had been \"haunting him.\"\n\nShea also confirmed investigators believe the girls were alive when they entered the water. The location where the witness saw two girls was \"a very short distance from the Hudson River,\" and such that they could have walked right in.\n\nInvestigators suspect suicide, official says\n\nFairfax County police previously said the sisters were reported missing for one day in December.\n\nOfficer Tara Gerhard, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax department, said the sisters were \"referred to services,\" but she could not specify what type of services, or offer additional details, citing privacy laws.\n\nA law enforcement official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity previously said investigators have not found anything to indicate the sisters were victims of foul play.\n\nShea echoed that belief in Friday's news conference, saying, \"It is entirely credible that the girls entered the water alive.\"\n\nPolice previously said their bodies showed no signs of trauma. Shea dismissed reports they jumped from the George Washington Bridge because there were no body marks that would indicate a fall from that height.\n\nThe New York Police Department is not ready to determine the official causes of death. Authorities are investigating whether the deaths were the result of suicide, homicide or an accident, said Phil Walzak, deputy commissioner for public information for the New York police.",

But with days to go before the midterm elections, don't blame their pillows.\n\nLindell, the mustachioed \"MyPillow\" inventor and infomercial star, is doing his part ahead of next Tuesday, hitting the road in support of conservative candidates and popping up at many a Trump rally across the country. Lindell, one of just a few \"celebrity\" endorsers, gave Trump his seal of approval early and remains a key supporter.\n\nThough Lindell might not be a household name, his MyPillow certainly is, and he's a recognizable guy, his high-energy infomercials having been on television more than 7 million times.\n\nLindell, an evangelical Christian and former crack cocaine addict who has been sober 10 years this January, has forged an unlikely path to the political arena, one that literally came about as the result of two dreams.\n\nThe first, in 2004, when Lindell dreamed of inventing the perfect pillow. He developed and patented his foam pillow, pitching it from a mall kiosk to fairs, home shows and expos, and, ultimately, on unscripted, nationally televised infomercials. After his first infomercial aired in 2011, Lindell's Minnesota-based company grew from 5 employees to 500 in 40 days.\n\nThe second dream, in 2015, came shortly before Trump declared his candidacy.\n\n\"I actually had a dream that I would meet Donald Trump in an office, and then all of a sudden he ran for president,\" Lindell recalled in an interview with CNN this week. \"I didn't know why and then he came down that (escalator), he's running for president.\"\n\nA year later, he had a private meeting with the then-Republican nominee in his Trump Tower office. The two talked about Made in America -- his pillows are made in the USA -- and inner city initiatives.\n\n'I just believed in Donald Trump'\n\nThat meeting sealed the deal.\n\n\"I just believed in Donald Trump so much after that meeting with him ... He has a heart that cares. And maybe people don't see that out there when he's on TV and stuff, because he's such a fighter and wants to win and wants to help this country so bad and help people,\" Lindell said.\n\nLindell endorsed Trump, appearing in the \"spin room\" at two general election debates and speaking at a Minnesota rally days before the election. He's been an invited guest to multiple White House events since Trump took office and spent time with Trump at Mar-a-Lago during Easter weekend when he was a guest of another club member.\n\nFor Trump, a MyPillow owner, the feeling is mutual.\n\n\"They went out and bought their own pillows,\" Lindell said, adding that Trump told him he recently \"went out and bought some more pillows.\"\n\nTrump has said he and the first lady both sleep on MyPillows.\n\n\"You ever see this guy with the pillows on Fox? MyPillow guy, Mike Lindell, where is Mike? He is the greatest,\" Trump said at a June North Dakota rally. \"First of all, he does make a great product, great pillows. I actually use them. He's been a supporter from Day 1.\"\n\n\"I had no idea he was going to do that, I didn't even know he knew I was there,\" Lindell said, laughing.\n\nAn education\n\nLindell admits he was \"very uneducated\" when it came to politics before Trump entered the arena.\n\n\"I had to learn what a liberal was, what a conservative was. I didn't know anything about politics. I'm not kidding. I was an addict, I was a crackhead. I didn't get into politics and I didn't realize how important they were,\" he said.\n\nTwo years later, the entrepreneur has endorsed a slate of candidates, ranging from Minnesota Republican gubernatorial candidate Jeff Johnson to Virginia Republican Senate candidate Corey Stewart.\n\n\"The reason I hope that the Republicans hold the house is so (Trump) gets the backing he needs to finish all the promises that he's made,\" he said.\n\nIn the last two weeks alone, Lindell has criss-crossed the country, attending Trump rallies, visiting the White House for an opioid bill signing, appearing at political fundraisers, speaking to millennials at an evangelism event, attending an event with Lara Trump, whom he considers a friend, and talking pillows on QVC. On Friday, Lindell traveled to the Florida Panhandle to hand out 10,000 pillows to hurricane victims.\n\nHe's been to a cadre of Trump rallies: Rochester, Minnesota; Fargo, North Dakota; Houston, Texas, and Thursday in Columbia, Missouri. He pays for his own transportation and lodging. He spoke on stage before the President in Rochester, but mostly, he just roams around with his VIP badge, talking to supporters.\n\nIn the lead-up to Trump rallies, loud music blaring and an atmosphere much like a rock concert, Lindell holds court. Attendees form a line, clamoring to get a photo with the \"MyPillow Guy.\"\n\nHere in Columbia, a volunteer held the crowd back as he greeted red-hatted fans, receiving line-style.\n\nKarin Housley, who is running for Democrat Al Franken's Senate seat in Minnesota, is one candidate benefitting from Lindell's star power.\n\nLast week, Lindell lent his name (\"Mike Lindell -- My Pillow\" in the \"from\" line) to a fundraising email on Housley's behalf: \"Friend -- you may know me from inventing MyPillow, but that's not why I am emailing you today. I want to tell you about Karin Housley and why her United States Senate race is critical to Minnesota and the rest of our country.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Housley praised Lindell for using his platform to \"stand up for the issues that are important to him and many Minnesotans.\"\n\n\"He has spoken on Karin's behalf a number of times and we really appreciate all he's doing to help out our campaign,\" Housley spokesman Jake Schneider told CNN.\n\nSo why should voters listen to the \"MyPillow guy\" when they head to the polls on Tuesday?\n\n\"Because they trust me. I do my due diligence,\" he said. \"When I put my credibility behind someone, or anything -- even if it's a product,\" he said. \"To me, it has to help people. I would ruin my credibility if I put my stamp of approval of anything I didn't do my due diligence on.\"\n\nThe \"MyPillow guy\"\n\nWhile some companies have faced backlash for supporting Trump, Lindell says the pillow business hasn't been affected by his politics -- in fact, it's growing.\n\n\"It's been very good for business, but I just do what I'm supposed to do, what God's called me to do. And I really -- I'm not going to back down,\" he said.\n\nWhen many advertisers pulled their ads from Fox News' Ingraham Angle after a tweet host Laura Ingraham posted mocking Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg, Lindell stood by her.\n\n\"You wanna boycott me, that's fine, but I'm not changing my advertising. I'm going to do what I'm gonna do, and I believe in (Trump),\" he said. \"I've stuck by my beliefs, I'm not going to change. And every day, my business -- they say, 'What's your busiest day?' and I say, 'It's the day we're sitting in.' I'm not kidding. We just keep getting busier and busier.\"\n\nBeing known as the \"MyPillow Guy\" doesn't bother him \"at all,\" Lindell said, noting that about half of the people he meets know his actual name. (Although when I asked one lady, who was showing off her selfie, what she thought of Mike Lindell, she asked, \"Who?\")\n\n\"Absolutely, that doesn't bother me, that's my platform,\" he said. But he hopes to use that platform to evangelize and help others struggling with addiction.\n\nLindell is open about his crack cocaine addiction, bringing it up unprompted multiple times. He's currently developing the Lindell Recovery Network, a resource for those seeking faith-based addiction treatment that will roll out early next year.\n\nAfter Election Day, it's Lindell's hope that he can work with politicians he is helping to elect to ease regulations in the addiction treatment arena.\n\n\"I want to get these people help,\" he said.\n\nAs to whether he'd consider entering the political arena himself, Lindell isn't ruling it out.\n\n\"Right now, no, but if God wanted me to do it, if I got it in prayer, I would do it tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Put it this way, nothing would scare me. I've watched what God's done in my life and nothing would surprise me,\" he added, remarking aloud that he is \"an ex-crack addict who's sitting with the President of the United States.\"", "Belgrade, Montana (CNN) Air Force One is landing in places this fall it rarely has before. And it's never flown so often to Big Sky Country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday made his fourth trip to Montana since July, which political historians here believe is more than any other US president. Harry Truman visited three times, but over a four-year span.\n\nTrump is more invested in Montana's Senate contest than almost any other, telling friends that his sweetest vengeance of the election season would be knocking off Tester.\n\nThis race has become Trump vs. Tester -- at least in the President's eyes -- with Republican candidate Matt Rosendale far more of a bystander.\n\n\"How the hell did you elect this guy?\" Trump thundered during a visit to Missoula two weeks ago.\n\nTester sounds far less eager to pick a fight and is trying to keep the race focused on the differences between himself and Rosendale.\n\n\"The President coming is a good thing,\" Tester told CNN. \"I would like to see him get around and not just do rallies, but actually see some of the challenges we have in a rural state like Montana. I mean, he's from New York City, he could learn a lot.\"\n\nAs the battle for control of Congress rolled into a frenetic final weekend, with the President flying from Indiana to Montana to Florida on Saturday alone, he is telling allies he is all but resigned to Republicans losing their grip on the House. He warned supporters on Friday in West Virginia, saying: \"It could happen.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump admits Republicans can lose the House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump admits Republicans can lose the House 01:02\n\nBut it's the fight for the Senate -- and the prospect of picking up this Montana seat -- that's driving Trump in the waning hours of his first midterm election campaign.\n\nWhile a handful of red state Democrats could fall on Tuesday, no other Senate contest has become so single-handedly competitive, because of Trump's own involvement. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana were always facing steep challenges, while Tester was seen as the senator most likely to glide through a difficult Democratic year.\n\nUntil he agitated Trump.\n\nThe President said Saturday he has not forgiven Tester for raising questions that ultimately led to t he embarrassing withdrawal of Dr. Ronny Jackson, Trump's personal physician, as the nominee for secretary of veterans affairs.\n\n\"He might be a nice guy, except he tried to destroy Adm. Ronny Jackson, who is the most clean-cut, wonderful person that you ever met. He tried to destroy him,\" Trump said. \"And I've never forgotten it. And it's honestly one of the reasons I've been here so much.\"\n\nNow, the race is the ultimate test for Trump.\n\nIt will determine if he is the exception to the rule for how a president's popularity often doesn't translate to other candidates in a midterm election. And it will offer a window into whether his loyal supporters will follow his lead against Tester, a third-generation farmer well known to friends and foe alike who has managed to win two Senate terms as a Democrat in a deep-red Republican state.\n\nIn an interview, Tester sought to downplay the Trump influence.\n\n\"This is a tough race. We knew it was going to be a tough race two years ago, regardless of who came out of the Republican primary,\" Tester said after rallying supporters in Livingston. He added, \"But the fact of the matter is this is a race between myself and Matt Rosendale, and the differences are huge.\"\n\nHeading into the final weekend, strategists on both sides told CNN they believe the race is excruciatingly tight. Republicans hope the President's visit Saturday will inject a jolt of electricity into Rosendale's candidacy by awakening any Trump supporters who aren't paying close attention.\n\nWhile Trump has put far more skin in the game than other presidents have in midterm campaigns, crisscrossing the country with one rally after another, he still worries his supporters aren't following the election closely because his name isn't on the ballot.\n\n\"You hear midterms and you go sleep, right?\" Trump lamented to supporters on a recent night in Missouri, acknowledging he had rarely paid attention to midterm races before he jumped into politics three years ago.\n\nEven though Republicans approach Election Day with a narrow advantage in holding on to control of the Senate, their majority is almost certain to remain slim, with every vote critical, particularly if Democrats capture the House and reshape the political order in Washington.\n\nTrump bluntly acknowledges the Montana seat is more personal than firewall.\n\n\"It's not that we need the vote so badly,\" he told supporters late last month in Missoula. \"I can never forget what Jon Tester did.\"\n\nAs the top Democrat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Tester raised pointed and persistent questions about the professional conduct of Jackson. The President ultimately withdrew Jackson's nomination to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, but has made clear that he hasn't moved on.\n\nWhen Trump arrived for his first visit in July, Tester placed an ad in more than a dozen newspapers across the state: \"Welcome to Montana and thank you President Trump for supporting Jon's legislation to help veterans.\"\n\nSince then, the atmosphere has become far more acrimonious.\n\nThe outcome of the Tester-Rosendale race will test whether an appetite still exists among the electorate for a bipartisan check-and-balance on Trump. Two years ago, he defeated Hillary Clinton here by 20 points even as voters re-elected Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat.\n\nFor Tester to win, he needs Trump voters.\n\nDuring visits to Great Falls in July, Billings in September, Missoula in October and just outside Bozeman on Saturday, Trump has repeatedly tried to nationalize the race and turn Tester, the farmer from Big Sandy, into a puppet of Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader.\n\n\"He will never vote for us,\" Trump said Saturday, devoting a significant portion of his speech to blasting Tester as a \"far-left Democrat.\"\n\nFor his part, Tester is doing everything he can to keep the race focused on local issues like access to health care and public lands. One of his closing ads of the campaign features an old meat grinder where he lost three fingers in a childhood accident.\n\n\"I was 9 years old when I lost my fingers in this meat grinder,\" Tester says in the ad. \"My parents paid for the hospital because our health care didn't cover anything.\"\n\nRosendale, a former Maryland developer who moved to Montana in 2002, served three terms in the state Legislature before becoming state auditor. He has clung tightly to Trump, often wearing his signature blue suit and red tie.\n\nThe race could also be influenced by a late development: Libertarian candidate Rick Breckenridge threw his support behind Rosendale this week.\n\nHis name will still be on the ballot, but Breckenridge said he favors Rosendale, which angered some Libertarian activists in the state. Six years ago, the Libertarian candidate captured more than 6% of the vote in a race Tester won by only 4 percentage points.\n\nWhile strategists on both sides believe that the minds of most voters are already made up -- most Montanans, in fact, cast their ballots by mail and about two-thirds of the electorate already has -- Trump believes he can increase Republican turnout with another visit and one final attempt at branding Tester as a Democrat.\n\n\"The Democrats have truly turned into an angry mob,\" Trump said on his last trip here. \"And your senator is one of them.\"\n\nYet it remains an open question whether the President can paint Tester as a run-of-the-mill Democrat or particularly angry. The senator was all smiles on Friday as he fired up audiences, reminding them of his strong tie to the land.\n\n\"What we really need to talk about,\" he said, \"is Montana.\"", "(CNN) Trump has taken his job as chief Republican campaigner seriously in 2018, attending more than 80 campaign events, including scores of fundraiser and rallies.\n\nPlacing the events on map tells the story of his involvement in the midterm.

Lee also noted that the group had put no Asian American students on the stand over the past three weeks to voice their grievances and back up the group's bias claims.\n\nThe final day of the case that both sides believe is headed to the Supreme Court offered more dueling data analyses regarding Asian Americans and competing visions of the use of race for diversity.\n\nUltimately at stake is a 1978 Supreme Court ruling that first allowed universities to consider race as one of many factors in admissions but forbade quotas. The case could change who gets into Harvard and highly competitive universities across the country.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, which filed the case in November 2014, asserts that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian-Americans as it engages in unlawful racial balancing that awards preferences to blacks and Latinos.\n\nHarvard denies the claim, defends the fairness of a process that considers a range of student characteristics, and contends that if it was forced to abide by racially neutral criteria, the number of black and Hispanic students on campus would plummet.\n\nA ruling in this initial district court phase is still months away. US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs said she would hold a post-trial briefing with the parties early in 2019 to address any remaining issues, before eventually ruling.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, founded by conservative advocate Edward Blum, has sued Harvard under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars intentional race discrimination at colleges and universities that receive federal funds. Blum, based in Maine, has brought a series of lawsuits against racial policies up to the Supreme Court. Abigail Fisher, a white student who sued the University of Texas at Austin over affirmative action, lost her long-running case in 2016. The Texas program was upheld by a single vote, that of Anthony Kennedy, who resigned this summer and was succeeded by the more conservative Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nThree years earlier, however, Blum achieved a major victory in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, as the Supreme Court curtailed the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Blum, a former stockbroker who is not a lawyer, recruited the Alabama county that successfully challenged a VRA provision that had required states with a history of discrimination to clear any proposed changes in election rules with the US Department of Justice before enactment.\n\nHarvard by the numbers\n\nHarvard receives about 40,000 annual applications and ends up with a final freshman class of about 1,600. The percentage of Asian American students has been rising through the years and the most recently admitted class of 2022 is 23% Asian American. African Americans constitute about 15% and Latinos, 12 percent. A category of mainly white students account for 50%\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions has argued that those percentages have been relatively constant because of \"racial balancing,\" and that Asian American applicants are essentially capped below the acceptance percentage they merit.\n\nThe group says Harvard tamps down successful Asian American applicants mainly through manipulation of crucial \"personal\" rankings, which assess a range of traits from leadership to likeability and which can be determinative among so many high-achieving applicants. (In the group that became the current Class of 2019, for example, 8,000 of the US applicants had perfect GPAs, and more than 5,000 had a perfect math or verbal SAT score.)\n\nIn his final arguments Friday, Hughes argued that Harvard uses the important \"personal\" rating to deflate Asian American admission chances, while it inflates the chances for blacks and Hispanics. He displayed a chart showing racial categories of students who had earned the highest academic scores. The top Asian Americans consistently received the lowest \"personal\" ratings, while the top African American applicants were awarded the highest \"personal\" ratings.\n\nHarvard rejected the evidence, saying it rested on a false assumption that academic superiority aligns with a personal character assessment. The \"personal rating,\" insisted Seth Waxman, a lawyer for Harvard who shared the closing arguments, \"has almost no correlation\" to the academic index.\n\nMore broadly, Waxman faulted the challengers' data models, which showed Asian American applicants at a disadvantage among other racial groups, because they excluded these \"personal\" ratings, as well as a whole class of traditionally favored applicants: athletes, children of alumni, faculty and staff or on a special dean's list.\n\nThe challengers also removed from their data analyses a student's parents' occupation and the student's intended career -- both of which Harvard said mattered in trying to bring in a range of backgrounds and experiences.\n\nLawyer Adam Mortara, who closed out the session on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions, rebuffed Harvard's efforts to discount the group. He said it had 20,000 members and was determined to try to end admissions practices that arise from racial stereotyping.\n\n\"Some day this [case] will be written about in the history books, and those books will say there was Asian American discrimination at Harvard. Of that, I am confident. Those books might say that Harvard let the wolf of racial bias in through the front door,\" Mortara said.\n\n\"I hope those books will say this court slammed the door shut.\"\n\nNationwide stakes\n\nIn Burroughs' own brief remarks as the trial ended Friday afternoon, she said she felt the weight of the case, for students and universities nationwide.\n\nAppointed to the bench in late 2014 by President Barack Obama, Burroughs began presiding over the dispute soon after it was filed. Throughout the trial, she asked relatively few questions, mainly testing the presumptions behind the data analyses.\n\nOn Monday, she heard from eight Harvard students and alumni who spoke about their experiences as racial and ethnic minorities at the Cambridge campus. From Native American, Vietnamese and other diverse backgrounds, they recounted feeling marginalized and stereotyped in their youth and that they came to feel appreciated for their differences at Harvard.\n\nPresented by civil rights organizations that had entered the case as amici, \"friends of the court,\" that testimony brought a human dimension to a trial filled with data crunching and contrasting views of what factors most illuminated Harvard's screening practices.\n\n\"No criticism intended,\" Burroughs said at one point to Harvard's leading data witness as he was criticizing the challengers' interpretation, \"but I assume that you're both presenting the data in the way that's most efficacious for your models.\"", "(CNN) The mayor of a small Utah city was killed Saturday in Kabul, Afghanistan in small arms fire while serving in the Army National Guard.\n\nOn Sunday, the Pentagon confirmed the identity of Brent Taylor of North Ogden.\n\nReports indicated the attacker was a member of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and was immediately killed by other Afghan forces, the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition said.

An escalation in insurgent attacks and fighting between the Taliban and government forces has helped drive the number of civilian deaths this year to its highest point on record , according to UN figures released last month.\n\nTotal civilian deaths across Afghanistan -- due to various violent attacks -- stood at 2,798 for the first nine months of 2018, slightly up from the same period last year, according to the United Nations.", "Washington (CNN) The first $5 billion election is almost in the books.\n\nDemocrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, are voicing confidence the party \"will\" take back control of the chamber.\n\nMy colleague Harry Enten said it best : The fundamentals of the midterm elections haven't changed.\n\nThe generic ballot advantage, enthusiasm edge and President Trump's underwater approval rating are facts that all work in the Democrats' favor.

Overall spending in the final week favors Democrats, with Davids outpacing Yoder $445,000 to $364,000 head-to-head, while Independence USA PAC, the DCCC and House Majority PAC combined are chipping in more than $600,000 to benefit the Democratic challenger.\n\nRace moves from Toss-Up to Lean Democratic\n\nSC-01: The National Republican Congressional Committee invested in this race late, looking to avoid a surprise upset in a district Trump won by 14 points.

on Friday evening made numerous racist and misogynistic comments in YouTube videos posted in 2014, according to a report from The New York Times .\n\nIn the videos, the man identified with \"involuntary celibates\" -- otherwise known as \"incels\" -- and also made derogatory remarks about interracial relationships and appeared resentful toward women who wouldn't date him.\n\nCNN has seen the videos The New York Times reported on, but has not independently verified that the man in the videos is the gunman identified by police.\n\nThe videos were first reported by BuzzFeed News.\n\nAccording to police, Scott Paul Beierle, 40, walked into Hot Yoga Tallahassee on Friday evening and opened fire, killing two people and wounding five others before turning the gun on himself.\n\nPolice identified the two killed as Nancy Van Vessem, 61, and Maura Binkley, 21.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Beierle was sympathetic toward Elliot Rodger , who killed six people and wounded 14 others in 2014 near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Rodger had wrriten a manifesto in which he lamented his virginity, which he blamed on the \"cruelness of women.\"\n\nBeierle said that as an adolescent he could relate to \"this endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nHe recounted a string of instances in which he was personally rejected.\n\n\"Made one date, didn't show up,\" he said of one woman, according to The New York Times. \"Made another date, didn't show up. Kept making excuses. Ah, I could've ripped her head off.\"\n\n\"I don't think a female can ever understand the societal pressure that's put on an adolescent male to unburden himself of this stigma that society's put on him,\" he said. \"This virginity burden.\"\n\nThe videos had names like \"Plight of the Adolescent Male\" and \"Dangers of Diversity.\"\n\nPeople fought shooter, police said\n\nPeople inside Hot Yoga Tallahassee appeared to have fought the gunman in an effort to save themselves and others, Tallahassee police Chief Michael DeLeo said.\n\nEvidence and interviews with dozens of witnesses led police to determine Beierle \"entered the business posing as a customer and began shooting patrons with a handgun without warning,\" DeLeo said Saturday.\n\nThe gunman, who was already dead when officers arrived, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police chief said in a statement Saturday.\n\nPolice said people fought the man who walked into a Tallahassee, Florida, yoga studio and opened fire.\n\nIt remains unclear what connection Beierle, who was staying at a local hotel, had to the yoga studio and the victims, DeLeo said. Investigators are working to determine the gunman's motive.\n\nA Defense Department official told CNN that Beierle was an Army veteran, but the official did not provide further details.\n\nAccording to police, Beierle was a Florida State University graduate and had been the \"subject of prior calls for service in the Tallahassee area related to harassment of young women.\"\n\nIt's believed he acted alone, DeLeo said, and there's no threat to the community.\n\nPolice received 911 calls about a shooting at 5:37 p.m. Friday -- minutes after a hot yoga flow class was scheduled to begin, according to the studio's website.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they found that six people were shot and one person had been pistol-whipped.\n\nTwo victims were in stable condition, police said early Saturday, and three others had been released from the hospital.\n\nOf the two hospitalized, one was shot nine times, and the other had a bullet pass through her body, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum told reporters.\n\nA doctor and a college student slain\n\nDeLeo said investigators were unable to draw a connection immediately between the gunman and either of the deceased.\n\nBinkley was a student at Florida State, and Van Vessem was a faculty member at the university's medical school, CNN affiliate WCTV reported.\n\n\"There are no words to express the shock and grief we feel after learning of the deaths of Maura Binkley and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem. To lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the Florida State University family,\" Florida State President John Thrasher said in a statement posted on his Twitter account.\n\n\"We feel this loss profoundly and we send our deepest sympathies to Maura's and Nancy's loved ones while we pray for the recovery of those who were injured.\"\n\nThere are no words to express the shock and grief we feel after learning of the deaths of Maura Binkley and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem. To lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the FSU family. 1/2 \u2014 President John Thrasher (@FSUPresThrasher) November 3, 2018\n\nVan Vessem was a doctor specializing in internal medicine who was chief medical director for Florida's Capital Health Plan, the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper reported.\n\n\"As we process the gut-wrenching act of violence that took place this evening in a place of peace in our community, we hold in our hearts everyone who is affected and lift them up in love,\" officials tweeted from the city's verified account.\n\nGillum addresses gun violence on campaign trail\n\nGillum, who is also the Democratic nominee in the Florida governor's race, took a brief break from campaigning and returned to Tallahassee on Friday evening after receiving news of the shooting.\n\n\"The truth is that these occurrences have become far too frequent in our society,\" Gillum said. \"I would ask that the community continue to lift up the victims, those who are still recovering from their injuries.\"\n\nGillum met with victims Friday night after he returned from a Shabbat service in South Florida honoring the 11 people killed a week ago in a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nPolice officers are stationed outside Hot Yoga Tallahassee on Friday night after the shooting.\n\nHe was back at it Saturday afternoon and addressed what he called \"nonsensical gun violence\" while at a \"Get Out the Vote\" rally in Orlando.\n\nAccording to Gillum, one of the victims of Friday's shooting told him, \"I am expecting you to do something about this gun violence.\"\n\n\"This is certainly not the news that I expected in the final closing days of this race,\" he said, \"but I want you to know that I am more agitated and activated, more than I ever have been when it comes to the need for us to bring the power of the NRA to kneel in the state of Florida and around this country.\"\n\nRon DeSantis, the Republican nominee for Florida governor, addressed the shooting on Twitter on Friday night, calling it \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Casey and I are praying for the families,\" he said.",

collapse at an Amazon Fulfillment Center in southeast Baltimore, officials said Saturday.\n\nBaltimore Fire Department spokesman Chief Roman Clark said thermal imaging equipment was being used to determine if anyone else may be trapped inside. One of those found dead was an adult male.\n\nBrandon McBride, an employee who was working in the building at the time, described the chaos to CNN affiliate WBAL when the building collapsed.\n\n\"I was standing inside the building and me and one of the facilities dudes were talking, and I went to the left side of the building and he went to the right, and all of a sudden, we just heard these loud noises. The power shut off. It was just crazy inside,\" McBride told the station. \"It just sounded like bombs were dropping everywhere. The whole side (of the building) was just dropping.\"\n\nSevere weather came through the area Friday night at the time of the partial collapse, Clark said. But fire officials have not determined a cause.\n\nRead More", "\u062a\u0643\u062a\u0633\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0647\u0648\u0646\u063a

"(CNN) It's the first weekend in November. You know what that means: It's time to \"fall back.\"\n\nOr more specifically, time for us to move our clocks back as daylight saving time comes to an end.\n\nIt happens at 2 a.m. Sunday, in essence allowing most Americans to relive the 1 a.m. hour all over again.\n\nSo people will get an extra hour to sleep or party or maybe go over that sample ballot before voting in Tuesday's midterms. Hey, we're not here to judge how you use your time.\n\nThe change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time. The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and American Samoa also do not recognize the change. (Florida lawmakers voted earlier this year to stop doing the time-change thing , but it still has to be OK'd by Congress before that takes effect there.)\n\nRead More", "Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) Divers searching for the wreckage of Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610 have found the main fuselage and claim they can now hear a signal from the aircraft's missing cockpit voice recorder, the head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency said Saturday.\n\nDiving teams are working to locate the device, commonly known as a black box, which could help investigators piece together the final moments of the brand-new Boeing 737 before it crashed, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nThe plane's flight data recorder was located Thursday, but investigators say they have not yet been able to extract any information from it.\n\nMuhammad Syaugi, head of Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency, Basarnas, told reporters in Jakarta on Saturday that divers had now heard a \"ping\" from the second black box.\n\n\"Although the sound is quite weak, it came from the spot not far from the ship 'Victory,'\" he added, referring to one of the vessels involved in the search effort.\n\nThe ill-fated Lion Air flight JT 610's flight data recorder was recovered from the Java Sea on Thursday.\n\nSyaugi said he had \"received information that we found the fuselage\" from the team on location, although he had not yet seen it himself. More than 100 divers are currently working in different zones conducting various searches, he added.\n\nThe fast-moving currents and muddy waters of the crash site in the Java Sea have hindered recovery efforts since the plane came down Monday shortly after taking off from Jakarta.\n\nDiver's death\n\nNews of progress in the search effort followed confirmation earlier Saturday that one of the divers involved in the search for victims and wreckage from the flight had died.\n\nSyahrul Anto, 48, was found unconscious Friday after his diving partner noticed he had disappeared, said Syaugi. He was immediately brought back to shore and was attended by doctors but Syaugi said that \"God had a different plan.\"\n\nAnto was a qualified, senior diver \"who devoted his life for our country,\" Syaugi said.\n\nSyaugi, who is responsible for the diving team, said those involved \"are very qualified divers, outstanding divers, with long experience. They are come from Navy special task forces, from the police, from the Basarnas team, and some are volunteers from diving clubs.\"\n\nPeople watch on the beach as a rescue team prepares to head to the crash site on Monday.\n\n'Broken parts' in flight data recorder\n\nEfforts to extract information from the flight data recorder, which should contain valuable information on how the plane's systems were performing in the moments before the crash, continued Saturday.\n\nInvestigators were in the process of cleaning the salt residue from its memory card so they can download the data, Nurcahyo Utomo, of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Commission (KNKT), said.\n\nThere was no other damage to the memory card and investigators hope to begin downloading data Sunday, with the help of an Australian team, he said.\n\n\"We really need to do this process carefully,\" Utomo said.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Lion Air plane crashes off Indonesia A relative of one of the crash victims tosses flower petals from an Indonesian Navy ship on Tuesday, November 6.

Hide Caption 27 of 27\n\nEarlier Saturday, investigators had not yet been able to download anything from the recorder because \"there are some broken parts\" in the device, the KNKT said.\n\nBoeing and the US National Transportation Safety Board are flying special equipment to Indonesia to help local authorities extract information from it, agency official Haryo Satmiko said.\n\nAn aviation official with knowledge of the crash investigation told CNN on Friday that the recorder was so deeply submerged in water that it was hard to get the data off it.\n\nWhat is believed to be a rear landing gear wheel from the doomed plane was delivered to the KNKT on Saturday, Utomo said. Divers are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder, he told CNN.\n\nA wheel from the crashed Lion Air flight was pulled from the sea by Indonesian authorities on Friday.\n\nAnalysts say finding the cockpit voice recorder is imperative if investigators are to determine whether the crash has implications for other airlines collectively operating thousands of Boeing 737 flights around the world each day.\n\n\"We need to know whether there is a Lion Air problem, a specific problem to this plane, or whether it is a general wider problem for 737s,\" said Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of airline rating agency, Airlineratings.com.\n\nIt's not yet clear what condition the main fuselage is in. Most of the plane's wreckage remains deep in the water and it's so shattered that analysts say much of the recovery is likely to be done by hand or with nets.\n\nDavid Soucie, an aviation safety analyst for CNN, said a big challenge for divers would be to identify and separate any body parts from other debris.\n\n\"You look at the insulation and the seat backs, the seat cushions can easily be mistaken for body parts and vice versa,\" Soucie said.\n\nOnly one victim identified\n\nFlight 610 was supposed to take its passengers on a one-hour journey from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang on the island of Bangka. Instead it crashed 13 minutes after takeoff.

The case remains under investigation, Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said.\n\nHere's what we know so far:\n\nWho were the sisters?\n\nRotana Farea, 23, and Tala Farea, 16, were Saudi Arabian citizens who had been living in the United States for two to three years, Shea said Friday.\n\nThey were students who were accompanying their brother in Washington, according to the Royal Consulate General of Saudia Arabia.\n\nRotana was formerly a student enrolled at George Mason University, according to school spokesman Michael Sandler. He told CNN that Rotana Farea was enrolled from spring of 2016 until the spring of 2018.\n\nThey were put in a shelter-like facility in Fairfax, Virginia, because of abuse allegations that came up in their home jurisdiction. Shea did not elaborate on further details and reports of abuse, which he said are not corroborated at this time.\n\nThe sisters were last seen together in Fairfax on August 24.\n\nTala Farea, 16, and Rotana Farea, 23.\n\nWhat about their family?\n\nThe sisters were last seen by their family at their Virginia residence on November 30, 2017, authorities say.\n\nThe family last had contact with the girls in December of 2017 and had no additional contact between then and August 2018, Shea said.\n\nTheir mother apparently lives in the United States, because Saudi officials told CNN that US officials had asked her to leave the country, reportedly due to her immigration status.\n\nHow did they die?\n\nBefore the bodies were ID'd, police released sketches of the siblings.\n\nOn the afternoon of October 24, the bodies of two young women were found on the bank of the Hudson River in New York, near 68th and Riverside in an area where \"it's such a place where you would essentially walk right into the water,\" Shea said.\n\nThe wore similar black leggings and fur-trimmed jackets. Shea said they were tied together at the waist with duct tape in a way that was \"keeping them together\" but wasn't meant to bind them.\n\nThe bodies were identified as the sisters on October 27.\n\nPolice have not yet determined the cause of death.\n\nOne law enforcement official, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that water was found in the sisters' lungs, leading investigators to believe they were alive when they went in the water.\n\nThe official told CNN investigators believe the deaths were suicide.\n\nThe bodies showed no signs of trauma, according to police. On Friday Shea dismissed reports that they had jumped from the George Washington bridge, saying, \"We have absolutely zero information to lead us to that.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? I can tell you that there were no, say, marks on the body, indicative of a fall from a height.\"\n\nUltimately, investigators have not uncovered evidence to suggest they were the victims of foul play.\n\n\"At this point in time we have no credible information that a crime took place in New York City,\" Shea said, \"but it is still under investigation.\"\n\nHow did they end up in New York?\n\nBy tracing credit card usage, detectives determined they first went to Washington, DC, then Philadelphia and finally arrived in New York City on September 1, according to an NYPD spokesman.\n\nThey took multiple modes of transportation, including Uber, authorities said.\n\nWhat did the sisters do before their deaths?\n\nThe sisters spent their final weeks staying at high-end hotels in New York including the Hilton and Hyatt, Shea said.\n\nThey also went shopping and ordered food -- always two meals, he said.\n\nThe expenses were put on a credit card that was eventually maxed out.\n\nPolice have seen video from as recently as last week that showed the sisters \"apparently in good health,\" Shea said.\n\nDetectives are also combing midtown Manhattan for surveillance footage, eye witness accounts, anything that can help them piece together what happened.\n\n\"We're looking at a two-month gap\" between their disappearance from Virginia and the finding of the bodies, Shea said.\n\nDid anyone see them just before they died?\n\nPolice said a \"credible\" eyewitness came forward on October 31 to share a story with detectives that was \"haunting him.\"\n\nThe witness said he was exercising at about 7 a.m. the day the Farea sisters' bodies were discovered.\n\nHe saw two girls sitting in Riverside Park at a playground a \"very short distance\" from the Hudson River, police said. The girls were sitting about 30 feet apart with their heads in their hands, and were making loud noises the witness described as praying.\n\nWas this the first time they disappeared?\n\nNo. According to the Fairfax County police, the sisters were reported missing for one day in December 2017.\n\nOfficer Tara Gerhard, a spokeswoman for the department, said the sisters were \"referred to services,\" but she could not specify what type of services, nor offer additional details, citing privacy laws.\n\nWere the girls seeking asylum?\n\nSources in the investigation have told detectives the sisters had said they would rather inflict harm on themselves or kill themselves rather than return to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA Saudi official told CNN the girls' mother's immigration status had expired and that US officials had asked her to leave the country. But the Saudis asked the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to give their mother an extension and called their mother to let her know, the official said.\n\nSaudi officials are still looking into whether Rotana and Tala applied for asylum, the official added. The official also refuted reports the family was told it must return to Saudi Arabia because the girls had applied for asylum.\n\nThe New York Times reported the Saudi Embassy in Washington had called Rotana and Tala's mother to inform her that her daughters had applied for asylum in the United States.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials declined to comment and referred questions to the NYPD as the lead on the case.", "Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone says messages obtained by CNN, to Randy Credico, a witness in the Mueller probe, are being taken out of context, and that that he made \"no effort to intimidate or coerce Credico to do anything other than the truth.\"", "Nota del editor: Frank Vales naci\u00f3 en La Habana, Cuba.

Los comentarios expresados en esta columna pertenecen exclusivamente al autor.\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) \u2013 Estudi\u00e9 traducci\u00f3n e interpretaci\u00f3n en alem\u00e1n en un instituto de La Habana, ubicado en el barrio de Miramar, llamado M\u00e1ximo Gorki. All\u00ed aprend\u00ed el idioma, pero tambi\u00e9n cultura alemana. Pronto comprend\u00ed que el idioma no puede separarse de la cultura que lo sustenta. Toda traducci\u00f3n o interpretaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 siempre un ejercicio cultural y ling\u00fc\u00edstico. Se traducen ideas que se expresan a trav\u00e9s de las palabras y pensar que el simple conocimiento de un idioma extranjero nos capacita para ser traductores o int\u00e9rpretes es cuando menos ingenuo o irrespetuoso.\n\nMi primer viaje a Alemania tuvo lugar en 1972, cuando hab\u00eda cumplido 25 a\u00f1os de edad y me desempe\u00f1aba como director de dos institutos: M\u00e1ximo Gorki y Pablo Lafargue. Siempre he pensado que esa fue la etapa m\u00e1s productiva y bella de mi vida profesional porque tuve la inmensa dicha de poder participar en la formaci\u00f3n de los futuros traductores e int\u00e9rpretes de Cuba. Mantengo contacto con muchos de mis antiguos alumnos y colegas de trabajo de aquel entonces y me llena de orgullo ver que no son pocos los que han tenido \u00e9xitos en su vida personal y profesional y que no olvidan a este viejo amigo. Recibo de ellos m\u00faltiples mensajes sumamente respetuosos y llenos de cari\u00f1o y agradecimiento. Pero volvamos al tema de Alemania.\n\nEn aquella \u00e9poca recib\u00ed una invitaci\u00f3n para visitar centros de formaci\u00f3n de traductores y escuelas primarias y secundarias donde se ense\u00f1aban lenguas extranjeras, as\u00ed como para sostener un intercambio de experiencias con expertos en materia de ense\u00f1anza de idiomas extranjeros. Fue as\u00ed que visit\u00e9 colegios y universidades y me encontr\u00e9 con colegas alemanes en Berl\u00edn, Leipzig y Dresde, entre otras ciudades y pueblos. En ese periplo tuve la oportunidad de ver algunas ruinas de la guerra, im\u00e1genes de la total destrucci\u00f3n de Dresde, impactos de balas en m\u00faltiples edificios, el muro de Berl\u00edn y visit\u00e9 dos campos de concentraci\u00f3n: Sachsenhausen, especialmente destinado a presos pol\u00edticos y disidentes, y Buchenwald, lugar de exterminio de jud\u00edos.\n\nEste \u00faltimo mostraba la verdadera y despreciable cara del nazismo, pues se encontraba en las cercan\u00edas de Weimar, ciudad muy importante en la cultura alemana y de dos de sus grandes representantes: Friedrich Schiller y Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Los horrores del nazismo y del Holocausto, de los que me hablaban los jud\u00edos neoyorquinos que conoc\u00ed, los pude apreciar en todas sus execrables manifestaciones nacionalistas en esas visitas.\n\nVarios viajes m\u00e1s realic\u00e9 a Alemania Oriental en a\u00f1os posteriores e, incluso, llegu\u00e9 a trabajar como profesor de espa\u00f1ol en un instituto de la Universidad Karl Marx (hoy Universidad de Leipzig) en la primavera y verano de 1989, donde adem\u00e1s obtuve una licenciatura en interpretaci\u00f3n y traducci\u00f3n en alem\u00e1n, ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol. Poco despu\u00e9s desapareci\u00f3 la RDA para abrirle el camino a la Reunificaci\u00f3n Alemana. Fue as\u00ed que visit\u00e9 la Alemania reunificada en a\u00f1os sucesivos a partir de 1991 y, especialmente, visit\u00e9 ciudades de la antigua Alemania Federal hasta que en 1994 recib\u00ed primero una beca para continuar mi investigaci\u00f3n sobre las influencias alemanas en la obra y pensamiento martianos; y luego para realizar un doctorado sobre este tema en la Universidad de Maguncia, pero residiendo en Munich.\n\nA modo de ejemplo quisiera se\u00f1alar que en todos esos viajes pude observar c\u00f3mo ciertos vocablos alemanes hab\u00edan pasado a ser rechazados por la poblaci\u00f3n en general debido a la carga negativa que hab\u00edan adquirido durante la \u00e9poca del dominio nazi. As\u00ed aprend\u00ed a evitar pronunciar palabras como vaterland (patria) por ser uno de los vocablos m\u00e1s empleados por Hitler para manipular al pueblo alem\u00e1n. Se prefer\u00eda hablar de heimat (pueblo o tierra natal). Das deutsche Volk (el pueblo alem\u00e1n) adquiri\u00f3 igual connotaci\u00f3n negativa porque se impuso como frase para justificar el expansionismo alem\u00e1n y el desprecio por todos los dem\u00e1s pueblos. Hoy se prefiere decir bev\u00f6lkerung (poblaci\u00f3n). F\u00fchrer (gu\u00eda o l\u00edder), que fue el t\u00edtulo que se le confiri\u00f3 a Adolf Hitler para resaltar su papel como m\u00e1xima figura del nazismo, ha sido rechazado categ\u00f3ricamente por reflejar la unipersonalidad del oprobioso y despreciable r\u00e9gimen que le cost\u00f3 la vida a decenas de millones de personas. Solamente he encontrado su uso en vocablos compuestos, muy com\u00fan en alem\u00e1n: reisef\u00fchrer que significa gu\u00eda tur\u00edstico o una gu\u00eda de turismo. Se usa ahora leiter (l\u00edder o jefe), entre otras palabras para indicar el significado de l\u00edder. Otro de los vocablos m\u00e1s aborrecidos era nationalismus (nacionalismo), que era la ideolog\u00eda del nazismo con lo cual se justificaba el desprecio y odio hacia otros pueblos y se realzaba la superioridad del pueblo alem\u00e1n con respecto a otros pueblos y etnias; y se defend\u00eda a Alemania por encima de toda consideraci\u00f3n o duda. No se trata de ser pol\u00edticamente correcto cuando aporto estos ejemplos, sino de tener un conocimiento de la historia moderna y sus repercusiones en el lenguaje. Por eso se dice con toda raz\u00f3n que las palabras tienen consecuencias, a veces desconocidas por las personas que no tienen en cuenta la historia y las usan incorrectamente.\n\nHace 73 a\u00f1os que Estados Unidos y sus aliados derrotaron al fascismo en Europa, pero \u00e9ste no ha desaparecido del todo como se comprueba con el ascenso del movimiento neonazi en meses recientes en este pa\u00eds. No basta con abrir una embajada en Jerusal\u00e9n, vender armas y sistemas de defensa antia\u00e9reas y hacer declaraciones en\u00e9rgicas de respaldo a Israel cuando, a su vez, se tolera y permite el surgimiento del neofascismo en nuestro pa\u00eds o se hacen declaraciones ambiguas sobre el racismo y los neonazis.\n\nCreo haber dicho que de tanto cuidarnos de las influencias negativas del comunismo se ha abandonado la lucha contra una plaga de la humanidad: el fascismo. Recuerdo que durante mi residencia de a\u00f1os en Francia conoc\u00ed de diversas sanciones a personas por negar la existencia del Holocausto y por sus posiciones neonazis. Ser\u00eda bueno que aprendamos de las experiencias de otros pa\u00edses en la lucha contra esta nefasta y aborrecible plaga y que formemos, una vez m\u00e1s, una sagrada alianza para erradicar de una vez para siempre esta aborrecible ideolog\u00eda. En eso no puede haber ambig\u00fcedades. Descansen en paz, queridos hermanos jud\u00edos de Pittsburg, las nuevas v\u00edctimas del nacionalismo. Ustedes representan lo mejor de todos nosotros.

Sostuvo que la investigaci\u00f3n sobre la trama rusa es un enga\u00f1o o una cacer\u00eda de brujas 157 veces y afirm\u00f3 que fue el suyo fue mayor recorte de impuestos en 120 ocasiones, de acuerdo con la verificaci\u00f3n de datos de The Washington Post.\n\n(Aclaraci\u00f3n: muchas personas preguntan por qu\u00e9 no me refiero a las falsedades de Trump como mentiras. Son dos razones: 1) The Washington Post eval\u00faa las afirmaciones falsas o enga\u00f1osas y, al citar sus cifras, prefiero usar sus t\u00e9rminos para mayor precisi\u00f3n. 2) Como he explicado anteriormente, creo que podemos \u2013y debemos\u2013 utilizar la palabra mentira cuando sabemos o tenemos una expectativa razonable acerca de que Trump es consciente de que algo que est\u00e1 diciendo es falso).\n\nEl gran n\u00famero de enga\u00f1o de Trump contradice lo que le se\u00f1al\u00f3 a Jon Karl de ANC News acerca de que \u201ctrato y siempre quiero decir la verdad\u201d. El registro sugiere lo opuesto.\n\nLos hechos son, para Trump, cosas intercambiables. Cuando encajan en su narrativa, \u00e9l est\u00e1 feliz de destacarlo. El problema es que rara vez van de acuerdo a su narrativa. Entonces, cuando no lo hacen, no tiene ning\u00fan inconveniente en crear su propia narrativa que simplemente carece de alguna semejanza real con la verdad establecida.\n\nDe hecho, como dejan claro los n\u00fameros de la verificaci\u00f3n de datos de The Washington Post, Trump parece presumir de sus afirmaciones sin hechos, asegurando a sus partidarios que est\u00e1 diciendo la verdad \u201crea\u201d de que los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n no mostrar\u00e1n. De hecho, el presidente convirti\u00f3 esa tendencia hacia la falsedad en toda una estrategia pol\u00edtica: es tan incorrecto pol\u00edticamente que ni siquiera respeta las reglas de los hecho y verdad que las llamadas \u201c\u00e9lites\u201d creen que deber\u00eda acatar.\n\nEs un asunto realmente impresionante y aterrador. Lo que m\u00e1s me asusta es que los seguidores de Trump no parecen saber \u2013o importarles\u2013 nada de esto. Consideran que la verificaci\u00f3n de datos de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n son simplemente \u201cnoticias falsas\u201d que hacen todo lo posible para frenar la fuerza del presidente. Y en la medida en que reconocen que Trump no dice la verdad la mayor parte del tiempo, lo califican como a) es \u00e9l simplemente hablando o b) todos los pol\u00edticos mienten. (La mayor\u00eda de los pol\u00edticos s\u00ed dicen cosas falsas de vez en cuando. Sin embargo, cuando se les mencionan, dejan de afirmarlas. Trump no es as\u00ed).\n\nTrump tambi\u00e9n trabaja de manera agresiva para asegurarse de que su base lo vea como el \u00fanico hombre honesto en el pa\u00eds, la \u00fanica persona que realmente dice las cosas como son.\n\n\u201cQu\u00e9dense con nosotros\u201d, le dijo a una multitud de VFW en Kansas City en julio pasado. \u201cNo crean la basura que ven de estas personas, las noticias falsas... Lo que est\u00e1n viendo y lo que est\u00e1n leyendo no es lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo\u201d, insisti\u00f3.\n\nSin embargo, este es el asunto: todo est\u00e1 ocurriendo. Los hechos no son una posici\u00f3n partidista. Y aqu\u00ed hay un hecho que nadie deber\u00eda olvidar: Donald Trump es enga\u00f1oso, y a veces mentiroso, a un ritmo que nunca antes hab\u00edamos visto en pol\u00edtica.

De ella depende que tengan \u00e9xito o no en su intento por conseguir que los mercados globales conf\u00eden en la econom\u00eda. Por eso, cada cierto tiempo indagamos en GloboEoconom\u00eda la percepci\u00f3n que los distintos pa\u00edses de nuestra regi\u00f3n tienen en la bolsa. El turno de esta semana fue para Colombia.\n\nDurante un largo periodo, que coincidi\u00f3 con la presidencia de Juan Manuel Santos, el pa\u00eds ha disfrutado de una muy buena imagen, en cierta medida guiada por los esfuerzos de conseguir la paz en su territorio y el final de m\u00e1s de medio siglo de conflicto armado interno. Circunstancia que adem\u00e1s tuvo la fortuna de ir unida a unos a\u00f1os en los que el boom energ\u00e9tico colombiano \u2013con altos precios del petr\u00f3leo\u2013 permiti\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n en infraestructuras importantes y el cambio de muchos inversionistas frente al pa\u00eds.\n\nPero, recientemente, la ca\u00edda de los precios del crudo, junto a una fuerte divisi\u00f3n dentro de Colombia sobre c\u00f3mo se recibi\u00f3 ese proceso de paz, ha enturbiado de cierta manera la buena imagen. La misma que ahora el nuevo gobierno de Iv\u00e1n Duque trata de mejorar dando explicaciones en estos mercados e insistiendo en que no se va a revertir nada de lo hecho que sea positivo y que solo se trata de conseguir un consenso social m\u00e1s amplio, mientras se ponen las bases para crecer con mayor vigor.\n\nCiertamente, el tema del crecimiento es uno de los retos pendientes porque la econom\u00eda colombiana \u2013como otras muchas de la regi\u00f3n\u2013, necesita aumentos m\u00e1s vigorosos si quiere llegar a un nivel de bienestar y desarrollo aceptable. Los crecimientos en el entorno del 2% o 3% \u2013que suelen servir a los pa\u00edses mas desarrollados\u2013, se quedan muy cortos para naciones como Colombia que a\u00fan tienen una renta per c\u00e1pita modesta.\n\nDe todo esto y m\u00e1s he hablado esta semana con Christian Murrle, directivo de Panamcap Advisors.

Production is increasing at an unprecedented clip, and so is the body count. Leaders in places like Bangladesh and the Philippines are waging deadly drug wars that have cost thousands of lives.\n\nBut this isn't \"Breaking Bad\" -- meth isn't just used by the poor and the downtrodden.\n\nMeth no longer discriminates in Asia; it has become the dominant drug of choice across the region, irrespective of class, age or gender, according to Jeremy Douglas, who is in charge of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) southeast Asia operations.\n\nIn a career spanning 16 years, Douglas said he's never seen demand like this.\n\n\"No situation is exactly comparable, but this is off the charts,\" he said.\n\nExperts say the boom is due to a serendipitous combination of domestic and geopolitical issues that have aligned to the benefit of the region's drug gangs.\n\nThe majority of meth production is happening deep inside the jungles of the Golden Triangle, a lawless area where the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet. Experts say it's easy to conceal drug production there and move it on at short notice.\n\nDrug runners, meanwhile, are exploiting new roads and infrastructure being built as part of an ambitious, trillion-dollar Chinese initiative to connect markets across the globe, using the flow of people and licit goods to mask drug trafficking.\n\nAnd the profits, likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars, are being laundered via intricate international schemes, often using front companies in countries where lax oversight makes it easy to hide money.\n\n\"It's a perfect storm in terms of the production of methamphetamine,\" says John Coyne, a former head of strategic intelligence at the Australian Federal Police who now works on border security issues at the Australia Strategic Policy Institute.\n\n\"It's pushing Southeast Asia into what could be in time a methamphetamine epidemic.\"\n\nProduction\n\nA large portion of meth seized throughout the Asia Pacific region has been traced to Myanmar's northern Shan State, where militias and warlords reign supreme.\n\nPerhaps the most prominent is the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and its political wing, the United Wa State Party (UWSP).\n\nThe two have waged a years-long struggle for autonomy for the ethnic Wa population, people who share a common language as well as cultural and historic ties with their neighbors in China's southern Yunnan province.\n\nShan State boasts a compelling combination of a good poppy-growing climate and a dearth of law enforcement. For years, the Golden Triangle was the source of the majority of the world's illegal heroin and opium.\n\nAuthorities in the West have long accused the UWSA and UWSP of funding their armed struggle against the Myanmar central government with the profits from drug production. The UWSA is believed to boast around 30,000 fighters.\n\nA United Wa State Army soldier in a poppy field in 1995.\n\nVerifying either claim is incredibly difficult. Northern Shan State is one of the hardest places in the world to access; some joke it's easier to get into North Korea. The UWSA granted journalists a rare visit to the region in 2016 , during which time they denied allegations of narcotics trafficking.\n\nOfficial numbers appeared to lend credence to the claim that the UWSA is no longer producing heroin, at least at first glance. Golden Triangle heroin production and distribution has been on the decline, according to numbers from the United Nations.\n\nAuthorities warn that's likely because the big players have ditched heroin in favor of a new, cheaper to produce alternative: methamphetamine.\n\n\"There's a lot of evidence coming together from across the region pointing back to the same groups, pointing back to the same locations,\" said Douglas with the UNODC.\n\nThis photo taken on June 26, 2017 shows a Wa ethnic woman with a buffalo seen next to members of the United Wa State Army in the Poung Par Khem region, near the Thai-Myanmar border.\n\nThe UWSA's decision to get into the meth game, experts say, is partly a response to market forces, but it's also motivated by profit and ease of production.\n\nMethamphetamine is a synthetic drug. It's made in a lab using chemicals and doesn't require drug makers to cultivate organic crops, such as poppies, as is the case with heroin.\n\nThese labs can be covered by a tarp or moved on short notice. You can't do that with a poppy field.\n\nA photograph shared by the Myanmar Ministry of Defense shows a meth lab seized in Northern Shan State in February 2018.\n\nDistribution\n\nOnce the meth is made, the next challenge is transportation. The Golden Triangle was for years one of the most impoverished and underdeveloped places on the planet, but that's changing thanks to China's One Belt One Road initiative -- a massive infrastructure development project intended to help connect global, predominately developing economies.\n\nBeijing has big plans in Myanmar, where it has spent billions to connect China's landlocked Yunnan province to port cities in South and Southeast Asia. Laos and Thailand have seen similar investments.\n\nAn unintended side affect of these infrastructure improvements is that they've made it easier for meth traffickers to transport product from deep inside Shan State to the rest of Southeast Asia, Coyne said.\n\n\"What you've got is a large, legitimate trade of people, goods, etc., flowing out of Myanmar and Laos in which you can hide your drugs,\" said Coyne.\n\nMeth from northern Shan State in both crystal and pill form has been found as far away as Japan, New Zealand and Australia. A record 1.04 billion Australian dollars ($800 million) worth of meth, believed to have originated in Shan State , was found by police in Western Australia in December.\n\nThis year, authorities have conducted dozens of meth seizures in Thailand, China, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nData supplied by the United Nations shows major cyrstal meth trafficking flows in the Mekong River Delta region and beyond.\n\nShockingly, it only took five months for seizures in Malaysia and Myanmar to surpass the 2017 totals, according to Douglas.\n\nWhile those busts could mean law enforcement is winning its fight against traffickers, it also shows the sheer quantity of meth being moved.\n\nCoyne warns of another possibility -- that meth producers have gone into overproduction, which drives down the per unit cost of making drugs, which in turn makes it easier for dealers to live with these massive busts.\n\n\"They can afford to lose larger quantities and still make profits,\" he said.\n\nThai national police chief general Chaktip Chaijinda (second from the right) watches police department chemists inspect seized drugs during a press conference in Bangkok on May 11. Ten million yaba pills made in Myanmar and nearly half a tonne of crystal meth hidden in tea packages was seized from a convoy in downtown Bangkok, Thai police said.\n\nLaundering\n\nAll that money has to go somewhere, and law enforcement say drug dealers are using intricate financial networks to hide their ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe most prominent -- at least publicly -- is the case of the Zhao Wei, a gambling magnate accused by the US government of using his casino in Laos to help the UWSA launder proceeds from the sale of meth.\n\nCasinos are used for laundering because they involve so much cash trading hands, but Zhao has the added benefit of operating inside what Douglas at the UNODC calls a \"criminal mini-state.\"\n\n\"It operates like his personal fiefdom,\" Douglas said.\n\nZhao has reportedly negotiated a 99-year lease with the Lao government to operate what's known as the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone. The zone lies along the Mekong River that flows between Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. At its center sits the Kings Romans casino.\n\nZhao's agreement with the Lao government allows his business to operate under its own set of unique laws, rules and regulations.\n\nThe only areas in which Zhao defers to the central government are on matters related to the military, the judiciary, and Lao foreign policy, Zhao told Chinese state media in 2011.\n\nThe system is ostensibly designed to help attract foreign investors into the special economic zone. However, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Zhao and the casino in January, alleging that Zhao uses the lax regulation to help facilitate \"the storage and distribution of heroin, methamphetamine, and other narcotics for illicit networks, including the United Wa State Army, operating in neighboring Burma.\"\n\nThe exterior of the Kings Romans casino.\n\nZhao has persistently maintained that the accusations leveled against him are \"groundless.\"\n\n\"The US government's unilateral sanctions on other countries and regions is unreasonable and ridiculous behavior and for other purposes. Such behavior has created profound misunderstanding for the world community thus causing unnecessary concern for a number of investors and visitors,\" he said in February, shortly after the Treasury Department ruling, according to Lao state media\n\n\"The Kings Romans Group's investment and development strictly complies with the law and signed agreements. There are neither reasons nor motivations for us to run illegal businesses. On the contrary, we have cooperated with the government of Laos to prevent and combat strictly illegal acts.\"\n\nThe Lao Ministry of Planning and Investment did not respond to CNN's request for comment, and the US Drug Enforcement Agency declined CNN's request for an interview for this story \"due to some ongoing activity related to the case.\"\n\nThe entrance of the Kings Romans casino.\n\nCashflow\n\nThe US Treasury Department, which did not respond to CNN's request for comment for this story, alleges that a key cog in Zhao's operation sits thousands of miles away from his casino in the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong.\n\nThat cog is a company called Kings Romans International (HK) Co., Limited. It and Zhao were both sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January of this year.\n\nAccording to records from the US Treasury Department and the Hong Kong Corporate Registry, the business is housed in a spartan office tower called Wu Chung House nestled in a commercial part of the city's busy Wan Chai district, a fast gentrifying red light district still famous for its seedy bars.\n\nThe Treasury did not specify what exactly goes on in the office. Hong Kong, however, maintains a reputation as a notorious hub for moving dirty money, with authorities in the city openly acknowledging the problem.\n\n\"Our competitive advantages here -- namely, free flows of capital, people, goods and information; well established legal system; sophisticated market infrastructure; and advanced professional services -- also make our market attractive for criminals seeking to hide or move funds or evade financial sanctions,\" Arthur Yuen, the deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), said in April, during a speech at a conference sponsored by the Association of Certified Anti Money Laundering Specialists.\n\nAn entrance to Wu Chung House in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district.\n\nThe Kings Romans office is supposed to be located at the end of a dimly lit hallway on the 36th floor of Wu Chung House, according to public records, but there was no sign of it when CNN visited.\n\nThe building's directory shows that a company called Shuen Wai Holding Limited uses the office space. Real estate records confirm that Shuen Wai is the property's owner.\n\nShuen Wai and Kings Romans share more than just an address, however. Shuen Wai and one of its two company directors were sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in 2008 amid allegations that the office was a key part of the financial network used by the UWSA to launder profits from drug sales.\n\n\"It makes total sense that the UWSA would be operating out of Hong Kong. They have a long history of mixing illicit with legal activities ... and Hong Kong is the perfect place to do that for them,\" said Evan Rees, an analyst at the intelligence firm Stratfor.\n\nPhotos: This 2008 chart from the US Treasury Department outlines the entities sanctioned that were allegedly part of the United Wa State Army's Financial Network.

Its name is displayed in shiny block letters above an empty secretary's desk. It was decorated with ornate wooden sculptures and marble floors, but with half the lights off and no one in sight.\n\nThe fact that the business was highly visible was a surprise to some of the sanctions experts CNN spoke with about the case.\n\n\"They usually at least make an effort to repaint the sign, even if it is the same address and same cast of characters in front of you,\" said Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for New American Security who previously served as deputy assistant secretary for counter threat finance and sanctions in the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs.\n\n\"Operating 10 years without changing the name, that's pretty brazen.\"\n\nWhen CNN rang the doorbell at the office, a middle-aged, bespectacled man answered. He said the company was previously involved in the jade trade but now works in funeral services.\n\nHe refused to give CNN his name, but said he had been an account manager at the company for 20 years, during which time he has known the two individuals currently listed as Shuen Wai's co-directors. He said the duo are based in mainland China and only come to Hong Kong a few times a year, a couple days at a time. He agreed to pass on a message to them from CNN -- which they did not respond to -- and then retreated back into the office. When CNN called back a couple days later, the individual said the couple was not willing to speak to CNN.\n\nWhen asked about the Wu Chung House connections, the UN's Douglas stressed that each case is different and the age of a specific holding company was not something he could comment on.\n\n\"That said, if the holding company has been a front for drug trafficking for 10 years it is pretty serious and concerning, and authorities should be investigating,\" said Douglas.\n\n\"If links are found and organized crime activities are confirmed then there should be some serious actions taken, and questions will need to be asked about how a front company has been able to run for so long in the open in Hong Kong.\"\n\nHong Kong authorities declined to comment when asked about the case.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - Un hombre abri\u00f3 fuego en un estudio de yoga en Tallahassee, Florida, matando a dos personas e hiriendo a otras cinco, antes de dispararse a s\u00ed mismo, dijo la polic\u00eda.\n\nLa gente dentro de Hot Yoga Tallahassee parec\u00eda haber luchado contra Scott Paul Beierle, un hombre de 40 a\u00f1os de Deltona, Florida, y trat\u00f3 de salvarse a s\u00ed mismos y a otros, dijo el jefe de polic\u00eda, Michael DeLeo.\n\nLa polic\u00eda recibi\u00f3 llamadas al 911 sobre un tiroteo a las 5:37 p.m. el viernes, apenas unos minutos despu\u00e9s de que comenzara una clase de yoga caliente, seg\u00fan el sitio web del estudio.\n\nCuando los oficiales llegaron, encontraron que seis personas fueron baleadas y una persona que fue golpeada con pistola.\n\nEl s\u00e1bado, dos de las v\u00edctimas han muerto.
