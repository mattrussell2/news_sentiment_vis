Las esclavas africanas, explotadas sexualmente, adem\u00e1s de servir para trabajar y proporcionar placeres malvados a depravados amos, produc\u00edan cr\u00edas.\n\nTal vez por la magnitud de la ignominia, la primera concesi\u00f3n de los esclavistas fue declarar \u201cvientres libres\u201d a las esclavas gr\u00e1vidas que par\u00edan hijos emancipados sin alcanzar ellas mismas la libertad. En Iberoam\u00e9rica se llam\u00f3 \u201clibertos\u201d a esas criaturas y en Estados Unidos \u201cfreeborn\u201d, algo as\u00ed \u201ccomo nacido libre\u201d. La paradoja recuerda a los beb\u00e9s que hoy nacen estadounidenses sin que sus madres puedan serlo.\n\nEn el presente, la desigualdad nacional ha generado una nueva modalidad de asumir la maternidad, se trata del llamado \u201cturismo de parto\u201d, que consiste en viajar a pa\u00edses desarrollados donde se practica el \u201cIus soli\u201d (derecho de la tierra), que vincula legalmente el suelo a la persona, generando la \u201cciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento\u201d. Una figura distinta, aunque no necesariamente contrapuesta es el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d o \u201cderecho de sangre\u201d, que asocia la ciudadan\u00eda de los hijos a la de los padres.\n\nMuchas personas estiman que, al nacer ciudadanos de Estados Unidos, Canad\u00e1 u otros pa\u00edses desarrollados, donde se aplica la ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento, sus hijos tendr\u00e1n mejores oportunidades. En Estados Unidos donde esa pr\u00e1ctica no constituye delito, existen compa\u00f1\u00edas que ofertan \u201cpaquetes\u201d del tipo \u201ctodo incluido\u201d que seg\u00fan BBC News pueden costar entre 15.000 y 80.000 d\u00f3lares.\n\nAl respecto, es preciso aclarar que los pa\u00edses que practican el \u201cIus soli\u201d o ciudadan\u00eda por nacimiento, no reconocen el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d\n\ninverso, lo cual significa que tener hijos estadounidenses, canadienses o franceses por nacimiento, no hace ciudadanos ni residentes ni tampoco dota de derechos especiales a los padres. Es frecuente el caso de turistas o personas con visas temporales que desean permanecer en los pa\u00edses de acogida sin poder lograrlo. Sus hijos estadounidenses pueden quedarse y los padres no.\n\nAunque viajar a Estados Unidos o Canad\u00e1 con el prop\u00f3sito de parir all\u00ed no constituye delito, algunas dependencias y funcionarios creen poder penalizar a las mujeres cuando se compruebe que han mentido al falsear los motivos del viaje y ocultar su condici\u00f3n de embarazadas. No obstante, todav\u00eda no existen legislaciones al respecto.\n\nLos avances de la Uni\u00f3n Europea en materia de integraci\u00f3n y unidad pol\u00edtica, condujeron a la adopci\u00f3n en 1992 del Tratado de Maastricht, en el cual se establece que: \u201cEs ciudadano de la Uni\u00f3n Europea toda persona que ostente la de un Estado Miembro...\u201d La ciudadan\u00eda de la Uni\u00f3n, no sustituye a la nacional.\n\nTal vez, t\u00e9cnicamente hablando, lo cual es dif\u00edcil cuando se trata de humanos, los pa\u00edses que cuentan con enormes territorios y poca densidad poblacional ganan m\u00e1s de lo que pierden. Por ejemplo, Estados Unidos con casi diez millones de kil\u00f3metros cuadrados y una densidad poblacional de unas 33 personas por km\u00b2, se beneficia porque obtiene a los hijos sin haber criado a los padres.\n\nAunque personalmente preferir\u00eda que tales fen\u00f3menos no existieran y que a las mismas personas se les aplicara a la vez el \u201cIus soli\u201d, derecho de la tierra y el \u201cIus sanguinis\u201d, \u201cderecho de sangre\u201d, y m\u00e1s a\u00fan que todos los terr\u00edcolas fueran ciudadanos del mundo, comprendo que por ahora tales sue\u00f1os no son practicables.\n\nEntre tanto, mientras la utop\u00eda no se materialice, no encuentro argumentos v\u00e1lidos para criticar a las parejas o mujeres que mediante emigraci\u00f3n nonata procuren un futuro mejor para sus hijos. De alguna manera sus vientres son tambi\u00e9n libres. Estados Unidos deber\u00eda sentirse orgulloso de dar libertad tambi\u00e9n a los nonatos.\n\nComo un d\u00eda con inspirada prosa humanista escribi\u00f3 el afamado autor novelas para la radio, F\u00e9lix B.

En todo caso, les deseo \u00e9xitos.", "(CNN) The UN Security Council unanimously voted on Wednesday to lift 9-year-old sanctions against Eritrea that imposed travel bans, asset freezes and an arms embargo.\n\nThe East African country was hit with targeted sanctions in 2009 after being accused of having ties to Al-Shabaab militants in Somalia and refusing to withdraw from border disputes with Djibouti. Eritrea denied the accusations of involvement with Al-Shabaab.\n\nThe resolution, which was drafted by the United Kingdom and backed by allies, marks a new chapter for peace and cooperation in Eritrea after years of regional conflict.\n\nIn July, Eritrea and neighboring former sworn enemy Ethiopia signed a peace deal officially ending a decades-old war and restoring diplomatic relations. Eritrea's position has improved across the Horn of Africa since historically hostile relations with Somalia and Djibouti have also thawed in recent months, UN members noted after the vote.\n\nThe peace advancements in the region played a significant role in removing sanctions, according to a statement from Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the UN. \"This is a very important move both for the region, who have made sterling efforts to make this work, and for the wider UN and international community,\" said Pierce.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Uber continues to bleed money as it races toward a much-hyped public offering next year.\n\nUber said Wednesday that it lost $1.07 billion in the three months ending in September, up from an $891 million loss in the quarter prior, as the company invests in newer services ranging from food deliveries to scooters, according to a copy of the financials provided to CNN Business.\n\nYet the spike in losses came as Uber's sales remained largely flat for the period. The ride-hailing company posted sales of $2.95 billion for the quarter, up about 5% from the prior quarter and an increase of more than a third from the same period a year earlier.\n\nThe latest results highlight the challenge Uber faces in trying to simultaneously manage its sizable losses while showing the kind of rapid sales growth that investors look for from a newly public technology company. Uber has repeatedly said it expects to go public in 2019\n\nWall Street expectations may be particularly high for Uber. It is valued at around $70 billion on the private market, making it the most highly valued US startup. It could reportedly fetch a valuation of as high as $120 billion in its IPO next year.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Warren Buffett is making an even bigger move into banks.\n\nLast quarter, Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) took a $4 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), according to regulatory filings posted Wednesday.\n\nBerkshire also grew its investment in Bank of America ( BAC ), Goldman Sachs ( GS ), BNY Mellon ( BK ) and US Bancorp ( USB ) though the company slightly lowered its stake in Wells Fargo ( WFC ).\n\nBuffett has long had a good relationship with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. He's partnered with the chief executive, as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, on a new health care venture for employees, and has recommended Dimon's annual investor letter as a must-read.\n\nHe said in an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier this year that he regretted not investing in JPMorgan Chase sooner.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) The White House, after a day of uncertainty, confirmed Wednesday that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel is leaving her position after first lady Melania Trump's office issued an unprecedented public statement calling for her ouster.\n\nIn a statement, press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \"Mira Ricardel will continue to support the President as she departs the White House to transition to a new role within the Administration. The President is grateful for Ms. Ricardel's continued service to the American people and her steadfast pursuit of his national security priorities.\"\n\nMultiple West Wing officials were unable to say where she is going -- because they do not know.

There are 200 other such zones across Europe and several in Asian cities such as Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nGriffiths' team is the first to look at the effects of large-scale traffic emission controls on air quality improvements and at their effects on children's health, he said.\n\nEach year from 2009 through 2013, they measured the lung capacity of 400 different primary-school children between 8 and 9 years old in four East London boroughs. All four boroughs were within London's low emission zone and are heavily polluted, exceeding European Union limits on nitrogen dioxide at the start of the study.\n\nAverage exposure concentrations of nitrogen oxides and particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5) were measured annually at each child's home and school addresses.\n\n\"The introduction of lower-emission zones did improve air quality but had less of an effect than expected,\" Griffiths said.\n\nThey hoped to see children's lung capacity grow year by year, as the zoning should reduce pollution, but the researchers found the opposite: Their lung capacity was an estimated 5% smaller than it would otherwise be.\n\n\"Although changes of this magnitude are unlikely to cause problems in healthy children, we urgently need to know whether these lung deficits will impact lung function and health in later life,\" Griffiths said.\n\nAt the study's start, 99% of the children were living in areas that exceeded the European Union's limits for nitrogen oxide. By 2013, 34% were living in areas that exceeded EU limits -- but many went to schools that had higher levels of pollution, next to busy roads, according to the paper.\n\n\"Doctors should consider advising parents of children with clinically significant lung disease to avoid living in highly polluted areas or to adopt personal mitigation measures to limit their exposure,\" Griffiths said.\n\nImproving child health\n\nA reduction in lung capacity can lead to stunted lungs, which is dangerous for two reasons, Griffiths said.\n\nFirst, it increases the risk of asthma and worsens the condition in those who have it. In the long term, it can also be problematic for adults, as lung size is a good predictor for life expectancy, for reasons that are not exactly clear.\n\nWith age, the lungs start to decline, and if people enter adulthood with already declining lungs, this will lower their life expectancy, he explained.\n\n\"All of the children involved in this study lost some degree of lung function from breathing toxic air,\" said Dr. Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research. \"What this means is that we urgently need to go much further to protect people right now.\"\n\nGriffiths highlighted that the study would have benefited from a comparison group of children living in an area of similar poor air quality and without any zoning regulations in place.

Also present were fellow White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump, faith leaders, law enforcement leaders and lawmakers supporting the legislation were also present.\n\n\"I'm waiting. I'll be waiting with a pen and we will have done something that hasn't been done in many, many years, and it's the right thing to do,\" Trump added.\n\nThe President also spoke about Alice Johnson , a first-time nonviolent drug offender whose sentence he commuted over the summer after the case was brought to his attention by reality television star Kim Kardashian.\n\n\"I'll never forget the scene of her coming out of prison after 21 years and greeting her family and everybody was crying. Her sons, her grandsons, everybody was crying and hugging and holding each other.

Sessions was an opponent of the legislation.\n\nPressed about the lack of Democrats at the President's announcement on Wednesday, the official insisted the bill has Democratic support and pointed to praise for the bill from both sides of the ideological spectrum. The issue for today ultimately came down to the final text of the bill not having yet been widely circulated, the official said.\n\nThe new legislation would eliminate \"stacking\" provisions that result in offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed using firearms; shorten mandatory minimum sentences, including reverting life imprisonment to a 25-year minimum for those convicted under the \"three strikes\" provision; and expand the \"drug safety valve\" to reduce the number of nonviolent drug offenders receiving mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nProponents of the bill made several changes to it to win backing from law enforcement groups, including excluding individuals convicted of some fentanyl-related offenses from accessing good time prison credits and a

Kai Wiggins is a policy analyst at the Arab American Institute. The views expressed here are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) The federal government's 2017 hate crime statistics are out, and they show a disturbing trend: Last year, as in 2016 and 2015 before, hate crimes were on the rise. But what the data fail to show is perhaps even more alarming, and further demonstrates the need for an improved response to hate crime.\n\nWe know that in 2017 , as in 2016 and 2015 before, the increase coincided with burgeoning racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. The FBI's information shows that crimes motivated by race or ethnicity, which rose 18% in 2017, accounted for a majority of all incidents reported, with hate crimes specifically targeting African-Americans representing the greatest share, while anti-Arab hate crimes increased 100%. As for crimes motivated by religion, anti-Jewish incidents surged yet again last year, this time over 37%, while anti-Muslim incidents, which stabilized after two years of dramatic rise, remained well above historical averages from before the 2016 election cycle.\n\nBut despite the reported increase, we know that many incidents, including some of the most horrific acts of bias-motivated violence committed last year, are somehow missing from the official statistics.\n\nThe murder of Heather Heyer is missing. According to the FBI data, the Charlottesville, Virginia, Police Department reported no hate crimes between July and September of last year. But on August 12, 2017, Heyer was killed in Charlottesville when a man plowed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally. An additional 35 people were injured, and the accused driver, James Alex Fields Jr., is awaiting trial on federal hate crime charges. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe killings of Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche are missing. According to FBI statistics, no hate crime murders were reported in Oregon last year. But on May 26, 2017, Best and Namkai-Meche were killed on a train in Portland when a man fatally stabbed them and wounded Micah David-Cole Fletcher after they confronted him for harassing two teenage passengers with anti-Muslim and racist slurs. The accused attacker, Jeremy Joseph Christian, was indicted on the state hate crime charge of \"second degree intimidation\" and pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe murder of Srinivas Kuchibhotla is missing. According to FBI statistics, no hate crimes were reported last year in Olathe, Kansas. But on February 22, 2017, Kuchibhotla was killed at a bar in Olathe when a man shot him because of his perceived national origin. His friend Alok Madasani was also targeted but survived the shooting, as did a man named Ian Grillot who attempted to intercede. The shooter, Adam Purinton, was convicted on federal hate crime charges.\n\nWhile all three cases were prosecuted as hate crimes, this detail is not relevant to whether they should have been reported in the FBI data. According to federal guidance on hate crime reporting, it is the responsibility of law enforcement officials responding to an incident to determine whether there was any indication that it was bias-motivated. After a secondary review, and regardless of whether any hate crime charges are brought, the relevant agency may then report the incident as a hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reporting, or UCR, system, which the FBI uses to publish its annual report.\n\nWe should also note that negligence on the part of responding law enforcement officials is not necessarily the cause of these apparent omissions. While the Portland Police Bureau was not immediately available for comment, the Olathe Police Department confirmed it had reported six hate crime incidents, including the murder of Kuchibhotla, which was recorded as an \"Anti-Other Ethnicity/National Origin\" incident, to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Because the Olathe Police Department and agencies from other jurisdictions submit hate crime data using an antiquated reporting format, the KBI said it was unable to aggregate these incidents into the data collections submitted to the FBI. As for Charlottesville, the department did not return a recent request for comment but had told us in a September statement that the Heyer case and others relating to the white nationalist rally would be reported as hate crimes, but it appears they were not finalized in time for inclusion in the official state or federal data.\n\nIn some states, including Virginia and Oregon , state UCR programs publish annual hate crime statistics. Like the FBI statistics, Virginia's annual hate crime report contains no data relating to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. However, and in seeming contradiction with the federal data, state-level statistics from Oregon include two hate crime murder offenses reported in Multnomah County. But without additional information, we are unable to determine whether either of these offenses corresponds to the May 26 stabbing.\n\nAdditional findings from state-level statistics raise questions about the FBI data. In advance of this week's FBI release, the Arab American Institute collected UCR hate crime data from 27 states and the District of Columbia. Based on these state-level statistics, we predicted a significant nationwide increase reported in 2017 federal statistics. While the overall prediction was correct, much like in the case of Oregon, we found some notable discrepancies. According to the FBI data, just 48 incidents were reported in Maryland in 2017, but state-level statistics indicate a far greater total of 183. Similar disparities occurred in multiple states, including Indiana. While FBI statistics contained no data from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, according to state UCR data , the department reported 44 incidents in 2017.\n\nArkansas, But the problem of questionable or underreported data is not limited to any one state. Hawaii does not even participate in the national hate crime statistics program, and aside from Nevada, an additional 11 participating states had fewer than 10 agencies report hate crime incidents in 2017. Many of these states, such as Alabama Georgia and Mississippi , have dark histories of racial and ethnic violence but have not enacted sufficient legislation to address hate crime. If all states offered inclusive protections in their hate crime laws, required hate crime reporting and data collection from law enforcement, and authorized comprehensive police training on investigating and reporting hate crime incidents, maybe then we would have more accurate and representative federal statistics.\n\nFor more opinion...

In order to improve the data collected under the Hate Crime Statistics Act and published in the FBI's annual report, Congress should pass legislation that provides law enforcement with incentives for hate crime reporting and ties federal funding for state or local agencies to the provision of accurate data.\n\nUntil then, we will continue to highlight what the data show, and bring what's missing to light.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

He's openly speculating about replacing more members of his Cabinet , though so far has stopped short of executing the dismissals , leaving those aides in a career purgatory.\n\nAt an election night party at the White House, Trump left attendees guessing when he was spotted in a huddle with a potential replacement for his chief of staff, John Kelly, who himself stood awkwardly in a corner.\n\n\"Yes, he's pissed -- at damn near everyone,\" a White House official said, noting the mood in the Oval Office is darker than normal this week. After nearly a month straight of campaigning before adoring crowds, the applause has gone silent and the President has retreated. The tempest has led to rampant speculation inside the building about the fates of other senior staffers, some of whom are beginning to plan their exits.\n\nFriends of the President describe him as embittered by the election losses and troubled by the Mueller investigation. He met Monday with his lawyers to go over a series of written questions from the special counsel. Some of his longtime confidants are worried for his health, believing he's gained weight and looks unwell.\n\nThe President's fury at special counsel Robert Mueller burst into view again Thursday morning when he unleashed a string of angry tweets about the special counsel.\n\nThe timing for the President's fury couldn't be worse, considering the White House is heading into uncharted territory with Democrats assuming control of the House. Trump has told some advisers he's itching for the fight, believing it can provide him a political foil. Meanwhile, Mueller is inching closer to issuing his report on the Russia investigation.\n\n\"He knows it's winding up. So, it's unsettling,\" another person close to the President said.\n\nIt was a 24-word statement from the East Wing, where the first lady and her small staff work, about a presidential adviser that revealed how the dysfunction inside the White House is deeper and more tangled than previously known.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" a spokeswoman for Melania Trump said Tuesday afternoon.\n\nYet a day after that extraordinarily public rebuke, Mira Ricardel reported to work in the suite of offices in the National Security Council . After Ricardel was not even given the dignity of being named in the statement -- which referred to her only as \"she\" -- everyone in the West Wing was saying her name on Wednesday as anxiety intensified about what this latest feud would mean for the President's mood. Later Wednesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIn the last week, the President's frayed and fraught relationships have been laid bare for all to see: He's furious at Kelly for a Paris trip that ended in a public relations debacle. He's blaming his political advisers for losing the winning narrative of the midterms. And he was caught off guard by his wife's shot across the bow at one of the top advisers in the West Wing -- a sign that their private conversations clearly aren't functional.\n\nAfter his wife ordered the astounding statement to be released Tuesday afternoon, Trump was furious that what had been an internal staffing matter was now thrust into public view, leaving him to look like a bossed-around husband. The President's mood was dark and intense after what officials said was a blindsiding by aides who do not report to him.\n\nIf the sudden public interest in Ricardel, a behind-the-scenes operator, came as a surprise to the President, however, the underlying issues between her and the first lady's office were not new.\n\nThe Ricardel affair\n\nTwo sources said the first lady's office believed Ricardel accused members of their staff of inappropriate behavior as part of her trip to Africa last month, and asked for the White House counsel's office to investigate. The counsel's office declined, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's on top of concerns that Ricardel treated the trip dismissively and interfered with seating arrangements on the first lady's plane.\n\nIt became \"very personal\" to the first lady, one person familiar with the matter said, because she \"ran over Melania's staff.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the situation said the first lady and her aides sought to take issue with Ricardel through \"appropriate channels\" for weeks, including Kelly, but nothing came of their concerns.\n\nOther officials said tensions between the first lady and Ricardel stemmed from more than just the deputy national security adviser's handling of her Africa trip, noting friction had developed over how Ricardel treated administration staff in general.\n\n\"It's true there was infighting between Mira and the first lady's staff. And it's true that the Africa trip was a big part of the tension,\" one person familiar with the matter said. \"But the reason the first lady asked for Mira to be fired was that the first lady believed she was a bully.\"\n\nThe episode came against the backdrop of broader tensions between the National Security Council and others in the West Wing who have bristled at the way national security adviser John Bolton has run his team. One senior White House official said some had viewed Bolton as more interested in serving as a personal adviser to the President than in running the day-to-day operations of the National Security Council.\n\nRicardel was Bolton's highest-ranking aide at the National Security Council, and her gruff style matches that of her boss. Both have made enemies within the administration for appearing to discard opposing opinions while advancing their own.\n\nBut when the first lady's office delivered its broadside against his top aide, Bolton was 10,000 miles away in Singapore on a trip with Vice President Mike Pence. Working against a 12-hour time difference, aides traveling with the national security adviser made furious calls to their colleagues back in Washington in an attempt to figure out what was going on and potentially stall Ricardel's firing. Bolton kept his head down, an official traveling with him said, and did not mention the drama publicly.\n\nMost viewed Bolton's efforts to preserve Ricardel's job as futile and just delaying the inevitable, which Bolton apparently realized after seeing the drama unfold from half a world away. But Trump had surprised staffers in the past, and there had been some speculation earlier Wednesday that Ricardel would end up in another position in the administration outside the National Security Council. The first lady does not offer the President staffing advice on a regular basis, but one former White House official said that when she does, it carries significant weight.\n\nPervasive dysfunction\n\nJUST WATCHED Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Bolton, Kelly get into heated shouting match 02:12\n\nThe episode underscored the dysfunction that continues to pervade West Wing staffing matters almost two years into the Trump presidency. It lays bare the continued factionalism pitting aides against each other, often in convoluted and unpredictable configurations. And it reflects the deep unease within the White House as Democrats prepare to launch an assault of investigations into all manner of administration business.\n\nStaffers are still coming to grips with the new political reality while responding to a freshly enraged President. The prospects for wide-ranging investigations launched by the new Democratic-led House have concerned aides, who worry about legal bills and the potential impact on their careers.\n\nA slow-rolling staff shake-up is far from over, with Kelly again the subject of rampant speculation, despite his proclamation earlier this year he would remain at Trump's side until 2020 . While the President has strongly considered Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff and an ally of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, as a replacement for Kelly, there has been \"aggressive pushback\" against him, one senior official said. Some senior aides have even threatened to resign if Ayers is tapped for the job, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nAnother name discussed inside the White House as a potential Kelly successor is Johnny DeStefano, a senior aide to Trump who has quietly taken over a growing portfolio. DeStefano, a former top adviser to then-House Speaker John Boehner, has a solid relationship with the President and is generally well-liked among the staff.\n\nBut the President, who detests the narrative that his White House is chaotic, could ultimately decide not to ax Kelly -- if only to spite the press.\n\n\"The more the press writes that John Kelly is gone, the more Trump is emboldened to keep him just to prove them wrong,\" one source close to the White House said.\n\nFraught workplace\n\nTrump's foul mood, meanwhile, has rendered the White House a tumultuous workplace where outbursts are becoming more common. The decision to scrap a planned visit to an American cemetery in France because of rain over the weekend only deepened the President's conviction that he's being misserved by some of his staffers.\n\nTrump was advised by deputy chief of staff Zach Fuentes, a close aide of Kelly's, just ahead of his tense meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron that he would not be able to fly his helicopter to the Aisne-Marne cemetery, situated 50 miles from Paris. A drive, Fuentes said, would cause traffic havoc around Paris, and would also make Trump late to the event -- something he detests.\n\nSome aides told the President that he should not worry about missing the event because he had other opportunities to pay respects on the trip, including another cemetery visit scheduled for the following day, according to people familiar with the conversations. Neither they nor the President expected the massive backlash the decision prompted, which sank in over the course of the following hours. As he watched the onslaught of headlines criticizing him for skipping the trip with no backup plan, the President took his anger out on Fuentes personally.\n\nWhiling away the empty hours at the US ambassador's residence in Paris, Trump complained the entire trip to France was poorly conceived and executed, according to people familiar with the matter. He'd long discovered the events on Sunday would not include a grand military parade like the one he witnessed a year ago on Bastille Day, leading him to wonder what the point of the trip was.\n\nInstead, Trump grumbled that he was kept away from the action back home, where election recounts were getting underway in key Senate and governors' races. With nothing to do for six hours in the middle of the afternoon, Trump demanded updates on the races and details about the state officials responsible for the counting.\n\nAs they have on previous foreign swings, staffers had ensured that televisions inside the ambassador's residence -- the second empire H\u00f4tel de Pontalba on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 -- had Fox News available for the President's viewing. And they worked to set up phone calls with officials back home in the hopes of keeping him occupied.\n\nA brewing presidential tempest\n\nThe clouds started gathering on election night, people familiar with the matter said. Surrounded by his wealthy friends, three oldest children and select senior staffers, Trump entered a White House watch party a week ago in a cheerful mood. But as he huddled over pizza and tiny hotdogs with some of his billionaire friends, the President began to see things shift. His mood went south. And the blame began flying.\n\nHe did everything his political team asked him to do, Trump protested to his friends. He did his job while others clearly had not.\n\nKelly, the beleaguered chief of staff, attended early in the evening with his wife. Long viewed by the President as lacking political acumen, Kelly appeared out of his realm, according to two sources familiar with the scene. He remained in a corner sipping a drink with his deputy.\n\nAn hour before midnight, the President -- visibly annoyed -- announced he was done. The rooms, which had been set up with large televisions for viewing results, began to empty. As attendees began trickling out, some saw an intriguing sight.\n\nHuddled in a corner, intense in conversation, were the President, his wife and Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, who has been speculated about as a leading contender to replace Kelly.\n\nTo those still there who saw, and others who later heard about it, it was a moment the President appeared to stage.", "(CNN) Retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake said Wednesday that he will not vote to confirm the Trump administration's judicial nominees on the Senate floor or advance them in the Senate Judiciary Committee if legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller does not receive a Senate floor vote.\n\nFlake made the new judicial threat after he and Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, unsuccessfully attempted to force a Senate vote on the special counsel legislation Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell objected to the request for a vote from Flake.\n\nBut the Arizona Republican's threats on judicial nominees could complicate matters in the Judiciary Committee, where Republicans have an 11-10 majority. There are currently 21 judicial nominees pending in the committee and 32 who are awaiting a floor vote, Flake said.\n\n\"We have been told that the bill that Sen. Coons and I will move to bring up shortly is not necessary, as there have been no indications that the independence of Mr. Mueller's investigation is in jeopardy,\" Flake said. \"That may have been an arguable position before last week. But it is not arguable anymore.\"\n\nFlake and a handful of other Republican senators, such as Susan Collins of Maine, have said they think the legislation to protect the special counsel is necessary after President Donald Trump fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and replaced him with acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has been openly critical of the Mueller probe.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

If it were no one could have gone to the press conference.\"\n\nBoutrous separately brought up evidence that hadn't been available when CNN filed its suit: A fundraising email that the Trump campaign sent Wednesday.\n\nThe email touted the decision to revoke Acosta's credentials and attacked CNN for what it called its \"liberal bias.\" Boutrous said that by grouping that all together in the same breath, the email made it clear that it was Acosta's coverage and not his conduct at a press conference that triggered the revocation of his press pass.\n\nKelly asked CNN's lawyers to state the company's position regarding the original White House accusation that Acosta placed his hands a White House intern as she tried to grab a microphone out of his hand.\n\n\"It's absolutely false,\" Boutrous said.\n\nBoutrous also pointed out that Trump administration never mentioned that accusation against Acosta in the 28-page brief that Justice Department lawyers filed with the court earlier on Wednesday.\n\n\"They've abandoned that\" claim, Boutrous said.\n\nIn his first question in a back and forth with the government, Kelly asked Burnham to clear up the government's shifting rationale for revoking Acosta's pass.\n\n\"Why don't you set me straight,\" Kelly said. \"Let me know what was the reason and address this issue of whether the government's reason has changed over time.\"\n\n\"There doesn't need to be a reason because there's no First Amendment protection and the President has broad discretion,\" Burnham said.\n\nStill, Burnham called the White House's stated reasonings \"pretty consistent throughout,\" and walked through a series of statements that the administration has made \u2014 from Trump's first comments at the press conference to Sanders' tweets announcing the revocation to the official statement put out Tuesday after CNN filed its suit.\n\nBurnham said Sanders' claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched a White House intern was not a part of their legal argument.\n\n\"We're not relying on that here and I don't think the White House is relying on that here,\" Burnham said.\n\nBurnham said that it would be perfectly legal for the White House to revoke a journalist's credentials if it didn't agree with their reporting.\n\nHe made the assertion under questioning from Kelly, who asked him to state the administration's position in this hypothetical situation.\n\nThe judge asked if the White House could essentially tell any individual journalist, \"we don't like your reporting, so we're pulling your hard pass.\" Burnham replied, \"as a matter of law... yes.\"\n\nPressed again by the judge on Sanders' claim that Acosta had inappropriately touched the intern, Burnham said \"we don't have a position\" on that.\n\n\"The one consistent explanation,\" Burnham said, \"is disorder at the press conference.\"\n\nBurnham contended that revoking Acosta's hard pass was not \"viewpoint discrimination\" \u2014 part of a legal threshold for a First Amendment claim.\n\n\"A single journalist's attempt to monopolize a press conference is not a viewpoint and revoking a hard pass in response to that is not viewpoint discrimination,\" Burnham said.\n\nKelly tried to press for details about how Acosta's pass came to be revoked, asking Burnham who made the actual decision.\n\nBurnham said he didn't have any information beyond what had been filed in court documents: that the revocation was first announced by Sanders on November 7 and then \"ratified\" by Trump the next day.\n\n\"Do you have any information to suggest that it was anyone other than Ms. Sanders that made the decision?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\"No, not that I'm offering today. I'm not denying it but I don't know anything beyond what's been filed,\" Burnham said.\n\nLater, Burnham argued that revoking Acosta's press pass does not infringe on his First Amendment rights because he can still call White House staffers for interviews or \"catch them on their way out\" of the building.\n\n\"I think the harm to the network is very small,\" Burnham said.\n\n\"Their cameras are still in there,\" he added.\n\nBurnham said CNN had made an \"odd First Amendment injury\" claim and suggested that Acosta could do his job \"just as effectively\" watching the President's appearances piped into a studio on CNN.\n\n\"The President never has to speak to Mr. Acosta again,\" Burnham said. \"The President never has to give an interview to Mr. Acosta. And the President never has to call on Mr. Acosta at a press conference.\"\n\n\"To be in a room where he has no right to speak... this seems to me like an odd First Amendment injury that we're talking about,\" Burnham said.\n\nBoutrous, the CNN attorney, fired back on rebuttal.\n\n\"That's not how reporters break stories. It's simply a fundamental misconception of journalism,\" Boutrous said, adding how unscheduled gaggles and source meetings throughout the White House amounted to \"invaluable access.\"\n\nIn a legal filing by the Justice Department on Wednesday, the White House asserted that it has \"broad discretion\" to pick and choose which journalists are given a permanent pass to cover it.\n\nThat position is a sharp break with decades of tradition. Historically both Republican and Democratic administrations have had a permissive approach to press access, providing credentials both to big news organizations like CNN and obscure and fringe outlets.\n\nAcosta's suspension -\u2014 which took effect one week ago \u2014 is an unprecedented step. Journalism advocates say it could have a chilling effect on news coverage.\n\nCNN and Acosta's lawsuit was filed on Tuesday morning, nearly one week after Acosta was banned.\n\nBefore the hearing began, CNN's lawyers said the case hinges on Acosta and CNN's First Amendment rights; the shifting rationales behind the ban; and the administration's failure to follow the federal regulations that pertain to press passes, an alleged violation of Fifth Amendment rights. The lawsuit asserts that this ban is really about Trump's dislike of Acosta.\n\nThe \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\" CNN's lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn addition to the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that CNN is seeking at the hearing, CNN and Acosta are also seeking what's known as \"permanent relief.\" The lawsuit asks the judge to determine that Trump's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" This could protect other reporters against similar actions in the future.\n\n\"If the press is not free to cover the news because its reporter is unjustly denied access, it is not free,\" former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson said in a declaration supporting CNN that was filed with the court on Tuesday. \"And if denying access to a reporter an organization has chosen to represent it -- in effect asserting the president's right to take that choice away from a news organization and make it himself -- is permitted, then the press is not free.\"\n\nTed Olson, a Republican heavyweight who successfully argued for George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, is representing CNN, along with Boutrous \u2014 himself another prominent attorney \u2014 and the network's chief counsel, David Vigilante.\n\nOlson said Tuesday that while it was Acosta whose press pass was suspended this time, \"this could happen to any journalist by any politician.\"\n\nHe spoke forcefully against Trump's action. \"The White House cannot get away with this,\" Olson said.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Sources say that Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, is in the running to replace Kelly.", "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy is insufficiently resourced and the US runs the risk of a military defeat by China or Russia, according to a report by a congressionally mandated panel of bipartisan experts that was released Wednesday.\n\nThe warning comes as the Trump administration is weighing a possible cut to the defense budget following a major boost in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.\n\nWhile the report applauds the administration for focusing more on Russia and China as opposed to counterterrorism missions in places like the Middle East, it slams the administration's strategy for not explaining how the goals of that strategy will be met.\n\n\"The (National Defense Strategy) too often rests on questionable assumptions and weak analysis, and it leaves unanswered critical questions regarding how the United States will meet the challenges of a more dangerous world,\" the report says, criticizing the lack of investment and organizational changes to reinforce the new strategy.\n\n\"The Commission assesses unequivocally that the NDS is not adequately resourced,\" the report says, while adding that \"available resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy's ambitious goals, including that of ensuring that DOD can defeat a major power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously.\"\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump called for the firing of Broward County Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes and suggested without evidence that Republicans don't win elections \"because of potentially illegal votes\" during an interview on Wednesday.\n\n\"You look at her past, she's a disaster,\" Trump told the Daily Caller , referring to Snipes, adding, \"I won Florida and, you remember? That area, Broward, didn't come in. ... You can only put in so many votes, although she may change that system.\"\n\nHe later added, \"Oh, she should have been removed -- I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up.\"\n\nSnipes, a Democrat, has been the target of repeated and direct attacks from Republicans throughout the Sunshine State as Florida's Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner races are recounted following the midterm elections earlier this month.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush, who first appointed Snipes to the post, called for her to step down on Monday. Gov. Rick Scott, whose Senate race is central to the recount, sued her and has used her as a foil for days. And dozens of Trump supporters protested outside of Snipes' office in Broward County, some holding signs labeling her the \"Supervisor of Corruption.\"\n\nSnipes has kept a low profile through much of it, but even Democrats in Florida admit the criticism is not entirely without reason: Broward County's elections office has been hampered by controversies for years and Snipes has been plagued by questions of bias for much of her tenure.\n\nSnipes hinted Tuesday that she may not be in the job very long, saying it was \"hard to rule out race\" as a factor in the criticism being lobbed at her.\n\n\"It is time to move on, to let someone else\" do the job, Snipes said. When a reporter followed on whether she will step down, the election official backed off slightly.\n\n\"Well, I haven't finalized that. I'll just check with my family. They'll tell me what I'm doing,\" she said.\n\nIn his interview on Wednesday, the President also suggested, without evidence, that voter fraud was taking place.\n\n\"The Republicans don't win and that's because of potentially illegal votes,\" Trump said. \"When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It's really a disgrace what's going on.\"\n\nThere have been no reports of the kind of fraud the President described.\n\n\"If you buy a box of cereal -- you have a voter ID,\" Trump continued, appearing to reference his previous argument that identification is required for buying groceries. There is no such requirement except for purchases of alcohol and cigarettes.\n\n\"They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing,\" he continued.\n\nThe President has repeatedly warned against \"illegal voting\" during his tenure in office, dredging up a familiar trope he popularized during the 2016 presidential election. There is well-established evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare\n\nFor example, stealing someone's identity to vote is less likely than being struck by lightning, as the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law put it.", "New York (CNN Business) Canopy Growth (CGC) CEO Bruce Linton wants investors to take the long view on pot.\n\nShares of the Canadian cannabis company slumped Wednesday following an underwhelming earnings report.

Pero no es probable que el derroche vaya a acabar muy pronto.\n\nEl Banco de Jap\u00f3n ha acumulado la mayor parte de las enormes reservas de activos desde que su gobernador, Haruhiko Kuroda, se embarc\u00f3 en un plan sin precedentes en 2013 para comprar una gran cantidad de bonos del gobierno. La meta era bajar las tasas de inter\u00e9s, animando a los consumidores y a los negocios a gastar m\u00e1s dinero.\n\nLa medida fue similar a los extraordinarios programas de alivio monetario que lanzaron Estados Unidos y Europa despu\u00e9s de la crisis financiera global. Pero el de Jap\u00f3n es mucho m\u00e1s grande en escala en relaci\u00f3n al tama\u00f1o de su econom\u00eda.\n\nLos bienes de la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos est\u00e1n en cerca de un quinto del tama\u00f1o del PIB de Estados Unidos, y los del Banco Central Europeo est\u00e1n en cerca del 40% de la econom\u00eda de la eurozona.\n\nLa Reserva Federal anunci\u00f3 el cese del gasto de bonos en 2014 y est\u00e1 ahora aumentando las tasas de intereses y el Banco Central Europeo para su programa el pr\u00f3ximo mes. Pero el exceso del Banco de Jap\u00f3n parece no tener un final a la vista.\n\nResultados mezclados\n\nJap\u00f3n disfrut\u00f3 recientemente de su racha m\u00e1s larga de crecimiento econ\u00f3mico en d\u00e9cadas, pero la econom\u00eda ha empezado a balbucear este a\u00f1o. Se encogi\u00f3 a un \u00edndice anual de 1,2% en el tercer trimestre, seg\u00fan informaci\u00f3n del gobierno publicada el mi\u00e9rcoles.\n\nA pesar de las compras masivas de activos del banco central y otras pol\u00edticas inusuales como tasas de inter\u00e9s negativas, la inflaci\u00f3n se ha mantenido obstinadamente por debajo del objetivo del banco de 2%. Kuroda ha dicho que el banco no considerar\u00e1 finalizar el esfuerzo de los est\u00edmulos prolongados hasta que se alcance la meta.\n\nEstrategia riesgosa\n\nPero esa puede ser una tarea imposible, y continuar el programa de est\u00edmulos de manera indefinida puede tener riesgos significativos.\n\n\u201cHay l\u00edmites sobre cu\u00e1ntos activos puede comprar el Banco de Jap\u00f3n\u201d, dijo Marcel Thieliant, un economista de la firma de investigaci\u00f3n japonesa Capital Economics, debido a la gran cantidad de que sus activos est\u00e1n en bonos del gobierno japon\u00e9s, de los cuales hay una oferta limitada.\n\nEste ya ha disminuido \u201csignificativamente\u201d las compras de bienes y al parecer continuar\u00e1 haci\u00e9ndolo, seg\u00fan Thieliant. No es porque el plan est\u00e9 teniendo \u00e9xito, dice \u00e9l, sino porque funcionarios del banco central est\u00e1n preocupados porque sus pol\u00edticas est\u00e9n haciendo que los bancos comerciales tengan ganancias. Las tasas de inter\u00e9s negativas han reducido sus m\u00e1rgenes, y las enormes compras de activos han matado efectivamente las operaciones regulares en el mercado de bonos, que alguna vez fue lucrativo.\n\nLa pol\u00edtica monetaria ultra flexible del Banco de Jap\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n lo deja con poco poder para ayudar a apuntalar la econom\u00eda en caso de otra gran crisis.", "Washington (CNN) While President Donald Trump has been relatively silent on the threat posed by what he had termed an \"invasion\" of migrants heading toward the southern border prior to the midterm elections, Defense Secretary James Mattis traveled to Texas on Wednesday with a simple message for US troops deployed to the area: Ignore the news and focus on the mission at hand.\n\nHe also made it clear that their mission will not involve fending off a hoard of dangerous migrants as Trump insisted in his pre-election rhetoric.\n\nAccompanied by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, Mattis appeared to take the lead when addressing troops at Donna Base Camp, using the opportunity to encourage those present to block out any outside noise related to politics, and he emphasized the importance of serving as \"confidence builders\" for Border Patrol officers.\n\n\"Now, there's all sorts of stuff in the news, and that sort of thing. You just concentrate on what your company commander, your battalion commander tells you. Because if you read all that stuff, you know, you'll go nuts,\" Mattis said. \"You know what your mission is here. You've had to deploy on short notice to a nontraditional location and do your jobs. So you focus on doing that.\"\n\n\"We were asked by the secretary, due to the number of people coming this way, to back them up. What does that mean? It means that her people do all the work, but we're standing behind them as a confidence builder,\" he added, referring to the request from the Department of Homeland Security to provide support.\n\nWhile touring the base camp, Mattis and Nielsen saw the living conditions of the troops and were given a briefing on the camp's laundry service.\n\nThey also spoke to several service members about their deployment experience thus far, including one woman who told Mattis that her husband was serving overseas and their young child was being cared for by the grandparents.\n\nA stark contrast\n\nThe visit by Mattis and Nielsen stands in stark contrast to Trump's relative silence in recent days on the migrants traveling to the US from Central America, after characterizing their approach as an \"invasion\" prior to the midterm elections.\n\nSince November 6, Election Day, Trump hasn't mentioned the so-called caravan in a tweet. He has used the word \"border\" a single time -- in a tweet on Friday in which he included a link to a \"Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States\" that said, essentially, that he was trying to push people entering the country illegally to specified ports of entry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mattis sought to distance the US military from the criticism that the President used the deployment to rev up his base prior to the election, emphasizing that the border mission is not unique in a historical context.\n\n\"There's nothing new under the sun,\" he said.\n\n\"I think many of you are aware that President Wilson 100 years ago, a little over a 100 years ago, deployed the US Army to the Southwest border. That's over a century ago. The threat then was Pancho Villa's troops, a revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States, New Mexico, in 1916 and there's a more recent history of DoD support on the border: It spans four administrations and both political parties,\" Mattis added.\n\nHe defended the legitimacy of the mission, particularly the task of backing up Border Patrol officers ahead of the migrants' arrival.\n\n\"We determined the missions as absolutely legal and this was also reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers. It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,\" Mattis told reporters prior to visiting the base camp.\n\nWhile the troops in Texas have largely been tasked with reinforcing border crossing points, largely with concertina wire, Mattis suggested that the deployment serves as a valuable training opportunity.\n\nWhen one service member said they were planning a field exercise when they got the call to deploy to the border, Mattis laughed before saying: \"We just gave you the best field training exercise possible.\"\n\nBut when asked about the long and short term plans for the operation, Mattis was able to offer few details.\n\n\"Short term right now, get the obstacles in so that the border patrolmen can do what they've got to do ... longer term, it's somewhat to be determined,\" he said before encouraging troops to \"keep the faith in each other, listen to your NCOs and you do what your officers tell you.\"\n\nNielsen under fire\n\nWhile Mattis repeatedly made clear that the border operation is being led by DHS, Nielsen, for the most part, appeared to take on a secondary role as the two Cabinet secretaries toured the base camp and engaged with troops, seeming to take her cues from Mattis before chiming in.\n\nWhen she did speak, Nielsen focused her on thanking the troops for their service and partnership in the border operation.\n\n\"We thank you for your partnership always. We greatly, greatly appreciate it,\" she said. \"We are right there with you, we know you're with us and we greatly appreciate it. So thank you, each and every one of you.\"\n\nNielsen's trip to the border comes amid indications that she could potentially be out of a job soon.\n\nTrump could ask Nielsen to resign in the coming days, multiple officials familiar with the matter predicted, describing the President's continued frustration at her handling of his signature issue: immigration and border security.\n\nMattis has faced a steady wave of rumors in recent months suggesting he too could be replaced but his name has not been mentioned lately as reports circulate that the President has been eyeing potential replacements for several senior positions in his administration -- both inside the West Wing and across the Cabinet.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEstas fotos muestran el antes y el despu\u00e9s del paso del fuego\n\nYa es el m\u00e1s destructor de la historia del estado\n\n(CNN) - Las im\u00e1genes de antes y despu\u00e9s ayudan a mostrar la devastaci\u00f3n que el incendio Camp tuvo en Paradise, California.\n\nEl incendio, m\u00e1s grande que el tama\u00f1o de Atlanta, solo est\u00e1 contenido m\u00ednimamente, pero ya es el m\u00e1s letal y destructivo de la historia del estado. 42 personas han muerto y m\u00e1s de 6.500 casas se han incendiado.\n\nMIRA: La impactante foto de lo que qued\u00f3 de la casa de Miley Cyrus y Liam Hemsworth tras incendios en California\n\nEl d\u00eda en que se desat\u00f3 el fuego fue como cualquier otro para Robert Hoffman.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) in the Senate and by Reps. Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Thomas Suozzi (D-NY) in the House, condemns the \"gross human rights violations of ethnic Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, and calling for an end to arbitrary detention, torture, and harassment of these communities inside and outside China.\" Both House and Senate bills have a broad swath of bipartisan cosponsors.\n\nAs many as 1 million of the minority Muslim population are believed to have been forced by the Chinese government into \"re-education camps\" in the Xinjiang province, according to a US congress report.\n\nFormer detainees say they were forced to endure intensive \"brain washing\" sessions including close study of Communist Party propaganda. The Chinese government has defended these camps as a means of fighting what they claim is a rising tide of extremism in Xinjiang.\n\n\"The United States must hold accountable officials in the Chinese government and Communist Party responsible for gross violations of human rights and possible crimes against humanity, including the internment in 'political reeducation' camps of as many as a million

Sanders critic\u00f3 a Acosta por, seg\u00fan ella, actuar de manera poco profesional y acaparar el micr\u00f3fono en la conferencia de prensa la semana pasada. Pero ella no se refiri\u00f3 a los problemas legales que se nombran en la demanda de CNN.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pas\u00f3 en la conferencia de prensa?\n\nAcosta es uno de los reporteros m\u00e1s agresivos en criticar a Trump, algo que ha hecho que gane tantos fan\u00e1ticos as\u00ed como cr\u00edticos. Trump le llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n durante la conferencia de prensa del 7 de noviembre. Ambos se enfrentaron por la ret\u00f3rica de Trump sobre la migraci\u00f3n, y luego Acosta trat\u00f3 de cambiar el tema y hacerle una tercera pregunta sobre la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial Robert Mueller. Cuando el presidente le dio la palabra a otro reportero, una becaria de la Casa Blanca fue a tomar el micr\u00f3fono que Acosta ten\u00eda, pero Acosta se rehus\u00f3 a entregarlo inmediatamente. \u00c9l hizo su pregunta y luego le dio el micr\u00f3fono a la becaria.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 dijo la Casa Blanca originalmente?\n\nEn un comunicado anunciando la suspensi\u00f3n del pase de prensa de Acosta, Sanders dijo que el gobierno \u201cnunca tolerar\u00e1 que un reportero ponga sus manos sobre una joven que solo trata de hacer su trabajo como becaria de la Casa Blanca\u201d. Pero el video del evento muestra que Acosta no la maltrat\u00f3. \u00c9l dijo incluso \u201cperd\u00f3n, se\u00f1ora\u201d, cuando la joven fue por el micr\u00f3fono.\n\nPara apoyar su razonamiento, Sanders tuite\u00f3 un video distorsionado de la conferencia de prensa que no muestra la situaci\u00f3n completa. El mismo video fue publicado por una personalidad de InfoWars dos horas despu\u00e9s. InfoWars es medio de comunicaci\u00f3n radical de extrema derecha con una historia de publicar contenido lleno de odio y teor\u00edas de la conspiraci\u00f3n.\n\nDos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, el propio Trump dud\u00f3 del razonamiento de Sanders: \u00e9l dijo que Acosta \u201cno fue amable con esa joven\u201d, pero, \u201cno lo suspendo porque haya sido excesivo, ya saben, horrible\u201d. Luego sigui\u00f3 quej\u00e1ndose sobre el comportamiento de Acosta en general.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo ha cambiado el razonamiento de la Casa Blanca?\n\nSanders ya no dice que Acosta puso sus manos sobre la becaria. En un comunicado del martes, la secretaria de Prensa dijo que \u201cf\u00edsicamente se rehus\u00f3 a entregar\u201d el micr\u00f3fono. Por supuesto, los reporteros frecuentemente tratan de hacer preguntas de seguimiento en ruedas de prensa.\n\nSanders continu\u00f3 diciendo que \u201cesta no es la primera vez que este reportero se ha rehusado inapropiadamente a ceder a otros reporteros\u201d. Y agreg\u00f3: \u201cSi no hay control de este tipo de comportamientos, esto impide la habilidad del presidente, del personal de la Casa Blanca, y miembros de los medios, llevar a cabo su trabajo\u201d.\n\nEste es, aparentemente, un nuevo razonamiento de por qu\u00e9 le revocaron el pase de prensa a Acosta.\n\nMira en este video: \"No sea grosero\", Trump manda callar a periodista de CNN\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 dicen los abogados de CNN?\n\n\u201cLos periodistas no pueden ser silenciados, censurados o intimidados.

Los abogados de la industria concuerdan. George Freeman, jefe del Media Law Resource Center, dijo que \u201cla retaliaci\u00f3n del presidente contra Acosta no fue por una raz\u00f3n apropiada, por no hablar de una raz\u00f3n convincente requerida constitucionalmente\u201d.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo aplica a este caso la Primera Enmienda?\n\nLa demanda de CNN dice que \u201cla deducci\u00f3n razonable de la conducta de los acusados es que han revocado las credenciales de Acosta como una forma de discriminaci\u00f3n basada en el punto de vista y en represalia por el ejercicio de la actividad protegida de la Primera Enmienda por parte de los demandantes\".\n\nSeg\u00fan el analista legal de CNN Paul Callan, \u201cla Primera Enmienda es muy clara en esto, que la prensa tiene el derecho legal de reportar y expresar las opiniones sobre la conducta del presidente\u201d.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 piden CNN y Acosta?\n\nUna soluci\u00f3n tanto a corto como a lago plazo. Inmediatamente CNN quiere que un juez emita una orden de restricci\u00f3n temporal y un requerimiento para que el acceso de Acosta a la Casa Blanca sea restaurado.\n\nLa cadena tambi\u00e9n quiere que un juez falle que la acci\u00f3n la Casa Blanca fue inconstitucional y que no puede volver a pasar.\n\n\u201cUna restricci\u00f3n temporal es una medida a corto plazo que tendr\u00e1 efecto hasta que, por ejemplo, un requerimiento preliminar sea emitido\u201d, dijo Jonathan Peters, profesor de leyes en la Universidad de Georgia.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con los otros reporteros de CNN?\n\nLa suspensi\u00f3n solo aplica a Acosta. Todos los dem\u00e1s reporteros de CNN, productores y fotoperiodistas asignados a cubrir la Casa Blanca siguen trabajado desde sus lugares asignados.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo fallar\u00e1 el juez de este caso?\n\nEl juez Timothy J.

Clara Hendrickson is a research analyst in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.\n\nMore than a year ago, the leaders of scores of up-and-coming cities across America's Heartland entered Amazon's HQ2 contest, embracing the idea that the e-commerce giant might choose a mid-size city or metropolis in the Rust Belt, like Detroit or Columbus, for its second headquarters location.\n\nAlas, we all should have known better. On Tuesday, Amazon officially announced its decision to split its award of 50,000 headquarters jobs \u2014 not to one up-and-coming city in the Midwest \u2014 but between Long Island City in Queens, New York and Crystal City, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. (The company also plans to create around 5,000 jobs in Nashville.)\n\nSo much for the Rust Belt uplift story, one that might help knit a divided country together through mid-market, Midwestern economic development.\n\nWhich raises the real story here: Amazon's decision to invest heavily in two preexisting \"superstar\" cities perfectly epitomizes one of the most troubling aspects of digital economies: their strong tendency to concentrate people and investment in a very few well-educated, tech-rich hubs that have, in recent decades, continued to pull away from the rest of the country on basic measures of prosperity.\n\nScholars for years have suspected that tech might alter the hierarchy of cities. Economist Elisa Giannone recently found that beginning in the 1980s the wages of cities \u2014 after converging for generations \u2014 had begun to diverge as tech began to inordinately reward dense clusters of highly skilled workers and firms. Likewise, research at Brookings has shown that a short list of highly digital, often coastal, tech hubs are pulling farther away from the pack on measures of growth and income, concentrating more of the nation's tech activity and talent.\n\nIn short, the \"digitalization of everything\" is exacerbating the unevenness of America's economic landscape and making it increasingly likely that new tech headquarters go not to new places, but to the same places. What just happened proves the point.\n\nThis matters because the widening gap between \"superstar\" cities and the places left behind by economic transformation is creating a troubling panorama of untapped potential and frustration. On the one hand, the drift of scores of promising cities filled with talented people, outstanding institutions and underutilized infrastructure mean that America is not fully delivering on its promise for economic fulfillment. On the other hand, whole swaths of the country that have fallen behind in a changing economy are marked by political discontent that has contributed to the nation's populist backlash and widening social divides.\n\nThe nation as a whole will need to push back against today's widening regional gaps with specific, intentional action.\n\nWhat might such action look like? For starters, it might begin by implementing policies that limit the kind of locational sweepstakes that impelled hundreds of places to ante up billions of collective dollars of business relocation subsidies in order to attract Amazon. One idea we endorse in a forthcoming paper is a 100% federal tax on every dollar in state and local tax incentives directed toward a specific company.\n\nAt the same time, local governments \u2014 ideally supported by Congress \u2014 should also take this moment to double down on focused initiatives that emphasize training workers with digital skills, while venture capitalists should ensure more local startups outside the coasts have access to the capital they need to grow. The federal government, for its part, should get serious about helping the Heartland and offer grants to 10 or so competitively selected, mid-sized business centers that show promise of emerging as regional \"growth poles\" that will ensure more people reside near top-quality jobs and opportunity.\n\nTo be sure, such an agenda would be an undeniably heavy lift for today's divided Congress. And yet, for all that, a growing chorus of policymakers and thought-leaders is increasingly calling for such action.\n\nIndeed, even those who see the concentration of economic activity in cities like San Francisco, Boston and New York as a good thing for the national economy may soon find themselves calling for a more geographically balanced national economy. After all, concentrating economic growth in just a few prosperous cities works as a national growth stance only up to a point. Eventually, even today's winners will be left to grapple with the side effects, like traffic congestion and expensive housing, while others will continue to struggle with too little growth and hope.\n\nMany hoped that Amazon would bring economic opportunity to the places left behind in the shift from a manufacturing economy to a tech economy. Now that it's clear that will not likely happen by itself, it is time for policymakers and concerned citizens to ensure that the current market forces don't deepen the economic and political divides between the places that have benefitted from the tech revolution and those it has left behind.", "New York (CNN Business) Bloomingdale's thinks you might want a dishwasher or a new fridge with your designer bag this holiday.\n\nThe high-end department store announced a partnership with LG for a dedicated appliance section at its flagship in Manhattan.\n\nBeginning next week, the store will sell a premium version of LG TVs, refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers and washer-dryers. It's the first time that Bloomingdale's, owned by Macy's ( M ), will offer major appliances or TVs.\n\nBloomingdale's is following a well-worn retail path into the appliance business.\n\nBest Buy ( BBY ), Home Depot ( HD ), and Lowe's ( LOW ) have increased their selection in recent years to capitalize on the collapse of Sears, which once dominated the appliance game, and grow their big-ticket sales.\n\nThe strategy has worked well for Best Buy. Appliances now account for about 10% of its overall business, and sales have been growing for seven straight years.\n\nDepartment store peer JCPenney ( JCP ) also saw an opportunity to start selling appliances in 2016 under former CEO Marvin Ellison, a home improvement veteran who now runs Lowe's. Penney now has appliance showrooms at more than 600 stores.\n\nBloomingdale's is not trying to take advantage of the market Sears left behind, though. Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette said on Wednesday that the company has \"very little customer overlap with Sears.\"\n\nInstead, Bloomingdale's is trying expand its home furnishing assortment starting in one store. If the test works, Bloomingdale's may roll it out to more stores.\n\nThe plan drew mixed reaction on Wednesday.\n\nChristina Boni, an analyst at Moody's, said Bloomingdale's new LG store-within-a store will \"provide a unique presentation when combined with its existing home offerings.\"\n\nBut Tim Barrett from Euromonitor doubts that the average Bloomingdale's shopper would think to go to the store for appliances.\n\nHe is skeptical that the initiative will drive new customers.\n\n\"Those that have been proactively executing this strategy for years are most likely to reap the benefits, not retailers that are just reacting to failures as they occur.\"\n\nMark Cohen, director of retail studies at the Columbia Business School, put it another way.\n\n\"Bloomingdale's entering the major appliance business makes absolutely no sense,\" he said. Cohen believes the company doesn't have the expertise or the experience necessary to make money in the complex world of selling appliances.", "New York (CNN Business) JCPenney could be in danger of following Sears into bankruptcy.\n\nThe longtime department store rivals have made similar missteps and could share a similar fate.\n\nLike Sears, JCPenney hasn't been profitable since 2010. It posted $3.9 billion in losses since then and has been closing stores in an an attempt to stanch the bleeding. And like Sears, it has run up debt while its credit rating has sunk deep into junk territory.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting another money losing quarter when the company reports earnings on Thursday.\n\nThat's not a surprise. Analysts expect losses to go on for years.\n\nThe company's executive turmoil, along with inventory and supply chain struggles, have raised concerns by outside observers.\n\nJCPenney ( JCP ) is in a quiet period ahead of Thursday's quarterly report and not able to comment for this story.\n\nDespite its problems, some opportunities could keep JCPenney out of bankruptcy court for a while, at least.\n\nBecause its near-term debt payments are relatively modest -- about $50 million is due next year, and $100 million in 2020 -- it has some time.\n\nBut not much. An estimated $2.1 billion in payments comes due in 2023, and that has credit rating agencies and analysts worried.\n\nIt also could benefit from Sears' demise\n\nAn analysis by Cowen and Co. found that 56% of Sears shoppers also shop at JCPenney, the highest overlap of any of the traditional department store chains.\n\nThe shoppers share similar demographics, according to research by Coresight Research and Cowen. For example, the average age of a Sears shopper was nearly 50, according to Coresight. At Penney, it's just over 48.\n\nSears will be closing hundreds of stores and its customers will be looking for places to shop.\n\nSo some experts say there's still a chance that JCPenney can avoid bankruptcy. They point to department store chains like Macy's ( M ) and Kohl's ( KSS ) which have been able to turn around and become profitable, despite changing shoppers' tastes. And Penney has improved its online sales, which rose more than 10% last year.\n\n\"I do think there is a place for traditional department stores. There's a chance they can still be relevant.

Pero debido al gran alboroto medi\u00e1tico, los funcionarios de Colombia y Cartagena ten\u00edan problemas con que el evento mostrara a Cartagena como una ciudad de prostituci\u00f3n\u201d, le dijo el representante de Sex Island a CNN en Espa\u00f1ol a trav\u00e9s de un mensaje de texto.\n\n\u201cAs\u00ed que nos movimos a otra isla de nuestra propiedad que est\u00e1 en el Caribe\u201d, dijo el portavoz de la fiesta.\n\nCNN en Espa\u00f1ol se ha intentado comunicar con la Alcald\u00eda de Cartagena para obtener un comentario al respecto, pero no ha recibido una respuesta hasta el momento.\n\nA mediados de octubre, el alcalde de Cartagena (e) Pedrito Pereira protest\u00f3 contra este evento y dijo que este promov\u00eda \u201cel turismo sexual\" en la ciudad por lo que asegur\u00f3 enviar\u00eda una nota formal a la Fiscal\u00eda para que investigara los hechos.\n\nY por esa amenaza los organizadores decidieron cambiar el lugar la fiesta.\n\n\u201cEntonces, \u00bfcambiaron el evento de lugar a otro pa\u00eds debido a las amenazas de las autoridades colombianas por investigarlos?\u201d, pregunt\u00f3 CNN.\n\n\u201cS\u00ed. Es correcto\u201d, respondi\u00f3 el portavoz de la fiesta.\n\nExplotaci\u00f3n sexual y trata de personas\n\nEl evento que se promociona es una fiesta privada en la que se permite el consumo de drogas y alcohol ilimitado e invita a los asistentes a tener \u201csexo ilimitado\u201d con al menos 100 mujeres. Este es uno de los cambios que se hace el nuevo evento, pues hace unos meses hab\u00eda cupo para 30 invitados y participaban 60 mujeres.\n\n\"No vendemos drogas a nuestros clientes\", dijo el portavoz del evento. \"Pero si ellos usan drogas en nuestros eventos, no tenemos problema\".\n\nPero la fiesta, que ya hab\u00eda causado pol\u00e9mica en 2017, prendi\u00f3 las alarmas de las autoridades de Cartagena, una ciudad azotada por la prostituci\u00f3n.\n\nEl alcalde Pereira dijo el mes pasado que este evento, adem\u00e1s, promov\u00eda el abuso y la explotaci\u00f3n sexual. La corporaci\u00f3n de Turismo de Cartagena tambi\u00e9n acuso a los organizadores de promover la trata de personas.\n\nSobre esto, el portavoz de Sex Island dijo que este evento s\u00ed promueve el turismo sexual, pero neg\u00f3 las acusaciones sobre abuso y explotaci\u00f3n sexual y sobre trata de personas.\n\n\u201cTurismo sexual, s\u00ed\u201d, respondi\u00f3 el portavoz. \u201c[Promovemos] el sexo con protecci\u00f3n entre hombres y mujeres en una ubicaci\u00f3n segura, con todas las partes dispuestas, a cambio de dinero\u201d.\n\nY a\u00f1adi\u00f3:\n\n\u201cTr\u00e1fico humano y explotaci\u00f3n sexual, NO\u201d.

Ahora las cuentas de Twitter y Facebook fueron borradas, y en Instagram solamente hay publicadas algunas im\u00e1genes que no hacen referencia ni a Cartagena ni a Colombia, como en el pasado, pero s\u00ed al Caribe.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 ocurre en Cartagena con el turismo sexual?\n\nCartagena es una ciudad azotada por la explotaci\u00f3n sexual, de ah\u00ed que las autoridades hayan rechazado enf\u00e1ticamente la realizaci\u00f3n de estas fiestas.\n\nRecientemente en la ciudad, que es uno de los principales destinos tur\u00edsticos del pa\u00eds, se llevaron a cabo una serie de redadas para desmantelar redes de prostituci\u00f3n y trata de personas.\n\nCon la Operaci\u00f3n Vesta, que se llev\u00f3 a cabo hacia finales de julio de 2018, las autoridades develaron la existencia de varias redes y formas de explotaci\u00f3n sexual comercial de ni\u00f1as y adolescentes en esta ciudad.\n\nEn agosto, en el desarrollo de esa misma operaci\u00f3n, 49 mujeres fueron halladas en s\u00f3tanos, y seg\u00fan la Fiscal\u00eda, hab\u00edan estado siendo sometidas a tratos crueles y obligadas a ofrecer servicios sexuales en Cartagena.\n\nEsas mujeres eran manejadas por una \u201cpresunta organizaci\u00f3n de proxenetismo que las manten\u00eda en hospedajes ubicados en s\u00f3tanos y precarias condiciones\u201d, seg\u00fan la Fiscal\u00eda.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

days behind it? That's probably a stretch. But Wall Street clearly is getting more worried about the company's reliance on the iPhone to generate sales and profit at a time when demand for the newer phones appears to be subpar.\n\nShares of Apple ( AAPL ) fell 3% Wednesday and that was one of the big reasons why the Dow , which includes Apple, lost more than 200 points. Apple's stock even dipped into bear market territory, meaning it was down 20% from its all-time high.\n\nIt was the fourth straight drop for the Dow, which actually opened the day with a more than 100-point gain after the US government reported that the latest figures for consumer prices were in line with expectations -- a sign that inflation remains mostly in check.\n\nThe other big tech stocks in the Dow -- Microsoft ( MSFT ), IBM ( IBM ), Intel ( INTC ) and Cisco ( CSCO ) -- were all lower too.\n\nThe Dow briefly bounced off its lows after UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her cabinet had agreed to a Brexit deal\n\nBut the broader market was also hurt by a slide in bank stocks after Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters, who is expected to take over the House Financial Services Committee in January, said in a House hearing Wednesday that the days of more lax regulations for banks \"will come to an end.\"\n\nStill, all eyes were mostly on Apple, which fell for a fifth consecutive day.\n\nThe reason for Apple's latest slide? Several companies that produce chips and other components used in iPhones have all issued gloomy forecasts recently, citing sluggish demand for higher-end smartphones.\n\nAlthough none of these companies, which include Qorvo ( QRVO ), Lumentum ( LITE ), Japan Display and IQE, have named Apple as the source of their woes, they are all Apple suppliers.\n\nBut it may not be time to throw in the towel on Apple just yet, even though some analysts are cutting their price targets and earnings estimates due to concerns about soft sales for the newer iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.\n\nApple's stock is still up more than 10% this year, making it one of the better performers in the Dow. The company is still worth nearly $900 billion. It remains the most valuable company in the world.\n\nApple also continues to pay a solid dividend that yields 1.5% -- and the company is likely to keep raising its dividend thanks to its cash stockpile of $237.1 billion.\n\nWhat's more, Apple's earnings are expected to increase by more than 13% this fiscal year and keep growing at about a 12% clip annually, on average, for the next few years.\n\nSo predictions of an Apple iPocalypse, if you will, may be premature. There are other legitimate worries for Apple though.\n\nUBS analyst Tim Arcuri cut his price target on Apple Wednesday. He wrote in a report that the stronger dollar could be hurting iPhone sales in China since currency fluctuations make the already expensive iPhones even pricier in China.\n\nAnd it does seem like the company needs a new product to get consumers and investors excited again.\n\nPerhaps Apple needs to take a cue from the movie \"This Is Spinal Tap\" and release a new iPhone that goes to eleven. But would it be the iPhone 11 or iPhone XI?", "\u0623\u0648\u0642\u0641\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u062a\u0629 \u0623\u0634\u062e\u0627\u0635 \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0642\u062a\u0644 8 \u0623\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0631\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0642\u0639\u062a \u0639\u0627\u0645 2016 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0623\u0648\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0648.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621 \u060c 14 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "(CNN) \"Bachelor\" stars Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham have a baby on the way.\n\nThe couple confirmed the news on Wednesday via Instagram.\n\nLuyendyk Jr. and Burnham shared a sonogram image he captioned: \"Nothing compares, absolutely nothing compares to the moment you find out you're going to be a dad!

At 77, Simon has a strong claim to be America's greatest living songwriter, with an award-winning career spanning seven decades -- first as one half of Simon & Garfunkel, then as a genre-defying solo artist.\n\nArt Garfunkel, left, with Paul Simon, around 1957. They were known at the time as \"Tom and Jerry.\"\n\nBut now, Simon has decided to stop. It's not quite retirement, but it comes close. In September, his final tour concluded in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, near where he grew up in Queens, New York. But as he explained to Christiane Amanpour for her show on CNN International and PBS, this isn't a final goodbye.\n\n'Good' songs, 'overlooked'\n\n\"I don't intend for it to be my last performance,\" he said at his office in New York -- just his last tour.\n\nJUST WATCHED Watch part 2 of Amanpour's interview with Paul Simon Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch part 2 of Amanpour's interview with Paul Simon 10:48\n\n\"I'd like to do it for my own pleasure, in concert halls that have prestige sound and with perhaps different musicians that I admire, and play a repertoire that is different from what I've been playing.\"\n\nIt's a repertoire, he pointed out, that includes songs he's been playing for decades.\n\nAnd what songs. With \"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\" \"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"Graceland,\" Simon has provided something of a soundtrack to the American experience.\n\nWith his most recent and possibly last album, \"In the Blue Light,\" he has dusted off some of his back catalog, rearranging and revising some of his favorite songs.\n\n\"These are songs that I thought were well written -- good songs that were overlooked, or people didn't notice them when I put them out,\" he said.\n\nPaul Simon performing in London, around 1980.\n\nIf this indeed proves to be his last album, Simon considers that very much his own choice.\n\n\"It's not like I couldn't do another album now at the same qualitative level as I've done the last two or three albums -- which I think are as good as I can do, as I've ever been. I think I could do that, but I'm not sure that's the most interesting choice for me.\"\n\nStill, he acknowledges that even if he wants to let go of songwriting, songwriting may not let go of him: \"I can't help but think music. It seems it's always there. I wake up with it.\"\n\nAt its best, songwriting for Simon comes close to a mystical experience. When he finished writing \"Bridge over Troubled Water,\" he recalled, he had to admit to himself: \"'That's better than I usually do.'\"\n\nSimon performing during the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.\n\n\"Graceland,\" he said, also fell into that category, \"where you feel as if you are a conduit and the song is coming through you. You're shaping it, but you're absolutely surprised at what's happening, and you don't know why, and you don't know where it comes from.\n\n\"But I recognize that that happens sometimes, and it's led me to be a more spiritual person -- because of the mystery of it.\"\n\nHe has learned to accept that process for what it is.\n\n\"I'm holding back from going into solving these musical thoughts, as if they were puzzles that needed to be solved.\n\n\"Now I say, 'No, don't solve it that way. Just leave it alone. Let's just see what happens.' \"\n\nFrom 'Tom and Jerry' to Paul Simon\n\nIt was over half a century ago that he started performing with Art Garfunkel, originally under the stage name Tom & Jerry. It would become one of the most renowned musical pairings in history.\n\nSimon and Garfunkel perform during a reunion concert at London's Wembley Stadium in 1982.\n\nAs a solo artist over the decades, Simon has continually reinvented himself, using music as a tool of global exploration: South Africa for \"Graceland,\" Brazil for \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nBut he remains, at heart, a New Yorker. So much so that after 9/11, the city called on him numerous times to reflect New York's feelings in song; most memorably, Lorne Michaels asked Simon to open \"Saturday Night Live\" on September 29, 2001, the first episode of the show after the attacks.\n\nThe memory of that performance still moves him.\n\n\"What I remember most about that moment was coming from the dressing room to the studio, where my mind is -- as it usually is when I'm about to perform -- focused on what I am about to do.\n\n\"But I passed by these lines of firemen and policemen, and the reality of what had occurred and what the situation was. ... The context that I was performing in was very powerful. Very powerful. It took away from any sense that it was going to be a regular performance.\n\n\"It was very emotional. And it's seldom that I feel my heart pounding -- not really on any of those times in Central Park or in front of people. But that night, that night, and again on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 when I sang down at the World Trade Center in front of the families, that was also...\" He trails off and shakes his head.\n\nWith these performances, Simon has had to acknowledge that he inhabits a healing role for the city.\n\n\"I've come to realize that I have that capacity, yeah. I'm surprised. I didn't plan it -- I've observed it.\"\n\nGraceland\n\nSimon hasn't always been a healing figure. In particular, the release of 1986's \"Graceland\" was surrounded by controversy. Simon traveled to South Africa to record with black musicians at a time when the country was still under the apartheid regime, and he was subsequently accused by some artists of breaking the cultural boycott against the country. At the time, he met his critics head on, and more than 30 years later, his opinion hasn't changed.\n\n\"They were completely disingenuous about it,\" he said. \"First of all, we didn't break any boycott. There was no rule about recording with black South African musicians. In fact, the whole purpose of the boycott was the antithesis of what we did.\n\nSimon with the South African musician Joseph Shabalala, founder of the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, with whom Simon collaborated on \"Graceland.\"\n\n\"The musicians voted whether they wanted me to come or not. I didn't know that, but I found out later on that they had voted. And what they wanted to know, the musicians, was, 'How much are we going to be paid? And will we get credit?' So that was easy, you know. Of course they were going to get credit and royalties. And I paid them, at that time, what was -- I think it was triple scale of what you would be paid in New York. So I think it came out to be like maybe $600 for a three-hour session. They were making like $15 for a day. So everybody was perfectly happy.\"\n\nOne of the groups Simon worked most closely with on the album was Ladysmith Black Mambazo, whose founder, Joseph Shabalala, embraced Simon both figuratively and literally -- the first time, he said, he had ever hugged a white man.\n\nIn the end, it's that message of unity that Simon hopes the album still carries: \"It's very hard to get the trust, but musicians will often bring it on a level that goes right to the heart. It's really true that music is the universal language. It's a clich\u00e9, but it happens to be true.\"\n\nLeaving a trail for environmentalists\n\nWhen it comes to finally making peace with his most famous musical partner, Garfunkel, Simon demurs: \"I don't know how to even approach that.\"\n\nHe mulls the question for a while.\n\n\"There's too much damage that was done. But, you know, it's like somebody that I've known since I'm 11, so I understand. I understand -- I think I understand why it happened, but I think it's best to stay away. Stay away just for safety's sake. And so I do.\"\n\nWithout a final reunion in the cards for this famous duo, and with Simon's touring career behind him, he is turning instead to more personal matters, including the cause that he cares about most: the environment.\n\nSimon, right, with Art Garfunkel, around 1965.\n\nDuring his penultimate tour, Simon gave the proceeds to the Half Earth Foundation, and in his final tour he donated money to a local charity or group in each city he played: \"A small amount, $25,000, as a thank you.\"\n\n\"I was going and trying to leave it as like a trail of breadcrumbs through the forest so that people, if they were following it, would join.\"\n\nIn fact, while he generally seems at peace with his life and his choices, Simon admits he feels tremendous guilt about the environmental mess that he is leaving his children and grandchildren.\n\nSo, what of his musical legacy? It's an inheritance he's more reluctant to assess.\n\n\"I don't believe in legacy,\" he told Amanpour. \"I don't believe that there's any importance to it.\n\n\"I've already left a great deal of my thinking. I just turned 77, so I've already left my thinking through these songs -- some of which are very, very well-known -- so it's good to stop and see what else will I think of. Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just take a rest.\"", "New York (CNN Politics) The coalition of Republican attorneys general hoping to bring down Obamacare is losing at least one member, thanks to last week's blue wave in state elections.\n\nthe Affordable Care Act.

A ruling in the suit, which revolves around Congress' reducing the individual mandate penalty to $0 starting in 2019 , is expected from a US District Court judge in Texas any day.\n\nThe ruling is expected to be appealed either way.\n\nRead More", "\u0645\u0642\u062a\u0644 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0637\u0641\u0627\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629

Read the full court filing below.", "(CNN) \"A mob of 10,000 Central American migrants is marching through Mexico and heading toward El Paso, Texas. Mexican border agents attempted to stop them at the Mexican border, but to no avail. The wall must be built. The wall will keep America safe and strong.\"\n\nThat's the sales pitch for a new toy -- a set of MAGA building blocks -- aimed at children ages 5 and up.\n\nThe toy is sold by Keep and Bear , a conservative apparel and gifts website that also sells Christmas cards featuring President Donald Trump in a Santa cap.\n\nThe set includes 100 building-block pieces and a Trump figurine wearing a Make America Great Again hard hat. The pieces snap together, allowing kids -- or their parents -- to build a section of a miniature border wall.\n\nThe President has trumpeted his promise of building a wall along the US southern border since the 2016 campaign. He has sought the billion-dollar structure to keep out \"dangerous drugs and criminals from pouring into our country.\"\n\nIn the three weeks before the 2018 midterm elections, Trump tweeted about the border more than 40 times, mostly referring to a \"caravan\" of migrants making its way north through Mexico towards the US. In late October, he sent more than 5,000 troops to the border to halt the migrants, although since the November 6 election, he has stopped tweeting about the issue.\n\nJust another toy?\n\nTo grown-ups, the MAGA building blocks may look like a political gimmick. Most kids, though, will see them as just another set of building bricks, said Richard Gottlieb, CEO and founder of Global Toy Experts.\n\n\"I wouldn't be concerned about it, it's just a novelty statement,\" he told CNN. \"I think it's mostly designed to appeal to adults who maybe feel they're making some kind of political statement.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Candidate teaches kid to 'build the wall' in new campaign ad Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Candidate teaches kid to 'build the wall' in new campaign ad 01:14\n\nThe set sells for $29.95 on the Keep and Bear website and begins shipping on November 23.\n\n\"We understand why they want to flee Honduras and live in and work in America,\" reads a description of the toy on the site. \"After all we are the greatest nation on Earth.\"\n\n\"This toy makes a great Christmas gift for your kids and grandkids!\"\n\nBut Gottlieb isn't so sure.\n\n\"I can't think of anything that would turn a child off more to that political position than building a wall,\" he said. \"It's the most boring play concept in the history of the world. It's just one-fourth of a house.\"\n\nFor kids, he said, there's no meaning behind the bricks.\n\n\"I think that whatever the toy is, we tend to, as adults, assert a meaning that children don't necessarily see. They just play.\"\n\nThe toy's political message will be lost on a young child, Gottlieb said.\n\n\"These are little bricks, construction pieces that are a part of every child's life,\" he said. \"If you're 5 years old, you may do it because Daddy wants you to, but I don't think it has a meaning.\"", "\"Fox News supports CNN in its legal effort to regain its White House reporter's press credential,\" Wallace said. \"We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court.\"\n\nWallace added, \"While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the President and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.\"\n\nFred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of the Washington Post, also expressed his support for the action in a separate statement.\n\nHe said on Tuesday night, \"We support CNN in its effort to restore the press credentials of its White House reporter. It is a journalist's role to ask hard questions, hold the powerful to account and provide readers with as much information as possible.\"\n\nThe Post and Fox News are joining the amicus brief along with a long list of others.\n\nWednesday morning's statement listed The Associated Press, Bloomberg, First Look Media, Gannett, NBC News, The New York Times, Politico, USA Today, the National Press Club Journalism Institute, the Press Freedom Defense Fund, and the E.W. Scripps Company.\n\n\"Whether the news of the day concerns national security, the economy, or the environment, reporters covering the White House must remain free to ask questions. It is imperative that independent journalists have access to the President and his activities, and that journalists are not barred for arbitrary reasons,\" the thirteen outlets said in a statement. \"Our news organizations support the fundamental constitutional right to question this President, or any President. We will be filing friend-of-the-court briefs to support CNN's and Jim Acosta's lawsuit based on these principles.\"\n\nAdditional news outlets are likely to sign on to the brief.\n\nAfter the initial statement came out, CBS said it intends to file a brief \"in support of CNN's lawsuit to defend its constitutional rights.\"\n\nBuzzFeed said it will also be signing on.\n\nABC News said in a statement that \"we stand with CNN in believing that Jim Acosta should have his White House pass reinstated. We hope this is resolved swiftly.\"\n\nAnd the Wall Street Journal said it supports \"efforts to restore Mr. Acosta's full access.\"", "Photos: How much sugar is in that drink? While food accounts for a large portion of the added sugar in our diet, many experts recommend cutting back on sugary beverages to reduce daily intake.

In the following slides, we compare the amount of sugar found in some of America's top-selling beverages -- according to Beverage Industry magazine's 2013 State of the Industry Report -- to the sugar found in common sugary snacks.

It was the largest US jackpot won by a single ticket and the nation's second-largest jackpot ever.\n\n\"They still have over 100 days to come forward,\" Holli Armstrong, a South Carolina Education Lottery spokeswoman, told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThat's because the winner has 180 days from the draw date to claim the prize, she said. In doing so, the new billionaire could remain anonymous.\n\n\"The winner has an option on the claim form to check 'yes' or 'no' for publicity,\" Armstrong said. \"If the winner declines publicity, we respect their wishes and do not release their name.\"\n\nThough surprised that no one has shown yet up to claim the money, Armstrong said people often take their time to come forward.\n\n\"We don't speculate why they haven't come forward. The winner should know how they will handle the money accordingly, so is not uncommon they take their time to claim it,\" she said.\n\nAnd this will be a lot of money to handle. The winner can pick between a one-time cash option of $878 million, before taxes, or the full $1.5 billion, before taxes, paid in annuities over 29 years.\n\n\"We encourage the winner, whoever they are, to sign the back of their ticket, put it in a safe place and speak to someone they trust for guidance before claiming the money,\" Armstrong said.\n\nIt's very likely the person who won will come forward, she said. But if not, the money will go to a great cause.\n\n\"The funds are returned to the states that sell Mega Millions tickets,\" Armstrong said. \"In South Carolina, the unclaimed prize money goes into an unclaimed prize fund that supports education.\"", "\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0623\u064a\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0649

re-elected Sen. Mitch McConnell to serve as majority leader for the new Congress and selected Sen. John Thune to be the new whip, the second-ranking member of leadership, as well as adding a female member -- Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst -- in the No. 5 spot.\n\nErnst won the contest to become the vice chair of the Republican conference, becoming the first woman to be elected to the Senate GOP's leadership since 2009.\n\nThune, who was the No. 3 leader, takes over for Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, who held that post for three two-year terms and must step aside because of term limits imposed by Senate GOP rules.\n\nThe slight realignment of the leadership structure came a week after the midterm elections, when Republicans narrowly preserved their majority . Republicans held a 51-49 before the election and it may grow to 53-49 if they win a runoff in Mississippi and Gov. Rick Scott preserves his lead over Sen. Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent in Florida.\n\nOther Republicans in the leadership ranks moved up one spot too. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, took over from Thune as chair of the Republican conference. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri took Barrasso's old job as Policy Committee chair.\n\nSen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, was elected chair of the Senate Republican campaign operation, the National Republican Senate Committee.\n\n\"Sen. Young understands how to win difficult Senate races in a presidential election year,\" said John Ashbrook, a Republican strategist close to McConnell. \"He did it in Indiana and his colleagues seem to like the idea of putting a Marine on the job for them in 2020.\"\n\nIowa Sen. Chuck Grassley will become the Senate president pro tempore, the longest-serving member in the majority, when Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch retires in January. In this new role, Grassley will be in the presidential line of succession.

Meanwhile, doctors and researchers continue to discover new illnesses linked to the crawling bugs.\n\nThe committee, known as the Tick-Borne Disease Working Group, was established under theand is tasked with proposing how to rein in this public health problem.\n\n\"As tick populations continue to grow and infected ticks expand geographically, the threat to human health intensifies,\" the working group wrote. To highlight the necessity to act, the report includes stories from patients, including Ruben Lee Sims.\n\n'Untreated patients can lose everything'\n\nSims, a Vietnam veteran who in 1977 was recognized by the US Air Force as the \"top enlisted management analyst of the year,\" had his life derailed several years later by tick bites.\n\nRuben Lee Sims is a Lyme disease advocate.\n\nUnable to diagnose Lyme disease, the military discharged Sims in 1984, labeling him a hypochondriac whose pain was caused by psychological factors. A year later, a non-military doctor also failed to deliver a diagnosis. Though the doctor suspected Lyme disease, Sims had never traveled to New England, where the disease is prevalent, so the tick-borne disease was crossed off the list of possibilities.\n\n\"I was misdiagnosed for over three decades and left untreated for Lyme disease,\" Sims told the report's authors. Today, that's no longer true. Better equipped to diagnose tick-borne disease, the VA has confirmed Sims' pain as a symptom of Lyme disease, and with appropriate treatment, he no longer has symptoms.\n\n\"Untreated patients can lose everything, as I did, and become part of the unemployed, under-employed, disabled, and homeless populations,\" Sims said in the report. These days, he shares his story to help others who may be affected by tick-borne illnesses.\n\nMost Lyme patients who are treated early can fully recover, yet up to 20% experience persistent symptoms -- some disabling. Immediate symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, swollen lymph nodes and a distinctive ring rash . Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath, inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, and shooting pains in the hands or feet are among the longer-term symptoms in patients with chronic illness.\n\nThe spread of Lyme disease\n\nLyme disease cases have doubled since 2004, according to the report. Meanwhile, its geographic prevalence has grown: The number of counties considered to have high incidence of the disease has increased by more than 300% in the northeastern states and by nearly 250% in North Central states, the report states.\n\n\"The geographic range of Lyme disease cases has expanded since its first appearance in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975 and has consistently spread northward, southward, and westward,\" the report says. The working group suggests this spread may be due, at least in part, \"to ecological changes taking place in North America since the middle of the 20th century, including habitat and climate changes.\"\n\nThough less common on the West coast, Lyme disease is an important concern there, as are other diseases that result from tick bites, the report states. Despite hundreds of thousands of estimated cases, only about 35,000 are reported each year to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLyme disease is transmitted by infected deer ticks. Infected blacklegged ticks, Western blacklegged ticks and lone star ticks also frequently transmit illness in the United States.\n\nTick-borne diseases can be difficult to diagnose. Tests are not always accurate, and health care providers may not know how to use them. Additionally, patients may have not just one but two or more tick-borne illnesses at the same time.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe Tick-Borne Disease Working Group's recommendations include improving early and accurate diagnosis and treatment, strengthening national surveillance and developing new treatment options for treating acute and persistent illness.\n\n\"For decades, tick-borne diseases have increased at an alarming rate,\" the committee concluded. \"The continued spread of ticks, the discovery of new tick-borne pathogens, and the spreading outbreak of human disease is a near certainty.\"", "(CNN) Astronomers have found a frozen exoplanet more than three times the mass of Earth, orbiting a star that's only six light-years away. The exoplanet is orbiting Barnard's star, the closest solitary star to our sun.\n\nThis makes it the second closest known exoplanet to us. Previously, an exoplanet was found orbiting in the three-star Proxima Centauri system\n\nThe exoplanet was found after stitching together 20 years of data, including 771 individual measurements, from seven instruments. The analysis that led to the discovery is detailed in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nFor years, astronomers thought they would find a planet around the nearby star, but it eluded them.\n\n\"The biggest 'kick' about this discovery is the host star,\" Paul Butler, study co-author and astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science, wrote in an email. \"Barnard's star is the 'great white whale' of planet hunting.\"\n\nThe planet, known as Barnard's star b, is probably dimly lit by its star and slightly colder than Saturn. The researchers believe that it is an icy desert with no liquid water, a hostile environment where the average surface temperature is around minus-274 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAn artist's impression of the planet under the orange-tinted light from the star.\n\nThe red dwarf star itself emits only about 0.4% of our sun's radiance, so the planet receives about 2% of the intensity that Earth receives from its sun. This is because Barnard's star is in the class of M dwarf stars, cooler and less massive than our sun. It's also an old star that predates our own solar system.\n\nAnd to look at it through a telescope, the star appears to be moving the fastest among the other stars in the night sky. This is because it's moving quickly in relation to the sun, and it's the nearest single star in the sky to us, Butler said.\n\n\"The star is named in honor of the great American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard, who was a pioneer of stellar photography and astrometry,\" Butler said. \"He recognized that this star had the largest known proper motion a century ago.\"\n\nThe planet is about the same orbital distance from its star as Mercury is from our sun, making a full pass around the star every 233 days. This places it in the \"snow line\" of the star, where it's cold enough for water to freeze into solid ice. This region in a planetary system is where the building blocks of planets are thought to form, collecting material to become cores. As they migrate closer to their host stars, gathering more material, they become planets.\n\nIt's the first time a planet this small and distant from its star has been detected using the radial velocity technique, which Butler helped pioneer. This method is sensitive to the mass of the exoplanet and measures changes in the host star's velocity. Instruments can be used to detect tiny wobbles in the star's orbit that are caused by the planet's gravity.\n\n\"I think this discovery shows the power of the [radial velocity] technique for detecting longer period, small planets that are much harder or not possible to detect with missions like Kepler and TESS, which focus on finding transiting exoplanets in shorter orbital periods,\" Johanna Teske, study co-author and Hubble Fellow at the Carnegie Institution for Science, wrote in an email. \"This study sets a wonderful example of collaboration and coordination across multiple teams and multiple data sets, something that doesn't always happen successfully in exoplanet research. It is only by combining data and working collaboratively that this very challenging detection was possible.\"\n\nThese methods haven't always been available to astronomers searching for exoplanets. For most of the past hundred years, the only way was the astrometric technique, in which astronomers look for the host star to wobble relative to background stars, Butler said. It worked only for the nearest stars and was achieved by taking photographs of the star and measuring its positions in relation to one another.\n\n\"This made Barnard's star the most important star in the sky because it is the nearest single star in the sky,\" Butler said.\n\nIn the 1930s, Dutch-American astronomer Peter van de Kamp began a quest to study Barnard's star that lasted for most of his 93 years. His claims of how planets could fit in orbit around the star were refuted, and he died five months before the first verifiable discovery of an exoplanet was made in May 1995, Butler said.\n\n\"He worked hard at improving the only technique at that time that had a prayer of finding planets, and spent decades collecting the data,\" Butler said. \"Van de Kamp is a true pioneer in extrasolar planets.\"\n\nGiven its proximity to our solar system and its long orbit, future missions and telescopes will be able to provide new insights about Barnard's star b.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

could be on the chopping block as this most mercurial of presidents seethes and stews over the midterm setback for his party last week and his broader grievances that he is not being well-served by his staff.\n\nWhich, uh, welcome to the Trump White House. Since Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, he has overseen one of the most chaotic Cabinets in modern history -- with resignations, firings and the whispers of future resignations and firings an almost-daily story.\n\nThe latest: Trump has decided he wants Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, gone -- although it's unclear when she will go. Thrown into that mix is the fact that White House chief of staff John Kelly is very close to Nielsen -- she followed him into the DHS job -- and might take umbrage at her firing (or forced resignation) and step aside himself. Given the ongoing tensions between Trump and Kelly, it's hard to say that such a two-for-one scenario would bother the President.\n\nThere's a tendency to reach to normalize Trump's hot-knife-through-butter slicing and dicing of his Cabinet. After all, being a Cabinet secretary -- or a senior White House official -- is a very stressful job. And history suggests that people wear out and are replaced -- particularly after a major moment like a midterm election.\n\nBut, as with so many things when it comes to Trump, this tendency toward normalization undersells the historic anomaly we are witnessing. Yes, Cabinet officials and senior staff leave every White House. No, we have not seen the level or pace of departures occurring in this White House ever before in modern memory.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) Almost three in five Americans said they'd prefer another Democrat as speaker of the House over past party leader Nancy Pelosi, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nAs Pelosi campaigns in the House to regain her title as speaker, Republicans and even some Democrats on Capitol Hill have mobilized against her. Among Democrats in the poll, more would prefer a different leader.\n\nIn CNN's post-election poll, respondents who participated in a survey from just before the election were called back. Only 30% of Americans said they want Pelosi to be speaker. Even Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are split -- 44% back her and 46% want another Democrat to take the lead.\n\nIn a CNN/ORC poll from after the 2010 election, when Republicans seized control of the House and Pelosi lost her role as speaker, 45% said they wanted her to continue as the Democratic leader in the House and 47% preferred another Democrat. Among all Americans in 2010, 66% said they wanted another Democrat and 25% said they preferred Pelosi. Despite that opposition, Pelosi has remained the top Democrat in the House for Democrats during the intervening eight years, and now that they have regained the majority, she is primed to retake the speaker's gavel.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEn ella se pueden ver nubes sobre el planeta de mayor masa del Sistema Solar\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El 29 de octubre de este a\u00f1o a las 4.58 p.m. ET. una c\u00e1mara de la NASA capt\u00f3 una impactante fotograf\u00eda de J\u00fapiter, el planeta con mayor masa en todo el Sistema Solar.\n\nLa imagen, publicada por la NASA el 8 de noviembre, muestra \"magn\u00edficas nubes arremolinadas en el din\u00e1mico Cintur\u00f3n de Templado Norte de J\u00fapiter\", explic\u00f3 la instituci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica en un comunicado.\n\nMIRA: La NASA graba su primer video de la Tierra en 8K\n\nEn la escena se pueden ver varias nubes de un brillante color blanco.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) The lawsuits are flying in Florida, as Democrats and Republicans fight over which votes should be counted in the state's hotly contested statewide recount and how long counties should be allowed to count those votes.\n\nTo date, there are several lawsuits pending about the recount, with the most litigious group being Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson's reelection campaign, which is hoping the effort will give them a chance at flipping the lead held by Florida Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nDemocrats, through the lawsuits, are looking to expand the universe of available votes, primarily by overturning a Florida statute that requires voter signatures on file to match the signatures on mail in ballots, reversing a measure that would allow votes postmarked before Election Day but received after to be counted and by expanding how election officials determine a voters' intent on ballots where a vote is not totally clear.\n\nNelson's campaign, led by lawyer Marc Elias, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are also suing to get rid of the Thursday deadline that requires all counties to finish the machine recount of votes. It appears, due to aging machines, that Palm Beach County will struggle to meet this deadline.\n\nRepublicans have also filed their own suits, including one filed by Scott's legal team against controversial Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes and another filed by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch that alleges voter fraud under Snipes. To date, however, there have been no reports of the kind of fraud alleged by Republicans.\n\nHere's a look at the suits in play:\n\nDemocrats sue over signature matching\n\nThis important hearing happens today at 1 p.m. before Judge Mark Walker in federal court in Tallahassee. Nelson's camp is asking a judge to invalidate Florida rules that say signatures on absentee and provisional ballots must match signatures on file. If successful, that suit could theoretically put thousands of tossed ballots back in play.\n\nDemocrats sue to lift all Florida recount deadlines\n\nNelson's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are asking a judge to allow all local elections officials \"the time they say is needed\" to finish \"because the race was so close.\" There's a status hearing on this Thursday morning before that same judge, Walker, in federal court).\n\nGroups sue to force Rick Scott to recuse himself\n\nThe League of Women Voters and Common Cause are asking for a restraining order to stop Scott from exercising any of his powers as governor in relation to the recount. They say he has demonstrated conflict of interest.\n\nAttorneys for Scott told a federal judge Wednesday morning that Scott will recuse himself from the certification of the final election results in Florida.\n\nThe comments came during the status hearing in the suit.\n\nWhile the governor's lawyers said Scott will not sit on the elections board to try to certify the result, that's only a small part of what the plaintiffs are seeking. They want the governor to not have any influence on the election canvassing process or use his authority to suspend election supervisors.\n\nThe judge did not make a ruling. A hearing is scheduled for 1 p.m. tomorrow.\n\nDemocrats sue over \"voter intent\" with undervotes and overvotes\n\nNelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are asking a judge to strike down a state rule that requires voters to use the same method of marking different races in order for such ballots to be counted. For example, the suit argues, the rule would disqualify a ballot where a voter clearly indicated intent by circling a candidate's name in one race but used another kind of marking for different race. Dems believe there are thousands of tossed undervote and overvote ballots in their favor.\n\nDuring a telephone conference today before Walker, attorneys for both the Nelson campaign and the secretary of state agreed the case is over interpretation of a legal issue and will not require a full hearing before the judge rules.\n\nWalker asked for written filings and responses by tomorrow morning and could rule at any point after that.\n\nWalker noted that there are seven recount-related lawsuits before his court alone, telling the parties: \"The people of Florida need to get orders out of me, as well as the parties, sooner rather than later. There's a lot of reasons why time is of the essence.\"\n\nState house candidate sues to extend recount in Palm Beach County\n\nDemocrat James Bonfiglio, in a recount for House District 89, sued to ensure Palm Beach County officials have time to review his race by the deadline. Interestingly, Nelson's team wants a judge to dismiss this case as not to hold up everything else. This case was just transferred from state court to federal court, so the status is unclear.\n\nDemocrats sue to allow the count of ballots that arrived late by mail\n\nThe VOTEVETS Action Fund, Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee are suing the state following the discovery of 266 ballots in the Opa-locka mail facility. The rules say mailed ballots must arrive in elections offices by election night, but the suit argues that voters should not be held responsible for the speed of the US Postal Service. This suit had a status conference Tuesday and Walker set a Thursday deadline for more filings.\n\nRick Scott is suing the Broward Supervisor of elections\n\nThis case in state court asks for an injunction to stop Snipes from counting any ballots not canvassed by last Saturday's noon deadline.

Bueno, una especie de trato. Apenas 872 d\u00edas desde que el Reino Unido votara para abandonar la Uni\u00f3n Europea, el texto del \"acuerdo de retirada\" se acord\u00f3 entre los equipos de negociaci\u00f3n de ambas partes. La primera ministra de Gran Breta\u00f1a, Theresa May, ahora tiene que persuadir a los miembros de su gabinete para que le den su bendici\u00f3n. Desafortunadamente para May, ah\u00ed es donde comienzan sus dolores de cabeza.\n\nMIRA: Alcanzan un acuerdo preliminar del Brexit m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su votaci\u00f3n\n\nVender el acuerdo al gabinete\n\nDesde hace tiempo se reconoce que el mayor problema que enfrenta May es la realidad pol\u00edtica en Londres.\n\nHay muy poco amor en cualquier lado del debate sobre el su plan para el brexit, y eso comienza a nivel del Gabinete.\n\nEl Gabinete de May est\u00e1 profundamente dividido entre los partidarios ardientes del brexit y los que votaron para permanecer. Ahora debe convencer a los miembros de probrexit de que el texto, que se espera que incluya un acuerdo que mantiene a todo Reino Unido en estrecha alineaci\u00f3n con la UE, cumple con el resultado del refer\u00e9ndum de 2016.\n\nSi ella falla, entonces es probable que tenga que regresar a Bruselas para renegociar, eso si no la obligan a renunciar. Sin embargo, ella deber\u00eda ganar a los 'brexiteers' del gabinete...\n\nLuego vuelve a Bruselas\n\nCon el Gabinete del Reino Unido en l\u00ednea, se convocar\u00e1 para noviembre una cumbre de emergencia del consejo de la UE, los 28 estados miembros que conforman la Uni\u00f3n Europea. O, al menos May espera eso.\n\nEn esta cumbre, los estados miembros aceptar\u00e1n el texto de retiro, lo que permitir\u00e1 que sea trasladado a las c\u00e1maras legislativas de la UE y Reino Unido.\n\nDebido al hecho de que el negociador principal de la UE, Michel Barnier, ha trabajado estrechamente en cada etapa con la UE27, los 28 estados miembros menos Reino Unido, se supone que esto ser\u00e1 poco m\u00e1s que un ejercicio de sello.\n\nMIRA: Theresa May convoca reuni\u00f3n de emergencia para presentar el borrador del acuerdo de negociaci\u00f3n para el brexit\n\nLo siguiente: la C\u00e1mara de los Comunes\n\nEsta ser\u00e1 la parte m\u00e1s complicada del proceso, y se le podr\u00eda perdonar a la primera ministra por golpearse la cabeza contra una pared.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de haber pasado meses tratando con la UE y viendo a una sucesi\u00f3n de ministros del gobierno renunciar por su gesti\u00f3n de brexit, debe enfrentarse a su propio Parlamento. El a\u00f1o pasado, gan\u00f3 el derecho a votar sobre el borrador del acuerdo, algo que el gobierno estaba dispuesto a evitar.\n\nEsto se conoce en Reino Unido como el \"voto significativo\" y permite a los diputados la oportunidad de dar su veredicto sobre el contenido del texto de retiro y el acuerdo pol\u00edtico asociado sobre la futura relaci\u00f3n entre Reino Unido y la UE.\n\nDesde que May perdiera su mayor\u00eda en el Parlamento despu\u00e9s de una elecci\u00f3n improvisada en 2017, la aritm\u00e9tica ha sido un desaf\u00edo para ella.\n\nLa prioridad para el Partido Laborista de la oposici\u00f3n es derribar al gobierno de May y forzar una elecci\u00f3n, por lo que est\u00e1 virtualmente garantizado que votar\u00e1 en contra del acuerdo. Pero May tambi\u00e9n sabe que una parte significativa de sus propios parlamentarios detestan el acuerdo que ha alcanzado con la UE y est\u00e1n listos para rechazarlo.\n\nLuego est\u00e1 el Partido Unionista Democr\u00e1tico de Irlanda del Norte, o DUP, cuyos 10 diputados apoyan a su gobierno. El DUP ha estado convencido desde el primer d\u00eda de que cualquier acuerdo que socave el lugar de Irlanda del Norte como parte del Reino Unido los llevar\u00eda a votar en contra.\n\nSi May pierde esta votaci\u00f3n, entonces todas las apuestas est\u00e1n perdidas. El gobierno ha sostenido durante mucho tiempo que se trata de su acuerdo de s\u00ed o no, pero en realidad a\u00fan podr\u00eda hacer un llamamiento a Bruselas e intentar obtener algunas concesiones adicionales.\n\nEn teor\u00eda, el gobierno, en este punto liderado por May o alguien m\u00e1s, podr\u00eda llevar a los comunes un acuerdo revisado y tener otro intento de lograrlo. Si no lo hace, lo m\u00e1s probable es que se produzca una ca\u00edda del gobierno, una elecci\u00f3n general y una mir\u00edada de posibles resultados, incluido un segundo refer\u00e9ndum.\n\nPero si ella gana este voto...\n\nM\u00e1s drama en los Comunes\n\nSuponiendo que el voto significativo pase, una suposici\u00f3n enorme en este punto, entonces debe ser traducido a la ley de Reino Unido. Aqu\u00ed es donde entra en juego el Proyecto de Ley de Acuerdo de Retirada de la UE. Esto estipular\u00e1 formalmente los t\u00e9rminos bajo los cuales Reino Unido dejar\u00e1 la Uni\u00f3n Europea y entrar\u00e1 el per\u00edodo de implementaci\u00f3n.\n\nNormalmente, los legisladores pueden enmendar legislaci\u00f3n como esta y frustrar al Gobierno. Pero como el brexit es un acuerdo entre el gobierno de Reino Unido y la UE, que no tiene voto en la C\u00e1mara de los Comunes, es dif\u00edcil ver c\u00f3mo los parlamentarios podr\u00edan influir en \u00e9l (aunque podr\u00edan hacer la vida muy dif\u00edcil para el gobierno de Reino Unido).\n\nEl fracaso de la votaci\u00f3n en esta etapa presumiblemente llevar\u00eda a Gran Breta\u00f1a a quedarse fuera de la UE sin un acuerdo, y una importante crisis pol\u00edtica. Pero, si May logra obtener la factura de retiro...\n\nA\u00fan m\u00e1s drama en los Comunes\n\nA continuaci\u00f3n, la Ley de Reforma Constitucional y Gobernabilidad de 2010, de la que poco se habla, que requiere que el gobierno presente ante el Parlamento cualquier cambio en los tratados internacionales con un memorando explicativo.\n\nMIRA:Theresa May pide \u201crespeto\u201d de la Uni\u00f3n Europea despu\u00e9s de la humillaci\u00f3n por el Brexit\n\nEn esta etapa, uno supondr\u00eda que una vez aprobado por el Parlamento, este ser\u00eda un trato hecho. Pero el brexit siempre ha sido una pelea complicada. Se podr\u00eda esperar que aquellos que a\u00fan se oponen al acuerdo que se est\u00e1 llevando a cabo recojan las rocas que puedan encontrar y se las lancen al gobierno.\n\nDe vuelta a Bruselas\n\nSi el acuerdo llegara tan lejos, el proceso final de ratificaci\u00f3n del acuerdo se traslada al Parlamento Europeo. Dado que, a estas alturas, el acuerdo ya habr\u00e1 sido acordado a nivel del Consejo y en el Parlamento del Reino Unido, es dif\u00edcil ver una raz\u00f3n para que el Parlamento de la UE lo arruine, especialmente porque la mayor\u00eda en Bruselas quieren que el brexit quede fuera del camino, por lo que pueden concentrarse en las elecciones europeas, que tendr\u00e1n lugar el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o.

But if its equipment is found to be responsible for it, PG&E \"could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage\" and that this could have \"a material impact\" on its financial results.\n\nThe utility renewed its liability insurance coverage for wildfire events for an amount of approximately $1.4 billion that covers the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, the company said in the SEC filing\n\nBut the fire is far from being under control, which means more damage is likely. PG&E said in the filing that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection estimates the fire won't be fully contained until November 30.\n\nThe damages alone could cost up to $6.8 billion. according to a report from Moody's this week.\n\nPG&E may not have enough to cover the cost that, let alone any legal fees or fines it might have to pay. The utility said in its filing that it currently has $3.46 billion in cash after borrowing from an existing revolving credit line.\n\nShares of PG&E ( PCG ) plunged more than 30% Wednesday following this disclosure and were briefly halted for volatility. The stock has now fallen by half since the Camp Fire began.\n\nPower lines rest on cars that were burned by the Camp Fire on November 10, 2018 in Paradise, California.\n\nThe utility could need another bailout from the state of California if it's found to be liable for the Camp Fire.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown signed a bill in September that lets PG&E issue bonds backed by surcharges from the utility's customers. Those bonds would help pay for damages tied to deadly California wildfires in October 2017 caused by faulty PG&E equipment.\n\nThe bill allows for the possibility that utilities could issue similar bonds for future fires, but that is not guaranteed.\n\nPG&E already faces one lawsuit on behalf of victims of the Camp Fire.\n\nA group of law firms that has dubbed itself the Northern California Fire Lawyers filed a suit Tuesday on behalf of Camp Fire survivors.\n\nThe firms allege in the suit that \"PG&E was negligent in failing to maintain its infrastructure and properly inspect and manage its power transmission lines.\"\n\nA spokesperson for PG&E told CNN Business that \"it's important to remember that the cause has yet to be determined.\"\n\n\"We are aware of lawsuits regarding the Camp Fire. Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers,\" the spokesperson added.", "Parroting CNN's motto, \"facts first,\" GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the network's First Amendment lawsuit a \"political stunt\" and said Acosta still has access to the White House through a daily pass.\n\n\"Every one of his colleagues still has access to the WH, as does the reporter himself via a daily pass. #FactsFirst,\" McDaniel wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn fact, as CNN said in court documents Tuesday, the White House denied Acosta's application for a day pass on November 8, the day after his hard pass was revoked following the post-midterms news conference.\n\nAnd on a Presidential trip in Paris over the weekend, the White House and the Secret Service continued to deny Acosta access to press events -- including at a ceremony that he had acquired separate credentials to cover from the French government \u2013 according to the suit.\n\nIn a signed declaration, CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist wrote that \"reliance on daily passes\" to access other unscheduled events on the White House grounds like \"gaggles\" and off-camera briefings was \"impracticable at best, impossible at worst.\"", "New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump wants oil prices to keep plunging. OPEC is warning Trump to be careful what he wishes for.\n\nThat's because low prices at the pump have cost the US oil industry jobs in the past, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told CNN Business on Wednesday.\n\nAs a cautionary tale, Barkindo pointed out how painful the 2014-2016 oil crash was for American oil workers. He noted that more than 100 US oil companies went bankrupt and thousands of jobs were lost during that downturn.\n\nOnce that crash ended, however, the oil rebound became a big win for energy-producing states like Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and North Dakota. The Permian Basin of West Texas has morphed into one of the most prolific oilfields in the world.\n\nAmerica's energy industry \"benefited immensely\" from the coordinated output cuts by OPEC and its allies, Barkindo told CNN Business' Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios.\n\n\"If you look at the job creation in the basins, you will appreciate what OPEC and non-OPEC have jointly done to benefit the United States,\" Barkindo said.\n\nThose jobs could be threatened if crude keeps crashing like Trump wants.\n\nFears about a new supply glut knocked oil into a bear market last week. The selling deepened dramatically on Tuesday, when crude plunged 7%, its worst day in three years\n\nThe OPEC comments serve as a reminder to Trump that cheap oil cuts both way for the United States. American drivers save at the gas pump, but oil workers have their livelihoods threatened.\n\nThat's a reality for the United States, which is both the biggest producer and consumer of oil in the world.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whatever decision we make will be in the interest of the United States,\" Barkindo said. \"I'm sure he (Trump) will come to terms with reality.\"\n\nOPEC pledges to do 'whatever it takes'\n\nMuch to Trump's dismay, OPEC signaled on Monday that it would consider cutting production in response to excess supply.\n\nDespite the oil meltdown, Trump is urging OPEC not to dial back output.\n\n\"Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production,\" Trump tweeted on Monday. \"Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\"\n\nBarkindo urged Trump to speak directly with OPEC. \"We prefer a face-to-face dialogue with his administration,\" he said.\n\nBut OPEC may go forward with cuts anyway when the cartel meets in Vienna next month.\n\n\"We will do whatever it takes to sustain the stability that we have achieved,\" Barkindo said. \"Going into 2019, there are signs of a resurgence of an imbalance which we are determined to stay the course.\"\n\nHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production. Oil prices should be much lower based on supply! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nThe comments helped lift US oil prices 2% on Wednesday, putting crude on track to snap its record 12-day losing streak.\n\nOf course, OPEC played a major role in the 2014-2016 crude crash.\n\nDespite a huge glut, OPEC kept pumping aggressively in a bid to steal back market share from the United States and other high-cost producers. The cartel didn't agree to production cuts until September 2016 , when pain from the crash was hurting the finances of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations.\n\nWorkers extract oil from the Permian Basin, the booming shale oilfield in West Texas. (Photo by Benjamin Lowy/Getty Images)\n\nOPEC is unlikely to keep production intact this time because it would lead to \"sustainably lower prices,\" Jeffrey Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, wrote to clients on Tuesday. Currie argued that oil is set to \"snap back\" because the selloff is not justified.\n\nIran whiplash\n\nThe Trump administration has played a role in the latest boom-to-bust cycle for oil.\n\nPrices soared earlier this year after Trump officials signaled a desire to cut all oil exports from Iran. But the administration later took a softer approach on Iran sanctions out of fear they could cause crude to spike to $100 a barrel. US officials granted temporary waivers allowing China, India and others to keep buying oil from Iran.\n\nYet Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States ramped up output in recent months in a bid to avoid a shortfall caused by Iran.\n\nUS production has been especially strong, led by the roaring Permian Basin. America recently surpassed both Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world's No. 1 oil producer for the first time since 1973.", "WASHINGTON (CNN) A majority of Americans say the 2018 midterms were mostly about the rejection of Republican policies, but Democrats may have more of a mandate this time around than in past election cycles, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS .\n\nLess than half, 32%, say the election is more of a mandate for the Democrats. But the nearly one-third of Americans who see the election as a mandate outpaces the share who saw the election outcome that way in other recent elections where control of either the US Senate or the House of Representatives changed hands.\n\nIn 2014, 16% of Americans said the takeover of the US Senate by Republicans equaled a mandate. Similarly, in 2010, when tea party backlash to Democrats helped Republicans take the House, 17% called it a mandate for Republicans. In 2006, when fatigue and anger at the Iraq War helped Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, 27% called it a mandate for the party. In 1994, 18% saw the takeover led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract with America as a mandate for Republicans.\n\nIn the new poll, which was conducted by re-interviewing those who participated in a CNN poll conducted just before Election Day, 53% of Americans said the election results indicate a rejection of policy positions pushed by Republicans.\n\nMore than 6 in 10 say it will be good for the country that Democrats will be in charge of the US House, higher than in any of those midterms save 2006, when 67% considered the Democratic takeover of the House good for the country.\n\nDespite divided control of the Senate and House, about half of Americans expect a more responsive Congress, and an optimistic 37% think it will get more done than the GOP-controlled Congress leaving office in January.\n\nBut few want to see Nancy Pelosi as the leader of the Democratic Party in the House -- 59% overall say they'd rather see another Democrat lead the party's caucus, and even among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, opinions on Pelosi are about evenly split, with 44% saying they'd like to see her in charge and 46% preferring another Democratic leader.\n\nIt also suggests that little has changed in perceptions of President Donald Trump or the state of the country in the wake of the election. Overall, 42% in the poll say they approve of the way the President is handling his job, a narrow increase from 39% who approved before Election Day. And 54% feel things in the country are going well, about even with the 55% who said so in the pre-election survey.\n\nThe survey finds a majority saying they trust the Democrats in Congress over Trump to deal with the major issues facing the country today, 55% to 38%, and that margin holds roughly steady across a range of critical issues, including health care (59% to 36%), immigration (58% to 39%), the Russia investigation (58% to 33%), gun policy and taxes (both 54% for the Democrats to 39% for Trump), and the federal budget deficit (52% to 39%). The one exception: the economy. On that issue, 48% say they trust Trump over the Democrats in Congress and 47% prefer the Democrats.\n\nImmigration and health care stand clearly ahead of other issues as voters' top priorities for the new Congress, with 29% citing immigration when asked open-ended what they'd like to see as Congress's first priority come January, and 21% naming health care. Another 10% say the Mueller investigation is their first priority for Congress.\n\nStill, both Republican and Democratic voters are mostly happy with the outcome of last week's midterm elections, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, but the election has done little to dampen the sense that the country's political divisions are deeper than they have been before.\n\nOverall, 57% say they're mostly happy with the way this year's congressional elections, 34% are mostly disappointed. Those who said they backed the Democrat in their own congressional district were most pleased (64% said they were happy) but a majority who say they voted Republican also feel mostly happy (53%).\n\nRelated: Full poll results\n\nViews of Trump divide perceptions of the outcome a bit more than House votes did: 66% of those who said before the election that they were casting a ballot to oppose the president were happy with the outcome, vs. 49% among those who said they were voting to express support for Trump.\n\nMost don't think Trump ought to be impeached and removed from office. Fifty-five percent say they don't feel that way and 42% say that they do. About 6 in 10 say there isn't enough cause for the Congress to begin hearings into whether or not Trump should be impeached. And just 3% say impeachment is their top priority for the new Congress come January.\n\nAbout half (49%) say they disapprove of the President firing Jeff Sessions as attorney general, while 44% approve. But most, 67%, say they think Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself from the Russia investigation, seemingly the President's biggest complaint about his former attorney general.\n\nThis CNN poll was conducted by SSRS by re-interviewing 677 adults who participated in a nationally representative pre-election survey. Those participating in the poll were originally interviewed from November 1 through 3 and callback interviews took place between November 8 and 12. Results for all respondents reached in the callback survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.", "(CNN) - El presidente de Fox News, Jay Wallace, dice que el canal \"apoya a CNN en su esfuerzo legal para recuperar las credenciales de prensa de su reportero de la Casa Blanca\".

That's why we don't have the special training for that specific situation,\" Zwingli said Wednesday.\n\nInvestigators are examining whether a sensor on the outside of the plane transmitted incorrect data that could have triggered the stall-prevention system.\n\nThe airline's claims come after Boeing was similarly accused Tuesday by the Allied Pilots Association (APA) of withholding information about the potential danger of the plane's new features.\n\nJUST WATCHED Families grieve at airport after plane crash Replay More Videos ...

Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe head of the Directorate of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations (DOAAO) at the Indonesian Transportation Ministry told CNN that the agency was in the process of intensive discussions about additional training for the pilots who fly the MAX 8 planes, but did not elaborate on what any additional training would involve.\n\nOn Tuesday, the APA said while there were no immediate safety concerns about the MAX 8 planes, \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\"\n\n\"What seems to have happened here is that a new version or a modified anti-stall capacity was added which pushes the nose down automatically. If it's true, it is beyond comprehension that Boeing did not tell the airline and pilots about this,\" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest.\n\nHe added that if important information hadn't been communicated to pilots, it would be a matter for aviation regulators, rather than individual airlines.\n\n\"The issue is how much information to give the pilots about the systems on board so they can respond in an emergency,\" Quest said, adding that pilots are often overloaded with readouts and signals from multiple devices and monitors that can risk distracting them at the worst possible moment.\n\nLion Air sensor replaced\n\nBoeing's operational bulletin, released last week, pointed airlines to \"existing flight crew procedures\" to address any erroneous readings related to \"angle-of-attack\" (AOA) sensors.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later issued its own directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems.\n\nLast week, investigators said the AOA sensor on board the aircraft had been replaced the day before the incident, but problems persisted.\n\nIndonesian authorities confirmed last Wednesday that the AOA sensor was replaced after a flight from Manado, in North Sulawesi, to Denpasar, Bali, on October 28. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 then made another flight to Jakarta that same day, and the pilots reported further problems.\n\nInvestigators said the jet experienced problems on its last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT).\n\nThe FAA's directive affects 246 Boeing 737 Max aircraft worldwide, with 45 of these operated by US carriers that include Southwest, American and United Airlines.\n\nVoice recorder still missing\n\nMore than two weeks after the crash, authorities are still searching for the plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which is believed to be buried under deep mud. If found, it should reveal what happened in the cockpit in the final seconds of the flight.\n\nInvestigators are already examining the flight data recorder (FDR) that was pulled off the seabed, some 30 meters under water, on November 1. Preliminary findings suggested there were problems with the airspeed indicator on the past three flights before the crash.\n\nThe airspeed indicator is like a speedometer and tells the pilot how fast the plane is moving through the air. It does this by gathering data from the plane's pitot tube and the static port, which essentially compare differentials in the air pressure to arrive at the plane's speed and altitude.\n\nAfter problems were reported with the airspeed indicator, the AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nPassengers on that flight told CNN that the plane experienced a significant drop in altitude shortly after takeoff. \"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" passenger Robbi Gaharu said.\n\nOnce in Jakarta, a Lion Air technician checked the plane again and gave it the green light to fly on its final flight, from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang.", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 (CNN)-- \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a\u060c \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u060c \"\u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\" \u0628\u0634\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0645\u062d\u062f\u062f\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0647 \"\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633\u064a\" \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0646\u062d\u0648 \"\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0631\u0641\" \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629.\n\n\u0648\u0641\u064a \u062a\u063a\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0646\u0634\u0631\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a\u060c \u0641\u064a \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \"\u062a\u0648\u064a\u062a\u0631\"\u060c \u0642\u0627\u0644: \"\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u062a\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0625\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0646\u0643\u0627\u0631\".\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0636\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0627\u062f\u0639\u064a: \"\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u062a\u062a\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646\u0638\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0634\u0639\u0628\u0627\u064b \u064a\u064f\u062f\u0639\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0647 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u062a\u064f\u063a\u062a\u0635\u0628 \u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0623\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0645 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0635\u064a\u0628\u062a \u0628\u0632\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0631 \u0625\u0646\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0626\u064a!\"\u060c \u0648\u0641\u0642\u0627 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0647.", "London (CNN Business) The United Kingdom has taken a step towards securing a Brexit deal with the European Union. For businesses, the agreement would deliver much-needed certainty about the next two years.\n\n\"This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead,\" May told reporters following a marathon cabinet meeting. \"It is a decision that is firmly in the national interest.\"\n\nBut the resignation of key UK government ministers on Thursday underscored the difficulty of gaining parliamentary approval for the deal. The pound dropped sharply against the US dollar following the resignations, weakening as much as 1.8%.\n\nHere's what the deal \u2014 should it survive \u2014 would mean for business, markets and the economy.\n\nBusiness\n\nCompanies in Britain and the European Union have spent months preparing for a chaotic Brexit. Their biggest fear is a scenario where the United Kingdom crashes out of the European Union, leading to new trade barriers.\n\nThat risk hasn't been completely eliminated and companies remain cautious. Still, business groups including the British Retail Consortium welcomed news of a potential deal.\n\n\"It is vital that we avoid the cliff edge of no deal in March 2019 as this could immediately lead to consumers facing higher prices and reduced availability of many everyday products,\" said Helen Dickinson, the industry group's chief executive.\n\nKey manufacturing firms also cheered the emergence of a deal.\n\n\"My gut feeling is we need to get behind it and we need to make this deal work. What we need is certainty,\" Juergen Maier, UK CEO of German engineering giant Siemens ( SIEGY ), told BBC Radio.\n\nThe deal includes a transition period during which most trading rules for companies in Britain will remain the same. A joint declaration published Wednesday said that agreement had been reached on a close relationship on trade in financial services, and broad cooperation on transportation and energy.\n\nBut businesses have also been warned to prepare for a scenario where the deal falls through.\n\n\"We still urge business to continue preparing for both a deal and no deal scenario until the deal is ratified,\" said Andrew Gray, head of Brexit at PwC.\n\nOne more problem: The deal only covers the divorce terms, and doesn't give businesses much clarity about a future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and its biggest trading partner following the transition.\n\nThe joint declaration said that negotiations had been \"particularly challenging\" on how future trade in goods would be conducted.\n\nMarkets\n\nThe pound has been volatile since Brits voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, and it's still trading almost 14% lower than on the day of the referendum.\n\nAnalysts said it would strengthen following a deal.\n\n\"If the deal as described in the press were to pass into law, both [the pound] and [the euro] would benefit,\" Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nKallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg bank, said the pound would likely jump higher in two stages, along with government bond yields and shares in companies that do business in Britain.\n\nHe expects the first increase once the UK parliament has approved the divorce deal, which could happen in December, and the second during the following year as investors update their outlook for the United Kingdom.\n\nKaren Ward, a market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said that investors were still \"most nervous\" about the deal getting through parliament. But she expects it to be approved.\n\n\"Going into next year we expect business investment to experience a relief rally and higher sterling to depress inflation and lift real wages so consumer spending would also accelerate,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\nIf the deal fails and Britain crashes out of the bloc, S&P estimates the pound will slump 15% against the dollar.\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomists say a Brexit deal would boost the beleaguered UK economy.\n\n\"While the long-term risks to UK potential growth from Brexit loom large, the prospect of a deal presents considerable upside potential for the UK economy over the medium-term,\" Pickering said.\n\nBerenberg estimates that a deal would lift economic growth to 2% in 2019, from 1.3% this year.\n\nThe UK economy slowed sharply following the Brexit vote, but it has avoided slumping into recession.

they possess to select which journalists receive interviews, or which journalists they acknowledge at press conferences,\" lawyers say in the filing.\n\nHistorically both Republican and Democratic administrations have had a permissive approach to press access, providing credentials both to big news organizations like CNN and obscure and fringe outlets.\n\nAcosta's suspension -- which took effect one week ago -- is an unprecedented step. Journalism advocates say it could have a chilling effect on news coverage.\n\n\"If the press is not free to cover the news because its reporter is unjustly denied access, it is not free,\" former White House correspondent Sam Donaldson said in a court declaration supporting CNN on Tuesday. \"And if denying access to a reporter an organization has chosen to represent it -- in effect asserting the president's right to take that choice away from a news organization and make it himself -- is permitted, then the press is not free.\"\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.\n\nCNN and Acosta are asking Kelly for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction that would restore his access right away.\n\nLawyers for CNN and Acosta are arguing that time is of the essence because his rights are violated every day his pass is suspended.\n\nThey are also seeking a declaration that Trump's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\" This could protect other reporters against similar actions in the future.\n\nThe government's filing quotes a tweet by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in which she announced the suspension of Acosta's pass by saying his \"conduct is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe \"conduct\" mentioned by Sanders in the tweet that the government lawyers cite actually refers to a false and since-dropped argument that Sanders had made in the aftermath of the press conference \u2014 that Acosta was \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\"\n\nThe administration has backed away from that argument in recent days, and it makes no appearance in the government's first legal comment on the case Wednesday. Even when the filing directly quotes Sanders' tweets, it leaves out that part.\n\nInstead, the White House is complaining about Acosta's aggressive style. In an interview with The Daily Caller, a conservative website, on Wednesday, Trump called Acosta \"bad for the country,\" depicting him as \"just an average guy who's a grandstander who's got the guts to stand up and shout.\"\n\nTrump called on Acosta at last week's post-midterms press conference. The two men had a combative exchange. When Trump called on someone else, Acosta held onto a microphone and asked another question. Trump responded, and Acosta handed off the mic.\n\nLater in the day, Acosta returned to the White House and was told to hand in his Secret Service \"hard pass.\" Sanders, around the same time, announced his suspension.\n\nCNN is alleging that this abrupt action violated due process rights. But the government's lawyers said in Wednesday's filing that the back and forth between Trump and Acosta, during which Trump strongly criticized Acosta, qualified as due process. They also cite Sanders' statement the night of that press conference as \"notice of the factual bases for denial.\"\n\n\"The President had similarly criticized Mr. Acosta's conduct during that press conference, which complemented Ms. Sanders' notice,\" the government argued.\n\nThe government also claimed that CNN can't be harmed by the banning of one of its journalists, arguing that the \"network has roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex on CNN's behalf.\"\n\nCNN has rejected that assertion. So has the White House Correspondents' Association. The group said Tuesday that the president \"should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\"\n\n\"This is a very, very important case,\" Ted Olson said. Olson, a Republican heavyweight who successfully argued for George W. Bush in Bush v. Gore, is representing CNN along with another prominent outside attorney, Theodore Boutrous, and the network's chief counsel, David Vigilante.\n\nOlson said Tuesday that it was Acosta whose press pass was suspended this time, but \"this could happen to any journalist by any politician.\"\n\nHe spoke forcefully against Trump's action. \"The White House cannot get away with this,\" he said in an interview with CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.\n\nCNN's lawyers say the case hinges on Acosta and CNN's First Amendment rights; the shifting rationales behind the ban; and the administration's failure to follow the federal regulations that pertain to press passes, an alleged violation of Fifth Amendment rights. The lawsuit asserts that this ban is really about Trump's dislike of Acosta.\n\nThe \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity,\" CNN's lawsuit alleges.\n\nMany media law experts, unaffiliated with CNN, believe the network has a very strong case.\n\nJudge Andrew Napolitano, the top legal analyst on Trump's favorite network, Fox News, said the same thing on Tuesday. \"I think this will be resolved quickly,\" he said, adding \"I think it will either be settled or CNN will prevail on motion.\"\n\nIf there is no settlement, CNN is requesting a jury trial.\n\nIn an interview with Wolf Blitzer, Boutrous said the government officials are being sued in their \"official capacity,\" but \"there is a possibility of damages claims,\" which would mean suing them personally.\n\nBlitzer pointed out that the officials would have to \"go out and hire their own attorneys.\"\n\nIt is incredibly rare to see a news organization suing a president.\n\nMore than a dozen news outlets -- from the Associated Press to USA Today, The Washington Post to Fox News -- have publicly expressed support for the effort.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump campaign is trying to capitalize on the lawsuit. On Wednesday it sent out an emailed survey to potential donors that asked recipients if they think the ban on Acosta was justified. The email's subject line was, \"CNN SUES! Help Trump win.\"", "(CNN) House Democrats are kicking off their investigations into the Trump administration by probing acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's connections to a Florida company that was shut down by the Federal Trade Commission over what court documents called \"a scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe top Democrats on the House Oversight, Judiciary, Intelligence and Energy and Commerce Committees jointly sent seven letters requesting documents and briefings about Whitaker's role on the advisory board of the company, World Patent Marketing, which was hit with a $26 million judgment when it was shut down earlier this year.\n\nThe letters represent an opening salvo of how House Democrats plan to investigate the Trump administration when they take over in January. The letters from the four presumptive incoming chairmen \u2014 Reps. Elijah Cummings of Oversight, Jerry Nadler of Judiciary, Adam Schiff of Intelligence and Frank Pallone of Energy and Commerce \u2014 suggest the committees are preparing, at least initially, to jointly investigate targets that multiple panels are interested in.\n\nWhitaker's appointment following the firing of Jeff Sessions last week has been slammed by Democrats as potentially unconstitutional, as well as an effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation Whitaker has publicly criticized.\n\n\"Our very first witness after January 3, we will subpoena, or we will summon, if necessary subpoena, Mr. Whitaker,\" Nadler told CNN's Jake Tapper Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"", "Washington (CNN) Former first lady Michelle Obama said that her oft-admired friendship with former President George W. Bush serves as a reminder of how relationships should be during a time when America only sees all the \"nasty parts\" of political discourse.\n\nIn an interview released Wednesday on NBC, Obama told Bush's daughter, Jenna Bush Hager, who is also a correspondent on \"Today,\" that her relationship with Bush \"reminds us that we can get there with the right leadership and with the right tone setting and with each of us giving one another the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\n\"I'd love if we as a country could get back to the place where we didn't demonize people who disagreed with us,\" she added.\n\nBringing up a famous photo of the former president and Obama sharing a hug in 2016, Bush Hager asked Obama about her friendship with Bush.\n\nFormer US President George W. Bush receives a hug from US First Lady Michelle Obama on September 24, 2016 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"It's so interesting how people are so interested in y'all's friendship. I mean that hug was, like, the hug that went around the world,\" Bush Hager said. \"Why do you think people are so hungry for that, though?\" she asked Obama.\n\nRead More", "Mexico City (CNN) \u2014 Mexico City's love affair with food -- from street-side tacos to warm, fluffy tamales that give off a puff of aromatic steam when released from their husks -- is abiding and all-encompassing, and no trip here would be complete without a thorough exploration of the culinary riches the city has to offer.\n\nAt the beating heart of this passion is Mercado de la Merced, the city's largest market and one of its oldest.\n\nDotted throughout its extensive warrens are delicacies from across Mexico -- a huge variety of tastes and styles, from the straight-up delicious to dishes and ingredients not for the faint-stomached.\n\nAnd who better to provide insight and insider knowledge than a trained chef? Nico Garc\u00eda, who also works as a guide for Eat Mexico Culinary Tours , is originally from the city of Xalapa -- making him, as he points out, a Jalape\u00f1o -- but has been in Mexico City for nine years and knows the market inside out.\n\n\"It's an incredible place that you have to see and experience to truly grasp how massive and varied it is,\" he says.\n\nThe market's colors -- like these Miguelito candy powders -- are striking. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\n\"You can find pretty much anything you can think of and it's the oldest part of the city. The modern market was built in the late 1950s, but Merced has been a very active commercial area since the 1300s, and because of all this, it's one of the best places in the city to find traditional market food.\"\n\nTours are done only in small groups, especially on the busy weekends, as it is, first and foremost, a working market, and shoppers and vendors have no time for gawking tourists getting in the way. Basic safety precautions, like keeping wallets, cameras and jewelry unobtrusive, are part of a pre-tour emailed brief.\n\nThe combo you never knew you needed\n\nThe eating begins in earnest in the banquet\u00f3n, the large food hall that runs the perimeter of the market. The first stop is at -- given what's to come, the relatively prosaic -- McTeo, a market-stall taqueria that, if looked at charitably, pays homage to the king of fast food, Ronald McDonald.\n\nA less understanding interpretation might see lawyers from the burger giant descend on the market with a cease-and-desist order regarding the liberal use of the mascot to sell tacos, but this doesn't seem to have deterred the stall's cheery workers.\n\nThe specialty at Tacos McTeo is adding papas fritas -- French fries -- to their tacos. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nInstead, in a cloud of oily steam they relentlessly slice potato after potato directly into a vat of boiling oil to provide the papas fritas -- French fries -- that serve as a carb-y garnish for the delicious carne enchilada tacos with cactus and onion. It's the combination you never knew you needed.\n\nNico says that on a weekend day, they'll get through three 50-kilo (110 lb) sacks of potatoes, easy.\n\nAll in all the tour takes in as many as 11 stops, while also wandering through the market's cavernous, multiple-football-field sized halls, so there's little dawdling. A pit stop for fried tamales -- a specialty of the city -- sees Nico expound on one of the most ubiquitous of Mexican foods.\n\n\"A famous chef, Ricardo Mu\u00f1oz Zurita of the Azul restaurants, once tried to catalog every variation of tamal, throughout the whole country,\" he says. \"He had to give up when he realized that he'd write down one recipe, and the guy next door would tell him, 'yeah, but you can also make it like this,'\" indicating just the tiniest change. Unfazed, he eventually published his unfinished research in a cookbook.\n\nFive siblings, one taqueria\n\nEach stop involves one or two bites, but upon reaching Cinco Hermanos, the famed family-run taqueria, it's OK to pause a little longer.\n\nWidely recognized as some of the best tacos in the city, Nico says that the secret comes from the synergy of owning the adjoining butcher's shop -- affording the five siblings the choicest cuts to turn into mouthwatering suadero -- a cut of beef similar to brisket -- longaniza (sausage) or tripe tacos.\n\nCinco Hermanos is rightfully known as one of the best places to get tacos -- possibly in the entire city. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nThe meat is confited in a vat of bubbling oil, along with the small, sweet onions habitually served as full stops to the meal. A bunch of p\u00e1palo leaves, which are used as palate cleansers, is on hand, self-serve, for customers.\n\nHuge variety\n\nNico shows us market stalls where men thump down huge knives in quick drumbeat succession into huge cakes of chicharr\u00f3n prensado -- pressed pork -- deconstructing them once again for gorditas or to be added to salsas or tacos.\n\nNearby, small samples of mole -- encompassing a huge variety of shades from deep, rich chocolate to bright red, are offered and tasted.\n\nAn array of moles is available at Moles Dona Balbi. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nA few rows over, an impassive worker methodically -- and rapidly -- shaves the spines off nopales, the ubiquitous prickly pear cactus pads that are sold for less than a peso each.\n\nHe strips and preps each in seconds flat. \"He makes it look easy, but if I were to try to do that, each one would take at least a couple of minutes,\" Nico admits.\n\nMesoamerican ingredients\n\nWe are in front of one of the smallest stalls, a mere table top, stacked with old plastic jars and bags, opaque with age and use. Alongside them are open, shallow baskets filled with crickets and tiny orange crustaceans called acociles. This is Se\u00f1ora Edith's pre-Hispanic ingredients, a unique stop in La Merced's vastness.\n\nSe\u00f1ora Edith's is a tiny stall selling pre-Hispanic ingredients such as mosquito larvae, ants and stink bugs. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nNico points out dried mosquito eggs and larvae, alongside dried ants and worms and a bug known as cocopaches -- crispy on the outside but harboring a gooey interior.\n\nMost of these ancient ingredients, vital sources of protein in Mesoamerican diets, are handed over, and following a moment of trepidation, sampled.\n\nChapulines -- grasshoppers -- are a tasty snack that has survived since pre-Hispanic times. To the right are acociles, tiny shellfish. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nHead tacos\n\nBlinking in the bright Mexico City sun, the group exits the building -- one of the market's eight -- through a slim passageway and walks along a narrow, bustling alley.\n\nStalls selling kitchen utensils line the sides, bookending a battered taco stand, next to which, on an old, worn chopping block cratered through years of use, sits a partially dismembered cow's skull.\n\nWisps of hair and skin stick to it, and Nico says that while customers can usually choose their cut -- from a dizzying array including cheek, tongue, eyeball and eyelid, brain, snout and sweetbreads -- Sundays are too busy so everyone gets the same -- surtida, a mix of all of the above. He says that on a Sunday, they'll get through six entire heads.\n\nTacos de cabeza -- beef head tacos -- can be found outside the Nave Mayor, in the road that runs between the market and the meat section. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nThe tacos de cabeza -- literally, \"head tacos\" -- are complex in taste and texture, but it takes a certain concentration to ignore the fact that we're eating parts of the animal that, in the US or Europe, would normally be discarded.\n\nStill chewing the last of the sticky, flavorful meat we wander to our next stop, El Pollo, which serves us quesadillas de huitlacoche -- quesadillas served with corn smut, the musty, earthy fungus also known as \"Mexican truffle.\"\n\nIt's unique to the country -- elsewhere in the world smut is seen as a disease and farmers will destroy whole fields to rid their crop of the infestation, but here it is actively encouraged.\n\nHuge stacks of fruit and veg\n\nAnother wander through the halls ensues, past stacks of limes, avocados and the multicolored hues of Mexico's bountiful and varied vegetable crops. Another aisle is filled with huge sacks stuffed with dried chiles, the air redolent with their smokiness.\n\nStacks of limes and avocados bring vivid greens to the multicolored hues of the market. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nEn route through the vegetable section, Nico pauses and hands over a few coins to a woman standing beside a small cart. She hands back a few bulbs of garlic. \"Every time I'm on one of these tours, I make sure I find her here. This is the best garlic I know.\" And he says she sells it for about an eighth of the price of a supermarket.\n\nA basketful of habaneros in the vegetable section of the market. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nAnother building and, after a warning from Nico about the number of bees flying around the alleys, the group is plunged again into the bustling passageways.\n\nThis building, the Mercado de Dulces, is home to a bewildering selection of candies, many made with honey -- hence the bees.\n\nSmall candy skulls made of amaranth -- an ancient grain which predates the Hispanic era -- lie stacked alongside other skeleton-themed snacks ahead of the Day of the Dead. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nIrreplaceable staple\n\nEven then it's not over. We emerge from the market to check out a tortilleria, which churns out dozens of the staple a minute.\n\nThe flatbreads are so crucial to the Mexican diet that the government regulates the price -- currently around 17 pesos (90\u00a2) a kilo (2.2 lb). Nico says that the average Mexican eats as much as 55 kg (120 lb) of tortillas a year.\n\nUnusually, this place does its own nixtamalization, the complex processing of corn that allows humans to reap the full nutrition of the grain.\n\nThousands of tortillas are pressed every day in small tortillerias. The staple is regulated by the government. Euan McKirdy/CNN\n\nAround another corner, a hand-pulled ice cream cart, which offers delicious homemade flavors including horchata, cotija cheese with blackberries, passion fruit and lime sorbet.\n\nWe finally stagger into Rold\u00e1n 37, a restaurant set in a restored mansion atop an old dried chile warehouse, for a restorative tequila and a final quesadillita.", "(CNN) Tracy Grant was in a parking lot handing out hamburgers to evacuees from the devastating Camp Fire in Northern California when she encountered Lee Brundige.\n\nThe 93-year-old World War II veteran had just fled his house in Paradise by driving his own car as the wildfire was approaching.\n\n\"He called me the burger girl,\" Grant says. \"It took us about 24 hours to convince him to follow me home.\"\n\nThis was last Thursday in Oroville, about 11 miles south of the fire. Brundige told her he could sleep in his car that first night, and that's exactly what he did, despite Grant's protestations.\n\n\"I didn't like leaving him there, but he's very independent. So I made sure he had blankets and a pillow,\" Grant says. \"I stayed with him until about midnight.\"\n\nRead More", "02:19\n\n\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0635\u0646\u0639\u062a \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0629", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa defensa intenta mostrar a Guzm\u00e1n Loera como una figura sin tanto poder como se le ha atribuido\n\nLa Fiscal\u00eda hab\u00eda solicitado que el juez de la causa desestimara los argumentos del abogado de Guzm\u00e1n Loera\n\n(CNN) - El juez en el caso del narcotraficante Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzman Loera neg\u00f3 este mi\u00e9rcoles la solicitud de los fiscales de descartar la declaraci\u00f3n inicial de la defensa.\n\n\n\nLa Fiscal\u00eda hab\u00eda solicitado que el juez de la causa desestimara los argumentos del abogado de Guzm\u00e1n Loera que acusa autoridades mexicanas de recibir sobornos de parte de Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, incluidos el presidente Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto y el expresidente Felipe Calder\u00f3n.

That fall came just 24 hours after Saudi Arabia promised to pump fewer barrels in December and threw its weight behind a proposal for OPEC to cut production by one million barrels per day.\n\n\"Normally talk of Saudi production cuts would help to support the price of crude,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. But other factors, such as soaring US production, are \"exerting an even stronger influence,\" he added.\n\nAnother factor is President Donald Trump's decision to allow some countries to continue buying Iranian oil for six months following the reintroduction of US sanctions on November 5.\n\nMembers of the OPEC cartel and Russia agreed in June to pump more oil to make up for the anticipated loss of Iranian exports. The Trump administration's decision to grant temporary waivers caught them by surprise.\n\nThey'll regroup in Vienna on December 6 to determine their next move, and they may have to deliver a bigger cut than the one suggested by Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih earlier this week.\n\n'Signs of an imbalance'\n\nReuters reported that OPEC and its partners are discussing cutting supply by as much as 1.4 million barrels per day in 2019 to avert a glut that would weigh on prices.\n\n\"We will do whatever it takes to sustain the stability that we have achieved,\" OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo told CNN Business' Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios.\n\nThe International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday that supply is expected to exceed demand through 2019. In its monthly market report, OPEC said global demand for its oil next year would be about 1.1 million barrels per day less than in 2018, and 1.4 million below current OPEC production.\n\n\"At the moment, the market looks balanced in the fourth quarter, but going into 2019, there are signs of a resurgence of an imbalance which we are determined to stay the course,\" Barkindo said.\n\nOPEC may need to work hard to persuade Russia to cut supply.\n\nRussia's energy minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday it was too early to make a decision to reverse course.\n\nMembers of OPEC are \"working the phones ... to ensure that we build this consensus before they arrive in Vienna,\" Barkindo said.\n\nIf OPEC and its allies cut, it would mean a win for American shale producers . US oil production continues to reach new record highs. US output topped 11 million barrels per day in August, making it the world's biggest producer.\n\nThe United States is \"more than compensating for falls in production in Iran, Venezuela and elsewhere,\" the IEA said in its report on Wednesday.\n\nFollowing the \"jaw-dropping\" growth in August, when US output climbed by nearly three million barrels per day over the same month last year, the United States \"shows little sign of slowing down,\" the IEA added.\n\nIt expects US output to increase by 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018, and another 1.3 million next year.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

caer\u00e1 el hacha o qui\u00e9n la llevar\u00e1.\n\nUn nuevo d\u00eda de despidos y furia que culmin\u00f3 en un asombroso juego de poder de la primera dama, Melania Trump, profundiz\u00f3 la ya hist\u00f3rica disfunci\u00f3n en el Gobierno el martes, dejando a los altos funcionarios cegados y confundidos.\n\nIncluso en comparaci\u00f3n con los altos cargos del personal, la agitaci\u00f3n burocr\u00e1tica y el caos furioso que es la normalidad en la Casa Blanca del presidente Donald Trump, su repentina acci\u00f3n contra una alta funcionaria de pol\u00edtica exterior fue una bomba.\n\nMIRA: \u00bfQui\u00e9n es Mira Ricardel y por qu\u00e9 Melania Trump la quiere fuera de la Casa Blanca?\n\nEn una declaraci\u00f3n p\u00fablica que sali\u00f3 de la nada, la oficina de la primera dama advirti\u00f3 que la vice asesora de seguridad nacional, Mira Ricardel, con quien, seg\u00fan informes, se enfrent\u00f3 por un reciente viaje a \u00c1frica, \"ya no merece el honor de servir en esta Casa Blanca\".\n\nSu dram\u00e1tica intervenci\u00f3n provoc\u00f3 la especulaci\u00f3n de que la primera dama estaba en desacuerdo con su marido, estaba sobrepasando su papel y que el Ala Este se estaba deshaciendo. Melania Trump ya hab\u00eda dicho en una entrevista en ABC el mes pasado que no confiaba en algunos empleados de la Casa Blanca. Ahora, ella est\u00e1 haciendo algo al respecto.\n\nUna persona le dijo a CNN que, incre\u00edblemente, Trump, el secretario general de la Casa Blanca, John Kelly, y la secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Sarah Sanders, no ten\u00edan idea de que llegar\u00eda la declaraci\u00f3n.\n\nNo es raro que la incomodidad aceche a la Casa Blanca despu\u00e9s de una p\u00e9rdida de las elecciones intermedias, ya que los empleados agotados por la primera mitad del mandato del presidente dan paso a tropas m\u00e1s frescas. Y el martes no fue la primera vez que una primera dama presion\u00f3 a su marido sobre un miembro del personal que ella encuentra irritante.\n\nPero el temperamento vol\u00e1til de este presidente y el nido de v\u00edboras que es su Ala Oeste ha infligido m\u00e1s presi\u00f3n sobre su personal de lo que es normal incluso en la Casa Blanca, donde las crisis siempre est\u00e1n a la vuelta de la esquina.\n\nVarios miembros del gabinete, incluida la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen, son objeto de ataques por susurros, filtraciones y especulaciones sobre su destino mientras hay especulaci\u00f3n sobre sus posibles reemplazos.\n\nSe dice que Kelly, que ha sobrevivido a varias rondas de rumores sobre su partida, a menudo supuestamente inminente, se dirige a la salida de nuevo. Y los informes filtrados de que Trump ve a Ryan Zinke como vulnerable a la supervisi\u00f3n dem\u00f3crata han debilitado la posici\u00f3n del secretario del Interior.\n\nMientras tanto, Trump est\u00e1 atrincherado en su nombramiento constitucionalmente cuestionable de Matthew Whitaker, un cr\u00edtico de Robert Mueller, para supervisar la investigaci\u00f3n del fiscal especial como secretario de Justicia interino despu\u00e9s de que despidieran a Jeff Sessions.\n\nSe esperaba que Sanders se fuera, junto con su adjunto Raj Shah, pero su estado sigue siendo incierto.\n\nMIRA: Michelle Obama dice que Melania Trump declin\u00f3 su ofrecimiento de ayuda\n\nM\u00e1s que la agitaci\u00f3n habitual del personal\n\nTrump usa el caos como un instrumento de poder personal, dejando a todos inseguros de lo que suceder\u00e1 a continuaci\u00f3n, mientras se sienta en el centro de la tormenta listo para hacer su pr\u00f3ximo movimiento.\n\nLa alteraci\u00f3n de los rumores en Washington, al mismo tiempo que confunde al establishment pol\u00edtico y las percepciones de c\u00f3mo debe funcionar una Casa Blanca, permite al presidente mantener la fe en su base pol\u00edtica.\n\nAs\u00ed que la intriga ha sido parte del gobierno desde el principio, junto con las narrativas de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n sobre que Trump dirige su Casa Blanca como un reality show y est\u00e1 constantemente disparando distracciones para que los reporteros vayan tras ellas.\n\nPero la turbulencia actual y el sentido de que las normas presidenciales se rompen por un presidente emocional y err\u00e1tico se sienten diferentes a las salvajes intrigas del personal al principio de la presidencia. Est\u00e1 empezando a generar preguntas reales sobre lo que est\u00e1 reservado para la naci\u00f3n durante la segunda mitad del mandato de Trump.\n\nParece seguro que Trump emerger\u00e1 de este momento altamente cargado con menos restricciones si los altos funcionarios que han tratado de mantenerlo dentro de los l\u00edmites de la costumbre presidencial y la ley se retiran.\n\nEs posible que tenga m\u00e1s libertad para seguir un curso impredecible en el que a veces parece repasar las convenciones de gobierno y las barreras de seguridad constitucionales que a menudo parece que ni siquiera est\u00e1n all\u00ed.\n\nEsto podr\u00eda ser un problema creciente cuando el gobierno enfrenta un repentino estallido de investigaciones de la nueva C\u00e1mara dem\u00f3crata, una realidad para la cual la negligencia de los republicanos les ha dejado profundamente mal preparados.\n\nY hay una buena posibilidad de que Trump se distraiga a\u00fan m\u00e1s con la investigaci\u00f3n de Mueller con la especulaci\u00f3n que se est\u00e1 calentando sobre posibles nuevas acusaciones y el contenido del tan esperado informe final del fiscal especial.\n\nMIRA: La oficina de la primera dama de EE.UU. pide boicotear al rapero T.I. por un \"repugnante\" video sobre Melania Trump\n\nEl martes, con su Casa Blanca alborotada, estaba sentado con sus abogados para responder a las preguntas escritas formuladas por Mueller, un momento cr\u00edtico potencial para su presidencia.\n\nSorprendentemente, el presidente a\u00fan tiene que enfrentar una gran crisis internacional que no precipit\u00f3, como una llamada militar cercana con un adversario importante o una crisis financiera, que requerir\u00e1 un liderazgo centrado e inequ\u00edvoco y un equipo que funcione con unidad y prop\u00f3sito. Eso parece una posibilidad poco probable en esta Casa Blanca.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de todo, funcionarios como Nielsen y Kelly han puesto su propia reputaci\u00f3n en el lugar, defendiendo las pol\u00e9micas pol\u00edticas del presidente sobre inmigraci\u00f3n, solo para que \u00e9l las cambiara al final.\n\nEn este momento, los \u00fanicos empleados de la Casa Blanca que podr\u00edan considerarse seguros son sus parientes: su hija Ivanka y su yerno Jared Kushner.\n\nPero el peligro de dirigir un ala oeste en el modelo nepotista del negocio de Trump se ha aclarado recientemente con la crisis por el asesinato del periodista saud\u00ed Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nEl asesinato, que caus\u00f3 indignaci\u00f3n global, est\u00e1 siendo ampliamente atribuido a Mohammad bin Salman, el pr\u00edncipe Heredero a quien Kushner apoy\u00f3 en la pol\u00edtica de Medio Oriente.\n\nMelania Trump muestra su poder\n\nEl golpe del martes de la primera dama fue notable. En una demostraci\u00f3n de fuerza que aparentemente se estaba gestando durante d\u00edas, hizo que la posici\u00f3n de Ricardel fuera insostenible.\n\nEn una pizca de intriga adicional, Melania Trump le retorci\u00f3 el cuchillo al asesor de seguridad nacional, John Bolton, quien ha forjado su merecida reputaci\u00f3n como un asesino burocr\u00e1tico despiadado, y quien estaba fuera de la acci\u00f3n a casi 16.000 kil\u00f3metros de distancia, en Singapur.\n\nNo fue la primera vez que un miembro del personal del ala oeste pag\u00f3 el precio por haberse peleado con una primera dama.\n\nMIRA: Encuesta: Melania Trump tiene mejor aceptaci\u00f3n que su marido\n\nLos chismes a menudo rebosaban sobre la mala voluntad entre Nancy Reagan y el ex jefe de personal de la Casa Blanca Don Regan. George Stephanopoulos escribi\u00f3 en sus memorias sobre los enfrentamientos con Hillary Clinton cuando prest\u00f3 servicio en la Casa Blanca de su marido. Y a menudo se hablaba de tensi\u00f3n entre Michelle Obama y el primer secretario de Prensa de su esposo, Robert Gibbs.\n\nPero es dif\u00edcil encontrar un precedente para el despido p\u00fablico, y categ\u00f3rico de Ricardel por Melania Trump, un golpe que ejemplific\u00f3 la voluntad de la primera dama de mostrar su peso pol\u00edtico.\n\nSin embargo, Marc Short, el ex enlace del Congreso con Trump, le dijo a Erin Burnett de CNN que, si bien su movimiento no ten\u00eda precedentes, no era probable que comenzara una nueva tendencia.\n\nUna fuente le dijo a Jeff Zeleny de la CNN que Trump, a quien a menudo le resulta dif\u00edcil despedir a las personas en persona, hab\u00eda decidido que Ricardel ten\u00eda que irse, aunque se le estaba dando tiempo para limpiar su escritorio.\n\nAlgunas fuentes de la Casa Blanca pintaron una imagen de Ricardel como alguien con quien es dif\u00edcil de trabajar y dijeron que hab\u00eda protagonizado muchas peleas desde que subi\u00f3 a bordo en abril.\n\n\"Ella atravesar\u00eda un muro de ladrillos por ti, pero su personalidad no es para todos\", dijo otro funcionario.\n\nSin embargo, Ricardel a\u00fan no ha tenido la oportunidad de contar su propia historia. Y el tono de cualquier Casa Blanca se establece desde arriba, y no hay duda de que hay pocos lugares m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles para trabajar en Estados Unidos.\n\n- Kate Bennett, Pamela Brown, Jeremy Diamond, Jeff Zeleny y Sarah Westwood de CNN contribuyeron a este informe.", "Warner Media, LLC (formerly, Time Warner Inc.)\n\nWarner Media, LLC (formerly Time Warner Inc. )(\"WarnerMedia\" or the \"Company\"), a leading media and entertainment company with businesses in television networks and film and TV entertainment, is formed and headquartered in the United States.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "(CNN) From October 16 to November 6 -- aka Election Day -- President Donald Trump sent 45 tweets mentioning the \"border\" between the United States and Mexico. Between October 16 and October 31, he sent nine tweets referring to the \"caravan\" of migrants making their way across Mexico.\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nSince November 6 -- 8 days and counting -- Trump hasn't mentioned the so-called caravan once in a tweet. He has used the word \"border\" a single time -- in a tweet on November 9 in which Trump tweeted out a link to a \"Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States\" that said, essentially, that he was trying to push people entering the country illegally to specified ports of entry.\n\nThat discrepancy between Trump's rhetoric in the runup to the election and his rhetoric after it exposes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, what most neutral observers initially suspected: That Trump's decision to seize on the caravan of migrants making their way across Mexico in hopes of entering the United States was 100% a political ploy to rev up his base.\n\nTo read Trump's tweets or listen to one of his speeches at the slew of campaign rallies in the final week of the midterm campaign, you would have thought that the caravan -- a horde of pillaging intruders -- was on the verge of crossing into the United States, intent on destroying everything in its path.\n\n\"If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you'd better vote Republican,\" he told a crowd in Missouri on November 2 . Time and time again over those final days, Trump repeated this mantra: \"This will be the election of Kavanaugh, the caravans, law and order, tax cuts, and common sense.\"\n\nAnd to some extent, Trump's strategy worked. Roughly 1 in 4 voters said that immigration was the most important issue facing the country, according to the 2018 exit polls ; 75% of that group voted for Republicans in the House while just 23% voted for the Democrat. Fear, as Trump learned in the 2016 election, is an extremely powerful political motivator. There were anecdotes from all over the country as the campaign came to a close in which voters said they were very worried about the group of migrants storming into the United States and endangering them and their way of life.\n\nThis quote, from Carol Shields, a 75-year-old woman living in northern Minnesota, to The New York Times about the idea of members of the group occupying peoples' lake houses in the state is indicative of the effectiveness of the fear Trump stoked.\n\n\"What's to stop them? We have a lot of people who live on lakes in the summer and winter someplace else. When they come back in the spring, their house would be occupied.\"\n\n(Sidebar: While Trump's use of immigration to scare his base into voting clearly had some effect on turnout, it wasn't determinative. Democrats, spurred by their base's deep distaste for Trump, scored major gains at the House, gubernatorial and state legislative levels while holding their own with a very difficult Senate election map .)\n\nTo be clear: There was NEVER any evidence that what Trump was saying about the caravan was true. When Trump began to talk about the migrants -- in mid-October -- they had just crossed into Mexico and were hundreds of miles from the US border. Trump's claim that \"criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in\" with the group lacked any proof. (Pressed later on that idea, Trump admitted \"there's no proof of anything but they could very well be.\")\n\nBut now, with the election eight days in our rear-view mirror -- and with only a handful of uncalled races remaining -- the bald cynicism of Trump's rhetoric on the migrants, and his decision to send 5,000 US troops to protect the border , is totally revealed.\n\nIf the caravan was such a threat to the country in the middle of October -- so much so that Trump dispatched troops to the border to deal with the \"threat\" -- then how can they be less of a threat today? They're closer to the border today than they were three weeks ago, right? Right. In fact, on Tuesday, the leading edge of the caravan -- those traveling in buses -- reached the border crossing near Tijuana\n\nAnd yet, silence from Trump. If this was truly a major threat to our country's safety and well-being, wouldn't you expect the President of the United States, who built his entire presidential campaign around his tough stance on illegal immigration, to be speaking out forcefully right about now? Of course you would.\n\nThat Trump hasn't said a word about the caravan since the election is proof positive that this was all a political ploy from beginning to end. Trump was worried that the GOP base wasn't as fired up as the Democratic one -- and, rightly, was worried that such a passion disparity could lead to major losses in the 2018 election. So when he saw the news that a group of migrants was moving toward the United States, he seized on it and wouldn't let go. Until, that is, the election ended.", "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department issued a defense of President Donald Trump's controversial appointment of Matt Whitaker as acting attorney general Wednesday, offering several reasons why the appointment is consistent with the Constitution, federal statutes and past precedent.\n\nThe memo provides a robust legal justification for Whitaker's right to lead the Justice Department, which includes ultimate oversight authority over special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nIn a 20-page memo addressed to the White House from DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel -- the chief legal interpreter of federal law for the administration -- the department concludes that:\n\n* Whitaker's appointment is consistent with the plain terms of the Vacancies Reform Act, \"because he had been serving in the Department of Justice at a sufficiently senior pay level for over a year\" as the statute requires.\n\n* Whitaker is only serving on a temporary basis, so he wasn't required to be confirmed by the Senate ahead of his selection last week, though the Justice Department acknowledged that situation had not come up in over a century.

Blue Apron laid off 6% of its staff in October 2017.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that the most recent job cuts would cost it about $1.6 million in severance charges during the fourth quarter but it would also save $16 million in personnel expenses next year.\n\nBlue Apron needs every dollar in savings that it can get. It was once synonymous with the meal kit delivery business, delivering boxes of fresh ingredients and menus to amateur gourmands.\n\nBut shares of Blue Apron ( APRN ) have tanked since the IPO because of concerns about increased competition.

Blue Apron has made the conscious decision to spend less on marketing -- its ad expenses were down more than 30% in the quarter -- to eke out a profit.\n\nBut cost cutting won't be enough to get Blue Apron back on track. The company either needs to attract a lot more foodies or get existing ones to spend a lot more.\n\nTotal sales fell 28% from a year ago.

In China, there are signs of a deepening economic malaise.\n\nThe reasons for the weak performance are varied, and economists believe that both Germany and Japan will dodge recessions by returning to growth soon. But the data underscore the major challenges faced by many of the world's largest economies.\n\nGermany's economy shrank for the first time since 2015 in the third quarter. It was hit by new auto emissions testing procedures that slowed car sales and a decline in exports, partly due to the US-China trade war.\n\nThe car certification bottleneck is expected to ease, but economists say export growth could weaken further because of reduced demand from major trading partners such as Turkey , Russia and China.\n\nJapan is much more accustomed to economic stagnation, and even recessions, but the outlook there is brighter. Its lackluster third quarter was caused by natural disasters, and economists expect consumer spending to spike this quarter ahead of a planned sales tax hike next October.\n\nIn China, the world's second largest economy, new data Wednesday revealed weaker consumption growth, subdued confidence and disappointing credit growth. Economists expect the government to ramp up stimulus measures to mitigate the effects of a trade war with the United States.\n\n\"We believe the worse is yet to come, with growth slowing faster into spring 2019,\" Ting Lu, chief China economist at investment bank Nomura, wrote in a research note.\n\nAnd despite the prospect of a rebound in Germany and Japan before the end of this year, the global economy is also heading for a weaker 2019.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund expects global growth to slow to 2.5% in 2019 from 2.9% this year.\n\nRisks clouding the global outlook include the trade war and the impact of US interest rate hikes on emerging markets.

The event brought in $317.8 million in total.\n\nIn his early years, Hopper -- who died in 1967 -- studied painting at the New York School of Art under the guidance of artist Robert Henri. Throughout his lifetime, Hopper followed Henri's advice: to paint the city life he knew best.

He told CNN he had his first paid fight just a year after that.\n\nAfter Anucha's death, he says he received a lot of vitriol on social media, but also enormous support.\n\nTo honor Anucha's memory, he's participating in the boy's cremation ceremony as a novice monk; Thais can temporarily join a monastery.\n\nHowever the death of his opponent has not deterred him from stepping into the ring.\n\n\"I want to continue on this road as a Muay Thai boxer, and see how far I can go,\" he said.\n\nShining light on the issue\n\nActivists and doctors have tried several times to amend the child boxing bill, but their attempts have never been successful, said Dr. Witaya Sungkarat, chief of the Thai Child Boxers Research Project at Mahidol University, adding that the news of Anucha's death has just shone a big light on this issue again.\n\n\"We have never recommended a total ban of Muay Thai boxing,\" said Sungkarat. \"But we want them to avoid hitting the head of the child until they are at least 15 years old.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHis institute has carried out research scanning the brains of children who take part in Muay Thai and comparing them against children who don't.\n\nThe result has clearly shown that brain development of kids who don't compete in Muay Thai are different from kids whose heads were hit in matches, said Sungkarat.

To each, their own. The different ways run the gamut.\n\nFor example, do you have an unusually powerful fascination with Bugs Bunny?\n\nWell then, you might be a furry.\n\nJUST WATCHED Revealing a furry alter ego Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Revealing a furry alter ego 01:04\n\nMaybe you like to doodle original animal characters that reflect your alter-ego or persona, aka your \"fursona.\"\n\nAgain, you could be a furry.\n\nWhat if you love your animal character so much you want to wear a costume of it?\n\nYou very well may be a furry.\n\nFor many furries, putting on their costume sparks a fascinating metamorphosis.\n\nTake longtime furry Joe Strike. When he puts on his reptilian costume, Strike transforms from self-described \"pretty mellow guy\" to a character he calls Komos.\n\n\"I become very sinister \u2014 very forceful and intimidating,\" says Strike, author of a book on the fandom called \"Furry Nation. \" \"It's so much fun to become that other person \u2014 this kind of mysterious, alluring character. Some women really take a shine to him and it's really a blast.\"\n\nBecause the colorful furry costumes get the most attention in the media, it supports the perception that furries are all about costumes. But they're not.\n\nIn fact, the co-founder of the first furry convention doesn't own a costume at all.\n\nYouTube furry video host Stormi Folf.\n\n\"If you honestly believe that furry fandom is about costuming, then you've missed the point,\" says Rod Stansfield, perhaps better known in the community by his pen name, Rod O'Riley. \"Saying furry fandom is about wearing fur suits is like saying 'Star Trek' fandom is about wearing pointy ears.\"\n\nOriginal 'ConFurence'\n\nIn the 1980s, Stansfield and his partner Mark Merlino \u2014 during visits to science fiction conventions \u2014 realized the furry fandom was becoming a bigger thing of its own. By 1989 they organized an \"experiment\" they called ConFurence Zero at a Holiday Inn in Garden Grove, California: the first known \"furry convention and seminar.\"\n\nAlthough only 65 people showed up, including only two or three in costume, ConFurence Zero started a movement of sorts.\n\nIt gave momentum to the fandom, later resulting in similar conventions such as Califur, Canada's VancouFur , Australia's ConFurgence Eurofurence and Anthrocon, which is now held yearly in Pittsburgh. Last summer's Anthrocon, one of the biggest, drew about 8,400 people, including nearly 2,000 in costumes, according to the event website.\n\n\"We don't feel like furry fandom is something we created, it's something that was there,\" Stansfield says. \"We were just the guys who introduced it to itself. We just came up with a goofy new way for fans to talk to each other \u2014 actually meeting, face to face. People took that and ran with it.\"\n\nThree decades later the fury fandom is much bigger, using the power of the internet to reach out, organize, engage with each other and share \u2014 via videos, podcasts and art.\n\nPocari Roo, Barton Fox and Stormi Folf are just a few of many furries who host video channels on YouTube discussing fursonas, affordable fursuits and other topics. \"I simply want to help the world understand our fandom a little better,\" says Stormi Folf, who prefers to use his fursona \"for reasons of privacy and safety.\"\n\n\"I'm known as a furry but only family and close friends know my real name,\" he said.\n\nMany furry fans create and share art depicting animal characters with human traits.\n\nFurry lingo\n\nIt's a subculture just like any other \u2014 including unique terminology.\n\nFor example, a \"greymuzzle\" is an older member of the furry fandom.\n\n\"Bronies\" are fans of the \"My Little Pony\" toy, TV and movie franchise.\n\nA \"therian\" is someone who feels an intense spiritual identification with a nonhuman animal.\n\nA \"babyfur\" is interested in age play and young or childlike characters.\n\nMilfurs are furries who are current or past members of the military.\n\nHere's one more: Furries who are into costumes are called fursuiters. And yes, #FursuitFriday is a real hashtag on social media.\n\nThe fandom has grown big enough to get the attention of academia. A group of scholars has established a continuing research project at furscience.com tracking furry attitudes and backgrounds by asking them to answer questions on surveys.\n\n\"Demographically, it's mostly white. They tend to be sort of middle class and they tend to be what you think of as nerds,\" says MacEwan University instructor Dr. Courtney Plante, who runs the study along with researchers at Niagara County Community College, Texas A&M University and other universities.\n\nThe project's website says more than 75% of furries are under age 25 and about a third identify as \"exclusively heterosexual.\"\n\nSixty percent of furries who answered surveys reported part-time or full-time enrollment in postsecondary education.\n\n\"They often like video games, computer games, board games, anime, science fiction, fantasy,\" Plante says.\n\nDancing is also big among fursuiters. In addition to costume dance events at conventions, nightspots have been getting involved. For more than a year now the Eagle Bolt Bar in Minneapolis has been hosting \"Suit Up Saturday,\" where 20-30 fursuiters, show up every week, the bar says.\n\nAn overwhelming percentage, 84%, identify as male.\n\nA female artist in the community who calls herself InkTiger says the mostly male fandom hasn't been a big problem for her. \"There's some sexism in the fandom, as there is in any other part of society. I don't think it's any more pronounced in furry than anywhere else.\"\n\nBut what does research say about fursuiters and sexual fetishes?\n\n\"We find that, with most furries and their fur suits, there's no sexual element to it for the vast majority of fursuiters,\" says Plante. \"It's because they want to be a cartoon character in the real world.\"\n\nBut just like any other group, furries acknowledge a small element of sexual activity during gatherings. In the community it's known as \"yiffing.\"\n\n\"Yiffing can refer to anything from affectionate hugging or nuzzling to totally going at it,\" says Strike. \"It's definitely part of the fandom but it's not what the fandom is all about. If I had to throw a percentage on it I would say maybe 15%, give or take.\"\n\nStansfield, co-founder of the first convention, says it's sad the furry fandom is mischaracterized as a \"sex style.\"\n\n\"Everything created by human beings has some degree of what people think is attractive \u2014 and attractive is a big, broad unquantifiable word \u2014 however you define that.\"\n\nCan the furry fandom heal?\n\nA lot of furries have some kind of bullying history. Researchers found they reported \"significantly more bullying than the average person.\" According to furscience.com, 61.7% of furries reported being bullied from the ages 11-18.\n\nCompare that with bullying rates among US students grades 6-12. About 28% have reported being bullied, according to stopbullying.gov . Internationally, a World Health Organization survey of 35 countries found 34% of all young people reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months.\n\nJUST WATCHED There are 'furries' of all ages Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH There are 'furries' of all ages 01:35\n\n\"Research shows that furries benefit from ... interaction with like-minded others in a recreational environment, which is associated with greater self-esteem and greater life satisfaction,\" the website says. Experts don't know if this benefit within furry culture attracts victims of bullying but it could contribute to helping bullying victims heal.\n\nStrike explains it this way: \"When they put on the fur suit and they become somebody else, it is very liberating. You've sort of left behind that human person with all those inhibitions and problems. You become this kind of free spirit. You become somebody else who you're not the rest of the time.\"\n\nThe fandom tends to be shy, Plante says. Costumes make it easier to socialize \"without fear of being judged.\"\n\nBottom line: Research shows that for the most part, they may be more \"normal\" than you think. \"The interesting part of the story is just how surprisingly normal furries can be despite having a strange hobby,\" says Plante.\n\nThe future of furries\n\nThe future looks bright for the furry fandom. Plante estimates the fandom is between 100,000 and 1 million people \u2014 and growing. \"I don't think it will ever become mainstream, because it's an unusual hobby to have. But I think as time goes on, it will be normalized in the way 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars' fans became normalized, in the way 'Lord of the Rings' fans became normalized.\"\n\nIf normalization does come via movies, Stansfield hopes technology will pave the way for it by making it cheaper and easier for furries to make Hollywood-quality films.\n\n\"The turning point will be when we get to the level where a fan can make a Pixar movie in their garage,\" he says. \"When that happens, more and more of the entertainment community is going to notice.\"", "Inside a beautiful multi-million-dollar house in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company set up a model smart home outfitted with every Google device and connected home gadget imaginable.\n\nThe one-day demo highlighted an assortment of new Google Assistant features coming in the weeks ahead. There are recipe recommendations on smart displays and custom alarms for children recorded by actors from popular cartoons.\n\nThe tour was also a chance to see how Google ( GOOGL ) imagines people living, parenting and even sleeping surrounded by its products.\n\nSmart speakers have given new life to the smart home market, which was struggling to move past its early-adopter beginnings before Amazon's ( AMZN ) voice assistant Alexa came along. Now the major companies, including Amazon , Samsung, Apple ( AAPL ) and Google, are fighting to lure customers into their own ecosystems.\n\nThe assistant personalities are different, but the applications are mostly the same.\n\nIn Google's model home, most appliances are either internet-connected or plugged into a smart plug that lets you turn them on with a voice command. Communication is constant and everywhere \u2014 between rooms and family members who aren't in the house.\n\nA feature lets a member of the household broadcast a message to every room, such as \"I'll be home in 20 minutes, start the rice maker.\" It'll now let the person at home reply, so it's like a phone call or text message conversation but through speakers.\n\nIn addition, Google smart displays will now show recommended recipes based on the time of day and year. If you make a mess while cooking, just ask Google to send out the robotic vacuum.\n\nParenting is the newest hot area for voice assistants, and the Google house was set up to show how it could work for a family with kids. Ask Google Assistant to read your children a bedtime story, and it can tell them stories about Dora the Explorer and PAW Patrol. If you'd prefer to read your kids a book yourself, you can ask Google Assistant to \"read along\" with a book it knows and it will play matching music and sound effects in the background.\n\nParents are increasingly using alarms to help time kids' screen time, tooth brushing or studying. To build on this, Google Assistant is adding alarms voiced by characters from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and LEGO City. If you want to wake up your children without walking to their room, you could ask Google to turn up the lights or play music in their room while you sip coffee downstairs.\n\nUpstairs in the master bedroom, adults can unwind by asking Google to put their phone on silent mode. The next morning, an alarm will go off and trigger a routine, automatically starting a coffee maker near the bed and reciting the day's weather and headlines.\n\nVoice assistants may have started in a single room for playing music, but Google's house previews a future where almost every room has an always-listening microphone, a speaker, camera and a screen of some sort. (There was no bathroom demo on the tour, but it's safe to say they'll be there soon too.)\n\nThe future Google is selling can seem unnecessary and sometimes pricey, but it could be incredibly convenient for a busy family.

The coming years will allow us to evaluate where we stand.\"\n\nThe excavations started in the area in 2013 and were centered on the rich Hellenistic and Roman burial sites surrounding the city, where archaeologists discovered nine new tombs this year.\n\nFindings from the Hellenistic and Roman period in the vicinity of Chiliomodi Credit: Greek Culture Ministry\n\nThe team, however, also excavated extensive building facilities in a 672-meter square area for the first time this year, which are believed to be remnants of the ancient city itself.\n\nKorka said that her team found key clues of the city's presence, including children buried in the foundations of walls. \"We found child burials; during the Roman times it was very strict where you bury the dead, and only babies were allowed to be kept inside buildings in the city -- all the rest had to be buried outside,\" she said.\n\nThe team also excavated a series of buildings, where they found organized rooms with housing facilities and door openings.\n\nInside the buildings, archaeologists found portions of clay, marble and stone floors, along with well-crafted walls, some of which were covered in mortar.\n\nBronze Age discovery: Is this Britain's Pompeii?\n\nThey also discovered a large storage jar, a pythamphorae, along with a 3.5-meter section of a long clay pipeline, believed to have been used for sewage.\n\nKorka said that researchers may have also uncovered the presence of an atrium, with architraves, columns and other architectural features located in the interior of the structures. The lead archaeologist described the city's construction as \"luxurious\" and noted that the buildings were \"very strong and very well done.\"\n\nThe ancient city of Tenea was founded approximately 9 miles south-east of Corinth and 12 miles north-east of Mycenae shortly after the Trojan war. The first inhabitants of the city are believed to have been Trojan prisoners of war, who were permitted to build their own town by Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, in the aftermath of the battle.\n\nKorka explained that the team discovered indications of the city's significant wealth, including 200 rare coins dating from early Hellenistic to the late Roman times.\n\nSeveral of these coins belong to the Emperor Septimius Severus (193-211 BC), which indicate that the settlement likely experienced particular economic growth during his dynasty.\n\nKorka said that her team will continue to excavate areas surrounding the current finds, and aim to slowly develop a topographical map of the city. The archaeologists will also focus on new branches of research, including exploring the effects of endemic diseases on ancient populations.", "(CNN) Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman announced his resignation on Wednesday and called for early elections because of his opposition to a ceasefire deal between Israel and Gaza that brought an end to the worst fighting since the 2014 war.\n\nCalling the ceasefire \"giving in to terror,\" the hard-line leader of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party said at an afternoon news conference in Jerusalem: \"We are buying quiet for a short time at a very high price for long-term security.\"\n\n\"From my perspective, what happened yesterday -- the ceasefire yesterday -- with all of the arrangements with Hamas, is giving in to terror.

For example, those cities submitted a comprehensive request for information (RFI) from Amazon following the company's site visits, containing a multitude of detailed questions about talent, real estate, regulations and more.\n\nAmazon itself has said it would use the information from the process when considering opening new facilities, such as warehouses and smaller corporate offices.\n\nAnd that's already happening. On Tuesday, the company announced that it would open an East Coast hub in Nashville, which was on the HQ2 short list. It will hire 5,000 workers for the facility, which will focus on customer fulfillment, transportation and supply chain activities. (The announcement came at the same time as Amazon's HQ2 decision : New York's Long Island City neighborhood and Virginia's Arlington will split duty as its second headquarters.)\n\nEven contenders not on the short list are already getting investments from Amazon. Since the HQ2 search started, Amazon has announced fulfillment centers in Spokane, Washington, and Ottawa, as well as a new office in Vancouver with jobs in fields like machine learning and cloud computing.\n\nAmazon also could use the information obtained in the HQ2 process to better pinpoint where the best talent is located in the United States.\n\n\"At the heart of this is talent,\" said UVA's Lenox. \"Having a better understanding of where talent may reside across the US is valuable to them.

They'll also get a personal car parking space, plus a direct line to the Corinthia's concierge with 24/7 room service.\n\nThe apartment is 3,703 square foot. Courtesy Wetherell\n\nIt's on the market via Mayfair realtors Wetherell , whose chief exec, Peter Wetherell, describes it as, \"designed for exquisite luxury living and elegant entertaining.\"\n\nThe property has historic significance -- it was a government building until the late 1980s for the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and was the site where Winston Churchill announced rationing during World War II.\n\nLuxury building\n\nIt's not clear whether the $14 million price tag includes unlimted hotel soaps.

But they do mean the scientists must redo their calculations.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature on November 1, found that \"ocean warming is at the high end of previous estimates.\" The researchers, led by Laure Resplandy of Princeton University, used precise measurements of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide between 1991 and 2016 to produce an independent estimate of ocean heat uptake over that period.\n\nSince publication, two problems had come to their attention, Keeling said, one of them related to incorrectly treating systematic errors in the measurements of oxygen.\n\n\"We expect the combined effect of these two corrections to have a small impact on our calculations of overall heat uptake, but with larger margins of error,\" said Keeling. \"We are

with 82% of the bloc's energy supply still coming from fossil fuels, a new report has warned.\n\nOf the countries, only India has set targets that would keep global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, the upper limit recommended by the Paris Climate Agreement, if adopted globally.\n\nOverall, the world is heading for a 3.2-degree rise, the organization Climate Transparency said , in an analysis of the G20's current emissions-cutting targets for 2030 published Wednesday.\n\nTargets set by the worst offenders -- Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey -- would lead to a rise of more than 4 degrees if they were adopted worldwide, the report added.\n\nThe G20 comprises representatives from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe landmark Paris Agreement, drafted in 2015, resulted in an aim to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, with 2 degrees set as an upper limit.\n\nBut the report cautions that those targets are virtually impossible to reach at current rates. It follows similar warnings made last month by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which found that the earth will reach the crucial 1.5 degree threshold as early as 2030.\n\n\"The G20 economies actually need to cut their emissions by half by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5\u00b0C,\" said Jan Burck, senior adviser at equality NGO Germanwatch, one of the report's authors. Germanwatch is one of 14 partners that make up Climate Transparency.\n\n\"But instead of responding to the urgency of climate change, the G20 countries continue to pour money into factors that drive climate disruption, like fossil fuel subsidies, instead of taking stronger action,\" he added.\n\nG20 countries account for around 80% of the world's global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Resources Institute.\n\nFossil fuel subsidies condemned\n\nSeveral experts involved with the report criticized the G20's continued reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n\"It's in the G20's own economic interests to shift from brown to green energy, but we're still seeing major investment into the fossil fuel industry, along with huge subsidies,\" said Charlene Watson of the Overseas Development Institute (ODI).\n\nFossil fuel subsidies from G20 nations totaled $444 billion a year, according to a 2015 study by the ODI\n\nIndividual nations were also singled out by the report, with Britain and France praised for commitments to phase out fossil fuel vehicles, but several others countries were criticized for setting insufficient goals.\n\n\"Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United States lack ambitious renewable energy targets and policies,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne co-founder of the NewClimate Institute, who co-authored the report.\n\nDeforestation was also highlighted, with the report noting rapid forest loss in Brazil, Argentina and Indonesia and warning that of those countries, \"none show any signs of reversing this trend.\"\n\nBrazil's newly-elected far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has promised to open up tracts of the Amazon rainforest to development, prompting an outcry from environmental groups.\n\n\"We hope our new President will keep Brazil in the leadership of climate negotiations and increase climate action within the country,\" said William Wills, research coordinator at Brazilian organization Clima, which contributed to the report.\n\nThis year's G20 summit will take place in Argentina from November 30.", "(CNN) A Washington man who followed the Pittsburgh synagogue suspect on social media was arrested on gun charges after his relatives reached out to authorities, federal court documents show.\n\nJeffrey R. Clark Jr. was charged Tuesday with illegal possession of a high-capacity magazine and transporting a firearm in interstate commerce.\n\nClark's family members tipped off authorities after they grew concerned over his involvement with the so-called alt-right movement, an affidavit says. It said he was \"friends\" with synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers on Gab , a social media platform that describes itself as \"the free speech social network.\"\n\nOn October 27, within hours of the attack that killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Clark's brother, Edward, went to Theodore Roosevelt Island in Washington and fatally shot himself, the affidavit says.\n\n\"After the death of Edward Clark, Jeffrey Clark became more outspoken about his radical views, expressing them openly to his family members who were in the area following Edward Clark's death,\" the affidavit says. \"During these conversations, Jeffrey Clark defended Robert Bowers' killings at the Tree-of-Life Synagogue. Jeffrey Clark also stated that he and Edward Clark had both fantasized about killing 'Jews and blacks.' \"\n\nA few days after the suicide, two family members called federal authorities and said Jeffrey Clark had been \"really riled up\" and \"agitated\" after his brother's death, and he could be a danger to himself or others, the affidavit says.\n\nSuspect allegedly defended synagogue killings\n\nJeffrey and Edward Clark openly discussed killing Jews and black people, and admired Timothy McVeigh Ted Kaczynski and Charles Manson , according to court records. Jeffrey Clark allegedly said the synagogue victims \"deserved it.\"\n\nJeffrey Clark shared his opinions on Gab, and was connected with the Pittsburgh synagogue suspect through the social networking site, the affidavit alleges.\n\nOn the social media platform, Jeffrey Clark's username was \"DC Bowl Gang,\" court records said, while Edward Clark went by \"DC_Stormer.\"\n\nJeffrey Clark's profile picture on Gab included a photo of him and his brother wearing masks and holding a shotgun and a rifle, court records said. The affidavit alleges they posed in front of a flag with crossbones.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, Jeffrey Clark posted on Gab supporting Bowers, the affidavit says. One post shows a picture of Bowers, armed with a gun, \"splattered in what appears to be blood, followed by the following post by Clark: \"... Get used to it libtards. This was a dry run for things to come,\" the affidavit says.\n\nClark's Gab profile has since been deleted. CNN reached out to Gab to ask why or who deleted it.\n\n\"It is Company policy to assist and cooperate with law enforcement.

Now, even the police chief is grieving the tragedy.\n\n\"What we have learned is Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room,\" Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\"\n\n\"We view this as the equivalent of a 'blue on blue,' friendly fire incident,\" the police chief said in a press release.\n\nSecurity guard Jemel Roberson, 26, wanted to become a police officer.\n\nPolice responded to the shooting around 4 a.m. at Manny's Blue Room Lounge in Robbins, about 20 miles south of Chicago, Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said. Three people and an alleged shooter were injured, she added.\n\nThen, after Roberson had apprehended the alleged gunman, the Midlothian officer shot Roberson outside the bar, according to a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The suit calls the fatal shooting \"excessive and unreasonable\" and says it violated Roberson's civil rights.\n\nWitnesses said security had asked several drunk men to leave the bar, and at least one person returned and opened fire, CNN affiliate WGN reported. A bartender was among those victims, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter that shooting, Roberson \"had somebody on the ground ... with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move,' \" Adam Harris, a witness, told WGN.\n\nThe officer responding to the scene then fired at Roberson, the TV station reported, citing witnesses.\n\n\"We all yelled. 'He's a security. He's a security,' and without ... giving any thought, they shot him,\" Harris told the station . \"The vest said security as well ... and they shot him in the side.\"\n\nThe unnamed officer who fatally shot Roberson has been a member of the Midlothian department for nearly four years, according to Delaney. The officer is assigned to the patrol division and also leads a regional swat team, the police chief said.\n\nHe also spent three years with another department, according to Delaney.\n\nThe officer is on paid administrative leave, as is standard department policy, pending the outcome an investigation by the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force investigation.\n\nMidlothian police had asked the state police task force to investigate, which is department policy for an officer-involved shooting, according to Delaney.\n\nIn a statement, the Illinois State Police said its officials are investigating the shooting. It said that according to witness statements, \"the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject.\"\n\nIt also said Roberson was armed with a gun and wearing plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard.\n\nThe department did not initially identify Roberson as a security guard because it immediately relinquished the investigation to the State Police and did not know his name or position at the time, Delaney said Tuesday.\n\nThe suspected gunman in the initial bar shooting is being treated at a local hospital and has not been charged, Ansari said.\n\n'Jemel was trying to save people's lives'\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Roberson's mother lists the unnamed Midlothian officer and the village of Midlothian as defendants. It seeks damages of more than $1 million.\n\n\"Jemel was trying to save people's lives. He was working security because a shooting had just taken place in the establishment,\" the family's attorney, Gregory Kulis, told CNN affiliate WLS\n\n\"So, he was doing his job and holding on to somebody until ... police arrived,\" Kulis said. \"And a police officer, our feeling is, did not make the proper assessment and fired and killed Jemel.\"\n\nRoberson had a Firearms Owners' Identification Card, which allows Illinois residents to legally possess firearms or ammunition, according to Ansari.\n\nKaren Sheley, director of the Police Practices Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, suggested that Roberson's race influenced the decision to shoot.\n\n\"Working as a security guard while Black should not be a death sentence. In this case, police were more dangerous to him than an active shooter who he apparently subdued,\" Sheley said in a statement\n\n\"The police killing of Mr. Roberson was avoidable. Here, a police officer's assumptions about Mr. Roberson, apparently impacted by bias, rather than a clear-headed assessment of the situation, resulted in a tragedy.\"\n\nA church musician who wanted to be a cop\n\nJemel Roberson's young son is now 9 months old.\n\nRoberson was the father to a 9-month-old son, and the boy's mother is expecting their second child, according to family attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\n\"My baby's not going to have his father for Christmas, his birthday, any holidays anymore,\" Avontea Boose, mother to Roberson's children, told Don Lemon on \"CNN Tonight\" Wednesday.\n\nHe was a gospel musician at several churches, according to according to WGN . Kulis said Roberson played the organ and was scheduled to perform at church on the Sunday morning he was killed.\n\nRoberson was also preparing to embark on a career as a police officer, WGN reported. Roberson had planned to take a police exam in March, according to activist Eric Russell.\n\nHe's a protector of everybody,\" Boose said. \"To anybody he knew, he got close to, he was a protector.\"\n\n\"The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,\" the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said.\n\nRoberson's family members are \"just distraught,\" said another pastor, the Rev. Walter Turner.\n\n\"They are hurt, trying to find out answers, trying to figure out why did this have to happen,\" Turner told WGN.\n\nLoved ones and supporters held a vigil Monday night outside Manny's Blue Room Lounge, WGN reported.", "Recounts in the razor-thin races for Florida's governor, senator and agriculture commissioner were triggered because the margins in all three contests are under .5%.\n\nThe path to victory for Sen. Bill Nelson\n\nAs we have made clear many times, the possibility of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson flipping the results into his favor are slim, but he does have a chance against challenger Gov. Rick Scott. As we move through the recount process that path to victory is becoming clearer. If the existing pool of votes remains the existing pool of votes, history shows us that he is unlikely to win. That means they need more votes. So where do they come from? The first is from the hope that the pool of \"undervotes\" in Broward County is a hidden treasure trove for Nelson. There is a statistical anomaly in Broward where there are roughly 25,000 fewer votes cast in the Senate race than in any other race. The Nelson campaign hopes that some sort of machine error or ballot design left their votes out of count. If that is the case, that could mean a new batch of votes. Then come the lawsuits. Nelson's lawyers are pinning their hopes on four specific lawsuits. Every single one of them is directly targeted at finding more votes. The more votes that can be counted, the greater the possibility they can close the gap. On a conference call Tuesday night, Marc Elias, Nelson's lead lawyer, said there is the potential of \"many thousands\" of new votes that could be counted if his lawsuits are successful.\n\nAbout those lawsuits\n\nWednesday is a crucial day. A federal judge will hear arguments in the Nelson claim that Florida's signature match law should be tossed. The law requires people who vote by mail to sign their ballot. That signature must closely resemble the signature first used when they registered to vote. If it doesn't, the vote doesn't count. Nelson's lawyers believe this standard is unfair and disenfranchises a whole host of voters. We may not know immediately how the judge will rule in this case. The hearing could be lengthy -- given the witness list it could go two to three hours. We don't know when the judge will issue his decision, but it is possible that he could hand it down right from the bench. The ruling could provide a big clue as to where these legal battles are headed. A win or loss for either side could foreshadow the direction of all these cases, and as we said before, Nelson needs to win just about everything to have a realistic shot of turning the tide. The signature lawsuit is just one of many lawsuits dealing with similar interpretations or challenges to Florida voter law. On Tuesday, the judge warned that not all the suits will have hearings, and it is quite possible that decisions in any of these cases could come down at any time.\n\nMark Walker -- senator maker?\n\nSpeaking of those lawsuits, the man at the center of almost all of them is Judge Mark Walker, an interesting and independent character. By a quirk in the system, Walker is the only judge in a position to hear cases like these. The original judge had to recuse himself because he was hearing another case involving the Scott administration. A second judge could not be assigned to any of the cases because his son is a county election supervisor. As a result, Walker is presiding over seven cases (and counting?) involving the recount. Walker has a history with Scott. He is an Obama appointee who had the support of Sen. Marco Rubio. He famously forced Florida to extend voter registration deadlines during the heat of the 2016 election in the wake of Hurricane Matthew after Scott declined to do so. Scott's record in front of Walker is pretty poor, but Republicans are hopeful because they believe Walker's track record on election law related matters plays in their favor. It was his ruling on a previous lawsuit related to the signature match standard that led to the existing law. One thing is for sure: his rulings could play a big role in who the next senator from Florida ends up being.\n\nWill the recount be extended?\n\nThe short answer is maybe, but if it is, it won't be for a very long time. The Democrats have filed a lawsuit asking for the deadline to be extended. Elias said on his Tuesday night conference call that there is no \"real rush\" to get the count done because the next senator won't be seated until January. (Yes, that made the hearts of the newly-made, unofficial CNN Tallahassee Bureau stop.) But there is probably no real need for it to go on indefinitely. The vast majority of counties will have their recount done with time to spare. Those who need extra time, may only need a day or two. After Elias scared us into thinking we needed to go Christmas tree shopping in the Florida panhandle, he said the extension needs are \"likely days, not weeks.\" Phew. Regardless, it won't matter under any circumstance unless the Democrats win their court case.\n\nWill the real senator from Florida please stand up?\n\nWe saw Nelson in the flesh for the first time since before the election on Tuesday. He appeared with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and recited the same talking points his campaign has been pushing since it became clear the race was going to a recount. He took no questions. In fact, he has yet to take a question of any kind from anyone since before Election Day. On Tuesday, though, we were reminded that he is still the senator, and those optics are important. Wednesday, it will be Scott's turn. The governor will descend on Capitol Hill in the role of senator-elect. He will appear with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the other new freshmen senators (including Sen.-elect Mitt Romney), and he will vote in leadership elections. It is not as if Scott has been incredibly accessible during this process either. He, too, held a new conference where he took no questions. However, he has conducted some interviews, albeit with mostly friendly outlets, and has stuck to talking points. For one Wednesday in November, it might be almost like Florida has three senators, with Nelson, \"Senator-elect\" Scott and Rubio all on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe future of Brenda Snipes",

exploit reserved for James Bond stunt doubles and drunken fools with a penchant for plaster casts.\n\nThat's going to change when the Audemars Piguet H\u00f4tel des Horlogers opens its doors.\n\nAt this new hotel, due to open 2020, guests will be able to ski down the hotel roof straight on to the ski trails below, without risking life and limb.\n\nThe ambitious design from architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) blends the top of the building seamlessly into the snowy surroundings of the Vall\u00e9e de Joux in western Switzerland.\n\nThe hotel, named for Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet , will also neighbor a museum celebrating this manufacturer of classic timepieces -- also designed by BIG.\n\nNext level skiing\n\nGuests at this upcoming hotel can ski down the roof. Courtesy Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nBIG partner Daniel Sundlin told CNN Travel the hotel's multipurpose roof symbolizes connection, aiming to forge ties between locals and guests, as well as the outdoors and indoors.\n\n\"Quite early in the process we fell in love with this idea of a terrace building that follows the topography, the site is essentially sitting in a slope,\" he says.\n\nInside, there will be two restaurants, a bar, a spa and conference center alongside hotel rooms.\n\n\"Audemars Piguet wanted a hotel that feels more like a guesthouse, than a traditional hotel,\" adds Sundlin.\n\nAll the rooms will be connected by a sloping corridor, designed to mimic a ski trail.\n\nSo how do you ski down the hotel roof?\n\n\"Essentially there's a local cross-country trail just in front of the building,\" explains Sundlin. \"So in the wintertime you will be able to enter the roof terraces directly from the hotel room corridors, and there will be an adjacent space where you can change gear and put your skis on and essentially just ski down the ramp and out into nature. \"\n\nRelated content What a million-dollar ski vacation looks like\n\nSeamlessly connected\n\nThe hotel's glamorous interior. Courtesy Bjarke Ingels Group\n\n\"Being able to ski directly out of your hotel room into the landscape will give plenty of people a seamless and exciting way to explore their surroundings,\" says Sundlin.\n\n\"On the other hand, it will also give the local skiing community direct access to the hotel. \"\n\nIn the summer the slopes will be covered in grass.

Wednesday, citing the Norwegian government.\n\nThe NATO exercise, Trident Juncture, concluded Sunday and involved some 50,000 personnel. It was labeled the alliance's largest exercise since the Cold War. Non-NATO members Finland and Sweden also participated in the exercise.\n\nA spokesperson for the Norwegian ministry of defense acknowledged the jamming to CNN, which it said took place between October 16 and November 7, and said it would defer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on further questions to Russian authorities.\n\n\"Norway has determined that Russia was responsible for jamming GPS signals in the Kola Peninsula during Exercise Trident Juncture. Finland has expressed concern over possible jamming in Lapland,\" NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu told CNN Wednesday.\n\n\"In view of the civilian usage of GPS, jamming of this sort is dangerous, disruptive and irresponsible,\" she added.\n\nRead More", "London (CNN) A British soccer referee has been suspended for a \"moment of madness\" after he asked two team captains to play rock, paper, scissors to decide a kickoff.\n\nDavid McNamara asked the two sportswomen to take part in the playground game ahead of a Women's Super League (WSL) match in October because he found himself without a coin to flip.\n\nThe incident, which fell afoul of the sport's regulatory body, the Football Association (FA), occurred on October 26 at Manchester City's home game against Reading. Manchester City captain Steph Houghton found herself in the bizarre situation alongside visiting captain Kirsty Pearce.\n\nSteph Houghton, who is the captain for both Manchester City and England, was one of the players involved.\n\nJoanna Stimpson, the women's refereeing manager for the FA, told The Times newspaper that that the mistake was a \"moment of madness.\"\n\nShe said: \"The referee forgot his coin and in that moment, in a TV game, he was really pushed for time.\n\nRead More", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

En una de las escenas, la polic\u00eda encontr\u00f3 a un beb\u00e9 de solo cuatro d\u00edas junto a su madre asesinada. Ese ni\u00f1o, junto con otro de 6 meses y uno m\u00e1s de 3 a\u00f1os, sobrevivieron a los asesinatos.\n\nLos sospechosos \"pasaron meses planeando el crimen\", dijo el fiscal general del estado de Ohio Mike DeWine.

Prost, Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill.\n\nOne of the most successful names in the sport's history, boasting nine constructors' titles, the eponymous team started by Frank Williams has fallen on fallow times.\n\nThe team's two drivers, Canadian Lance Stroll and Russia's Sergey Sorotkin, have picked up just seven points from 19 races this season.\n\nIt's been 21 years since Williams was last won a title and Pastor Maldonado's victory at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix is its sole triumph in the past 14 seasons.\n\nBut the rebuild has begun. Claire Williams, daughter of Frank, is now deputy team principal while Paddy Lowe, the architect of much of Mercedes' current success, is chief technical officer.\n\n\"The first 20 years of Williams have been a lot better than the second,\" Lowe told CNN Sport, well versed in Williams' glory days having started his F1 journey with the team back in 1987.\n\nHis six-year tenure at the British manufacturer included title wins for Nelson Piquet, Nigel Mansell and Prost before switching to McLaren, where he enjoyed another period of success followed by his title-winning run at Mercedes.\n\n'The biggest challenge of my career'\n\nBut Lowe has no plans to rest on his laurels as he tries to manufacture a motor racing renaissance.\n\n\"That history is not so significant as it's a long time ago and the sport has changed,\" he said. \"Of course, I have an emotional attachment to back then as that's where it really began for me.\n\nJUST WATCHED Meet ex-Williams racer Valtteri Bottas: Finland's F1 hero Replay More Videos ...

It takes a different way of thinking, and I knew it would be difficult when I took the role one-and-a-half years ago.\n\n\"But even if you're fighting for eighth, ninth and 10th, it's still the same hard work, and there's no lack of complexity in our car compared to the others.\"\n\nThe rebuild is partly built on loyalty from staff and fans alike, who have stuck with Williams through thick and thin.\n\nLowe tells the story of a member of staff who left the company earlier this month after 39-and-a-half years, virtually the entirety of the team's lifespan.\n\n\"At McLaren, you'd had out five or 10-year medals for long service,\" he said. \"At Williams, if you get to 10 years, you're only just getting started.\"\n\nHitting rock bottom\n\nLowe aims to harness that loyalty, a loyalty that Williams herself has occasionally feared would be eroded.\n\nWilliams has a young son, Nate, but its the plight of her team that is giving her the most sleepless nights.\n\nJUST WATCHED Claire Williams: the humble F1 team leader Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Claire Williams: the humble F1 team leader 03:54\n\n\"I constantly think about Williams,\" she said. \"You can never entirely switch that off and, for the first time this year, getting to sleep has been a problem.\"\n\nShe describes the current situation as \"heartbreaking\" having initially thought developments over the winter would see Williams once more be battling the frontrunners.\n\n\"It's just soul destroying to see the team fall back as it has,\" she said. \"But I like a challenge, and we've got that.

California wildfires\n\nFirefighters in Southern California have a brand-new blaze to battle. The Sierra Fire sparked up overnight and is burning through about 20 acres east of Los Angeles County. But there's some good news. The firefight may not be as rough as with other blazes because forecasters predict the swirling winds that have fueled the fires will slowly begin to decrease today, with favorable conditions lasting a couple days.\n\nSo far, 48 people have been killed in the northern part of the state by the Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, while two have died in the Woolsey Fire, in Southern California. Officials fear the number will rise as search teams comb through rubble and ashes in the town of Paradise , which was wiped out by the Camp Fire. It's just been a hellish time in California. In the past week, more than 230,000 acres have burned -- more area than Chicago and Boston combined. And in the past 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes , Cal Fire said.\n\n2. White House\n\nNow that the midterms are (sort of) over, it looks like there's going to be some turnover at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And not all of it will be orchestrated by the President. First lady Melania Trump shocked the heck out of everybody when she put out a stinging statement seeking the ouster of senior national security adviser Mira Ricardel . Now, President Trump seems poised to fire her. Ricardel reportedly ran afoul of the first lady after feuding with her staff over her recent trip to Africa (about plane seats and National Security Council resources).\n\nBut that's not all the potential people-moving that could happen. The President is reportedly looking at replacements for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, as well. It's not unusual for a White House to retool after midterms, but this seems more tumultuous.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ...

The so-called draft deal will be discussed today during an emergency meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May's Cabinet. It's not clear just what's in this agreement, but the main sticking point had been over the Irish border. Currently, the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market, so goods passing between them do not need customs inspections. The sides wanted to avoid a \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and Ireland (which will remain in the EU), which would require infrastructure and customs checks. May wanted to strike a deal now to get it ratified by the time Britain is due to leave the EU at the end of March.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sinn F\u00e9in leader: Brexit threatens Irish peace Replay More Videos ...

Authorities said the Wagners planned the crimes for months, learning the Rhodens' routines, the layouts of their homes and where they slept.

He says his children are catching the tennis bug: https://t.co/HVBzAn0X57 pic.twitter.com/1vAjSZPL1x\n\nFederer was then asked about the stinging comments made by recently retired Julien Benneteau, one of his junior rivals.\n\nThe Frenchman claimed earlier this month on radio station Radio Monte Carlo that Federer benefited from playing most of his matches at night at the Australian Open for the last two years -- bypassing the oppressive afternoon heat that can strike the January tournament. He won the title in both seasons.\n\nBenneteau noted Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley's involvement in the Laver Cup, a September exhibition event launched by, among others, Tennis Australia and Federer's management agency Team8. He also said he heard that Federer's agent Tony Godsick told US Open officials he didn't want his charge to be scheduled on the new Louis Armstrong stadium during this year's tournament.\n\nNot in the mood\n\n\"I don't really feel the mood during a World Tour Finals to discuss that topic, to be honest,\" Federer said when the subject was raised in his press conference. \"In all fairness, I hope you understand why, because this is a bit of a celebration for tennis. For me it's the year-end finale. I love playing here.\n\n\"The radio interview that happened over a week ago that surfaces now in French, Julien, who is a nice guy, I know him since the junior times, I think all of this has been totally taken out of context.\"\n\nPhotos: How the final was won The trophy was sweet for Roger Federer after he won a 20th major at the Australian Open.

Sometimes they go ask the agent. Sometimes they ask me, you know, Asia wants you to play at night.\n\n\"Yes, sometimes we have our say. But I asked to play Monday at the US Open.

For that sometimes you need a break.\"\n\nAnderson is realistically through to the semifinals from the Lleyton Hewitt group, with Thiem (0-2) realistically out. Federer will likely battle it out with Nishikori (1-1) for second spot.\n\nDjokovic (1-0) plays his second match in the Guga Kuerten group Wednesday against Alexander Zverev (1-0), while debutant Isner (0-1) faces Marin Cilic (0-1).", "Tallahassee, Florida (CNN) Democrats and Republicans have fought for days in the court of public opinion over the hotly contested recounts in Florida's Senate and gubernatorial contests .\n\nOn Wednesday, that fight culminates in a set of major legal battles, with the two sides meeting in a federal court room in Tallahassee.\n\nIn what both sides admit will be the most consequential ruling to date in the fight over vote counting in Florida, Democrats are asking US District Judge Mark Walker to invalidate a statute that requires voter signatures on provisional and mail ballots to match those on file. Republicans, on the other hand, will seek to keep the statute in place.\n\nThe lawsuit is just one part of a broader Democratic effort in Florida to fight against certain statutes that have put in dispute ballots they believe should be considered lawfully cast. Democrats, led by top lawyer Marc Elias, have filed at least four lawsuits in federal court, all of which look to either extend the time counties need to recount votes or grow the pool of votes that are legally allowed to be considered by county election officials.\n\n\"All of these cases attempt to bring some common sense to the administration of a recount code that was passed after 2000,\" Elias told reporters on Tuesday, referencing the prolonged presidential recount between Al Gore and George W. Bush.\n\nThe reason for this attention is simple: Democrats trail in the state's top two statewide races, but party officials believe there is a slim chance when all votes are counted they could close the gap and emerge victorious.\n\nThe most pressing race in question is between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and challenger Rick Scott, the Republican governor. Scott led Nelson in the unofficial, pre-recount tally by more than 12,500 votes.\n\nThe gubernatorial contest between Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum is a different scenario. DeSantis led Gillum by nearly 34,000 votes, and Democrats in the state are cognizant that margin will probably not be overcome in a recount. Still, Gillum withdrew his election night concession over the weekend with a message that every vote should be counted.\n\nElias and Democratic lawyers will argue on Wednesday that more votes need to be considered, telling the judge that Florida's signature match law disenfranchises the ill and elderly, people of color and young voters. And, in a preview of what could be the heart of the argument on Wednesday, Elias told reporters on Tuesday that the people judging the signatures are not experts and that there are a host of reasons people have different signatures.\n\n\"There are any number of reason why signatures don't match from one to another,\" he said, citing whether people use a middle name, nicknames, went slow or fast or used a maiden name vs. married name.\n\n\"When you look at those laws and you look at the affect they have, they are not effective anti-fraud measures, what they are is disenfranchisement measures,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have long believed that the Democratic strategy on the recount was to turn this process into a legal battle.\n\nRepublican lawyers are expected to go after Elias on Wednesday, particularly on whether he is making one argument in Florida that conflicts with one he is making in Arizona, where Democrats are also litigating similar laws on mail in ballots and signatures.\n\n\"Democrats in Arizona are using the opposite and contradictory argument to the one they plan to use in court tomorrow in Tallahassee,\" Scott's campaign said in a statement on Tuesday. \"For them, this isn't about following the law and it isn't about having a free and fair election. This is about getting rid of Florida laws they don't like.\"\n\nMembers of the Scott campaign are frustrated because they feel like they are playing by Florida's rules. These laws were purposely re-written and hashed out in the wake of the 2000 presidential election recount. They argue the legal strategy by Elias and company is specifically designed to undo Florida law, piece by piece.\n\nIn addition to the signature match lawsuit that will be heard Wednesday, Elias and Democrats have filed three other legal challenges that are making their way through the federal legal system in Florida.\n\nNelson's campaign and the Democratic Party's Senate campaign arm sued in federal court on Tuesday to lift the deadlines on the statewide recount taking place in Florida, arguing that they are \"arbitrary\" and \"impose a severe burden ... on the right to vote.\"\n\nIf successful, the suit would do away with the Thursday deadline for the machine recount to provide counties with enough time to recount all votes.\n\n\"We have asked the federal courts to take the common-sense steps to ensure that every county has a chance to complete those phases of a recount without interruption,\" Elias said.\n\nThere are signs at least some counties may not finish the recount by the Thursday deadline. Late on Tuesday, old and overheated vote counting machines in Palm Beach forced election officials there to start over their count of early vote ballots, erasing more than a day's worth of work.\n\n\"We're disappointed by the mechanical problems that are going to cause a further delay in the recount,\" Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher told reporters Tuesday night. \"It became evident through the vigorous pace of counting that the machines used for the recount were starting to get stressed.\"\n\nBucher said that 179,000 early voting ballots did not tabulate properly and must be counted once more. She did not specify how long this would set back the county's timetable, but the set back is almost certain to dampen confidence Bucher had in finishing at least the Senate portion of the count by Thursday.\n\nDemocrats have also filed suit to ensure vote-by-mail ballots postmarked before Election Day that didn't make it to election officials on time are counted.\n\n\"It is not reasonable for peoples' votes to be taken away from them and for them to be disenfranchised based on the speed with which the US Postal Service can deliver these ballots,\" Elias said. \"There is no reason why a Floridian in Ottawa ought to have their ballot counted when a retired veteran in Pensacola who mailed the ballot on the same day and it didn't get here in time shouldn't.\"\n\nAnother suit seeks to clarify how a voter's intent is judged when they incorrectly fill out a ballot.\n\nThe crux of Elias' case seeking to clarify a voter's intent is twofold: The lawyer is partly questioning how people mark their ballots, especially in those cases where they are either deemed to have marked too many names or those where they marked too few, and how they note they made a mistake and want to change their vote.\n\n\"We can't deny people a right to vote because they choose to put Xs in some, oval, circle some names or fill in some ovals,\" Elias said before decrying the fact that Florida law requires people to write on their ballot that they made a mistake in voting, not just crossing out a vote.\n\n\"It says you can't cross out an errant vote with some marking, you have to use words,\" he said. \"A rule that says you can't cross out an errant vote and you have to use words is simply nonsensical.\"\n\nElias argued that these laws are \"discriminatory\" and unfairly impact people who don't use English as a primary language and people who are illiterate.\n\nAll of this has clearly annoyed Scott's team, who have taken an aggressive posture on Democrats broadly, but on Elias in particular.\n\nAides close to Scott believe that Democrats are attempting to re-write the rule book. That frustration has turned into accusations of possible fraud.\n\nScott aides often make it clear that Scott himself has never directly claimed there is fraud, but instead has said there is a \"possibility that fraud exists.\" They firmly believe that these lawsuits have the potential to change Florida law in a way that opens the door to problems down the road.\n\nThe Scott campaign hopes that argument resonates with voters as well.\n\n\"While Bill Nelson and his D.C. lawyer continue to file frivolous lawsuits attacking Florida's laws,\" Chris Hartline, a Scott campaign spokesman, said Tuesday, \"Senator-elect Rick Scott will remain focused on actually respecting the will of the voters.\"", "Washington (CNN) Rep. Kevin McCarthy was elected House minority leader Wednesday in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, putting the California Republican in position to lead House GOP members after Speaker Paul Ryan leaves Capitol Hill at the end of his term in January.\n\nThe vote was 159-43. McCarthy had faced a long-shot challenge from Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the co-founder of the conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nWith Ryan headed for the exit s, McCarthy, the current No. 2 House Republican, had long been viewed as the heavy favorite to become minority leader in the new Congress, the highest-ranking GOP leadership post with Republicans in the minority after losing control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.\n\nRyan announced in April that he would not seek re-election and had endorsed McCarthy , the House majority leader for the past four years, to be his successor.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the current No. 3 House Republican, was elected to the No. 2 Republican leadership position in the new Congress, where he will serve as minority whip. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was elected to the third-ranking position in the GOP hierarchy and will be the next Republican conference chair.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday, McCarthy vowed to help the GOP win back the majority in the House and said Republicans will oppose Democrats if they target President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We will work with anybody across that aisle if they are there to work to move America forward. But let me be very clear, if their agenda is simply investigations, impeachment, and not focused on the hardworking American public, we will be there to defend the American public,\" McCarthy said.\n\nTrump and McCarthy have spoken about leadership races recently, territory that Presidents usually avoid so not as to seem like they're alienating members of their own party. In private conversations, the President pushed for Jordan and another close conservative ally -- Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina -- to have the top Republican positions on key committees, according to a source familiar. McCarthy doesn't dole out those positions -- that's for the House GOP Steering Committee -- but plenty of people on the Steering Committee are loyal to McCarthy and would heed his word. As of Wednesday afternoon it was not clear where Jordan or Meadows would land.\n\nMeadows told reporters on Wednesday that he believes Jordan has \"earned\" the spot of ranking member on the Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"I think Jim has earned the position for ranking member on Judiciary, but that's not my call. That's going to be the Steering Committee's call, and certainly as we look at that they will be making those decisions after Thanksgiving,\" he said.\n\nPolitico first reported Wednesday that Trump has privately pushed McCarthy to make a deal with Jordan.\n\nA separate source confirmed to CNN that Jordan is interested in the ranking member position on the Judiciary Committee in order to check Democratic investigations that will be led by Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York.\n\nIn his race for minority leader, McCarthy positioned himself as a close ally of Trump. In a letter announcing his bid , he wrote, \"We need to lay the groundwork to regain the majority so that we can continue working alongside President Trump to fulfill our promise to fundamentally change Washington. I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again.\"\n\nAs minority leader, McCarthy will become the most visible face of opposition to the incoming Democratic majority. The next minority leader will have to decide whether and when the GOP minority might work to find common ground with Democrats and could also come under increased scrutiny from the President as the administration itself goes under a microscope in the new Democratic-controlled House.\n\nThe leadership election comes as incoming freshmen lawmakers are in town for orientation.\n\nAt Wednesday's news conference, McCarthy said he does not believe that the President is to blame for House Republicans losing their majority, but he conceded that the party has work to do to improve its standing with voters, particularly in suburban areas.\n\n\"History is against us,\" he said. \"Any President in their first off-year election, on average, loses more than 30 seats.\"\n\nBut McCarthy added, \"We took a beating inside the suburban areas. We're going to have to work harder. I think our message is going to have to be clearer. Our ideas are going to have to be stronger. We realize that, and we will work toward that effort.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.", "\u0646\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0643\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a

with CNN's Perry Kostidakis.\n\nHines Ward.\n\nIt seems like there's been a lot of trades and signings this season -- is it really that much different from any other season?\n\nOh, there's more this year than any other year. You see it often in baseball and basketball, you never really see it as much as in the NFL. But lately, you see teams trying to load up and make a push and make a run to the playoffs.\n\nNow, you don't really have time. They don't give new coaches and quarterbacks time to do it. A lot of the older guys, their window of opportunity for winning is short, so now teams are starting to pull the trigger on a lot of free agents and trades during the season to add that one little piece that might help them get over the top.\n\nAnd then for bad teams, it's a firesale. It's, 'we're not going to win anyways, so let's load up on draft picks, let's lighten this salary cap, let's get rid of some of the higher-paid players, let's rebuild and start working on next year.'\n\nJosh Gordon's move from the Cleveland Browns to the New England Patriots was one of the season's biggest roster changes.\n\nRead More", "Our series returns after a midterm election that delivered historic numbers of women to Congress. Their energy, perspective and determination will reshape one of the power centers in a man's town. These are the stories of Badass Women all around Washington . \u2014 Dana Bash, Bridget Nolan, Rachel Smolkin & Abigail Crutchfield\n\n(CNN) Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers was Cathy McMorris when she was first elected to the House in 2004.\n\nThirty-five years old and single, she headed to Washington for a new powerful job as a Republican congresswoman from Washington state -- and didn't know if having a family would happen for her.\n\n\"I expected finding a husband, finding a partner would be even more difficult with me in this position,\" McMorris Rodgers remembers.\n\nTo be sure, not all women are looking for a partner. Not all women want to have children. But McMorris Rodgers did. And like so many working in any profession -- never mind in Congress -- she worried that adding mother to her title could pass her by.\n\nThe reality of a woman's biological clock is a theme we unwittingly began exploring with this series, after Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao bravely admitted to us that she felt as though she missed out on having children , and often tells younger women not to make the mistake she did of not thinking it through.\n\nBut that is not McMorris Rodgers' story. During her first term in Congress she met now husband Brian Rodgers at a barbeque back home in Spokane.\n\n\"I so admire Brian,\" she grins, speaking with CNN for a recent interview. \"He is confident in who he is. He knows what's important to him, and he's comfortable with me, and he supports me wholeheartedly.\"\n\nHistory Making Mom\n\nCathy McMorris Rodgers is now the only woman in history to give birth three times while serving in Congress. In fact, she was the first to do it twice as well.\n\nShe still remembers telling then-House Speaker John Boehner that she was pregnant with her third at age 44.\n\n\"He looked at me, and he's like 'really?'\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm just so grateful it happened, I'm grateful to be a mom, and I feel like I came very close to missing on that,\" McMorris Rodgers says. \"And in some ways it's the hardest thing that I've ever done and yet I think it's the best thing that I have done.\"\n\nHer first pregnancy was easy, until the end. During a routine ultrasound doctors spotted a blockage called \" duodenal atresia \" and McMorris Rodgers was warned that one out of three babies with that disorder is born with Down Syndrome. Her son Cole was part of the one in three.\n\n\"When I got the news it was tough, it's just not what you expect and in that moment, it's overwhelming, and part of it is just the fear of the unknown,\" McMorris Rodgers explains. \"And I wondered how I would ever talk about it even, and yet today I'm grateful, I am grateful for Cole. He brings me such joy, I am grateful for the influence that he's had on my life.\"\n\nHaving a child with disabilities has opened her eyes not just as a mother, but a lawmaker. She has worked to pass legislation like the so-called ABLE Act, which allows people with disabilities to open tax free savings accounts to help pay for their care.\n\n\"It's given me a whole new purpose and a passion for what I do on Capitol Hill and I find a lot of fulfillment in just knowing that I'm making a difference, not just for Cole, but millions of others who just happen to have a disability,\" she says.\n\nBack into the fight\n\nShe says her husband Brian sometimes acts as a boxing coach, which can come in handy in Washington.\n\n\"I'll retreat to my corner, and he'll clean me up and encourage me and then send me back into the fight,\" she says.\n\nHer most recent fight? Seeking re-election in her eastern Washington state district, which was harder this time around than it had been for her in the past ( CNN projects she won with just over 55% of the vote ).\n\nAnd the House Republican Conference Chair -- the highest ranking Republican woman -- made the decision not to run again for Republican leadership, after Steve Scalise announced he was going to run for House minority whip, a position McMorris Rodgers had been considering seeking. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming ran unopposed for the position McMorris Rodgers held for five years. McMorris Rodgers has since said she'll pursue a top position on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nStill, as we walk through her neighborhood in Spokane, she talks about growing up on a farm in Kettle Falls, Washington, where no one in her family had attended college. She was the first.\n\nAnd McMorris Rodgers remembers her 25-year-old self -- who had to be prodded to run for office in the first place.\n\n\"I had a lot of doubts and like a lot of women I told myself every reason why I shouldn't do it,\" she remembers.\n\n\"Some individuals who encouraged me, who saw something in me that I didn't see in myself and tapped me on the shoulder and say, 'Cathy, we think you should do it, we think you have something important to offer,' and I'm grateful for that,\" she adds.\n\nShe is hardly alone. Women, whatever their profession, tend to have a harder time feeling ready for a job, even though in most cases they are more than prepared.\n\n\"I think there's something in us that ... sometimes we're our own worst critic and instead of really focusing on what we have to offer and celebrating who we are, and our strengths, we can get caught up on the things we shouldn't be focusing on,\" she notes.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers is trying to make sure the new generation of women running for Congress has the help and the nudge that she appreciated so many years ago.\n\n\"I have made it a priority especially since I've been elected to Congress to reach out to other women and to do likewise because in recruiting women to run for office I hear them saying the same thing that I told myself,\" she says. \"And yet it's very important that they be encouraged to take that step.\"\n\nHow do you do it all? When will we stop asking?\n\nMcMorris Rodgers often is asked how she does it all. A key answer is that her husband, a retired naval commander, is now a stay-at-home father.\n\n\"He'll tell you it's harder than anything he did in the Navy,\" she says with a smile. \"And yet, I'm so grateful that he's doing that for our kids. He is carrying that load and being with them day in and day out. I mean it puts my heart at ease, those times when I am away longer than I would like to know that the kids are with Brian.\"\n\nShe is happy to serve as a role model for working moms, and hopes her story can inspire other women to follow in her footsteps.\n\n\"Whenever I talk to another woman whether they're married, or not, have kids, the first question they asked me is 'how do you do it?' And it's a lot of other people that make it possible, but if I can do it other women can do it,\" she says.\n\nBut McMorris Rodgers looks forward to the day when women like her aren't asked that question: how do you do it all?\n\n\"Men have done it one way and we become accustomed to the way that men may approach serving in Congress, having families, doing their roles. And women are going to do it a little different, and so it's still somewhat new,\" she explains.\n\n\"Sometimes we get caught up in how someone is doing it rather than just being focused on, wow she's she's getting it done, she's making a difference,\" she says.\n\nShe's admits -- that may take some time.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - Un piloto muri\u00f3 y otro fue hospitalizado despu\u00e9s de que un avi\u00f3n se estrellara en una base de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Estados Unidos en Texas.\n\nUn avi\u00f3n T-38C Talon de la Fuerza A\u00e9rea se estrell\u00f3 el martes por la noche en la Base Laughlin, de acuerdo con un comunicado.

The country failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and its best finish came back in 1930 -- when it reached the semifinals.\n\nPulisic is likely to start for the USA in their friendly against England.\n\nBut there have been signs of a revival. They drew 1-1 with world champions France in June, a performance which hinted that the team's potential could be fulfilled.\n\nWith this being the case, Pulisic sees \"no reason\" why the USA can't win the World Cup in his lifetime.\n\n\"With the talent we have now, and if we continue to grow as a sport in the country, there is no reason that we can't make a good run in a World Cup one day,\" he said.\n\nRebuilding the USA\n\nPulisic is very much at the heart of the rebuilding process and feels a responsibility to lead from the front -- although this isn't something that necessarily comes naturally to him.\n\n\"I'm pretty quiet but my best quality is leading by example,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not like I have to tell people what to do all the time. It's more leading by example and working hard every training and have those guys see how I train.\"\n\nAttitudes towards the sport are slowly changing in the US and ambitions of growing the game have been buoyed with the news that the USA will host the 2026 World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico\n\nAlthough Pulisic is \"really excited\" for a tournament on home soil, he insists his side is solely focused on qualifying for Qatar 2022.\n\nChristian Pulisic made his Borussia Dortmund debut in 2016.\n\nMaking it in Germany\n\nPulisic's journey to the top of the game has been a tough one. It's also been an unusual one.\n\nThe attacking midfielder moved to Germany to join Borussia Dortmund's youth academy in 2015 and, just a year later, made is first-team debut.\n\n\"I remember not speaking the language or understanding anyone. Every single day was a grind,\" he said.\n\n\"I had to get stronger and stronger, quicker and quicker with all your movements. It's a fast learning process if you want to be successful at the highest level.\"\n\nMuch is now expected of the youngster but being the next-best-thing for both club and country is not something that weighs heavily on his shoulders.\n\n\"I just play because I enjoy the sport,\" he said. \"I set my own personal goals, I'm not playing to satisfy fans. I know what I want to accomplish, for myself and to help my team\"\n\nPulisic (R) and Jadon Sancho (L) are considered among the world's best young talents.\n\nDortmund are currently top of the Bundesliga and their impressive domestic form has continued into their Champions League campaign -- they currently sit top of Group A.\n\nWith qualification out of the group stages looking likely, Pulisic has one eye on a cup run.\n\n\"Once we get to the knockout stages I think anything could happen. Our team believes we can make a run as long as we want to. There's no reason why we can't,\" he said.\n\nDespite his side's purple patch, Pulisic has been frustrated for the last few weeks. He's just returned from a problematic calf injury which forced him out of action last month.\n\nIn his absence, English starlet Jadon Sancho has excelled and the pair are now battling for a place in Dortmund's starting line-up, but Pulisic insists there is no unhealthy rivalry between the two.\n\n\"It's great having a guy like that, competing with him every day and also being friends off the field,\" he said.\n\nPhotos: Best atmospheres in world football Borussia Dortmund \u2013 Borussia's Dortmund's Westfalenstadion Stadium is known for its \"Yellow Wall.\" The south stand is packed full of impassioned fans who together create one of the most spell-binding sights in football.

Una fuente familiarizada con la situaci\u00f3n dijo que el despido Ricardel se debe en parte al \"bullying\" de asesores tanto por encima como por debajo de ella.\n\nColegas actuales y del pasado de Ricardel la pintan como una conservadora comprometida y experta en seguridad nacional con una fuerte personalidad.\n\nUno de sus excolegas la describe como alguien que no \"soporta a los tontos\" o tiene un toque matizado cuando se trata de navegar los peligros de la pol\u00edtica interna.

But it appears May has found a loyalist to helm the Department for Exiting the EU, as Barclay has never rebelled against the government in parliamentary votes.\n\nElected to parliament in 2010, Barclay has also held the post of Economic Secretary to the Treasury. He was a director at Barclays bank before beginning his political career.\n\nWhat it means: While Barclay supported the campaign to leave the European Union, the appointment of such an inexperienced Brexit Secretary will do little to appease pro-Brexit MPs angered by the diminishing importance of the position.\n\nBarclay's role will be limited to the domestic delivery of Britain's withdrawal from the EU, the Press Association reported, while Theresa May takes sole control of negotiations with the bloc.", "London (CNN Business) 1.

They are, it has been said, making being smart \"sexy.\"\n\nOn one side of the board is reigning champion Magnus Carlsen, a 27-year-old Norwegian who, aged 14, was described by the Washington Post as the \"Mozart of chess.\" He models for G-Star, has endorsed Porsche, beaten Bill Gates in nine moves and 12 seconds, and is the highest-rated chess player in history. Forbes estimates his net worth at more than $8 million.\n\nAiming to topple one of the greats is challenger Fabiano Caruana -- the first American to compete for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972. He is the world No.2 and is described as having superhuman powers of concentration. By the end of this month he could be world champion.\n\nChess has not been this fascinating since Fischer, the first western world champion in the modern era, took on Soviet Boris Spassky at the height of the Cold War in 1972 in what was seen as a clash of east versus west, a battle between capitalism and communism.\n\nThere has not been a match between players this closely ranked in almost three decades.\n\nMagnus Carlsen (left) is reported to be worth more than $8M.\n\nCaruana, one year Carlsen's junior, has likened chess to MMA and boxing. Those who furrow their brow at such comparisons need only have watched the opening contests of this month's 12-game title fight in the English capital to perhaps alter their perceptions.\n\nThe opening match lasted an agonizing seven hours before ending in a draw. The next day the evenly matched rivals faced up again. There is not much time for rest during 19 days of mental combat. In the second game it was Carlsen, in his own words, who was left to \"beg for a draw.\" Monday was a third straight tie of the showdown and on Tuesday there was no separating them either.\n\nFour games down and deadlock -- 2-2. The tension teeth-clenchingly high. Millions around the globe transfixed.\n\nIf players are tied after 12 classical games, it will go to a tie-breaker -- a series of games under shorter time controls.\n\nUnder such pressure the pulse quickens, the mind whirrs, which is why Italian-American Caruana has made sure he is in peak mental and physical condition for the tournament. When time allows he will be pounding the treadmill between bouts and searching for Zen-like calm to soothe the mind.\n\n\"I have taken a liking to yoga recently, I've been practicing quite a lot. It's important to try to counteract the negative, physical effects of chess -- sitting down for so long under a lot of strain and mental stress,\" says Caruana, speaking to CNN Sport last week on the eve of the championship.\n\nCaruana is nerdy, but stylish, wearing a grey T-shirt and a bomber jacket made by the American designer Thom Browne for an afternoon of answering questions from journalists who have traveled to England from around the world. Though he left New York for Spain aged 12 and has not, he says, returned to the city where he spent much of his childhood for a while, his Brooklyn accent remains strong.\n\nCaruana is a dual national and represented Italy before switching alliegances to the US.\n\nFocusing on the physical as well as the mental is not new for elite players, he says. The answer to the old argument of whether chess is a sport is irrelevant. Playing for such extensive periods takes its toll. After the \"Moscow Marathon\" between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov in 2000, which lasted five months and 48 games, Karpov told a Russian magazine he had lost 10kg in weight.\n\nCarlsen is lithe and watches what he eats, while Caruana -- who describes himself as a decent runner -- is no different.\n\n\"When I was a kid I was encouraged by my parents to exercise and stay in shape. It was only more recently that I took it upon myself and became interested and really wanted to take care of myself,\" says Caruana, who first played for the land of his Italian mother before switching allegiances to the US.\n\n\"I understood that chess can be physically demanding, although it doesn't seem like it. When you're under a lot of stress and your heart is racing and you're just sitting down and there's no outlet for it you really need to be in good shape to make sure it doesn't get to your head.\n\n\"If you're crashing at the board you won't be able to play so I think pretty much all the top players these days are very aware of the necessity to be in good shape.\n\n\"I've tried to improve my cardio, I've done a lot of running and interval training to try to improve my cardiovascular system. I've had trainers in the past, but because I travel so much it's kind of hard to have someone there to monitor what I'm doing so I also have to take it upon myself to make sure I know how to exercise and know what I need to do.\"\n\n\"As a kid I found myself staring at the ceiling during a game.\"\n\nIt was an English journalist who described Caruana as having superhuman powers of concentration. The bespectacled New Yorker, who in 2007 became the youngest American-born grandmaster in history less than two weeks before his 15th birthday -- a mark since beaten by Sam Sevian -- laughs at such a description.\n\n\"At the board, I turn everything off and focus on that. I think that's years of training, through playing and trying to not let mind wander,\" he replies with a smile.\n\n\"As a kid, I found myself staring at the ceiling during a game and wouldn't be thinking about chess at all, but through so many years of playing chess at a high level I've learnt to focus. I haven't really had to consciously try to do it, it's sort of just happened.\"\n\nAfter four moves in any game of chess there are already a billion possible placement of the pieces.\n\nThe American was first introduced to chess aged five in an after-school program to help with his concentration. He lost all four of his first games, but quickly began to show promise by defeating older players and, in 2004, the family relocated to Spain so that the young prodigy could train with better instructors and play higher-quality opponents.\n\nIn admitting he was not enthusiastic about moving to Europe, the New Yorker chuckles: \"When you're 12 years old your parents don't really ask you.\"\n\nHome-schooled in Spain, Caruana would practice for 10 hours a day on non-school days, but he does not regard it as a childhood lost.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I've made any great sacrifices,\" he says.\n\n\"When I was a teenager I guess I sacrificed on school and having the normal life of a teenager and having traditional education, but I've been quite fortunate. I haven't had to make big sacrifices for my chess. I've had a relatively smooth road with the support of my parents to be able to devote myself to it.\"\n\nHis parents reportedly estimate they spent as much as $50,000 a year paying for coaches and training before their son started making money in his late teens.\n\nHe will leave London considerably richer whatever happens in the final. There is a $677,000 prize for the winner, while the loser will walk away with $451, 000. And there's sponsorship to boost the coffers, too. For Caruana, plans are afoot to launch a chess board line and apparel, while tech companies, sports brands and start-ups have shown interest in associating with the grandmaster.\n\nIn explaining the increasing interest in his client, Caruana's manager Eric Kuhn tells CNN Sport that chess is at the \"center of the zeitgeist\" and that the players \"represent everything that is now.\"\n\nAsked whether he felt he was playing for America, Caruana said: \"I try to approach tournaments as an individual. If I have success I would like to share it with the US.\"\n\nDuring a press conference comprising about 200 representatives of the media, Caruana was asked last week how he would describe himself, being that he was playing \"the Mozart of chess.\" \"My musical tastes lie more outside classical music, so I'd probably pick someone in the hip-hop or rock genre,\" he said.\n\nBoth Caruana and Carlsen give chess a modern twist and their rivalry is the sort which elevates a contest to a wider audience. Some report that the pair aren't fond of each other -- In August, Carlsen made a shushing gesture when he played the American. With this world championship being so a close, all the elements are in place for a great spectacle.\n\nThe intuitive Carlsen, a grandmaster since 13, a world champion since 2013, is the favorite. But Caruana, described as a brilliant all-rounder, is on a hot streak, having beaten seven other top players to win the Candidates Tournament in Berlin in March. His official rating of 2,838 is just three points behind his opponent.\n\nMagnus Carlsen has been the world champion since 2013.\n\nWhen asked whether he saw himself as the favorite or underdog, much to the amusement of the assembled journalists, a smiling Carlsen replied: \"It has been a while since I have considered myself an underdog, to be honest. If you have been the No.1 ranked player in the world for seven years and have won three world titles in a row and consider yourself an underdog then there is something seriously wrong with your psyche, I think.\"\n\nBut Caruana is a fighter. \"I have the will to fight under any circumstances and it's served me very well in the past to be able to fight from very bad conditions on the board, from the worst type of position, from a hopeless position, to try to fight back. That's been my greatest strength,\" he says.\n\nCaruana also has belief. Asked if he thinks he can beat Carlsen, the American, regarded as the heir to Fischer, confidently replies: \"I do think I'm going to win but it's probably going to be really tough and harder than I realize.\"", "London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will attempt to sell her divorce deal from the European Union to the House of Commons Thursday as a divided country examines the finer details of the 585-page draft document.\n\nStanding outside Downing Street late Wednesday, May announced that she had won the backing of her senior ministers after a debate that had lasted five hours. \"This is a decisive step which enables us to move on and finalize the deal in the days ahead,\" she said.\n\nHours earlier, there had been talk that some mutinous members of her Cabinet might resign and that remained a possibility on Wednesday night. Even as the meeting drew to a close, rumors swirled in Westminster that May could face a vote of no-confidence from within the ranks of her own Conservative Party.\n\nDifficult decisions made\n\nBut on the steps of Downing Street, May seized the upper hand. She acknowledged the debate had been difficult, and that decisions had not been taken lightly.\n\n\"I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest. And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom,\" she said.\n\nMay's success in facing down a rebellion -- at least for now -- marked a pivotal moment for her leadership. Cabinet backing gives the Prime Minister crucial breathing space, but her troubles are far from over. May must now get the deal through the House of Commons, where her Conservative Party does not command a majority, and opponents smell blood.\n\nThursday's front pages reflected the difficulties ahead. The Financial Times predicted a \"backlash\" following the \"ferocious Brexit battle,\" while the Daily Mail focused on the Prime Minister's defiant tone with the headline, \"I stand to fight.\"\n\nThe Guardian, which had supported Remain, pointed to the divisions that May's Brexit plan had created under the banner \"a split cabinet, a split party and a split nation.\"\n\nKnives are out\n\nThe Conservative Party is deeply divided between hardline Brexit supporters and others who voted to remain in the EU, and Wednesday's breakthrough is only the beginning of what is expected to be a protracted and painful political process.\n\nChief among hardliners' concerns is that the agreement will tie the UK to the EU's customs union and parts of the single market free-trade area for years to come, without any say in how the bloc is run.\n\nA sign of the peril faced by May came at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons earlier Wednesday, when one of her own MPs, Peter Bone, accused her of \"not delivering the Brexit people voted for.\" Bone said May would \"lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\"\n\nOne of the Prime Minister's most vocal rivals, arch-Brexiter and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, was critical of the proposal.\n\nIn a statement, he said that \"the proposed agreement will see the UK hand over \u00a339 billion ($50.7 billion) to the EU for little or nothing in return.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister was not without her supporters, however. Brandon Lewis, Chairman of the Conservatives & Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth, said in a tweet that May's deal is \"absolutely the right deal for Britain. It gets people what they voted for -- control of our money, borders and laws.\"\n\nCorbyn slams 'shambolic negotiations'\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, laid into the PM's deal. \"After two years of bungled negotiations, from what we know of the government's deal, it's a failure in its own terms,\" Corbyn said, repeatedly describing the negotiations as \"shambolic.\"\n\nHe slammed May for offering a choice between a \"botched deal and no deal.\" It seems unthinkable that his party would support May's deal when it comes to a vote.\n\nPro-Brexit supporters demonstrating in Whitehall, near the UK Houses of Parliament in London, on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Thursday morning, shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said that the document was a \"failure of negotiation.\"\n\n\"We've read and analyzed all 500 pages -- it's a miserable failure of negotiation.\"\n\nHe said there was \"huge detail\" about \"issues like the backstop which the government says it doesn't intend to use,\" but said it was \"vague\" in other, key areas.\n\n\"For the future relationship, what it does intend, it's seven pages, it's vague in the extreme. Only three of those are about the future economic relationship.\"\n\n\"We talk about blind Brexit but this is about the blindest of blind Brexits.\"\n\nScottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said late Wednesday that she had had a telephone conversation with May in which the PM had promised that Scotland's \"'distinctive' interests had been protected,\" but contested that interpretation.\n\nNot long off call with PM. She tried to tell me Scotland's 'distinctive' interests had been protected. I pointed out that there isn't a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage. \u2014 Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) November 14, 2018\n\n\"I pointed out that there isn't a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage,\" Sturgeon tweeted.\n\nThe Prime Minister's deal is absolutely the right deal for Britain. It gets people what they voted for - control of our money, borders and laws. pic.twitter.com/3ZRgLv3OOo \u2014 Brandon Lewis (@BrandonLewis) November 14, 2018\n\nPotential stumbling block\n\nOpponents of the deal take issue with the part of the agreement that deals with the border between Ireland, which remains in the EU, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK.\n\nCritics say the border agreement would, at least temporarily, tie the UK to the EU's trading rules without a way out.\n\nRees-Mogg called the different treatment of Northern Ireland \"unacceptable\" and said that locking the country into EU customs rules was \"profoundly undemocratic.\"\n\nMay must now attempt to secure the support of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs prop up her minority government. DUP leader Arlene Foster said in a statement on Wednesday that the party's \"desire for a deal will not be superseded by a willingness to accept any deal.\"\n\nIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in a tweet that he was \"pleased\" that a deal had been reached but that his government \"regrets\" the UK's decision to leave the bloc.\n\n\"I am pleased an agreement has been reached between EU and UK negotiators on a draft Brexit Withdrawal Treaty. While I welcome these developments, Brexit is not our policy and is something we regret. However, we respect the vote of the people of the UK.\"\n\nBut May insisted that she felt the draft withdrawal agreement was \"the best that could be negotiated.\"\n\nShe also made it clear that if Brexit-supporting MPs in her own party conspired to kill the deal, they could end up destroying their ultimate goal of leaving the EU.\n\nThe choice, she said, was stark: \"This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings us back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our union; or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThat line was intended as a warning to rebels that if they vote down her deal, they risked precipitating a political crisis that could end with a second referendum. It was the first time that May had acknowledged that Brexit could, in theory at least, be stopped.\n\nNext step\n\nMay's strategy is to seize the momentum. With the UK Cabinet now in line, an emergency summit of the EU council -- the 28 member states that make up the European Union -- is likely to be called for November. At this summit, the member states will agree to the withdrawal text, allowing it to move to legislative chambers of both the EU and the UK.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, welcomed Wednesday's developments. \"This agreement, is a decisive, crucial step on concluding these negotiations,\" he said. \"It is also the achievement of a methodology which has been a negotiation carried out in transparency from the word go and fully in respect of our respective mandates.\"\n\nEU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt echoed the sentiment, saying in a tweet that while he hoped \"one day the UK will return\" that \"in the meantime this agreement will make a Brexit possible, while maintaining a close relationship between the EU and UK.\"", "\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0646\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u060c \u0645\u0627\u064a\u0643 \u0628\u0646\u0633\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621\u060c \u0644\u0632\u0639\u064a\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0623\u0648\u0646\u063a \u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0648 \u0643\u064a\u060c \u0625\u0646 \"\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0636\u0637\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0623\u062f\u0649 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0641\u0639 700 \u0623\u0644\u0641 \u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0647\u064a\u0646\u063a\u064a\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0628\u0646\u063a\u0644\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0634 \u0647\u0648 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0628\u0631\u0631\". \u0648\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0632\u062a \u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u062f\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u062a\u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d\u0647 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0646\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0644\u0642 \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0646\u063a\u0627\u0641\u0648\u0631\u0629.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0627\u0621 \u060c 14 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Paradise, California (CNN) Hundreds of people poured Wednesday into the Northern California communities ravaged by the deadly Camp Fire, searching for human remains while authorities tried to track down 130 people who are unaccounted for after the blaze.\n\nThe staggering death toll from the fire increased to 56 as eight sets of remains were found.\n\nMost of the people on the partial list of the missing posted earlier Wednesday on the Butte County website are senior citizens.\n\nThe majority of the missing live in Paradise, which is a town of 27,000 residents, many of them retirees. About 461 people and 22 cadaver dogs are searching the town and other communities, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said.\n\n\"We're moving as fast as we can. It will take as long as it takes,\" Honea said when asked about a timeline for the search. \"It's an important thing that we get right. And I understand the issue (of residents wanting to return to their properties), and I'm balancing the competing interests.\"\n\nThe sheriff's department will begin taking DNA samples from people who are missing a family member on Thursday, he said.\n\nThe Camp Fire is one of two major blazes burning in California that have left at least 58 people dead. The other is the Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, which has killed at least two people and destroyed nearly 500 homes.\n\nAn Alameda County coroner looks for human remains at a burned home in Paradise, California.\n\nEarlier officials said the number of missing was 103 but the total will change each day with new information.\n\nResidents want to rebuild\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones insists her town will be brought back.\n\n\"We're gonna come back, we're gonna rebuild. We're gonna make Paradise Paradise again,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nJones knows people want desperately to come back to see what can be done, what is gone and what can be salvaged.\n\nThe threat from the Camp Fire is now minimal, but there are other dangers, she said.\n\n\"I know people want to take RV's up and stay on their land while they rebuild and I think that will eventually be possible, but it's gonna take time before it's safe enough to do that. We all just need to be patient,\" she said.\n\nPhotos: In pictures: Wildfires tear across California A burned neighborhood is seen in Paradise, California, on Thursday, November 15.

They've also been fighting a new blaze, the Sierra Fire, in San Bernardino County. It started late Tuesday about 50 miles east of Los Angeles near Rialto and Fontana,and by Wednesday morning had burned 147 acres , though no evacuations have been ordered,the San Bernardino County Fire District said.\n\nFire officials said the Sierra Fire was fanned by the Santa Ana winds -- strong, dry winds that high-pressure systems push from east to west, from the mountains and desert areas down into the Los Angeles area. It was 85% contained by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWinds were \"particularly strong\" Wednesday morning but weakened during the day, meteorologists said. The forecast calls for light winds Thursday and Friday, but brisk winds are expected to return Saturday night.\n\nThe chance of precipitation -- next week -- has increased, forecasters said.\n\nA look at the wildfires' astonishing numbers\n\n\u2022 Camp Fire: The Camp Fire has destroyed 8,650 homes and The Camp Fire has destroyed 8,650 homes and scorched 138,000 acres in Northern California .

As of Wednesday, the inferno was 52% contained.\n\n\u2022 Hill Fire: A second Southern California blaze has burned 4,531 acres and was A second Southern California blaze has burned 4,531 acres and was 96% contained as of Wednesday morning.\n\n\u2022 Death toll: There have been 58 deaths statewide.\n\n\u2022 A devastating week for the Golden State: More than 230,000 acres burned in California in the past week. That's larger than the cities of Chicago and Boston combined. And in 30 days, firefighters have battled more than 500 blazes, said Cal Fire, the state's forestry and fire protection agency.\n\nFederal officials visit\n\nPresident Donald Trump received a briefing about the fires from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long, who were in California.\n\nThe two officials told reporters the Camp Fire was one of the worst disasters they have seen.\n\nZinke also said this is not the time to cast the deadly fire in a political light or cast blame.\n\nDevastation in Paradise, CA.

It's not a federal issue. This is an American issue of managing our forests,\" he said.\n\nZinke cited several reasons for the increase in devastation including dead and dying timber and beetle infestation. He stopped short of blaming climate change.\n\nHe said prescribed burns are a start and that \"the best scientists are looking at best practices.\"\n\nAfter viewing the decimated town of Paradise, Long said a lot of planning will go into reconstructing the town.\n\n\"This is a very complex disaster. Probably one of the most complicated disasters this nation has ever seen when it comes to Paradise,\" he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands are displaced\n\nMore than 300,000 people have been forced from their homes statewide. Most of those live in Los Angeles County, where 170,000 were evacuated.\n\nThomas Hirsch was searching the burned remains of his childhood home Tuesday in Malibu, looking for anything salvageable. His parents -- who are 97 and 94 -- still live there and plan to rebuild, he said.\n\n\"We're survivors.

The announcement triggered protests and violence leaving one person dead.\n\nWickremesinghe denounced Sirisena's attempt to remove him from office and refused to leave the official prime minister's residence, claiming the president does not have the power to take such action.\n\nSirisena had attempted to prevent a vote of no-confidence by dissolving Parliament until December 7, however, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court overturned the president's controversial decision and ordered an interim order, paving the way for fresh elections.\n\nIn a move that showed that he was potentially softening his hard stance, Sirisena invited his ousted Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, leaders of his party and those associated for talks Wednesday evening.\n\nSpokesman Mahinda Samarasinghe declined to comment on the meeting, but told CNN: \"The President will act constitutionally and within the framework of the law of the country.\"\n\nSri Lanka's former president and newly appointed prime minister Mahinda Rajapakse (C) attends the parliament session in Colombo on November 14, 2018.\n\nPassed by voice, not by name\n\nThe passing of the no-confidence motion comes as a major blow to Sirisena, demonstrating that his appointment of Rajapaksa does not have the majority backing of the 225 seat Parliament.\n\nContrary to the usual practice, notice of the motion was given Wednesday morning and taken up for discussion immediately after.\n\nHowever, such was the commotion inside the House Wednesday, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was prevented from taking the vote by name, as is standard, and instead forced to take a vote by voice.\n\nThe resolution, which was passed by a majority, was moved by left wing Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and law maker Vijitha Herath.\n\nThe United National Party of ousted Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, the Tamil National Alliance and smaller Muslim parties all supported the no-confidence motion.\n\nThree newly sworn cabinet ministers and a state minister also crossed over to the opposition benches in support.

Kilmer lost her own mother as a teenager and was determined to get more time with her only child.\n\nKilmer searched for experimental treatments, opting for an unproven approach in which researchers select drugs based on the genes in patients' tumors. Doctors have selected her treatments for the past three years based on the unique, ever-changing DNA of her cancer cells. Now 41, Kilmer has responded better than anyone dared to hope. Her cancer has gone into hiding; her tumors are no longer visible on medical scans.\n\nKilmer's insurance company calls it experimental. As a consequence, her insurer has covered only a fraction of her care, forcing Kilmer to make an agonizing choice: stop taking a drug that costs nearly $17,000 a month or pay out-of-pocket, burdening her family with tremendous debt.\n\n\"When you are looking at your daughter, you ask yourself, 'Do I take a medication that might allow me to see her graduate high school?'\" asked Kilmer, of Spearfish, S.D. \"Or do you stop taking it to avoid causing her financial harm?\"\n\nKristen Kilmer, at home with her family, was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer at age 38.\n\nThe high cost of cutting-edge tests and treatments is threatening to keep precision medicine -- one of the most celebrated areas in cancer research -- out of reach for many patients. Patients who pay for these new treatments on their own \"could be in debt for decades,\" said Dr. Scott Ramsey, director of the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research in Seattle.\n\nAlready cancer care is hugely expensive. A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that 42 percent of patients depleted 100 percent of their assets -- an average loss of $92,000 -- within two years of diagnosis.\n\nPrecision medicine involves running expensive tests called genomic sequencing, which scan the DNA of tumors to find mutations that might be susceptible to available drugs. Although the field is relatively new, hundreds of thousands of cancer patients have had their tumors sequenced to identify cancer-related mutations, according to testing companies\n\nMedicare, the government insurance plan for people 65 and older, announced in March that it will pay for genomic testing for people with advanced cancers -- a decision that could add $2.5 billion to federal health care costs, according to a May analysis in Health Affairs\n\nFew private insurers cover the tests, leaving some patients with surprise medical bills.\n\nCarrie Wyman, who also has advanced breast cancer, discovered that her insurance plan doesn't cover genomic sequencing only after she received a $5,800 statement.\n\n\"I just assumed it would be covered,\" said Wyman, 50, a resident of La Plata, Md., who has six children and stepchildren. \"I was blindsided, to be honest with you.\"\n\nLooking For Financial Assistance\n\nYet paying for that initial test is just the beginning. As Kilmer learned, finding the money for ongoing treatment is far more challenging, said Dr. Gary Lyman, who studies way to improve health care quality at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.\n\nIn some cases, genomic tests match patients to experimental drugs available only in clinical trials. Although these trials sometimes provide free medications, many cancer patients can't afford to travel to participate in them. Kilmer drives 12 hours round-trip every month to participate in a clinical trial in Sioux Falls, S.D. The expenses add up quickly, she said.\n\nKristen Kilmer spreads out her daily medications, including Lynparza, center, which costs nearly $17,000 per month.\n\nKilmer's genomic tests identified a rearrangement in the PALB2 gene. Preliminary studies suggest that tumors with this genetic rearrangement could be susceptible to the drug Lynparza, but those effects haven't been definitively proven in large-scale studies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Lynparza only for breast cancer patients with a mutation called BRCA.\n\nLegally, doctors can prescribe Lynparza \"off label\" to anyone with cancer. But insurance programs are reluctant to cover off-label treatments, unless they're specifically recommended in expert guidelines.\n\nKilmer has spent much of the past three years battling insurance officials and begging drug companies for financial assistance. The drugmakers have been generous, allowing her to take a rotating cocktail of experimental drugs for free because of her modest income.\n\nIn September, however, AstraZeneca decided to end Kilmer's financial aid. Kilmer appealed the drug company's decision.\n\nPaying thousands of dollars a month is not an option, Kilmer said. Her family already carries significant credit card debt from earlier cancer treatments. She estimates that she has spent about $80,600 out-of-pocket treating her illness, including $23,600 on her early breast cancer therapy and $57,000 treating metastatic disease.\n\nKilmer said she would rather stop taking Lynparza than financially burden her daughter and husband, a truck driver.\n\n\"It's not worth it,\" Kilmer said. \"I will not put my family into that kind of debt.\"\n\nUncertain Benefits\n\nInsurers say costs aren't their only concern. Evidence is lacking that the precision medicine approach will work consistently, they argue.\n\nAmerica's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said genetic sequencing remains unproven.\n\nCathryn Donaldson, the group's spokeswoman, described recent scientific advances as \"remarkable and noteworthy.\" But she said insurers \"need a more definitive answer\" about whether the tests help the average patient live longer.\n\nKristen Kilmer said she'd rather stop taking Lynparza than financially burden her family.\n\nThe South Dakota State Employee Health Plan -- which runs Kilmer's insurance plan -- said it bases its coverage decisions on science and reviews \"published, randomized data about the safety and efficacy of the requested drugs.\"\n\nAlthough genetic testing has become the standard of care for melanoma and a common type of lung cancer, no one knows if genomic sequencing will extend the lives of people with other types of cancer, said Dr. Carolyn Presley, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nWithout insurance coverage, some cancer patients simply give up on treatment.\n\nstudy of more than 1,000 women with advanced breast cancer -- presented at a September meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology -- found that 54 percent had stopped or refused treatment due to cost. The women in the study may have been more vulnerable than most, because 30 percent were uninsured, about twice the national rate\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn an August study in JAMA , researchers found that relatively few of those who hoped to benefit from precision medicine actually ended up on a medication. Just 15 percent of those who underwent genomic sequencing ended up taking a targeted therapy, according to the study. The study didn't ask participants why they failed to get a targeted drug, but Presley, the lead author, said it's likely that some patients couldn't afford them.\n\n\"We're finding the mutations, but patients aren't getting the drugs,\" Presley said. Without insurance, she said, \"you and I would not be able to afford these medications. It's a huge barrier.\"\n\nWithin hours of the publication of this story, AstraZeneca called Kilmer to notify her that it would continue to provide financial aid.

Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much. At 2\u00bd, she can still run around and play with her sister in their toy kitchen, read books and giggle with her grandma.", "Beijing (CNN) When passengers for Air France flight AF116 boarded their aircraft in Paris last Saturday night, they expected to land in Shanghai on Sunday evening after an 11-hour journey.\n\nInstead, for three days, more than 200 passengers became stuck in a remote town in Siberia, where overnight temperatures plunged to nearly -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe original Boeing 777-300ER plane was diverted to Irkutsk on Sunday after experiencing \"a technical problem\", Air France said in a statement.\n\nThe plane landed safely after reporting smoke in the cabin and none of the 280 people on board were hurt, Russian news agency Sputnik cited a local airport official as saying.\n\nAfter realizing repairs couldn't be done quickly enough on the ground, the airline sent a second B777 from Paris to the Russian city to pick up the stranded passengers.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nNeil Young, Robin Thicke y Gerard Butler son otros famosos cuyas casas se perdieron en los incendios.\n\nCyrus dijo previamente que estaba devastada por los incendios en la comunidad\n\nCyrus y Hemsworth donaron 500.000 d\u00f3lares a la fundaci\u00f3n The Malibu Foundation por los incendios en California\n\n(CNN) - Miley Cyrus y Liam Hemsworth perdieron su casa en uno de los incendios que afectan California, pero la pareja de famosos tiene el objetivo de reconstruir no solo su hogar sino su comunidad.\n\nCyrus y Hemsworth donaron 500.000 d\u00f3lares a la fundaci\u00f3n The Malibu Foundation a trav\u00e9s de la organizaci\u00f3n de caridad de Cyrus, Happy Hippie, dijo un representante.\n\nLos fondos ser\u00e1n utilizados para \"aquellos con necesidades financieros, asistencia de emergencia, reconstrucci\u00f3n de la comunidad, prevenci\u00f3n de incendios forestales y adaptaci\u00f3n al cambio clim\u00e1tico\", de acuerdo con un comunicado.\n\nEl martes, Hemsworth comparti\u00f3 una impactante fotograf\u00eda de los restos de su casa.\n\nIt\u2019s been a heartbreaking few days.

Australia's north, the latest in a series of \"Big Things\" built as tourist attractions across the country.\n\nThe bright-pink slice of watermelon will join such cultural icons as the Big Merino in Goulburn, New South Wales, the Big Banana in Coffs Harbour and the Big Lobster in South Australia.\n\nThe \"Big Melon\" is actually a slice of watermelon. Wotif\n\n\"I could not think of a better way to capture the fun and excitement of visiting our region, especially after the Chinchilla Melon Festival, than by having your photo taken with our newest tourist attraction,\" Paul McVeigh, mayor of Western Downs Regional Council, said in a statement.\n\nRelated content 10 of Australia's best beaches\n\nStanding 9 meters wide (29 feet) and 3 high (nine

more than 15,000 visitors, according to the town.\n\nThe watermelon was built as part of Australian travel site Wotif's \"Next Big Thing\" campaign, in celebration of their 18th birthday, where thousands of Australians submitted their suggestions for what should be the country's next large-scale roadside attraction.\n\nAccording to Wotif, the \"Big Melon\" beat out the \"Big Peanut,\" suggested for Kingaroy in Queensland, and the \"Big Tulip\" in Mittagong, New South Wales.\n\nRelated content How this Australian Instagram account amassed 3.2 million followers\n\nWotif Managing Director Daniel Finch said in a statement that the company had been inundated with votes from each of the contending towns. \"It goes to show the significance of 'Big Things' in Australia and how sentimental Aussies are about them,\" he said.\n\nMayor McVeigh said he was excited to have Chincilla finally on Australia's \"Big Things\" tourist map.", "\u0645\u0639 \u0628\u062f\u0621

"(CNN) US Vice President Mike Pence told Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi Wednesday that the treatment of her country's stateless Rohingya Muslim population was inexcusable.\n\n\"The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes which resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh is without excuse,\" Pence told Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Singapore. \"I'm anxious to hear about the progress you're making in holding those accountable who are responsible.\"\n\nIt comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp. The Myanmar government has repeatedly denied that its soldiers deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya.\n\nPence also brought up the jailing of two Reuters reporters who were sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty in September of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Muslim population was inexcusable.\n\n\"The violence and persecution by military and vigilantes which resulted in driving 700,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh is without excuse,\" Pence told Suu Kyi on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Singapore. \"I'm anxious to hear about the progress you're making in holding those accountable who are responsible.\"\n\nIt comes as officials in Myanmar and Bangladesh get ready to repatriate more than 2,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year.\n\nThe Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, has been accused of using rape, murder and arson in a systematic campaign of ethnic cleansing that drove hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, where they languish in what has become the world's largest refugee camp. The Myanmar government has repeatedly denied that its soldiers deliberately attacked unarmed Rohingya.\n\nPence also brought up the jailing of two Reuters reporters who were sentenced to seven years in prison after being found guilty in September of breaching the country's Official Secrets Act.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller are back on the lesson plan after a vote by the Texas State Board of Education.\n\nThe committee voted 12-2, with one abstention, on Tuesday to continue teaching students about Clinton in high school history classes, according to State Board of Education Director Debbie Ratcliffe. The board also voted to keep Keller on the curriculum.\n\nThe vote reverses a September preliminary decision to cut the women, along with 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater and several other historical figures, from the required curriculum. The board said then that the change was intended to streamline the curriculum for its 5.4 million students at the recommendation of volunteer work groups.\n\nThe thinking was that less content would allow teachers to take deeper dives into certain topics, rather than emphasizing such things as the memorization of dates, Donna Bahorich, chairperson of the Texas State Board of Education said in a statement in September.\n\n\"Texas simply has too many learning standards, required to be taught and assessed on state assessments, for educators to cover in a year,\" she said.\n\nRead More",

Khosrowshahi says he's waiting for more information about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi before taking any action over the Saudi government's significant investment in the startup.\n\nKhosrowshahi was one of the first major CEOs to pull out of a high-profile Saudi business conference last month as the international outcry grew over the kingdom's role in the killing of Khashoggi , a Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi government.\n\nSaudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is a significant investor in Uber after putting $3.5 billion into the ride-hailing company in 2016. The fund's managing director, Yasir Al Rumayyan, sits on Uber's board.\n\nKhosrowshahi is now trying to figure out how to respond to the widespread outrage over the Saudi government's apparent connections to the killing of Khashoggi in the country's consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\n\"Until we learn more, we're not in a position to act one way or the other,\" he said Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal D.Live conference in California. \"The act itself was horrible. And we're anxious to learn more and then we'll talk to our board and decide the best way forward.\"\n\nDara Khosrowshahi addressed Uber's relationship with the Saudi government on Tuesday.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) In this White House, no one knows when the ax will fall or who will be swinging it.\n\nA new day of firing and fury culminating in a staggering power play by first lady Melania Trump deepened already historic dysfunction in the administration on Tuesday, leaving top officials blindsided and confused.\n\nEven compared with the senior staff knifings, bureaucratic turmoil and raging chaos that passes for normality in President Donald Trump's White House, her sudden move against a top foreign policy official was a bombshell.\n\nIn a public statement that came out of nowhere, the first lady's office warned that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel , with whom she reportedly clashed over a recent Africa trip, \"no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nHer dramatic intervention sparked speculation that the first lady was at odds with her husband, was overstepping her role and that the East Wing was going rogue. Melania Trump had already said in an ABC interview last month that she didn't trust some White House staffers. Now, she was doing something about it.\n\nOne person told CNN that, incredibly, Trump, chief of staff John Kelly and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders had no idea the statement was coming.\n\nA source told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that Trump -- who often finds it difficult to fire people in person despite his schtick on NBC's \"The Apprentice\" -- had decided that Ricardel has to go, though she was being given time to clear her desk.\n\nBut as is often the case in this poorly run White House, there was uncertainty at first over Ricardel's actual fate. It was not clear on Wednesday morning whether she had been officially dismissed, whether she would show up for work as usual or if she might be found a spot elsewhere in the administration. Later Wednesday, Sanders issued a statement confirming Ricardel will leave her White House position, while noting that Ricardel will \"transition to a new role within the Administration.\"\n\nIt's not unusual for unease to stalk the White House after a midterm election loss, as staffers exhausted by the first half of the President's mandate give way to fresher troops. And Tuesday was not the first time a first lady has leaned on her husband over a staffer she finds irksome.\n\nBut this President's mercurial temperament and the nest of vipers that is his West Wing has inflicted more nerve-rattling pressure on his staff than is normal even in the White House, where crises are always just around the corner.\n\nThe current turbulence and sense of presidential norms being shattered by an emotional and erratic president feels different and more consequential than the wild staff intrigues of early in the presidency. It's beginning to raise real questions about what is in store for the nation over the second half of Trump's term.\n\nSeveral Cabinet members -- including Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen -- are being targeted by whispering campaigns, leaks and speculation about their fates as trial balloons float about possible replacements.\n\nKelly, who has survived several rounds of scuttlebutt about his often supposedly imminent departure, is said to be heading for the exit again. And leaked reports that Trump sees Ryan Zinke as vulnerable to Democratic oversight have weakened the Interior secretary's position.\n\nTrump is meanwhile digging in on his constitutionally questionable appointment of Matthew Whitaker, a critic of Robert Mueller, to oversee the special counsel probe as acting attorney general after Jeff Sessions was fired.\n\nSanders had been expected to leave, along with her deputy Raj Shah, but their status remains uncertain.\n\nMore than the usual staff turmoil\n\nTrump uses pandemonium as an instrument of personal power, leaving everyone off balance and unsure of what will happen next, while he sits in the center of the storm ready to make his next move.\n\nSowing disruption in Washington, while confounding the political establishment and perceptions of how a White House should be run, allows the President to keep faith with his political base.\n\nSo palace intrigue has been part of the administration from the start, along with media narratives that Trump is running his White House like a reality show and is constantly firing off distractions for reporters to chase.\n\nIt seems certain that Trump will emerge from this highly charged moment with fewer constraints if senior staffers who have tried to keep him within the bounds of presidential custom and the law depart.\n\nHe may have more latitude to follow an unpredictable course in which he sometimes seems to brush up against governing conventions and constitutional guardrails he often doesn't seem to even know are there.\n\nThis could be an increasing problem when the administration faces a sudden burst of investigations from the new Democratic House, a reality for which lax oversight by Republicans has left it deeply underprepared.\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nAnd there is a good chance that Trump becomes even more distracted by the Mueller investigation with speculation heating up about possible new indictments and the contents of the special counsel's long awaited final report.\n\nOn Tuesday, with his White House in uproar, he was sitting down with his lawyers to answer written questions posed by Mueller -- a potential critical moment for his presidency.\n\nAmazingly, the President is yet to face a major international crisis that he did not precipitate \u2014 like a close military call with a major adversary or a financial crash, that will require focused, unambiguous leadership and a crack team operating with unity and purpose. That seems an unlikely prospect in this White House.\n\nThere must also be questions, given the ever more fractious nature of life in his administration, whether top-level staffers on the GOP bench who might be persuaded to serve are going to have second thoughts.\n\nAfter all, officials like Nielsen and Kelly have put their own reputations on the line, defending the President's controversial policies on immigration, only for him to turn on them in the end.\n\nRight now, the only White House staffers who might consider themselves safe are his kin: his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nBut the danger of running a West Wing on the nepotistic model of Trump's business has been made clear recently with the crisis over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The assassination, which caused global outrage, is being widely blamed on Mohammad bin Salman, the Crown Prince on whom Kushner -- going around the State Department -- anchored Middle East policy.\n\nMelania Trump shows her power\n\nTuesday's swoop by the first lady was remarkable. In a show of force apparently brewing for days, she made Ricardel's position untenable.\n\nIn a dash of added intrigue, Melania Trump twisted the knife with national security adviser John Bolton, who has forged his own deserved reputation as a ruthless bureaucratic assassin, out of the action -- nearly 10,000 miles away in Singapore.\n\nIt was not the first time a senior West Wing staffer paid the price for falling out with a first lady.\n\nGossip often bubbled over ill will between Nancy Reagan and ex-White House chief of staff Don Regan.

The collection contains what's reputed to be the most valuable item of furniture in the world, a cabinet valued by the estate at $30 million. One of the chairs in use during CNN's visit turned out to be worth a million dollars. When asked why such a valuable chair was being treated so casually, a member of staff replied: \"Because they are here to be used.\"\n\nPhotos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Photos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Prince Charles poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Hide Caption 52 of 52\n\nEncouraged by the prince, this un-precious philosophy is what drives the place. It's meant to be a living, breathing project that is not only part of the community but adds to it. Prince Charles stepped in to save the estate from the seventh Marquess of Bute who couldn't afford the upkeep. It was renovated and reopened by the prince as a visitor attraction.\n\nDumfries House is now the second-largest employer in the county, after the local authority, and has even funded a new town hall and outdoor swimming pool in the nearby town of New Cumnock. Every Friday, the prince is sent a report on the estate running to dozens of pages and he returns it with notes the next morning.\n\n\"The signs were there from young adulthood -- his concerns about social issues, community issues and ecological issues,\" Dunsmuir said. \"All that's happened is that he's got more and more involved and has had the time to develop these ideas and take them further, due to the length of time that he's been Prince of Wales. What I'd like to think is that in bringing together so many strands into the Prince's Foundation of his charitable initiatives, that this (Dumfries House) is a fantastic physical legacy of that work that will always be here and always remain.\"\n\nWhile Dumfries House may be the project that best symbolizes Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales, we shouldn't take it as an indication of what sort of king he will be. A senior aide said the prince feels a duty to use his platform now to promote his causes before he becomes head of state. He knows the two roles are distinct and it is \"his clear wish and intention to change his approach in the next role.\"\n\nWithout doubt, he has a lot to live up to. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is revered for the way she has steadily gained popularity during the course of her reign despite the collapse of the British Empire and a general loss of deference in society. She has modernized and stayed relevant by embracing public walkabouts, mass media and charitable work. She has rarely expressed any opinions, let alone political views, so we never know quite what she is thinking.\n\nWe know what the Prince of Wales thinks about a wide range of issues so he is already a more divisive figure and that won't simply be forgotten when he takes the throne.\n\nHe was ahead of his time on many issues, warning as far back as the 1970s of the dangers of climate change before it became a mainstream issue, and he continues to do so now when, for many, it's become a political issue.\n\nA giant portrait of Prince Charles outside a Young Entrepreneurs Event in Accra, Ghana, on November 5.\n\nAt a speech in Accra, Ghana, last week, the Prince said, \"I know, Mr. President, that you share my determination that the Commonwealth should strive for renewed relevance in the lives of its citizens and should draw upon its unparalleled networks of professional expertise to offer practical solutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, many of which are increasingly deep-seated and deeply integrated. No issue is more pressing, it seems to me, than that of climate change. The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which provided stark and alarming evidence that even 1.5 degrees of warming will mean catastrophic damage to the planet's ecosystems, sent a clear signal that we must all surely heed.\"\n\nCharles will become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.\n\nHe made the case again in Nigeria with a group of powerful regional leaders. After the meeting in Abuja, the Emir of Kano was positive about the Prince's interventions, telling CNN: \"He's been talking about climate change. He's been talking about demographic implosions. He's been talking about town planning and we do not make the connection between these three issues, for example, and some of the conflicts we see.\"\n\nPrince Charles attends a meeting with regional leaders in Abuja on November 6.\n\nThere was particular interest in his work on youth unemployment, which is rife in the region, though the prince wasn't able to see as much of the country as he had hoped, to his frustration. Because of security concerns, the British government called off a visit to Jos, a city in Central Nigeria that has been the scene of deadly clashes between Christians and Muslims.\n\n\"The only sad thing for me was not being able to go further into other parts of Nigeria,\" Prince Charles told CNN. \"It is such a vast country and obviously there are so many other states and interesting areas. I know many are facing different challenges and other opportunities, so it was a pity not being able to do that, but otherwise it's always marvellous coming here because people are so friendly. I'm always intrigued by the way so many of these young, for instance, are developing really interesting ideas that they can turn into businesses and things like that, helping to tackle some of the real issues we face, particularly around the environment and waste and goodness knows what else. Very ingenious characters.\"\n\nAt 70, Prince Charles has given his future role \"a lot of thought,\" the senior aide told CNN, particularly what he will and won't be able to speak about, but it \"doesn't weigh heavily\" on his shoulders.\n\nIf he feels any pressure, it appears to be completing his work as Prince of Wales, which is a role he has made his own. He's redefined the responsibility that comes with being heir and in that sense he has already left a legacy.", "(CNN) Britain's Prince Charles has released a candid family photograph, as the heir to the throne celebrates his 70th birthday.\n\nIn a special edition of British magazine Country Life , which the Prince of Wales guest-edited to mark the occasion, he spoke of \"the alarming realization that I have reached the biblical threshold of three score years and 10.\"\n\nHowever, in the official portrait, taken in the gardens of Clarence House in London in September, Charles looks anything but alarmed.\n\nBritain's Prince Charles poses for an official portrait to mark his 70th birthday in the gardens of Clarence House.\n\nIt's been five years since Charles last stepped in as guest editor for Country Life, and this edition offers even greater insight into the royal's life and his views on the British countryside.\n\nAn interview with his eldest son William, the Duke of Cambridge, reveals that Charles, a long-time advocate of environmental issues such as climate change, is \"completely infatuated\" by the endangered red squirrels and has \"hundreds\" of bird tables at his Highgrove estate in England, which he replenishes by hand whenever he is there.\n\nThe prince also commissioned his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, to write about her support for the Medical Detection Dogs charity.\n\nPhotos: The heir apparent: Britain's Prince Charles Prince Charles poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Hide Caption 52 of 52\n\nLandmark birthday\n\nEarlier this month, Charles spoke for the first time about what sort of king he will be in a BBC documentary celebrating his 70th birthday.\n\nThe king in waiting promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once he takes on the role of the monarch.\n\n\"You know, I've tried to make sure whatever I've done has been nonparty political, but I think it's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two. So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir,\" said Charles.\n\nAs heir to the throne, Charles has written to ministers -- and even the prime minister -- on subjects close to his heart. He has spoken out on issues such as the environment and modern architecture -- he once called a proposed extension to the National Gallery in London a \"monstrous carbuncle.\"\n\nThe proposals were later dropped.\n\n\"So, clearly ... I won't be able to do the same things I've done you know as heir, so of course you operate within the ... the constitutional parameters. But it's a different function,\" he said in the film, titled \"Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70.\"\n\nAfrica tour\n\nPrince Charles and his wife Camilla, earlier this month undertook a nine-day tour of West Africa. The royal couple visited Nigeria, Ghana and Gambia to celebrate the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth.\n\nCharles will become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king.\n\nIn Accra, Ghana, once the embarkation point for many Africans traded as slaves, the prince condemned the modern slave trade, saying: \"We have a shared responsibility to ensure that the abject horror of slavery is never forgotten, that we abhor the existence of modern slavery.\"\n\n\"The royal visit will celebrate the UK's dynamic, forward-looking partnerships with these Commonwealth Nations on a range of shared priorities,\" Clarence House said in a statement.\n\n\"The visits will highlight key themes in these relationships, including the importance of our Commonwealth ties.\"",

And I ran up and down the length of the train showing people my cartoons. I remember that as a really strong memory between me and my mother.\"\n\n\"Let's Make a Deal\" (2018) by Jim Carrey Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nIn this way, Carrey's recently opened exhibition of his political cartoons at Maccarone Gallery in Los Angeles \"is really a revisitation, a re-gifting of my childhood. It's become a political thing at the moment because I think that's necessary. But it's a thing that's been in my life, my whole life.\"\n\nThe show, titled \"IndigNation,\" features 108 drawings from Carrey's Twitter feed, where the works where originally shared, from roughly 2016 to the present. The wall labels echo the tweets that accompanied the drawings.\n\nObama 'Hope' artist: Trump is 'dangerous'\n\nAs a highly subjective document of a fraught political moment, it's a fascinating timeline, mainly depicting the president as a clown, a cyclops, a pig, a witch and a kinky ice cream-eater among other unflattering personages, alongside more flash-in-the-pan political figures.\n\nOne drawing from early this year disfigures Trey Gowdy, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, as a slack-jawed rat set against a background of red and blue scribbles, alongside the caption-tweet : \"Another RAT leaps from the sinking ship! Swim Willard! Swim! #TreyGowdy.\" (One has to dig deep into the news cycle memory to recall that Gowdy was one of the first Republicans to publicly defend the FBI's investigation into Russian intervention in the 2016 election.)\n\nOther sundry figures that briefly burst into headlines over the past two years are similarly subject to the invective of Carrey's colorful cartoons. Former political consultant Rick Gates, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, national security adviser John Bolton are all presented with much censure but little context. The show feels less like a critique than a reaction to -- and some ways an enactment of -- the disorienting political circus that sparked it.\n\n\"I have many friends who are connected in the media world and I get a lot of information from a lot of sources,\" Carrey said when asked where he gets his news from, \"but I also watch the other side, to great chagrin, from time to time. It is about weird sides and misinformation and this strange pseudo structure we're living in, where half the people believe a completely different story.\"\n\n\"Greedzilla\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nThe world of Jim Carrey's political cartoons, where an Ace Ventura avatar gleefully rides atop an elephant with Trump's sons impaled on its tusks, relates only loosely to the history of art, or even the political cartoon itself. The latter is often a finely tuned metaphor, turning drawing into a narrative infographic. The reactionary force of \"IndigNation,\" which has been the source of much of its praise, produces something different: revenge caricatures and revisionist fantasies.\n\n\"There's a little bit of a push that has to happen with someone like me,\" Carrey admitted. \"People have to get over a preexisting prejudice about coming from a supposedly different line of work. But it's not a different line of work to me.\"\n\n\"The Great Spewdini\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nIt's true. Carrey's staggering talents as a comedian, actor and entertainer are undeniable and seemingly impossible to disentangle from any critique of his work as a visual artist.\n\nStripped of the context of his celebrity aura, the drawings and paintings resemble much of what can be found stacked on the blankets of any street artist hawking their wares on Venice Beach, or hung on the walls of a college town coffee shop or inked in the pages of an angry teen's notebook. Which makes \"IndigNation\" more compelling as a case study in the ethics of attention than anything else.\n\n\"Capitalism with a Conscience\" (2018) Credit: Courtesy Jim Carrey/Maccarone\n\nTaylor Swift expressed support for Democratic senate and house candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in her home state of Tennessee (the former lost, while the latter was reelected), reportedly causing a spike in voter registration.

Richard Sokolsky is a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former member of the secretary of state's Office of Policy Planning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the authors; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Among the most magical urban myths floating around the Trump administration is that Saudi Arabia is America's strategic partner and the relationship is simply too big to fail. Sadly, that relationship is already failing.\n\nIndeed, under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), Saudi Arabia has willfully pursued policies that have undermined both American interests and values. Worse still, the Trump administration envisions a role for Saudi Arabia in its Middle East strategy that can only disappoint.\n\nIn recent weeks, Turkish authorities have accused the Saudi regime of responsibility for the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed rogue operatives for the killing and dismissed a number of high-ranking officials.\n\nThere's no doubt that Saudi Arabia is important to the United States. Preserving global access to its oil, avoiding the chaos that would be unleashed if the kingdom collapsed or became a failed state, and cooperation on counter-terrorism are clearly core US interests.\n\nBut to concede these interests doesn't mean Saudi Arabia is a reliable security partner of the United States or that Riyadh is America's strategic ally. Saudi Arabia is in fact a repressive police state that has long exported a strain of Islam supportive of Islamic jihadi terrorist activity and that ideologically has been hostile to America, the West, Jews and Christians.\n\nMBS has made an effort to restrain religious extremism. But he's also launched a major crackdown to concentrate absolute power, repress civil society and journalists and jail or intimidate his opponents.\n\nAs for promoting US interests, the past year and a half reads like a DIY manual in undermining them. The detention of the Lebanese Prime Minister, in an apparent bid to force his resignation, has only strengthened Hezbollah. Bin Salman's disastrous boycott of Qatar made it more difficult for the Gulf Cooperation Council to stand up to Iran and has driven Doha and Tehran closer together, and his failed military campaign in Yemen has created instability, polarized the region and expanded rather than contracted Iranian influence (and given ISIS more room to maneuver).\n\nSaudi Arabia has proven to be too weak and incompetent to be a bulwark against Iran; on the contrary, it has been an enabler of Tehran's influence.\n\nThe Trump administration, and especially the President, have argued that punishing Saudi Arabia for the killing of Khashoggi would jeopardize the much ballyhooed $110 billion arms sales package that was announced last year in Riyadh. This is baloney. Of this amount, the Washington Post reported , there were many suggestions of intent to purchase weapons and \"six specific items, adding up to $28 billion, [of which] ... all had been previously notified to Congress by the Obama administration.\"\n\nThe rest comprise a Saudi pipe dream of future purchases, not signed contracts, most of which are unlikely to reach fruition because of Saudi budgetary pressures. Moreover, in the unlikely event that the Saudis put their money where their mouth is, Trump's claims that it would produce 500,000 to one million jobs in the American defense industry are \"fake facts.\"\n\nThe real facts are: 1) the Saudis need US weapons and equipment more than we need to sell them, in part because they demonstrate the US security commitment to the kingdom; and 2) it would be very difficult and expensive for the Saudis to make good on their periodic threats to \"buy foreign\" if they can't get what they want from the United States.\n\nThen there's the much trumpeted claim the Saudis are always there when you need them on oil prices. There are many examples of the Saudis bucking US interests when it came to oil supply, including its leadership of the 1973 Arab oil boycott, its expansion of output to drive down prices in an effort to hurt the US oil fracking industry, and its decision this week to reduce supplies to drive prices up.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether, on another occasion, the Saudis would move to increase supplies in the wake of a very tight market. If they did so, it would be a calculation driven by a Saudi-first, not an America-first, oil policy.\n\nFinally, there's the administration's conviction that the Saudis are integral to achieving Israeli-Palestinian peace. There's no doubt that MBS has warmed up to the Israelis, largely because of their common interest in checking Iran and Sunni jihadists. But direct and under-the-table contacts are a far cry from open meetings or support for a US peace plan that on issues like Jerusalem and borders violates the Arab consensus and could hand Iran and Sunni Muslims a propaganda windfall if the plan is too aligned with the needs of the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nKing Salman \u2014 MBS' father -- has reined in his son on this issue and publicly identified conditions that would be needed to gain Saudi support.\n\nIn response to the killing of Khashoggi, the Trump administration has doubled down on the US-Saudi relationship and would love to find a way to sweep this crime under the rug. Washington need not abandon the relationship, but it needs a serious reset. MBS has become more of a liability than an asset for Washington, and we should not be enabling or coddling him.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia wants to continue its reckless policies abroad and despotic behavior at home, it's free to do so, but not with American support. And that means imposing harsh costs on the Saudis for the killing of Khashoggi and serious efforts to end the kingdom's destructive and inhumane policies in Yemen.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 ambientada en un gran universo inspirado en el mundo noir\n\n\"El caminante, hablador y peludo detective\", y ha dividido a los seguidores de la franquicia\n\n(CNN) - Pok\u00e9mon se ha vuelto real.

Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Filemon Vela of Texas, contended that their private conversations revealed that Pelosi would soon learn that she lacked backing within the full House to be elected speaker next year -- despite her confidence that she would lock down the necessary support.\n\n\"I am 100% confident we can forge new leadership,\" Vela told CNN.\n\nAsked how confident they were that they could defeat Pelosi, Moulton also said: \"100%.\"\n\nThe Pelosi detractors are circulating a letter and trying to accumulate enough signatures to showcase the breadth of the Democratic opposition to Pelosi. The strategy is this: Show that the California Democrat lacks support after new and current members commit to voting for another candidate on the floor. At that point, they hope, Pelosi will see the writing on the wall, step aside and allow new candidates for the speakership to emerge.\n\n\"We are trying to do the right thing for the party by solving this ahead of time,\" Moulton said.\n\nThe goal, they said, is to release their letter as soon as this week or at least before the Nov. 28 leadership elections in the House Democratic Caucus. Pelosi will have to win a majority of support within the caucus to be nominated as speaker -- something that is virtually assured -- before the full House votes for a speaker in January, where the numbers will be critical.\n\nSupporters of Pelosi are deeply skeptical about her critics' predictions, expecting she will get enough votes to become speaker and will overcome the opposition from the small minority of rabble-rousing Democrats. No candidate has emerged to take her on, with even her opponent after the 2016 elections, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, saying he had no plans to jump in at the moment.\n\n\"Leader Pelosi is very confident in her support among members and members-elect,\" said Drew Hammill, her spokesman.\n\nFor days, Pelosi herself expressed no doubt she'd be elected speaker.\n\n\"A hundred percent,\" she said on CNN last week when asked about her level of confidence.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, whom many Pelosi detractors want to run for speaker, said he believes Pelosi will get the 218 votes she needs -- and insisted he was focused on his race for Democratic Caucus chairman, rather than a bid for the speakership.\n\n\"Never count out Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. \"Nobody within the Capitol dome is a better vote counter than the once and future speaker of the United States House of Representatives.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Marcia Fudge, a vocal Pelosi critic, said she's not ruling out a potential challenge against the Democratic leader.\n\n\"I have ruled out nothing,\" she said, adding that she's getting encouragement to run from \"a number\" of people. \"But what I'm saying to you is I haven't really given it any thought.\"\n\nThe current split in the House next year is 225-200, with Democrats holding the advantage, and with 10 races still outstanding, it's very likely that the Democratic majority will still grow. According to a CNN tally, 10 incoming freshman have said they'd oppose Pelosi, while 13 incumbents have vowed to oppose her.\n\nBut it's unclear if those members might vote against her in the caucus yet vote for her on the House floor. After the 2016 elections, 63 Democrats opposed Pelosi in the leadership races but nearly all of them voted for her later on the floor.\n\nJUST WATCHED Pelosi: I'm the best person to be speaker Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pelosi: I'm the best person to be speaker 01:19\n\nAfter this month's vote, the Democratic candidate for speaker will face off against the Republican candidate for speaker in January. House rules say the candidate who wins the race must secure a majority of votes from the members who attend and actually cast votes for a candidate. So if members skip the vote or decide to vote \"present,\" that would lower the threshold below 218 to win the speaker's election, something that could help Pelosi if her critics decide to skip the vote rather than vote against her.\n\nMoulton and Vela insisted that none of the detractors would do that.\n\n\"I'm confident that at this point, we have a number of current and incoming members committed to going to the floor and voting for someone else and not voting present,\" Vela said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments from lawmakers.", "Brenda Snipes, the embattled Broward County elections supervisor, responds to Republicans in Florida and nationally who are trying to paint the statewide recount as a Democratic effort to steal the election.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nVideo arriba: En 2013 Lucho Gatica habl\u00f3 con CNN en Espa\u00f1ol al cumplir 70 a\u00f1os de carrera.\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - El cantante de origen chileno Lucho Gatica falleci\u00f3 este martes en la ciudad de M\u00e9xico.

This famous West Hollywood road, dotted with marquee signs and patrolled by paparazzi, is where entertainment intersects with the American dream.\n\nAnd at 11pm on a Saturday at The Laugh Factory, it's also where Iranian-American comedian Maz Jobrani takes the stage. His aim is to give the audience relief from a tough week and from an even tougher political environment.\n\nFrom Trump jokes to dad jokes, no topic is taboo for Jobrani. His set covers his heritage, which has become a pillar of his standup, and his latest Netflix special \"Immigrant.\"\n\n\"Throughout my life and throughout my comedy I've talked about being Iranian, about being an immigrant. And I am very much in support of immigrants in America,\" says Jobrani.\n\nA new life\n\nIn 1978, when Jobrani was six years old, his family moved to the United States from Iran, as that country's revolution gathered steam.\n\n\"My father was on business in New York. He asked my mom to bring my sister and I out during winter break. I always say we packed for two weeks and we stayed for 40 years,\" he says.\n\nMaz Jobrani with his father in Iran (L) and in the United States at the age of eight (R).\n\nJobrani grew up in Northern California playing baseball and watching American cartoons, but also speaking Farsi and eating Persian food.\n\n\"The truth is, I never felt American enough and I never felt Iranian enough. I was always in between,\" says Jobrani.\n\nIt's this \"in between\" feeling that makes Jobrani's comedy so relatable. He's able to touch on a wide array of subjects that apply to many cultures.\n\nJobrani believes his brand of humor is universal. \"Jokes that you do in America will work in Saudi Arabia or in Jordan, or in Stockholm. It works all around the world,\" he says.\n\nThe American dream\n\nInspired by American comedian Eddie Murphy, Jobrani knew he wanted to be a performer from childhood.\n\nHe participated in drama classes throughout high school but when the time came for college applications, his parents pushed for a more conventional career path and persuaded him to study law. Later, while undertaking a PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, Jobrani took up acting again.\n\n\"I felt alive on stage. And whenever I would go to my political science classes, I felt kind of bogged down,\" he says.\n\nHe dropped out during the first year of his PhD. His mother was shocked -- and tried to persuade her son to become a mechanic.\n\n\"She said: 'Nobody needs an actor,'\" recalls Jobrani. \"My mom came from a revolution -- she thought you need to learn a skill so that if there's ever a revolution in America, you can go to Argentina and fix cars.\"\n\nComedy with a message\n\nJobrani honed his comedy skills at open mic nights, drawing on his personal experiences to develop his act. In the early 2000s, his career catapulted when he began touring with other Middle Eastern comedians under the title \"Axis of Evil\" -- a name designed to lampoon the term used by US president George W. Bush to describe states accused of sponsoring terrorism.\n\nMaz Jobrani's memoir, \"I'm Not a Terrorist But I've Played One on TV,\" was published in 2015.\n\nThe Comedy Central television channel picked it up and the group became a positive voice for Middle Eastern people in the wake of 9/11.\n\nSince then, Jobrani has had five TV standup specials, played roles in TV shows and movies, and penned a book called \"I'm Not a Terrorist But I've Played One on TV.\"\n\nOver the years, his comedy has mined other aspects of his identity -- dad, husband, Los Angeles resident.\n\nBut he says many of his jokes are still dedicated to one simple mission: making people see \"immigrant\" as a good word.", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to throw his support behind bipartisan criminal justice legislation during a Wednesday White House event, two sources close to the process tell CNN.\n\nTrump is scheduled to announce he is supporting the latest iteration of the First Step Act, a measure his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has been working to craft and build support for alongside a bipartisan group of senators, the sources said.

Regrettably, that did not appear to happen in this case.\"\n\nMatey is the latest in a string of nominees with controversial resumes that have punctuated a record-breaking push by the Trump administration to reshape the federal judiciary in a conservative mold.\n\nAlong the way, a handful of nominees have had their nominations withdrawn, including one tapped for a circuit court, Ryan Bounds, whose past writings were considered by lawmakers to be insensitive.\n\nThe Senate has so far confirmed 29 of President Donald Trump's nominees for powerful appellate judgeships, a feat underpinned by close coordination among Senate Republicans, the White House and outside legal groups.\n\nMatey, who also served in the US Attorney's Office in New Jersey under Christie, was recommended to the White House for the seat on the federal bench by his former boss, according to a questionnaire Matey submitted to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs an assistant US attorney, Matey prosecuted white-collar crime and health care fraud cases, including a 2009 case involving a financial adviser convicted of swindling his clients out of more than $9 million. In 2010, Matey followed Christie to the state's capital, ultimately becoming a deputy chief counsel to the popular Republican.\n\nChristie, a close Trump ally, has in recent days been mentioned as a potential attorney general nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, Matey denied involvement in a list of other Christie scandals ticked off by Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat.\n\n\"So many of the scandals it's hard to -- we don't have time to go through all of them,\" Leahy said.\n\nMatey's involvement in the fallout of Bridgegate, a political retribution scheme that saw lane closures on a section of the George Washington Bridge snarl traffic in Fort Lee, New Jersey, appears limited -- reports prepared for the state Legislature and governor's office mention only an internal questioning of a Christie aide he made as the scandal emerged.\n\nMatey was also behind the firing of one of the Christie aides later indicted for her role in the scandal, according to the 2016 book \"American Governor: Chris Christie's Bridge to Redemption,\" by Matt Katz, who covered Christie's administration for years.\n\nTwo former officials linked to the governor's office were sentenced last year after being found guilty of federal conspiracy and fraud charges. An appeal of the case is before the 3rd Circuit, which is based in Philadelphia.\n\nMatey's hearing Tuesday came despite the disapproval of his nomination by his home state senators.\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday protested the eschewing of that norm, referred to as the \"blue slip\" process, which has under recent committee chairmen allowed members of the party in opposition to the White House to block judicial nominees.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Judiciary Committee, repeated his stance on the blue slip process in an opening statement.\n\n\"My policy is that unreturned or negative blue slips will not necessarily preclude a hearing for a circuit-court nominee, unless the White House failed to consult with home-state senators,\" Grassley said, contending that it was consistent with decades of past committee leadership.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a member of the Judiciary Committee, pushed back on Grassley's assertion that the White House had meaningfully consulted with him on the nomination and said it was \"insulting\" that Trump aides had not set up a meeting between him and Matey ahead of the hearing.\n\nSome outside groups have expressed concern about Matey's involvement in the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal group that has held behind-the-scenes sway in the selection of judges and Supreme Court justices in the Trump administration. Matey has been a member of the group since 2001 and he led his state's chapter for several years, according to the questionnaire he submitted to the Senate.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, Vanita Gupta, the former acting head of the Justice Department's civil rights division under the Obama administration, called Matey a \"conservative ideologue\" and dinged the Federalist Society as an \"out-of-the-mainstream legal organization.\"\n\nGupta, now the head of the DC-based Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, also criticized Matey for writing in his committee questionnaire that he had performed no pro bono legal work since becoming an attorney.\n\nShe said Matey was the only Trump judicial nominee to say that he had provided no free legal services outside of his professional duties.\n\nPressed on his lack of pro bono experience in Tuesday's hearing, Matey said his years in public service had \"constrained my position to take on outside clients,\" but he detailed past work that had affected under-served communities, including a prison re-entry program he started at a hospital in Newark where he was general counsel after leaving the governor's office in 2015.", "At 70, Prince Charles demonstrates with his recent tour of West Africa that he has no intentions of slowing down.", "(CNN) \u2014 Always fantasized about attending a big blow-out India wedding, complete with days of celebration, delicious food, vibrant interiors and spectacular clothing?\n\nCrashing a random couple's nuptials isn't advisable, but there might still be a way to snag an invite.\n\nThat's where start-up JoinMyWedding.com steps in.

And if Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley steps aside from running the Senate Judiciary Committee to chair the Senate Finance Committee, as is widely expected, Graham would be poised to run the powerful panel that oversees the FBI. Graham's comments are the latest sign that the Senate GOP will be a counterbalance of sorts to House Democrats, who plan to end the House Republican probe into the FBI and launch a flurry of new investigations in their new majority next year.\n\nGraham also said Tuesday that he would support Senate passage of a bill to protect special counsels like Robert Mueller from political pressure, even though he said, \"I don't see any threat to Mueller.\" Democrats have demanded quick passage of that bill after President Donald Trump fired Jeff Sessions as attorney general last week and named Mueller critic Matt Whitaker to the post as acting AG.\n\n\"I'd support it if it came to the floor, but I don't see any threat to Mueller,\" said Graham, who cosponsored the special counsel bill that the Senate Judiciary Committee approved this year. \"The idea of a check and balance going forward makes sense to me. ...

She will move to a different job in the administration.\n\nIn those few months on the job, Ricardel generated a long list of enemies and developed a reputation for shouting at subordinates, plotting against White House officials she disliked and leaking stories about her administration opponents to the press. One source familiar with the situation said Ricardel's firing is due in part to her \"bullying\" of aides both above and below her.\n\nCurrent and former colleagues of Ricardel paint a picture of a committed conservative and national security expert with a strong personality. One former colleague described her as someone who doesn't \"suffer fools\" or have a nuanced touch when it comes to navigating the shoals of internal politics. A White House official was blunter, describing the California native as ideologically driven and \"obstinate\".\n\nEnemies\n\nThe former State Department and Pentagon official made enemies of heavyweights within the Trump administration, feuding with chief of staff John Kelly, his deputy Zach Fuentes, and locked horns with Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to people familiar with the White House intrigue.\n\nBut her spat with the first lady's staff over Mrs. Trump's trip to Africa -- apparently over seating on the plane and the use of National Security Council resources -- seems to have earned her the enmity of the person who may wield the most weight with Trump: his wife.\n\nThe President told people on Tuesday that he had made the decision to fire Ricardel, but that he was giving her time to clear her desk, making her the latest in a long list of high ranking officials who have left or been booted from the Trump administration.\n\nRicardel did not return requests for comment.\n\nRicardel was raised in Pasadena, the child of a Croatian immigrant and went on to study at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and then do doctoral work at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n\nLong experience\n\nShe went on to hold positions in three Republican administrations, working in the departments of State, Defense and Commerce, as well as acting as an aide to then Republican Senate leader Bob Dole. She has also worked in the private sector, including at Boeing, before becoming a member of Trump's presidential transition team as a Pentagon adviser.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton, who was in Singapore when news of Ricardel's dismissal broke, said when he tapped her to be his deputy in April that she \"has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues.\"\n\nAnd yet repeatedly during Ricardel's tenure, news stories trickled out of the troubled White House that suggested she wasn't managing teams or working within them particularly well.\n\nMost famously, she clashed with Mattis during the transition. Ricardel blocked some of his picks for Pentagon positions because they included former Obama administration officials who she felt were not strict Republican loyalists, multiple defense officials have told CNN.\n\nMattis then blocked Ricardel from getting a high level job at the Pentagon. In the months since Ricardel's arrival at the NSC, White House sources have repeatedly leaked stories to the press saying that Ricardel and Bolton were spreading rumors about Mattis' imminent departure in an effort to pressure the Pentagon chief to leave.\n\nBolton and Ricardel allegedly believe that Mattis is not \"ideologically aligned\" with Trump, according to Foreign Policy magazine, which quoted a former official saying that the two were trying \"to build the sense that he is done for.\"\n\nA former Trump transition official who is close to Ricardel said Ricardel thinks Mattis \"never should have been appointed and thinks he's a Democrat and tells anyone who will listen.\"\n\nRicardel also had a fraught relationship with Kelly and Fuentes, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believed Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, those sources said.\n\nBut Ricardel seems to have crossed a line in taking on Melania Trump's office over the first lady's trip to Africa in October, making what some viewed as challenging requests and being obstinate, the White House official told CNN.\n\nSince then, the source continued, some officials said she has been dishonest about what went on and leaked stories to try and cover her behavior.\n\nThe former Trump transition official said they were not surprised to hear that Ricardel butted heads with the first lady and her staff, saying, \"she does not suffer fools.\" The former transition official characterized Ricardel as \"smart and tough,\" but acknowledged that she is not always effective at navigating \"internal politics.\"", "CNN analyst Juliette Kayyem is the author of \" Security Mom: My Life Protecting the Home and Homeland. \" She is a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, a former candidate for governor of Massachusetts and CEO of Zemcar.

A key member of national security adviser John Bolton's team, she was brought in in April to help him shake up the national security staff. In the past, she had butted heads with Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly not a fan, two former White House officials told the Washington Post .\n\nNow it appears that she has learned, quite publicly, that the one you really don't want to mess with is the first lady.\n\nIn another episode of \"Survivor: West Wing,\" Melania Trump went public Tuesday with her personnel concerns about Ricardel, in the process undermining the national security staff and -- not to be forgotten -- our national security. Indeed CNN reported Tuesday afternoon that \"a White House official confirmed ... that Trump has told people that Ricardel will be fired, but she has been given some time to clear out her desk.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH WH aide to exit after Melania pushed for ouster 01:35\n\nThe once private dispute between the first lady, her staff and Ricardel broke into the open this week after news reports that Ricardel had challenged some request from the first lady's office about Melania Trump's recent trip to Africa. CNN reported that a person familiar with the most recent dustup said \"Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.\"\n\nMelania Trump's spokeswoman issued a statement Tuesday that \"(i)t is the position of the office of the first lady that she [Ricardel] no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House.\"\n\nSo, let me make a few things clear. First, Ricardel may have been behaving badly regarding the Africa trip; there are some suggestions in news reports that she deliberately withheld national security resources from the first lady's office. Second, Melania Trump has every right to relate her disdain for bad behavior to her husband or Bolton and to ask for a staffer's resignation over not sufficiently respecting the first lady's duties.\n\nBut what is not acceptable, and indeed dangerous, is the extent to which Melania Trump used her status as a family member \u2014 unelected, unappointed and unqualified \u2014 to dictate national security personnel decisions, in public, as if there are no global consequences to such action.\n\nAnd, in this regard, the first lady was acting very -- Trumpish.\n\nThere is a great deal of this sort of behavior in this White House \u2014 the people's house. The President, her husband, wants a military parade (eventually). Jared Kushner, Melania Trump's son-in-law, wants to guide Middle East politics while continuing his business deals with those very same nations.\n\nEarlier in the administration, Ivana Trump, Melania Trump's husband's ex-wife, said she was considered for (and turned down) the post of ambassador to the Czech Republic. And Ivanka Trump, her daughter-in-law, just received initial approval for 16 new trademarks from China, while experts on trade are trying to avoid a tariff war.\n\nAll these are examples where the line between national security and Trump family interest are blurred, if not essentially invisible. There are no American interests for the first family, only Trump personal or financial interests.\n\nAnd there is likely to be more drama poured into the security mix in coming days. Sources in the White House made it clear Tuesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen's days in her job are numbered. And John Kelly, the chief of staff, may also be booted, sources told CNN.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nMelania Trump's actions are consistent with the mercurial management preferences of the Trump family; indeed, the President is keen on calling the defense apparatus that exists to protect America \"my generals.\" The family has turned national security -- once, not so long ago, immune from the political backstabbing and favor-grabbing that animate the political side of the White House -- into its own TV-style drama. The first lady felt no need to hide that that was exactly the way she was handling things.\n\nBolton, who hired Ricardel, doesn't have many options. Melania Trump has spoken. This is no longer our national security hard at work to protect the American public. It is a denigration of the career staff and (whether you like him or not) the NSA's Bolton. In public.\n\nDear world, this is America's security apparatus. Fear us? Respect us? At least, don't laugh at us?", "The Papua New Guinean capital, a tiny cluster of high rise and residential buildings housing some 300,000 people on the Pacific nation's southern coast, has been preparing all year for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which begins on November 17. But for months, experts have been warning the city isn't ready, and concerns remain over costs, infrastructure and security.\n\nThis is the first time Papua New Guinea (PNG), the poorest of the 21 countries in APEC, has hosted the summit. PNG ranks 110th worldwide for GDP, with an economy roughly the size of Cyprus or Afghanistan, according to the World Bank, and far behind richer APEC nations like Australia or China.\n\nSome leaders won't even be staying in the PNG capital -- often ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world -- and instead are flying in and out of the country via the Australian city of Cairns, across the Coral Sea.\n\nOther leaders are staying away altogether. US President Donald Trump decided not to attend the summit, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place, though Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Xi Jinping will both be in PNG.\n\nViolence and disorder\n\nIn June, PNG's government declared a nine-month state of emergency and sent in the military following intensive violence in the Southern Highlands province (SHP), where rioters looted businesses and torched a government plane and court buildings. One commentator described the situation in parts of the country as close to \"civil war.\"\n\n\"The full scale of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea is difficult to assess, given the limited coverage and poor quality of police and other data,\" academic and PNG expert Sinclair Dinnen wrote in a report for Australia's Lowy Institute in December . \"Levels of unreported crime, including rape and other sexual offenses, are extremely high, particularly in rural areas where access to police is limited. Significant variations exist between urban and rural settings, as well as within regional, rural, and urban contexts.\"\n\nIn part, violent crime is driven by the proliferation of illegal firearms, both homemade within PNG and smuggled in from neighboring Indonesia.\n\nSince the 1990s, fear of crime and widespread instability has seen a \"flourishing of non-state security providers\" seeking to fill the gap, according to a World Bank report\n\nBut while some of these firms have helped provide vital services to businesses that the local police or government simply are unable to, officials have warned that this booming private industry may be compounding the very problems it is intended to correct.\n\n\"There is a huge gap between the state's ability to deliver public safety and the society's need for collective peace and order,\" a 2013 government report said. However, it warned that the growing presence of foreign private security firms \"undermines the state's ability and authority\" to deliver these services.\n\nRegional militaries have largely stepped in to fill the gap, with both New Zealand and Australian providing training and resources to their PNG counterparts.\n\nThis photo taken on November 5, 2018, shows Papua New Guinea security forces on parade in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nPutting PNG on the map\n\nFor the PNG government, APEC seems like a silver bullet to many of its problems, raising the country's profile and helping it break free of a reputation for chaos and danger that has dogged it for decades.\n\nBut some critics have warned that the meeting of regional leaders could do the very opposite, exposing systemic issues within PNG and embarrassing it in front of the world.\n\nAs far back as 2016, opposition lawmakers were urging the government to \"swallow its pride\" and cancel the summit, saying it would be a waste of resources.\n\nFormer PNG Prime Minister Mekere Morauta in July accused the current government of converting the two-day summit into a \"cargo cult.\"\n\n\"APEC will not solve PNG's problems such as the rampant corruption, high unemployment, escalating crime, deteriorating state of health centers and hospitals as well as classrooms, roads, telecommunication and transport services,\" he said.\n\nMany were particularly enraged by the government's purchase of 40 custom-made Maserati cars -- which were flown in from Italy -- for leaders to use while they're in Port Moresby.\n\nNeighboring Australia is bearing a large part of the bill for the summit -- upwards of $90 million (130 million AUD), according to the ABC -- as is China, which has been significantly increasing its footprint in the Pacific , to no small concern in Canberra and other regional capitals.\n\nPapua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill gives a talk at the Lowy Institute in Sydney on May 14, 2015.\n\nCritics of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, who has been dogged by accusations of corruption for years, have accused him of seeking to distract from other issues with the splashy international conference, a repeat, some said, of the 2015 Pacific Games.\n\n\"Three years later, some of the South Pacific Games venues are still to be completed, others are not open to the general public, and many have been closed temporarily due to unpaid service bills accumulated from the Games,\" according to Watna Mori , director of PNG Presence, a consultancy firm. \"This is an example of what may happen to the infrastructure being built now to host the APEC summit.\"\n\nLast month, opposition lawmakers called for a nationwide stay at home strike over high government spending and alleged corruption in the run-up to APEC.\n\nAt a forum in Brisbane in May, O'Neill defended his government's focus on APEC, saying the summit would put PNG on the map, ensuring \"everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is\" and not confuse it with an African country.\n\nThis photo taken on November 4, 2018, shows the Australian warship HMAS Adelaide moored off APEC Haus in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nHeavy security presence\n\nO'Neill's government has pulled out all the stops to ensure the summit goes off without a hitch, and residents of the capital can expect a massive security presence while world leaders are visiting PNG.\n\nPolice have vowed to crack down hard on any unlawful public assembly or protest around the summit, with Deputy Police Commissioner Jim Andrews saying in a statement last month that \"all public servants including members of the Constabulary are duty bound and obligated towards ensuring that government efforts geared towards the 2018 APEC Summit is cohesively supported and maintained.\"\n\nAndrews warned police \"would not hesitate to arrest and detain opportunists and trouble makers who defy lawful authority by disturbing peace and good order in the community.\"\n\nAlongside local police and military, many of the troops providing security for the summit will be foreign. Australia has sent 1,500 soldiers to Port Morseby, along with a Royal Australian Air Force squadron patrolling the country's airspace, and the helicopter carrier HMAS Adelaide, which is currently moored off the city.\n\nThe US Coast Guard has also deployed around 95 troops to PNG, their boats are already patrolling parts of the waters around Port Moresby which have been declared restricted areas during the summit.\n\n\"The safety and security of the maritime environment surrounding Port Moresby will be critical during Leaders' Week. Australia is pleased to enhance PNG's maritime security arrangements for APEC by providing these capabilities,\" Australia's Minister for Defense Christopher Pyne said earlier this month.\n\n\"This support is a clear demonstration of Australia's close and longstanding defense relationship with PNG and the interoperability our defense forces have developed over a number of decades.\"", "Dave Chappelle photobombs engagement photos\n\nOn the Story with Erica Hill\n\nTommy Saunders and Emily Eldridge were enjoying a photo shoot in Yellow Springs, Ohio, when Dave Chappelle hopped in on the couple's engagement photos.", "(CNN) A constant of undemocratic governments is elections that defy logic and belief. Vladimir Putin, for instance, was re-elected earlier this year with more than 76% of the vote and more than 67% turnout.\n\nThat's a good solid result for the Russian President. Probably too good to be true. International election monitors said at the time that it was \"overly controlled\" and \"lacked genuine competition.\" No US presidential candidate -- even in the most remarkable of landslides -- has ever gotten more than 61% of the popular vote, and no US election in more than 100 years has drawn 67% of the voting population.\n\nBut President Donald Trump congratulated Putin on the win and wouldn't criticize the questionable results, which is odd given he's cried voter fraud both about the 2016 election that put him in the White House and the close results in Florida and Arizona during this month's midterms.\n\nFar from offering congratulations to rival Democrats, Trump has spent more time challenging the results in individual races, complaining about fraud where there's no evidence any exists and instilling doubts about the integrity of the vote in people's minds, while their confidence in American elections had already been dropping.\n\nThere's no evidence in the US of widespread voter fraud, despite what Trump said of the last two elections ; whereas in Russia this year there were actual videos of poll workers stuffing ballot boxes.\n\nAmericans are generally comfortable with the state of US elections. A Pew survey in October found 82% of Americans very or somewhat confident their votes in their communities would be counted as they intended in November.\n\nThey were a bit more leery of elections nationwide: 25% were very confident, 47% were somewhat confident, 21% were not too confident and 6% were not at all confident. But that's still a combined 72% of the country very or somewhat confident their votes would be counted as they intended.\n\nBut what's interesting is that while Americans are still broadly confident their own votes will be counted, they have become a lot less \"very confident.\" Between 2008 and 2016 -- there is no Pew data for the elections in between -- the percentage of people answering \"very confident\" dropped 8 percentage points. It was over 60% in 2004 and has been under 50% the last two elections.\n\nAll of that was before Trump and Florida's Republican Gov. Rick Scott in particular started alleging fraud and theft by campaign officials, particularly in Florida, who were taking a long time to count votes. Or before Democrats, including Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who is behind in vote counts, started challenging recount rules. In Florida, in particular, this election is turning into a legal mess.\n\nBoth Scott's bid for Senate and the governor's race to replace him are destined for recounts.\n\nTrump was also crying fraud at the US Senate election in Arizona, where Republican Rep. Martha McSally led in votes after election night but has fallen behind as absentee votes were counted. McSally has since conceded the election, but Trump has not walked back his tweet implying voter fraud there. He has started to focus instead on pressuring the Democrats in Florida to concede.\n\nAmericans were more concerned in the Pew report about hacking of elections. Less than half (45%) were confident that US elections are secure from hacking or other technological threats. Just 8% said they were very confident US elections are secure in that way.\n\nAll of that Pew information, by the way, was from before the close races on Election Day led the President to accuse local officials in multiple states of fraud and trying to steal votes.\n\nHis allegations can only inflame what was already a partisan split. Another tidbit from Pew's report is that majorities of both Democrats (64%) and Republicans (56%) say the opposing party has little or no commitment to fair and accurate elections in the US.\n\nThe American form of democracy has plenty of issues. A patchwork of standards governing elections makes voting in Florida a very different thing from voting in California. The Electoral College is tilted toward rural states; the candidate with more votes has lost the presidency because of the Electoral College twice. Efforts to make it difficult for certain people to vote are viewed either as voter suppression or voter security, depending on one's political view.\n\nTrump voters back in 2016, when he was railing that the election was rigged against him, were more likely to tell Pew they had little or no confidence the election would be open and fair.\n\nOn the other side, Democrats held nothing back in their recent allegations of voter suppression against then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican who now leads Democrat Stacey Abrams in their bid to become governor.\n\nRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election led the group Freedom House, an independent watchdog organization that ranks nations by political freedom, to downgrade its score of US freedoms from 89 to 86 on a scale of 100. The US is still among the 45% of countries it places in the \"free\" category, along with most of South America and Europe. Russia, China and most of Africa and the Middle East are classified as \"not free.\"\n\nNone of that big picture stuff seems to matter to Trump as he tweets his grievances at local officials in Florida.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the percentage of countries that Freedom House places in the \"free\" category to 45%.", "Eric B.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?\" the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes was often quoted as asking. This is a question we ought to be asking of Chief Justice John Roberts and Congress in the wake of the 2018 elections -- most notably in Georgia.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), gutting enforcement of the 1965 federal Voting Rights Act, or VRA, elevated Keynes' supposed dictum to the level of constitutional mandate. The court ruled that the provisions of the VRA, requiring states with histories of voting rights violations to submit themselves to federal preapproval of any changes in voting procedures or electoral rules, were deemed unconstitutional because of changes in the underlying facts.\n\nIn Roberts' telling, interference with African-American voting rights in the South was ancient history, successfully swept away by the VRA itself, not to mention a New South where torch-lit Klu Klux Klan marches with Confederate battle flags were things of the past. When the facts change, Roberts asserted, the court must change its mind as to a law's constitutionality.\n\nIf Roberts and the court's majority mean what they say, then they need to change their minds again after last week's developments.\n\nNever mind that, in the decade preceding the court's Shelby County decision, Georgia had continued adopting voting changes that the US Department of Justice found discriminatory roughly once every three months.\n\nSince then, Georgia has pursued voting restrictions disproportionately affecting African-Americans and other minorities with renewed vigor: It closed 214 polling places , for example. Then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp took the lead on aggressive voting-reduction efforts, purging the voting rolls of over 1 million primarily minority voters and instituting an \"exact match\" requirement that removed voters for any clerical errors or misspellings.\n\nWhen this policy was struck down by the federal courts, it was essentially just re-enacted by the Georgia Legislature at Kemp's urging. (The Brennan Center for Justice, for example, has found that both reduced numbers of voting machines and increased voter purges disproportionately affect minority voters.)\n\nKemp even expressed \"concern\" to donors at a private dinner earlier this year that Democrats would defeat him \"especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote.\" No wonder: His African-American opponent, Stacey Abrams, had launched her career by organizing people to vote.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, Kemp -- still overseeing the voting in his own election -- threw out or held up thousands of absentee ballot applications, a majority of which turned out to be from African-Americans, until ordered to cease and desist by the federal courts.\n\nThat didn't stop a record shortage of voting machines in black precincts on Election Day, or -- and this is really the most eye-rolling of all -- what machines there were from running out of battery power in the middle of voting. Even by such means, Kemp (as of this writing) was barely able to cling to a narrow majority.\n\nThe larger point is that none of this occurs in a vacuum. As everyone knows, Georgia and other states have a long history of racial oppression -- but just because it's long doesn't mean that it's dead.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Congress enacted several constitutional amendments that outlawed slavery (the 13th), established due process and equal protection under the laws for all Americans (the 14th) and prohibited racial discrimination against the right to vote (the 15th).\n\nThese amendments, in more-or-less identical language, expressly grant Congress the \"power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.\" Under that authority, Congress had reauthorized the VRA's preclearance provision, and the formula for determining those states and localities to which it applied, as recently as 2006 -- only seven years before Roberts found it terribly outdated.\n\nRoberts' approach ignores -- in fact, rejects -- the continuing relevance of the Civil War and the history of the Confederate States in construing those Civil War Amendment guarantees. Whatever the real-world relevance of Confederate history to US today, its relevance to the Constitution -- and, particularly, the Civil War Amendments -- is central: It was the sole animating reason for the three amendments that dramatically reshaped federal authority over the states. That history matters.\n\nListen, for instance, to those defending President Donald Trump's position opposing birthright citizenship: They assert that these amendments were concerned entirely with the former Confederate states' treatment of African-Americans, not our current conditions (and, hence, not intended to protect undocumented immigrants).\n\nIn short, conservatives and self-styled \"originalists\" ought to be (and usually are) the first to agree that historic rather than current conditions should dictate Congress' scope of action. As such, the mechanism to sweep away any constitutional deadwood isn't court fiat -- it's an amendment.\n\nBut let's assume that Roberts was correct -- and intends to be consistent -- that the Constitution requires keeping pace with today's realities. The more important issue in the Shelby County decision, then, is the contention by Roberts and the court's majority that the facts had changed and so, too, had the VRA's constitutionality.\n\nFor more opinion...

Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPerhaps the chief justice was correct that, by 2013, the VRA's concerns with racial discrimination in voting had been rendered anachronistic by its own success. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg trenchantly observed in her dissent , however, \"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\" It's now also clear, to continue Ginsburg's metaphor, that putting your umbrella away when it's not raining, as Roberts would have it, is usually sufficient itself to provoke a cloudburst.\n\nAnd so it has. Since the Shelby County decision, increased restrictions on voting have been enacted in many states where Republicans reign. But nowhere have attempts to shut down the black vote been as widespread -- and the result as transparent -- as in Georgia.\n\nOnly someone willfully blind to all this would fail to see that exactly the same behaviors have rearisen in exactly the same places as before. The Roberts Court majority -- or, if it turns out to be so utterly disingenuous, then Congress itself -- needs to revisit Shelby County today and reinstate the VRA in the form Congress enacted it. After all, the facts have clearly changed back to, well, what they always really were.", "Hong Kong (CNN) Fear is sweeping through the campuses of China's elite universities following a nationwide government crackdown aimed at silencing left-wing student activists, who had been campaigning for greater rights and protections for ordinary workers.\n\nSince August at least nine young Chinese labor advocates have been forcibly detained in major cities across the country, a sharp escalation in Beijing's campaign against student activism on university campuses.\n\n\"The whole of Peking University is like under the white terror now, (the security guards) will come after you even if you were just at the scene where the student activists were distributing leaflets,\" a student at the prestigious Peking University told CNN Tuesday.\n\nOn Friday, one graduate, Zhang Shengye, was attacked and dragged into a car at the Beijing university by several people in black jackets, according to a widely circulated open letter.\n\n\"Someone used his arm to put me in a headlock and pushed me forward ... My glasses were missing in the chaos, and I was pressed to the ground,\" the letter writer and fellow activist, Yu Tianfu, said.\n\n\"I struggled to say, 'Who are you? Why can you do such a thing?' A man pointed to my head before I could finish and said ferociously, 'Stop shouting otherwise I will beat you again.'\"\n\nA grassroots student movement, led by activists labeling themselves Marxists and calling for greater workers' rights, has become a growing problem for the Chinese government in recent years.\n\nUnder Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing has increasingly cracked down on all forms of dissent, including human rights activists, labor groups and religious organizations.\n\nActivists and analysts have pointed out the irony of the socialist Chinese government, led by the theoretically pro-worker Communist Party, cracking down on young Marxists.\n\nXi in particular has been enthusiastically pushing the country to embrace its Marxist roots following his ascension to the head of the Communist Party in 2012.\n\nEli Friedman, an associate professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University who has been in contact with the Chinese student groups supporting workers' rights, said the crackdown would only serve to undermine the party's legitimacy. \"What is socialism if not standing with the workers?\" he told CNN.\n\nPeking University in Beijing, seen in an undated photo in the snow.\n\nStudent solidarity\n\nThe growing crackdown has its roots in a labor dispute in southern China, beginning in June, where a group of workers at Shenzhen's Jasic Technology called to set up a trade union.\n\nThe government declined their request and, after a month of petitioning, dozens of workers were detained by police in July, according to the group. Others claimed they were beaten by security personnel while protesting.\n\nOn July 29, a group of left-wing students, proclaiming themselves Maoists, traveled from around the country to join in the protests, drawing national attention.\n\nOne Peking University graduate, Yue Xin, published an open letter calling for students at universities across China to join in supporting the workers and sign a petition.\n\nBut as public attention grew, the government quickly tightened the net around the young protesters. On August 11, one of the main organizers, Shen Mengyu, a graduate of Sun Yat-sen University, another elite school in southern China, was detained by a group of unidentified men.\n\nYue disappeared on August 24, along with a number of her fellow students. No official arrest reports have been announced yet by police and neither Shen or Yue have been seen since.\n\nFollowing their disappearance, a group of alumni and students at Peking University set up the \"Finding Yue Movement\" to lobby for the graduates' release. One of the organizers, Zhang, was among those who disappeared in the past week.\n\n\"There is a pervasive sense of fear particularly after what happened in Peking University a few nights ago ... (Zhang's) crime was essentially to draw attention to the fact that another student had disappeared,\" Friedman, the American professor, told CNN.\n\n'Wave of repression'\n\nFriedman's university, Cornell, cut ties with China's Renmin University in October over growing questions around academic freedom in the country, as well as concerns for the safety of exchange students.\n\n\"The wave of repression we're in is not just the last few weeks. It's a very conscious strategy on the park of the state to close a space for academic freedom,\" he said.\n\nFriedman said Chinese students were being strongly pushed to study Marxism in universities, in juxtaposition to banned Western ideologies considered dangerous by the government, such as democracy or liberalism.\n\n\"Now they're taken it to heart, the government is cracking down quite significantly. In some ways, this is the government's own making,\" he said.\n\nThe arrests came shortly after the arrival of a new Communist Party chief at Peking University, Qiu Shuiping, who was formerly the top state security official in Beijing between 2013 and 2014.\n\nAnalysts at the time pointed to Qiu's appointment as an indication the Communist Party wanted to pull the student community at the university into line.\n\nDespite the disappearances and the attacks, not all the left-wing activists are giving up. Renaming their group from \"Finding Yue Movement\" to the \"Missing Peking University Alumni Watchers,\" labor rights advocates released another open letter on Sunday calling for their former members' release.\n\n\"We can't let those who collected firewood for others be frozen to death in the snow, and we can't let those who created the path of freedom be trapped in the thorns,\" the letter said.", "Washington D.C. (CNN Business) When Amazon started looking for a second headquarters location more than a year ago, the company asked cities to put their best offers on the table \u2014 in cash.\n\n\"Incentives offered by the state/province and local communities to offset initial capital outlay and ongoing operational costs will be significant factors in the decision-making process,\" the initial request read.\n\nThe victors, New York and Virginia, delivered. The final deals revealed on Tuesday showed they provided total incentives worth about $2.8 billion total \u2014 extraordinarily generous offers to a company whose profits in 2017 totaled $3 billion on $178 billion in revenues, and whose founder Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest man in the world.\n\nThat number only reflects the value of subsidies if Amazon hires the expected 25,000 employees in each location. If the company were to add 40,000 employees, and also win additional New York City tax breaks afforded to all companies that meet certain qualifications, the total amount of subsidies could go as high as about $5.5 billion.\n\nAmazon's requested perks include not just money, but a helipad at its planned new locations in Long Island City and National Landing \u2014 a tall order, given that Crystal City currently falls within a flight restricted zone where the only allowed flights are those that go through the airport or have to do with law enforcement and the military.\n\n\"I was surprised the package wasn't bigger,\" said John Boyd , a site selection consultant who wasn't involved in the Amazon search. \"For a high-cost market like Long Island City, incentives are a necessarily evil.\"\n\nAmazon has long been a master of extracting tax incentives by playing local governments off one another as they vie for fulfillment centers, offices, and other sources of jobs.\n\nFor its headquarters, the company didn't go with the richest offer.\n\nMaryland had pledged $8.5 billion for sites just north of Washington D.C. and New Jersey had offered a $7 billion package if Amazon located in Newark. Those offers were predicated on a single headquarters with 50,000 jobs rather than the existing split deal with 25,000 in each location, but still would have blown the New York and Virginia offers out of the water \u2014 a signal that Amazon was not willing to compromise on access to technical talent.\n\nSome of the incentives are subject to approval by state and local legislative bodies, setting up a likely political fight over how much public money to give away in exchange for thousands of high-paying tech jobs.\n\nAlready, a New York state legislator has signaled he plans to introduce a bill to block the deal by phasing out the economic incentive statutes upon which the agreement is based.\n\n\"There is a much better way of allocating our taxpayer's money that will directly help the communities,\" said New York State Assemblyman Ron Kim, who represents parts of Queens.\n\nVirginia's offer: $22,000 per job\n\nThe bulk of Virginia's tax incentives come in the form of a cash grant of $22,000 for each job added over the next 12 years, as long as the average annual wage of those jobs is at least $150,000 \u2014 a total of $550 million if Amazon adds the 25,000 jobs it says it will, and up to $750 million it if adds more jobs on top of that.\n\nThe funds, which have to be appropriated by the Virginia General Assembly, are designed to decrease slightly in value if more than 10% of the new hires are focused on federal government contracts.\n\nIn addition, Amazon will receive $23 million cash from the local Arlington County authorities based on an expected increase in hotel taxes, which needs to be approved by the County Board.\n\nAnother $28 million in forecast property tax revenues will be dedicated to infrastructure investments around National Landing, the new branding for the collective developments of Potomac Yards, Pentagon City and Crystal City, all across the Potomac River but still within view of downtown Washington DC.\n\nThe agreement with Arlington County also pledges assistance in securing the necessary approval for a helipad on Amazon's new campus.\n\nVirginia's memorandum with Amazon pledges a maximum of $195 million of state investment to pay for transportation projects in the area, including a pedestrian bridge to connect the neighborhoods to nearby Reagan National Airport, which is separated from Amazon's new home by a highway.\n\nVirginia pledged a few other goodies, such as a commitment to \"regulatory flexibility\" in order to allow new technologies to operate in the area, as well as confidentiality for \"all materials, communications, data, and information related to this Memorandum.\" That could mean testing of everything from drones to autonomous delivery vehicles, which Amazon has been developing at its Seattle headquarters.\n\nNew York's offer: $48,000 per job\n\nThe combined offer from New York State and New York City is considerably richer than the one offered by Virginia, and does not require approval by any local or state legislative body.\n\nThe incentives offered for Amazon's Long Island City campus total $1.5 billion if the company hires 25,000 people, and up to $1.7 billion if it hires 40,000 people, which mostly reflects a $48,000-per-job tax credit for every position as long as the average salary is at least $150,000.\n\nThere's another cash grant of $325 million based on the company occupying a certain amount of office space.\n\nThe agreement also pledges assistance in securing a helipad, with flights limited to 120 per year and limited to company executives.\n\nWhen asked why New York's bid was so much higher than Virginia's at a press conference on Tuesday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pointed out that Virginia's personal income tax is lower than New York's. \"I don't know how they calculated it, and what they actually calculated,\" Cuomo said. \"So I don't have an idea about how they put together their transaction.\"\n\nWhile the New York deal is worth more for Amazon, it also comes with more requirements than the Virginia agreement.\n\nFor example, Amazon pledged to create space for a tech startup incubator, artist studios, and public open space. The agreement also includes requirements for participation by minority and women-owned businesses in the construction process.\n\nThe state, the city, and Amazon pledged to kick in $5 million each for workforce development initiatives, such as technology training programs targeted at local public housing residents and high school students \u2014 which, of course, also furthers Amazon's goal of staffing up in a tight labor market.\n\nDon't forget Nashville\n\nAlthough it wouldn't qualify as a \"headquarters,\" Nashville won 5,000 jobs, with Tennessee kicking in $102 million in tax incentives including a job subsidy worth $13,000 per head.\n\nBoth the city and the state components of the incentive package will have to be approved by various legislative bodies.", "Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in Washington and the author of the book \" The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness .\" Follow her on Twitter.

And that a sophisticated government waged an effective propaganda campaign that relied on a long-existing chauvinism of white Germanic Christian superiority.

It was instead a story we always see with autocrats, dictators and genocidaires: one of a powerful few backed by a malevolent many.\n\nSome who are sympathetic to the Wisconsin students -- white non-Jews, one imagines -- will be tempted to write this off as teenage antics for which the young men should not pay a significant price. One of those people appears to be Peter Gust, the motorcycle photographer who took the photo and posted it on his website. I can imagine that many people saw the photo and wondered if this could have all been avoided if there was an \"adult in the room.\" It turns out there was.\n\nGust claims the photo is \"innocent,\" and is actually of the kids waving goodbye to their parents (I don't know how people wave in Wisconsin, but I've never seen it done like that). Gust has also taken the photo down and complained about \"jerks\" who are being online bullies -- by which he apparently meant the people angry about the photo, and not the teenagers who appear to be making a Nazi salute.\n\nThe photo was also tweeted on a parody account called @GoBaraboo with the caption \"We even got the black kid to throw it up.\" If the photo was of an innocent group wave, why would it be notable that the one African-American kid participated?\n\nThe school administration is now investigating, and Baraboo police tweeted that they are assisting. It's unclear why police would be involved with this -- throwing up a Nazi salute is disgusting and offensive, but it is not and should not be illegal. Still, the school needs to take this seriously. That doesn't mean just a slap on the wrist. The school should have a policy on racist bullying (and if it doesn't, it needs to implement one immediately), and the students should face meaningful consequences -- suspension at the very least, and certainly alerting any colleges to which these students have been accepted.\n\nJUST WATCHED Student speaks out against Nazi salute photo Replay More Videos ...

It left open the possibility that Ducey would be choosing a second replacement after the midterm elections.\n\nKyl said Tuesday that he and his family have \"pretty much come to the conclusion of what we want to do,\" but would not reveal that decision.\n\nWhen asked if he would continue to serve in the Senate in 2019, Kyl said, \"I'm going to be discussing my plans with the governor, and everybody else will be the second to know.\"\n\nAides and operatives close to Ducey deflected questions about a potential replacement for Kyl early this week.\n\n\"The governor is hopeful that Kyl will continue to serve in the appointed Senate seat through 2020,\" said Ducey senior adviser Daniel Ruiz. \"At this point we would not speculate on a vacancy that does not exist.\"\n\nKyl said he talks to Ducey \"all the time\" and not to expect an announcement \"anytime soon\" about his future.\n\nBut in the wake of Sinema's victory in the race for Arizona's other Senate seat, some Republicans in the state buzzed about the possibility of McSally replacing Kyl.\n\n\"I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to think that he would do. The governor's kept his cards very close to his chest,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a veteran Arizona Republican strategist.\n\nThere are, several Arizona Republicans pointed out, significant downsides to appointing McSally, too: She's the only Republican to lose a Senate race in Arizona in 30 years. And she cast aside what had been a more moderate record on issues like immigration to align herself closely with Trump -- a departure from the tactics of Ducey, who ran as an independent-minded, business-focused governor in a runaway re-election victory.\n\n\"Hopefully she'll have learned something from this election, in terms of making herself more friendly to the Arizona electorate,\" Coughlin said of McSally.\n\nMcSally and Ducey aren't particularly close, Arizona Republicans said -- and McSally is just one of several possible selections. Others on the list include Karrin Taylor Robson, an Arizona Board of Regents member and real estate developer, who is well-liked by the GOP donor community; Kirk Adams, a former Arizona House speaker who is Ducey's chief of staff but widely expected to leave his office soon; and Eileen Klein, a chief of staff for former Gov. Jan Brewer who Ducey appointed state treasurer in April.\n\nDucey's appointment wouldn't preclude other Arizona Republicans from running in the 2020 primary in a race that's likely to be among the nation's most competitive.\n\nFormer Arizona attorney general Grant Woods, a former chief of staff for McCain, has said he is considering running for Senate as a Democrat. Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, has also openly mulled a run. Rep. Ruben Gallego and Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor who was elected to the House last week, are also on the list of potential candidates Democratic strategists have mentioned.", "New York (CNN Business) First Amazon.

The company earned $13 billion in profits last year, while the median worker is paid just over $19,000 a year.\n\nWalmart, the nation's largest private-sector employer, has long been the target of community advocates, who say it skimps on wages and benefits.

The assessed mental status and monitored psychological well-being, but also looked for any apparent factors which would preclude the use of enhanced interrogation techniques,\" the report says.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment on the release of the documents.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, the newly released records support the idea that \"CIA torture left a legacy of broken bodies and traumatized minds.\"\n\nAnd that lesson remains relevant today given President Donald Trump's comments on the issue of torture and CIA Director Gina Haspel's controversial record.\n\n\"Today, with a President who has vocally supported torture and a new CIA director who was deeply complicit in torturing prisoners, it's more important than ever to expose the crimes of the past. Recognizing the roles played by the lawyers, doctors, and psychologists who enabled torture is critical to making sure it never happens again,\" the statement said.\n\nPrior to her confirmation, Haspel faced a barrage of criticism from some Democrats and human rights groups after she was picked in March to succeed Mike Pompeo as the nation's top spy, over her role in the George W. Bush administration's detention and interrogation program.\n\nThe criticism came on two fronts: Haspel ran a CIA black site in Thailand in 2002 where detainees were brutally interrogated with tactics that critics say is torture. And she drafted the cable that her boss sent to destroy dozens of CIA interrogation tapes in 2005.\n\nIn 2017, Trump ignited a row over the use of waterboarding after claiming intelligence professionals told him it \"absolutely works.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, he said at the time that the US must \"fight fire with fire\" when dealing with terrorists in comments which reverberated around the world.", "(CNN) Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to decide on a 2020 presidential bid no later than February 2019, a spokesperson confirmed to CNN.\n\n\"I think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\" Bloomberg told The Associated Press in an interview. CNN confirmed through a Bloomberg spokesperson that he would make a decision by February at the latest.\n\nBloomberg, a billionaire who was elected mayor as both a Republican and independent, announced this fall he had re-registered as a Democrat and unleashed some of his considerable wealth to boost Democrats in the midterm elections this year.\n\nHe told CNN previously that he was still undecided on a bid and would delay consideration until after the midterms.\n\n\"I am focusing on November 6, and then I've said, you know, a few months later I'll take a look at it and see,\" Bloomberg said.\n\nIn a move that further stoked speculation about his intentions, Bloomberg's political action committee released an ad shortly before Election Day featuring an appeal from the former mayor himself.\n\nIn the CNN interview last month, he said his prospective candidacy would include an appeal to pragmatism and demonstrated accomplishment.\n\n\"I have a case to present, if I'd like to present it,\" Bloomberg said. \"And if the public likes it, that's fine, and if they don't, that's what freedom of choice is.\"\n\nBloomberg told the Associated Press in the interview published Tuesday that he knew why he would want to run, but still needed to consider whether \"it's possible.\"\n\n\"If people don't seem to be warming to you, there's plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it's given my kids and me,\" he said.", "Yes. He found out his Secret Service \"hard pass,\" which speeds up entry and exit from the White House, was being suspended on Wednesday, November 7. The next day, he was also denied a \"day pass\" to enter the White House. And over the weekend he was turned away from a presidential event marking the end of World War I in France.\n\nWhat does CNN want?\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Acosta and CNN's First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by the ban. Lawyers are asking a judge for \"immediate restoration of Acosta's press credentials and hard pass,\" plus a declaration that the administration's action was \"unconstitutional, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\"\n\nWhat is the White House's position?\n\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders, one of the six defendants in the case, said Tuesday that \"this is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit.\" Sanders criticized Acosta for, she said, acting unprofessionally and hogging the mic at a press conference last week. But she did not address the legal issues raised by CNN's lawsuit.\n\nWhat happened at that press conference?\n\nAcosta is one of the most aggressive reporters on the Trump beat, winning him fans as well as critics. Trump called on him during a November 7 press conference. The two men went back-and-forth over Trump's immigration rhetoric, and then Acosta tried to change topics and ask a third question about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. When the president called on another reporter, a White House intern reached for the microphone Acosta was holding, but Acosta refused to immediately hand it over. He asked his intended question, then gave the mic to the intern.\n\nWhat did the White House originally claim?\n\nIn a statement announcing the suspension of Acosta's press pass, Sanders said the administration will \"never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" But video of the event showed that Acosta did not mistreat the intern. He even said \"pardon me, ma'am\" when she reached for the mic.\n\nTo support her rationale, Sanders tweeted a distorted video clip of the press conference that didn't show the complete back-and-forth. The same video had been posted by an InfoWars personality two hours earlier. InfoWars is a fringe right-wing media company with a history of posting hateful content and conspiracy theories.\n\nTwo days later, Trump himself cast doubt on Sanders' rationale: He said Acosta was \"not nice to that young woman,\" but \"I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.\" Then he complained about Acosta's behavior more generally.\n\nHow has the White House's rationale shifted?\n\nSanders is no longer claiming that Acosta placed his hands on the intern. Her Tuesday statement said he \"physically refused to surrender\" the mic. Of course, reporters frequently try to ask follow-up questions at press events.\n\nSanders went on to say that \"this was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\" She added: \"If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\" So that's apparently the new rationale for the revocation of his press pass.\n\nWhat are CNN's lawyers saying?\n\n\"Journalists cannot be silenced, censored or intimidated. That's the end of the line. The White House cannot get away with this,\" Olson said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nOlson and CNN's other outside counsel, Theodore Boutrous, said they believe CNN has a very strong case. Media industry lawyers agree. George Freeman, the head of the Media Law Resource Center, said \"the president's retaliation against Acosta was for no appropriate reason, let alone a constitutionally required compelling reason.\"\n\nHow does the First Amendment apply here?\n\nCNN's lawsuit says the only \"reasonable inference from defendants' conduct is that they have revoked Acosta's credentials as a form of content- and viewpoint-based discrimination and in retaliation for plaintiffs' exercise of protected First Amendment activity.\"\n\nAccording to CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, \"the First Amendment is very clear on that, that the press has a right to report and express opinions regarding the president's conduct.\"\n\nWhat are CNN and Acosta asking for?\n\nBoth a short term and a long term solution. Right away, CNN wants a judge to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction so that Acosta's access to the White House is restored.\n\nThe network also wants the judge to rule that the White House's action was unconstitutional so that it doesn't happen again.\n\n\"A temporary injunction is a short-term measure that remains in effect until, for example, a preliminary injunction is issued,\" said Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia. \"And whether it would be temporary or something more enduring, the court would consider, before issuing any injunction, the effects on the requesting party if the injunction isn't granted; the effects on the non-requesting party if it is granted; whether the requesting party has a potentially successful case; and the injunction's effect on the public interest.\"\n\nWhat about CNN's other reporters?\n\nThe suspension only applies to Acosta. All of CNN's other reporters, producers and photojournalists assigned to the White House continue to work from its grounds.\n\nWhen will a judge rule in this case?\n\nJudge Timothy J. Kelly, a Trump appointee, has been assigned to the case. He will hold a hearing about the request for a temporary restraining order Wednesday at 3:30 p.m.\n\nBut this legal battle could stretch on for a while.

But what is just as interesting to me is how she lays bare the Obamas' struggle with infertility and the overwhelming sense of loneliness and exhaustion that accompanied being married to a man with presidential ambitions.\n\nObama describes looking at political families like the Clintons and the Kennedys -- families who devoted their lives to politics -- and wondering if their smiles were genuine. \"At home, our frustrations began to rear up often and intensely,\" she writes. \"Barack and I loved each other deeply, but it was as if at the center of our relationship there were suddenly a knot we couldn't loosen.\" She was 38 and describes feeling \"protective\" of her own marriage, especially when her brother moved into the apartment they grew up in when he separated from his wife. She says she saw some of her friends' marriages come undone because of \"small problems left unattended or lapses in communication that led eventually to irreparable rifts.\"\n\nWhat could be more honest and vulnerable than talking about the struggles inside your marriage?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.", "That's wrong.\n\nGiven the challenging map, Democrats did about as well as you would expect them to do in the in a wave election.\n\nDemocrats look on pace to win about 69% of all Senate races that were up for election this year.\n\nI went back and looked at the overall Senate outcome in midterms since senators began to be popularly elected a little more than 100 years ago. Democrats performance this year ties them for the fifth highest percentage out of the 27 since 1914. It puts 2018 slightly ahead of 1974 (68%).\n\nNow, Republicans can certainly crow about Democrats losing Senate seats even with an unpopular president. On average, the opposition party gains four seats in a midterm. There were certainly points this cycle it looked possible (though difficult) for Democrats to net gain seats.\n\nBut Democrats had a lot of exposure. They were defending 26 seats, 10 of which were in unfriendly territory President Donald Trump won in 2016. That reality upends expectations about net loss and net gain. There is, in other words, a bit of a reversion to the mean when one party controls a lot of seats.\n\nIf you were to look at the previous 26 midterms and were trying to predict how many seats the Democrats would win based on how many seats they controlled beforehand and the party of the president, you would have estimated that they net lose four seats. They only ended up net losing two seats. In other words, they did two seats better than should have been expected.\n\nBut let's get a little more nitty gritty and get down to the individual seat level. Democrats did pretty well given how many seats were up in red states.\n\nIf you were to look back at all Senate elections since 1982 and tried to estimate how well a party would do given the past presidential vote in each state, Democrats did on average about seven points better than expected. This seven-point overperformance, perhaps unsurprisingly, will match or come close to matching what looks to be the Democrats popular vote margin in the House. It also ranks as the Democrats third best over-performance in the last 19 Senate elections.\n\nOf course, Democrats holding so many seats at the beginning of the cycle was to their advantage in a way. Incumbents tend to do better than candidates running in open seats or those taking on so-said incumbents. It's a little difficult to control for the incumbency factor because it has significantly lessened over the last 15 years ago.\n\nStill, it's pretty safe to look at midterm elections occurring over the last 10 years. Specifically, let's examine the last three midterms : 2010, 2014 and 2018.\n\nRepublicans net picked up six seats in 2010 and nine seats in 2014. No doubt that's better than Democrats did this year in the net seat loss/won category.\n\nDemocrats though ended up actually controlling a slightly higher percentage (69%) of the seats up for election in 2018 than Republicans did in 2010 (65%) or 2014 (67%).\n\nLooking at the individual seat level and controlling for incumbency and the past presidential vote, Democrats had on-par or slightly better performances than Republicans did in 2010 and 2014. The average Democrat did about 5 points better than expected in 2018. The average Republican did five points better in 2010 and three points better in 2014.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense when you look at the national environment. Republicans won the House popular vote in 2010 by about the same as Democrats did in 2018. They did slightly worse in 2014 than this year.\n\nNow, I wouldn't call the 2018 Senate result a \"wave.\" I don't think you can given the fact that Democrats lost seats. Once you control for key factors though, the result was about you'd expect in a wave year.", "(CNN) The Bartek family lost more than 30 years of memories as a quickly spreading wildfire burned down their childhood home.\n\nFor five days, Phil Bartek and his two adult children wondered if they had been lucky enough to be the last house standing.

Her father's home is the home she still has a connection to.\n\n\"Your childhood home is your home. That's where you feel safe and secure. The place where you can always go back to,\" the 37-year-old said.\n\nBartek-Regnier, her husband, their 10-year-old daughter Mia and their dog lived a mile from her father. They lived in downtown Paradise.\n\n\"I was hoping I would be the last house standing or there would be a pocket of houses standing,\" the baker and grocery store employee said.\n\nShe learned the home they had been renting had burned down by seeing the aftermath on social media. Local officials, first responders and others posted images and videos of the homes they saw, along with each location, she said.\n\n\"My white picket fence, my trellis, everything you'd identify my house with was gone,\" Bartek-Regnier said. \"We're just waiting on a picture so that we can have our closure that way. I've known since Friday that our house was gone.\"\n\n\"Out of all the people we know in Paradise, we only know one person who still has a house,\" Bartek-Regnier said.\n\nThey want to stay in Paradise if they can\n\nAimee Bartek-Regnier along with her daughter, father and her husband on a 2017 family trip.\n\nBoth Bartek-Regnier and her father said they want to stay in Paradise. They know they have no houses to go back to, but this is their home.\n\n\"It's hard thinking about starting a new life elsewhere when you don't know anybody. We don't have anything, but we are still in our familiar surroundings,\" Bartek-Regnier said.\n\nParadise is a beautiful place and a town where everyone knows everyone, she said. She grew up there and so has her daughter, Mia.\n\n\"In times of tragedy, people have always come together in Paradise,\" she said.\n\nHer father is not sure what his next move is yet. He knows the chances of rebuilding where his home once was may be difficult.\n\n\"We go back and forth from trying to stay in the area or starting a new life in another town or out of state,\" Bartek said. \"It's really a tough call because we've been here for so long.\"\n\nBartek has lived in Paradise since 1979. He and his wife raised their two children there. Bartek worked at supermarket chain Safeway and is now retired.\n\nHe rebuilt his life after his wife passed away in 2014, he said. He leads a youth ministry group for teens and children at his church. He also helps with the music.\n\nThe widower even found love again. Bartek met Susan at their church and they're engaged to be married in February 2019.\n\nBartek and his fianc\u00e9e had started moving her furniture into his home and had redecorated the place together. She was set to move in February. Her rental home also burned down in the wildfire, so she's staying with her daughter.\n\nTheir wedding rings were lost in the fire, as were many of the centerpieces and other wedding decorations that were at his house.\n\nTheir chapel is still standing, but many of the church's buildings were lost. Their caterer's restaurant was also destroyed.\n\nYet he said the wedding date of February 2 is still set.\n\n\"My life's great except for the fire. I'm trying to stay optimistic because I have a lot to look forward to,\" Bartek said. \"I have to rebuild and rethink the future, like everybody else.\"", "(CNN) The United States and United Nations' top human rights official have expressed concern at a plan to repatriate thousands of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar beginning this week, warning that such a move is premature.\n\nOn Sunday, Myanmar's Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement announced that it would repatriate 150 refugees per day for two weeks beginning Thursday. The names of 2,260 people set to be repatriated during the two weeks are taken from a list of 8,032 identified by both Bangladesh and Myanmar as verified refugees from Myanmar.\n\nThe UNHCR -- the UN's refugee agency -- has repeatedly warned of the risk of resettling the refugees. In a statement on Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet reiterated those concerns and called on the government of Bangladesh to stop the plans for repatriation.\n\n\"The human rights violations committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar amount to the worst atrocities, including crimes against humanity and possibly even genocide. With an almost complete lack of accountability -- indeed with ongoing violations -- returning Rohingya refugees to Myanmar at this point effectively means throwing them back into the cycle of human rights violations that this community has been suffering for decades,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"The history of the Rohingya in Myanmar is one filled with repeated episodes of violence, flight and return,\" Bachelet added. \"We need to speak with one voice to stop this cycle from repeating itself yet again.\"\n\nRead More", "Washington, DC (CNN) The news of Amazon's massive expansion in New York City and Northern Virginia is already stirring strong feelings from local leaders and communities.\n\nSome are excited; others are dreading it.\n\nBut there's one thing everyone can agree on: Amazon's decision to split its new headquarters, called HQ2, between Arlington, Virginia and Long Island City , New York will have far-reaching implications.\n\n\"The impact it's going to have is hard to exaggerate,\" Angel Cabrera, president of George Mason University in Northern Virginia, told CNN Business. \"This will be seen as perhaps the biggest economic development event in the history of this region.\"\n\nLocal universities in the DC and New York areas are among the most excited about the news. These institutions are well-positioned to grow as they educate the young talent Amazon hopes to attract.\n\nFollowing Amazon's announcement, George Mason and Virginia Tech revealed plans for expanded satellite campuses, bringing more buildings, new faculty members and lots of computer science classes. Virginia Tech plans to invest $1 billion in a campus located a couple miles from Amazon's new site.\n\nMeanwhile, Gail O. Mellow, president of LaGuardia Community College in Long Island City, said the news is a way to diversify the tech sector, which has historically been dominated by men. Her student body consists mostly of women and people of color.\n\n\"This could be a total paradigm shift,\" Mellow said. \"This is an open door for students to really dream a much bigger dream about the possibilities of tech employment.\"\n\nShe hopes to work with Amazon on designing courses that cater to its needs. Discussions haven't started yet.\n\n\"First on my list is hugs and kisses,\" said Mellow, shortly before a related news conference. \"And then after that we move through the real partnership part.\"\n\nJimmy Van Bramer, the New York Council member representing Long Island City, and Michael Gianaris, the area's state senator, were less thrilled.\n\n\"Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth,\" they wrote in a statement. \"It is unfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check to Amazon in the face of these challenges.\"\n\nLocal businesses were generally more positive, seeing potential for new customers.\n\n\"There are two sides to the coin,\" said Michel Wolfert, owner of the Cliffs, a rock climbing gym in Long Island City. \"It's going to be great for our business but in terms of rent costs, apartment pricing and what's happening with Long Island City, everything's going to go through the roof.\"\n\nBut Michal Strejcovsky, general manager of Bierocracy in Long Island City, said he sees a great opportunity to host Amazon parties, given his beer hall's large capacity. But he's concerned about the impact on day-to-day life.\n\n\"I can already see the business coming in there,\" he said. \"But I'm not particularly happy about it overall. Long Island City is growing insanely. The place is getting ridiculously overcrowded.\"\n\nIn a statement, District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called for regional leaders to work together on affordable housing.\n\n\"This opportunity will push us to work together on our biggest challenges like improving our transportation and infrastructure,\" Bowser said. \"We call on elected leaders in the region to come together and agree to a concrete goal for affordable and workforce housing.\"\n\nAnother drawback for Northern Virginia and New York City could be increased competition for talented workers\n\nEvan Burfield, who previously co-founded a startup accelerator based in Crystal City, Virginia, and now is CEO of Union, a network for innovators, said he's heard trepidation among startups that it'll be hard to compete against Amazon for talent. But he sees things differently.\n\n\"It's not like Amazon is hiring 25,000 people tomorrow,\" Burfield said. \"If we drive the message that the Washington DC region is a place where you can innovate, where you can do amazing, interesting things with artificial intelligence and drones and all the cool things Amazon is working on, that's going to cause more talent to come here.\"\n\nIn Arlington, Virginia, Amazon's headquarters will be located in a newly-dubbed neighborhood, National Landing, just minutes from Reagan National Airport. But there are no plans to rename Long Island City. It's already hard enough for people to grasp the current name, and where it is. Outsiders often think Long Island City is on Long Island, miles from Manhattan, but it's actually a five minute subway ride to Grand Central station in midtown New York, according to Wolfert.\n\n\"Now America is learning what Long Island City is,\" Wolfert said. \"It's a fantastic side effect.\"", "(CNN) The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may now allow for states to pursue Medicaid reimbursements for short-term inpatient treatment in mental health facilities despite a decades-old exclusion, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Tuesday.\n\n\"There are so many stories of Americans with serious mental illness, and their families, that end in tragic outcomes because treatment options are not available or not paid for,\" Azar told the National Association of Medicaid Directors on Tuesday. \"More treatment options are needed, and that includes more inpatient and residential options that can help stabilize Americans with serious mental illness.\"\n\nIn order to receive a waiver, states must guarantee that their efforts are budget-neutral to the federal government. They must also ensure that this doesn't come at the expense of community-based mental health care, and are taking steps to improve the long-term needs of people with severe mental illness after their release from a treatment facility.\n\n\"Inpatient treatment is just one part of what needs to be a complete continuum of care, and participating states will be expected to take action to improve community-based mental health care,\" Azar said\n\nThe reason why Medicaid has not historically covered this treatment, Azar said, is to \"discourage states, which traditionally provided mental health care, from offloading these responsibilities onto the Medicaid program.\" But by the time Medicaid was signed into law in 1965, states were curbing their investments in mental health treatment, he said.\n\nPolicy analyst Aaron Glickman said the policy comes from a time before medication-assisted treatments were widely used, when state-run mental institutions were known to \"warehouse\" patients in poor conditions.\n\n\"These are the psychiatric hospitals you read about in horror stories,\" said Glickman, a policy analyst for the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy and its Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics.\n\nBack then, there was a concern that the availability of federal funds would cause states to \"warehouse people further and shirk any responsibility to provide the least coercive possible treatment in the community,\" Glickman said.\n\nThe modern-day result of the policy is that residential psychiatric treatment, though not necessarily appropriate for all patients, has now become \"unnecessarily restricted,\" Azar said.\n\nCMS has described how Medicaid patients with \"acute psychiatric needs, such as those expressing suicidal or homicidal thoughts,\" are often redirected to hospital ERs that cannot provide comprehensive care for these patients. And this can delay patients from getting services they need, the agency says.\n\nTuesday's announcement is the latest in a series of moves to relax the restriction through waivers. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have granted waivers in recent years, largely focusing on opioids and substance use disorder.\n\n\"There was clearly a sudden spike in need in the last 10 years,\" Glickman said.\n\nCMS has granted waivers for projects in 17 states that target substance use disorders, and 12 states have expressed interest in pursuing the new waiver, the agency said Tuesday.\n\nAccording to CMS, over 10 million American adults had severe mental illness in 2016, and just under two-thirds of them received mental health services. About 26% of adults with a serious mental illness are covered by Medicaid, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe Medicaid policy against financing treatment in \"institutions for mental diseases\" -- or IMDs, as they are referred to by federal agencies -- has been contentious among policy experts and mental health advocates.\n\n\"Although our mental health systems are in crisis, neither the IMD rule nor insufficient hospital beds are the primary problem,\" Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, wrote in a policy debate this year.\n\n\"The primary problem is the failure to implement an effective system of intensive community-based services, which have been shown to prevent or shorten hospitalizations,\" Mathis wrote. \"Repealing the IMD rule would do little to alleviate the true crises in our public mental health systems and would likely deepen those crises.\"\n\nIn an email to CNN, Mathis added that CMS's announcement \"ignores all of the findings of the IMD demonstration that has already been done, which showed that expanding federal reimbursement for short-term IMD stays had none of the beneficial effects that were hypothesized.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut Glickman disagreed: \"In my view, ethically speaking, we should not have this carve-out of limitations for funding for mental health services.\"\n\nHe described the new move as just one part of a longer \"battle over mental health parity in the United States\" and said the new waiver process could be a necessary step toward dismantling the Medicaid restriction altogether by proving that it enhances care in the states that pursue it.\n\n\"Showing the sky did not fall is a good thing,\" Glickman said.", "(CNN) In a letter Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee top Democrat Jerry Nadler asked acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker and FBI Director Christopher Wray to respond to a \"back log of unanswered requests\" Democrats have been making over the last two years related to how the White House has interacted with the Justice Department.\n\nNadler asked that Whitaker and Wray respond with answers by December 31, a sign of the kind of oversight Democrats plan to pursue in coming months.\n\n\"Between now and the end of the 115th Congress, I ask that you work with me and other members of the committee to address this backlog. Over the coming days, I expect to correspond with you on a number of our highest priority requests,\" Nadler wrote. \"I write with growing concern over President Trump's repeated attacks on the integrity of (the) Department of Justice and the FBI -- including, but not limited to, his decision to fire former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his frequent statement about ongoing criminal investigations, and his personal attacks on senior department officials.\"\n\nNadler's Tuesday letter includes several prior requests he'd already made, but were ignored because Democrats were in the minority. Nadler's letter is the first of several expected to be aimed at getting answers before Democrats take the House in January. The letter gives a road map into the kinds of things that Nadler and Democrats will be interested in investigating when they assume power next year.\n\nNadler wants the administration to respond to questions about Sessions' recusal from the Russia investigation and allegations that former FBI Director James Comey made about the President among several other letters.\n\nRead More", "", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - La NFL, Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol Americano, decidi\u00f3 trasladar el partido del pr\u00f3ximo lunes por la noche del Estadio Azteca en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico al Memorial Coliseum de Los \u00c1ngeles.

And while there are 10 House races -- and a Senate race (hello, Florida?) -- still not called, we now have a very good sense of who voted, why they voted and what it tells us about the electorate both now and moving forward.\n\nWe have that sense because of the exit poll, a survey taken of almost 18,000 voters after they cast their ballots on Election Day. (For an explanation of exit polling and why it's so useful in understanding voters, check this out .)\n\nBelow are my big takeaways from the national House exit poll, which you can see -- and sift through -- yourself here\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n1. Republicans have an age problem\n\nIn the national House exit poll , Republicans got crushed among young people -- taking just 32% as compared to 67% for Democrats among those aged 18 to 29. But it's more than just the youngest segment of the electorate where Republicans are struggling. Among voters aged 18-44 -- at 42 years old myself, I'd say that includes people who are no spring chickens -- Democrats took 61%, while Republicans got just 36%.\n\n2. White women are swing votes\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's saving graces in the 2016 election was white women, who made up 37% of the electorate and voted for him over Hillary Clinton by 9 points. In Tuesday's election, white women again made up 37% of the electorate, but this time they split their votes: 49% for Democrats, 49% for Republicans.\n\n3. More people (still) identify as Democrats\n\nAsked what party they identify with by exit pollsters, 37% said Democrats, 33% said Republicans and 30% called themselves independents. Those numbers were very similar to where party ID was in 2016 : 36% Democratic, 33% Republican and 31% independent.\n\n4. Democrats made gains among married women\n\nIn 2016, Trump lost married women by only 2 points. In 2018, Republicans lost them by 10 -- perhaps a sign of the broader erosion for Republicans -- due in large part to Trump -- in the suburbs. Democrats continued to absolutely dominate among unmarried women; 66% voted for Democratic candidates for the House while just 31% voted for Republicans.\n\n5. Mothers were major Democratic voters\n\nI haven't seen the electorate broken down by \"mothers\" and \"fathers\" ever before, but the result is interesting! Mothers made up 16% of the overall electorate and went for Democrats by 60%-39%. Fathers? Republicans won them by 2 points.\n\n6. Almost 1 in 5 voters were new\n\nFully 16% of respondents said that 2018 was the first midterm election they had ever voted in. Some of those are young people who turned 18 sometime between 2014 and 2018, but lots more were part of Democrats' attempts to broaden the electorate. It worked; first-time midterm voters chose Democratic candidates by 26 points over Republicans.\n\n7. Haters of Trump > Lovers of Trump\n\nOverall, 45% of people said they approved of Trump as President while 54% disapproved. But dig into the numbers and you see that those who dislike Trump strongly outpace those who strongly like him. Almost half of the public (46%) strongly disapproves of Trump while 31% strongly approve of him. Given how big a factor Trump was in voters' minds (38% said their vote was to show opposition to Trump, 26% said it was to express support for him), the passion the President brought out in his opponents clearly influenced the overall outcome.\n\n8. The impeachment divide is real\n\nFewer 4 in 10 (39%) said that Congress should move to impeach Trump. But of those who support imeachment, 92% of them voted for Democrats, which shows significant support within the Democratic base for impeachment. That disparity speaks to the challenge before expected incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) as she navigates her caucus' politics. Pelosi, who has repeatedly expressed skepticism about the idea of impeachment, will have to deal with her party's base (and a not-insubstantial number of her House Democratic colleagues), which believes that trying to impeach Trump is beyond debate. (Worth noting here: Even if House Democrats did move to impeach Trump, there's a zero percent chance the Republican-controlled Senate wold follow suit and convict him.\n\n9. We're united about our divisions\n\nThere's not a whole hell of a lot of agreement between the two parties in the exit poll. But one place where most people (76%) agree is that the country is growing more divided. Just 9% said we were getting more united -- sidebar: Who ARE these people? -- and 13% said we aren't changing in any meaningful way when it comes to partisanship.\n\n10. This was (another) health care election\n\nMore than 4 in 10 voters (41%) named health care as the most important issue facing the country. That was almost double the number who named immigration (23%) and the economy (22%) and four times as much as those who said gun policy (10%). What those numbers mean is that the last three midterm elections -- 2010, 2014 and 2018 -- were primarily decided on health care. The first two of those elections worked in Republicans' favor; this one broke for Democrats. One other stat on health care from the exit polls: 69% of people said the current system needs \"major changes.\"\n\n11. It wasn't the economy, stupid\n\nA remarkable 68% of voters said the economy was either in \"excellent\" or \"good\" shape. And yet Democrats scored across-the-board gains in House races, with their ultimate seat pickup looking closer to 40 seats than 30 seats. Why? Because this wasn't an election about the economy. It was an election about health care, yes, and also about how people -- and women in particular -- viewed the basic idea of Trump as President.\n\n12. The Russia investigation is seen through a political lens\n\nOne of the most surprising findings for me is that more people believe the ongoing probe into Russia interference in the 2016 election is \"politically motivated\" (54%) than believe it to be \"mostly justified\" (41%). Those numbers were obviously split starkly on partisan lines -- Democrats believe the probe is justified, Republicans think it is political -- but it's clear from the numbers that Trump's \"witch hunt\" mantra has had an effect.\n\n13. Voter suppression > voter fraud\n\nA majority of respondents (53%) said they were more worried that \"some people will be prevented from voting\" while just 36% said their primary concern was that \"some people will cast illegitimate votes.\" Those findings come despite the fact that Trump repeatedly pushed the idea of voter fraud in the runup to the election -- seemingly ignoring the reams of data that suggest there really is no such thing as widespread voter fraud\n\n14.

The donors were mostly Texas based, and many were longtime Castro contacts. His twin brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, also attended the fundraiser, which was first reported by Politico.\n\nCastro's recent outreach has also included meetings and phone calls with prospective staff for a possible presidential campaign, including potential staff in the early nominating state of Iowa, the source said.\n\nWithin the last week, he has also engaged in conversations with lawyers about the \"mechanics of launching a possible 2020 presidential campaign,\" the source added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Castro will hold a fundraiser for his political action committee, Opportunity First, in San Diego, where he's also set to appear before San Diego's Regional Chamber of Commerce.\n\nOver the past few months, Castro has openly talked about his interest in a presidential run, recently telling Rolling Stone , \"I'm likely to do it.\"\n\n\"I have a strong vision for the country. I believe that our country's going in the wrong direction and that it needs new leadership. I'll make a final decision after November, but I'm inclined to do it,\" Castro told Rolling Stone last month.\n\nShould he choose to run, Castro would potentially be one of the only Latino candidates to enter what's expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field which has already seen formal announcements from two candidates -- Rep.

Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, billionaire activist Tom Steyer, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren -- were in talks with potential staff and consultants, said several Democratic sources interviewing for those roles themselves or who have friends who are doing so.\n\nCastro could also find himself facing off against several other Obama administration alumni -- like former Vice President Joe Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder -- as well as fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke, whose narrow loss against Sen. Ted Cruz has sparked speculation he could run for president in 2020.\n\n\"It's going to be cathartic for the party to go through a process where everybody gets to show what they've got. Where you have debates with over a dozen people and every wing of the party is represented,\" Castro told Rolling Stone last month.\n\nHe added \"We need to go through that to get over 2016, and we're going to come out of the 2020 primary, I'm convinced, in a much stronger position. The nominee will be stronger for it and be better prepared to win in November of 2020. I'm hopeful, and I think realistically hopeful, about what this very contested, long, drawn-out process is going to mean. Most of the time a party wants to avoid that kind of process, but in this case, that's our salvation.\"\n\nThroughout the midterms, Castro, who recently released his memoir \"An Unlikely Journey,\" crisscrossed the country campaigning for candidates he endorsed through his Opportunity First PAC. He endorsed 89 candidates in the midterms.\n\nHe made trips to several early nominating states, like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. He also campaigned for candidates in Arizona, Texas, and Florida, where he was an early endorser of Andrew Gillum's gubernatorial campaign in 2017.", "New York (CNN Business) Stocks shot up after the midterm elections. Then the market turned south again.\n\nThe Dow fell for the third straight session Tuesday, closing more than 100 points lower. Stocks were relatively flat compared to Monday, when the Dow fell more than 600 points , dragged down by investors' concerns about the tech sector and the rising dollar.\n\nApple ( AAPL ) fell a little less than 1% Tuesday and 5% Monday after suppliers cut their earnings and sales forecasts because of weak demand. JPMorgan cut its target price on Apple's stock and Goldman Sachs slashed its iPhone sales forecast . That weighed on other technology stocks.\n\nAnd the strong dollar pulled stocks down too. The US currency surged to a 16-month high Monday. The rising dollar is a signal of a strong economy, but it hurts sales and profits for American companies that do business overseas.\n\nThat's all led to another volatile week on Wall Street.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) The approximately 1,300 US troops on the Texas southern border are expected to finish their assigned task of reinforcing border crossing points, largely with concertina wire, in the coming days. Once that work is done, it's not clear what additional orders they will be given other than putting up more wire, according to two defense officials.\n\nAs of Tuesday there are 5,900 US troops assigned to the border mission in Texas, Arizona and California, according to one of the defense officials. Several hundred troops, however, remain at their various headquarters as planners, while others are part of aviation units.\n\nWhile there are approximately 2,800 troops assigned to the mission of helping protect the Texas frontier, only 1,300 are on the border.\n\nBorder reinforcements at McAllen have largely been completed, the official said. Similar reinforcements at Brownsville were expected to be completed Tuesday.\n\nReinforcements are also expected to be carried out at Laredo crossing points. However, it is not clear how many of the troops will stay on the border and how they will assist Customs and Border Protection officers when the Central American migrants who spurred the mission reach the border. There have been separate discussions about troops assisting in the movement of border control officers by air.\n\nRead More", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 (CNN) \u2013 \u0623\u0643\u062f \u0633\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u062f\u0649 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0637\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u060c \u062d\u0645\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0646\u062c\u0627\u062f\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u0625\u0639\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u0644\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a \u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0641\u0631\u0636\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0623\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646 \u0641\u0634\u0644\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0625\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0639 \u0628\u0634\u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a.\n\n\u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629 \u062d\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0639 CNN: \"\u0644\u0642\u062f \u0628\u062f\u0623\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u0634\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0625\u062e\u0627\u0641\u0629 \u0634\u0639\u0628\u0646\u0627 \u0648\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0646\u0627\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0648\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0631\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0637\u0631\u0642 \u062a\u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0644\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u062a\u0635\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0637\".\n\n\u0648\u0634\u062f\u062f \u0628\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0646\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0637\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0633\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0631\u062f \u0641\u0639\u0644 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0623\u0634\u0627\u0631 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0636\u062a \u0634\u0631\u0648\u0637\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u064a\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u060c \u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633\u0643\u0629.\n\n\u0648\u0623\u0648\u0636\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0648\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0647 \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0644\u0627 \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627 \u062a\u062d\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0627\u0633\u0629 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062a\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0636\u0645\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0648\u0648\u064a \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0628\u0623\u0646 \u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062e\u0635\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0645\u0627\u060c \u062b\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0634\u0646\u0637\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0623\u062e\u0631\u0649 \u0644\u062a\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u062d \u0644\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0628\u060c \u0645\u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \"\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062d\u064a\u0644\".", "New York (CNN Business) Citi is making room for an Amazon takeover of its iconic building in New York's Long Island City.\n\nThe bank said Tuesday that in the first half of 2019 it will move about 1,100 employees out of its space at One Court Square, one of the most recognizable towers outside Manhattan. Roughly 3,000 Citi ( C ) employees currently work in the building, which overlooks the East River and has long carried Citi's logo.\n\nThat will allow Amazon ( AMZN ) to get in sooner, accelerating its transformation of the surrounding area. The tech company plans to lease 1 million square feet of office space in the skyscraper for its new headquarters, according to a statement from the building owner.\n\n\"As we have been consolidating our people in our global headquarters in Tribeca, we have still maintained a significant presence in Long Island City,\" Citi CEO Michael Corbat said in a statement. \"But given what it would mean to New York and Long Island City to have Amazon establish a significant presence here, we want to do our part to make this possible.\"\n\nCiti, whose lease at One Court Square reportedly runs out in 2020 , had previously planned to reduce its footprint at the building. But ahead of Amazon's arrival, the bank intends to speed up the process, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) Tesla's reign as the king of electric car makers could be in jeopardy.\n\nTraditional automakers are planning big pushes into electric vehicle production, none more so than Volkswagen.\n\nAt first blush it may not seem like Tesla could lose its dominance.\n\nIt has sold nearly 500,000 cars worldwide, which accounts for about 20% of all the battery-only electric vehicles on the road today, according to an estimate from Navigant Research.\n\nAt 250,000 units in the United States, Tesla has about double the amount of Nissan Leafs, the No. 2 electric car in America. Nissan has sold more than 125,000 Leafs since its late 2010 debut GM's all-electric offering, the Chevy Bolt, has only sold about 36,000 cars since it debuted in 2016.\n\nVolkswagen has a plan to dwarf those numbers.\n\nCEO Herbert Diess recently told Automotive News that VW intends to build and sell 50 million all-electric vehicles in coming years.\n\nHe said VW will be able to price its cars less than comparable Teslas by taking advantage of economies of scale.\n\nDiess did not give a time frame and it will obviously will take years, if not decades, to reach that goal.\n\nVolkswagen sold 10.7 million vehicles last year, almost all of them gas or diesel powered.\n\nBut VW has already announced plans to roll out a wide selection of all-electric cars. The Volkswagen I.D. line is set to debut in 2020. The Audi E-Tron should hit US showrooms in the spring. Other Volkswagen brands, including Porsche , are planning their own electric models as well.\n\nOthers are pushing hard, too.\n\nFord has committed to spend $11 billion to refocus the company on new products such as self-driving and electric vehicles. GM is gearing up its plans as well.\n\nTesla said it's not worried about the increased competition because it will help its overall goal of transitioning cars globally from gas and diesel to electric.\n\n\"Every compelling electric vehicle on the road is a win for Tesla,\" a company spokesman said.\n\nBy 2026, Navigant expects more than 30 million battery-only electric vehicles to be on the road worldwide, compared with about 2.6 million today. That's far too much production for Tesla to handle.\n\nHalf of those vehicles are expected to be sold in the Asia-Pacific region, mostly in China, where Tesla is just now starting plans for its first Asian factory.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, a transportation analyst with Navigant, said he expects Tesla's foothold in the market and its reputation among electric car buyers should help it weather the flood of new competition from established automakers.\n\nBut he said the Volkswagens and General Motors of the world come with size and long track records of building cars.\n\n\"One area where they have a bit of an advantage is the ability to work with their supply chain to get high quality components, and a supply of raw materials such as lithium and cobalt,\" he said. \"They ... already have factories in place around the world.\"\n\nThe deep pockets of established automakers also gives them an advantage.\n\nFor much of 2018, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had to fend off worries about an imminent cash crunch. Those concerns seem to have been allayed after the company finally hit production targets for its Model 3 sedan in October. He says the company's newfound profitability will allow it to meet its debt obligations.\n\nBut it's clear that the far larger and richer established automakers have resources that Tesla can't touch.\n\n\"The other companies have a significant amount of cash reserves to protect them. And they have other products and a wider portfolio,\" said Abhay Vadhavkar, director of manufacturing, engineering and technology for the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank.\n\nIn the end, the biggest barrier to the established automakers making a major push into electric vehicles could be that they might not be as profitable for the automakers' dealers, Abuelsamid said.\n\n\"Most dealers make little or no profit on selling new cars. They make most of profit on used car sales and warranty service,\" he said. The presumption among dealers is the electric vehicles won't require as much service,\" he said.\n\nWith advances being made in electric cars, most buyers won't want a used one.", "(CNN) Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth lost their home to a California wildfire, but the famous couple have their sights set on rebuilding not just their house but also their community.\n\nCyrus and Hemsworth have donated $500,000 to The Malibu Foundation through Cyrus' charity, Happy Hippie, a representative said.\n\nThe funds will be used for \"those in financial need, emergency relief assistance, community rebuilding, wildfire prevention and climate change resilience,\" according to a statement.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Hemsworth shared a striking photo of their home's remains.\n\nIt's been a heartbreaking few days.

Bill Nelson's campaign and the Democratic Party's Senate campaign arm sued in federal court on Tuesday to lift the deadlines on the statewide recount taking place in Florida, arguing that they are \"arbitrary\" and \"impose a severe burden ... on the right to vote.\"\n\nIf successful, the suit would \"extend the deadline for recounting of all the votes statewide in the US Senate race,\" the campaign said in a statement.\n\n\"The lawsuit seeks to allow all local elections officials in the 67 Florida counties the time they say is needed to finish a legally mandated and accurate recount because the race was so close,\" the campaign said of the suit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida.\n\nLawyers for the Democrats argued that the current deadlines -- November 15 by 3 p.m. for machine recounts and November 18 by noon for the hand recounts -- \"will result in the disenfranchisement of voters who associate with Plaintiffs, and this serious and immediate harm warrants the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\"\n\nThe new filing -- which comes on top of four earlier lawsuits that are making their way through the legal system -- are the latest salvo in the Democratic effort to ensure through court action that a variety of ballots in question are counted in the three statewide races. Both Nelson, whose efforts have been steered by lawyer Marc Elias, and the campaign of his opponent, Republican Gov. Rick Scott, are increasingly turning to the courts in an effort to shape a broader fight over the scope of the count and, eventually, final recount.\n\nRead More", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) In an interview with \"Good Morning America\"'s Robin Roberts for her new memoir \"Becoming,\" Michelle Obama revealed that her two daughters, Malia and Sasha, were conceived using in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Malia, Obama's eldest daughter, was born in 1998, 20 years after the birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, in a hospital in Oldham, England. In 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, slightly over 80,000 assisted reproductive technology procedures (ARTs) were performed in the United States. Two decades later, that figure has more than tripled. Nearly 2% of live births in the US are the result of IVF and other ARTs (including intrauterine transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg to effect fertilization). Over eight million children have been born via IVF worldwide. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 9% of women aged 35 to 44 reported that they or their partner had undergone fertility treatment.\n\nLaura Beers\n\nObama's disclosure that their children were the product of IVF is a welcome addition to this public conversation about infertility, one which will hopefully prompt some women and men to reconsider whether it could be a solution for them. It is inevitable that Obama's star power will help demystify this medical process. But what greater public familiarity with IVF won't do is help the many women and couples struggling with infertility for whom the principal obstacle to parenthood is financial, not psychological. For too many, the price of IVF places the procedure out of reach. The spiraling costs associated with the \"infertility industry\" mean that the benefits of new assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) are not equally available to all.\n\nProfessional women like Michelle Obama remain most likely to pursue IVF, not just because they have put their careers before childbirth and left it too late to have babies the natural way, as the common cultural myth goes, but because they can afford to. (According to the CDC's most recent report , less than one-third of ART treatments result from a diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve, which tends to correlate with advanced maternal age, lower than the number of treatments performed as a result of male-factor infertility.)\n\nJUST WATCHED Michelle Obama in her own words Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Michelle Obama in her own words 01:59\n\nIVF's high price tag, combined with an uneven insurance coverage has created an entrenched social division between IVF haves and have nots . When the Pew Research Center's figure of 9% of women or couples who have undergone infertility treatment is broken down by race, the discrepancies are stark. While 12% of white women report that they or their partners have undergone treatment, only 3% of black women, and 5% of Hispanic women report the same. This is despite the fact that, as Ann V. Bell recently wrote in \" Misconception ,\" women of color are in fact more likely to suffer from infertility. The education gap is equally stark. While 56% of adults with a postgraduate degree say that they have either undergone infertility treatment or know someone who has, only 20% of those with a high school degree or less report experience or knowledge of infertility treatment.\n\nThere is, to a certain extent, a chicken and egg aspect to the lower instance of IVF amongst women of color. Because they encounter fewer friends and family who have undergone IVF, they are less likely to consider it as an option. Obama's speaking out about her own infertility will hopefully show African-American and other minority women that IVF is not exclusively a white woman's solution. But while Obama's revelation may inspire a greater interest in the procedure, it does nothing to lower the financial barriers to infertility treatment.", "London (CNN) We have a deal ! Well, sort of. A mere 873 days since the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, the text of the \"withdrawal agreement\" has been agreed on between the two sides' negotiating teams and Theresa May's Cabinet has, against the odds, given her their support.\n\nUnfortunately for May, the celebrations will be short lived. She still faces a number of hurdles both in Brussels and back home before she can call Brexit a success.\n\nFirst, back to Brussels\n\nWith the UK Cabinet now in line, an emergency summit of the EU council -- the 28 member states that make up the European Union -- will be called for November. Or, at least May hopes it will.\n\nAt this summit, the member states will agree to the withdrawal text, allowing it to move to legislative chambers of both the EU and the UK.\n\nOwing to the fact the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has at every stage worked closely with the EU27 -- the 28 member states minus the UK -- it's assumed that this will be little more than a rubber-stamp exercise.\n\nNext, to the House of Commons\n\nThis will be the trickiest part of the process, and the PM could be forgiven for banging her head against a wall. It has long been acknowledged that the political reality in London is the biggest problem May faces. And it will all come to a head when Members of Parliament get to show the PM exactly what they think of her deal.\n\nLast year, Parliament won the right to have a vote on the draft agreement -- something the government was keen to avoid.\n\nThis is known in the UK as the \"meaningful vote\" and it allows MPs the chance to give their verdict on the contents of the withdrawal text and the associated political agreement on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.\n\nSince May lost her majority in Parliament after an ill-advised a snap election in 2017, the arithmetic has looked challenging for her.\n\nJUST WATCHED Britain's Brexit agreement deadline is near Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Britain's Brexit agreement deadline is near 01:59\n\nThe priority for the opposition Labour Party is to bring down May's government and force an election, so it is virtually guaranteed to vote against the deal. But May also knows that a significant chunk of her own MPs detest the agreement she has struck with the EU and are ready to vote it down.\n\nThen there's the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP, whose 10 MPs prop up her government. The DUP has been adamant from day one that any deal that undermines Northern Ireland's place as part of the United Kingdom would lead to them voting against the PM.\n\nIf May loses this vote, then all bets are off. The government has long maintained that it's her deal or no deal, but in reality it could still make an appeal to Brussels and try to get some further concessions.\n\nIn theory, the government -- at this point led by May or someone else -- could bring a revised deal back to the Commons and have another go at getting it through. Failure to do so would most likely result in the government falling, a general election and myriad potential outcomes, including a second referendum.\n\nBut if she wins this vote...\n\nEven more drama in the Commons\n\nAssuming the meaningful vote passes -- a huge assumption at this point -- it then needs to be translated into UK law. This is where the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill comes in. That will formally make legal the terms under which the UK will leave the European Union and enter the implementation period.\n\nNormally, lawmakers can amend legislation such as this, and frustrate the government. But as Brexit is an agreement between the UK government and the EU, which doesn't have a vote in the House of Commons, it's hard to see how MPs could influence it (though they could make life very difficult for the UK government).\n\nFailure of the vote to pass at this stage would presumably lead to Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, and a major political crisis. But, if May manages to get the withdrawal bill through...\n\nStill more drama in the Commons\n\nNext, the seldom talked-about Constitutional Reform and Governance Act of 2010, which requires the government to lay before Parliament any changes to international treaties with an explanatory memorandum.\n\nAt this stage, one would assume that having cleared Parliament this would be a done deal. But Brexit has always been an ugly street fight. Those still opposed to the deal going through could be expected to pick up whatever rocks they can find and hurl them at the government.\n\nBack to Brussels\n\nIf the deal has made it this far, the final process of ratifying the agreement moves to the European Parliament. Seeing as by now the agreement will have already been agreed at Council level and in the UK's Parliament, it is hard to see a reason for the EU Parliament to mess it up -- especially as most in Brussels want Brexit out of the way so they can concentrate on the European elections, taking place next year. But Brexit, as you might have gathered by now, can be weird. However, assuming it passes this final phase...\n\nBong! 29 March 2019 -- Brexit day\n\nDespite the wishes of many hardline Brexiteers, Big Ben will not chime in the UK's new era of independence.\n\nBut should that day be marked by the draft agreement the Cabinet is thought to be shown on Wednesday this week, those Brexiteers will likely consider themselves to have lost the battle and have little to celebrate.", "In her new memoir, \"Becoming,\" former first lady Michelle Obama writes that she extended help to Melania Trump as she transitioned into the first lady role, but Mrs. Trump has yet to take her up on the offer.", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump took part in an event celebrating Diwali Tuesday at the White House alongside several administration officials.\n\n\"Our nation is blessed to be home to millions of hardworking citizens of Indian and southeast Asian heritage, who enrich our country in countless ways.

In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him \"The sexiest player of the year.\"\n\n\"I thank the people who voted for me, but I'm sure it's rigged,\" Solari quipped. \"We'll see if I'm offered another career in the film industry when I leave.\"\n\nSantiago Solari was part of Real Madrid's European Cup winning team in 2002.\n\nIntensely private\n\nIn 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Pe\u00f1arol.\n\nMarried with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile.\n\nBack in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid's junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club's B team -- in 2016.\n\nUnder Solari, Castilla's results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group.\n\nWill Real place their faith in Solari or go with a more established coach?\n\nWhat type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gr\u00e1fico magazine provides a clue.\n\n\"First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.\n\n\"Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that's very attacking or a 3-4-3 that's very defensive and vice versa.\"", "(CNN) A feud with the first lady's office cost a senior national security adviser her job in the White House after she sparred with East Wing staff and other key members of the Trump administration.\n\nThe dispute spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion on Tuesday when the first lady's office released a statement calling for deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel's ouster as reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would fire the official.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that Ricardel would be leaving her role as deputy national security adviser and would take a different role in the administration.\n\nThe statement Tuesday from Melania Trump's office amounted to a stunning public rebuke by a first lady of a senior official serving in her husband's administration. It came after reports surfaced earlier Tuesday indicating Ricardel would be pushed out of her post after less than seven months on the job.\n\nNeither Ricardel nor spokespeople for the National Security Council responded to CNN requests for comment.\n\nReflecting the fast-moving nature of the events, soon after a Wall Street Journal report surfaced Tuesday afternoon alleging Ricardel was fired and escorted off the White House grounds, a senior White House official denied the story to reporters.\n\nThe official said Ricardel was still in her office Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHer departure leaves national security adviser John Bolton without one of his key allies in the White House, a deputy who has also shared his penchant for bureaucratic infighting.\n\nIt was those sharp elbows that sources said led to the first lady's stinging statement, with Ricardel most recently feuding with members of the first lady's staff over her trip to Africa. One person familiar with the matter said Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.\n\nA White House official accused Ricardel of being dishonest about the feud and subsequently leaking stories to try to cover her behavior.\n\nAnd before her spat with the East Wing, Ricardel butted heads repeatedly with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a rivalry that was well-known within the Trump administration. Her disputes with Mattis preceded her time as deputy national security adviser, going back to the presidential transition when Ricardel sought to block Mattis from hiring certain people who had been critical of Trump or were viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump.\n\nTensions had also been rising between Ricardel and chief of staff John Kelly and his deputy Zach Fuentes in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believe Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, the people said.\n\nThe dispute made it difficult for Ricardel to land in a top post in the Trump administration, though she was ultimately tapped for the position of undersecretary of commerce for export administration. Ricardel then joined the National Security Council as Bolton's deputy in April after he was named national security adviser.\n\nRicardel has been key to Bolton's efforts to restructure the National Security Council and to help Bolton secure his place as an influential adviser to the President on all foreign policy matters.\n\nThe drama surrounding Ricardel's ouster surfaced while Bolton was half a world away in Singapore, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.\n\nWest Wing caught off guard\n\nWest Wing officials were caught off guard on Tuesday by the statement from the first lady's spokeswoman targeting Ricardel, two sources familiar with the matter said.\n\nWhite House officials were generally aware of the tensions between Ricardel and the first lady's office stemming from the Africa trip, but were stunned to see the first lady take such a public stance against a senior staffer through her spokeswoman. Sources said officials in the White House press shop were particularly annoyed that they didn't get a heads-up from the East Wing.\n\nWest Wing and NSC officials are more upset at the way the East Wing handled the matter than the substance of the effort to push Ricardel out.\n\nOne person said neither Trump, Kelly nor press secretary Sarah Sanders knew the statement was coming.\n\nRicardel made few friends since she came on board in April, clashing with officials across the administration. Two administration sources said she was generally not well liked, though others pushed back, saying she was a respected member of the team and one of the highest ranking women in the West Wing.\n\nEven one NSC official who said they liked Ricardel said she \"liked to pick fights with a lot of different folks\" and suspected her latest feud with the first lady's office was \"the last straw.\"\n\nAnother official was more forgiving: \"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.", "(CNN) Here's what you might have missed Tuesday on CNN:\n\n--Northern California's Camp Fire has become the deadliest wildfire in the state's history after an additional 13 sets of human remains were discovered, bringing the death toll to 42.\n\n--CNN filed a lawsuit on Tuesday morning against President Trump and several of his aides, seeking the immediate restoration of chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's access to the White House.\n\n--More than two years after Britain voted in a divisive referendum to withdraw from the European Union, British and EU negotiators have finally agreed on a draft Brexit deal , UK Prime Minister Theresa May's office said Tuesday.\n\n--Democratic Rep.

Decorated with 50,000 multicolored lights and topped with a massive Swarovski star, only a bona fide Scrooge wouldn't find the shimmering Norway spruce a stunner.\n\nRockefeller Center was the brainchild of John D. Rockefeller Jr., born in 1874 as the heir to the Standard Oil fortune. One of America's wealthiest citizens, his defining business venture was the creation of his namesake.\n\nBuilt at the height of the Great Depression, it employed thousands of people during the three-year construction project. At a time when jobs were scarce and a dime was hard to come by, Rockefeller Center's building phase put food on many tables around New York\n\nNot one to think small, Rockefeller conceived of his development as a \"city within a city.\" He wanted to build a complex for business and pleasure. Visual razzle-dazzle was to be a component, in tune with his belief that promoting art was an act of good citizenship. Innovations included heated buildings and an indoor parking complex.\n\nRockefeller Center officially opened in May 1933. The Christmas tree, first purchased and decorated by the Depression-era workers at the construction site, quickly became a New York holiday tradition.\n\nBy 1939, more than 125,000 people were visiting daily. If it had been its own independent city, Rockefeller Center would have been the 51st largest in the country, making John D. Rockefeller's dream of a \"city within a city\" a reality.\n\nHere's what to see and do:\n\nRockefeller Center Tour\n\nRockefeller Center is composed of buildings, public spaces, shops, eateries and attractions. To get a comprehensive overview, take the 75-minute guided Rockefeller Center Tour. Sprinkled with historical tidbits, it explores some of the most significant buildings and eye-catching artwork.\n\nTours are given daily from 10 a.m. until 7:30 p.m., scheduled every half hour excluding 6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Tickets cost $25.\n\nRockefeller Center Tour , 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10111; +1 (212) 698-2000\n\nTop of the Rock Observation Deck\n\nNew York City's skyline looks mighty fine from the Top of the Rock's three observation decks on the 67th, 69th and 70th floors.\n\nThe theatrics start during the elevator ride up, as the lights dim and images of Rockefeller Center from the 1930s through the present day are projected on the glass ceiling.\n\nAll three levels offer sweeping views: Central Park to the north and the Empire State Building to the south.\n\nIt's open 8 a.m. to midnight with the last elevator going up at 11 p.m. Tickets cost $36 for adults, $30 for kids 6-12, free for kids 5 and younger.

During the holidays, its tree-side position makes it one of the city's busiest spots.\n\nThe Rink first opened on Christmas Day, 1936. For some, a Yuletide spin around the oval is the quintessential New York experience. For others, it's reminiscent of a rush-hour subway ride.\n\nWith room for only 150 skaters, general admission is on a first-come, first-served basis. Adult general admission is $25, rising to $28-$33 during the holidays. Seniors and kids younger than 11 pay $15.\n\nTo avoid a potentially lengthy wait, consider a pricier VIP option, which includes a reserved skating time, admission to the heated igloo, refreshments and more. The VIP ticket ranges from $60 to $150 during peak holiday sessions.\n\nIn season, join two-time Olympian JoJo Starbuck for her hour-long skate exercise class on the ice at Rockefeller Center's rink.

Their performance at the annual \"Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes\" may be kitschy, but their technique is razor-sharp. Performances start in early November and continue through New Year's Day. Ticket prices range widely -- from about $50 to close to $600.\n\nRadio City Music Hall , 1260 Ave. of the Americas, New York, NY 10020; +1 (866) 858-0007\n\nThe Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree\n\nThe tree is usually lit for the first time on the Wednesday following Thanksgiving.

The largest and perhaps the most recognized sculpture is the heroic-sized bronze statue of Atlas supporting the earth on his shoulders.\n\nAtlas is found at the main entrance forecourt of 630 Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe elegant bronze sculpture of Prometheus is surrounded by a cascade of water in Rockefeller Plaza. In the winter, Prometheus serves as the golden support of the towering Christmas tree.\n\nShopping\n\nWith more than 100 stores, Rockefeller Center is a shopper's wonderland. For kids (and kids at heart), the LEGO store is a must. It features innovative displays made with the Danish company's signature colorful interlocking plastic bricks.

Priority is given to trees from neighboring states.\n\n- In the 1930s, Mexican artist Diego Rivera was hired to paint a mural in the lobby of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. He was fired in a wave of controversy after he altered his initial approved concept sketch to include a prominently featured depiction of Communist leader Vladimir Lenin. Despite protests from the art community, the painting was destroyed.\n\n- The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is adorned with energy-efficient LED lights. When the tree comes down in January, it is milled and made into lumber that is donated to Habitat for Humanity and used for home building.\n\n- More than 1,100 glitzy costumes are worn in the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes. Each Rockette has eight costume changes per show, with as little as 78 seconds to change outfits.\n\nWhere to eat nearby\n\nWhile those with a sincere interest in gastronomy don't usually make designated pilgrimages to Rockefeller Center, the Sea Grill and Rock Center Caf\u00e9 are rink-side dining options. Both are popular and palatable.\n\nThe Sea Grill presents fresh seafood, such as Blue Point oysters and sushi rolls, in an upscale atmosphere.\n\nThe Sea Grill , 19 W. 49th St, New York, NY 10020; +1 (212) 332-7610\n\nRock Center Caf\u00e9 serves a casual menu with broad appeal.

Journalism is built on a strong foundation and will outlast Trump and other demagogues who seek to subvert facts and the truth. I think that's wrong. There are limits to what media organizations can do, but that doesn't mean they should do nothing to adjust to the new reality.\n\nSo, some modest ideas. The first applies to covering live presidential events, which involve mutual trust between journalist and public official. Trump has abused that privilege of his platform. He has repeatedly and blatantly lied about the facts and his own policies. He has spread spurious and demonstrably false charges against his critics and attacked journalists who are doing their jobs.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump responds to Michelle Obama's comments Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump responds to Michelle Obama's comments 00:45\n\nHe has lost the right to be covered live on TV or Twitter. His probation? Tape delay. Do not put anything on live; in fact, don't put anything on without a fact check. Whether a presidential event is broadcast live at 11 or 11:30 does not impose an enormous burden on the President's ability to lead the nation or get his message out. It does allow the President's comments to be broadcast in the context of reality and truth.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced during a Diwali ceremonial lighting ceremony at the White House Tuesday that he is nominating Neomi Rao to fill Justice Brett Kavanaugh's seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"I won't say today that I just nominated Neomi to be on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the seat of Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\" Trump said, 24 hours before a planned announcement. \"She's going to be fantastic -- great person.\"\n\nTrump said the early announcement \"gives me a big story.\"\n\n\"We were going to announce that tomorrow and I said you know, here we are Neomi -- we're never gonna do better than this -- I thought it was an appropriate place\"\n\nThe President has interviewed Rao, who currently serves as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, an agency within the White House Office of Management and Budget, CNN's Ariane de Vogue reported.\n\nRead More", "Parroting CNN's motto, \"facts first,\" GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the network's First Amendment lawsuit a \"political stunt\" and said Acosta still has access to the White House through a daily pass.\n\n\"Every one of his colleagues still has access to the WH, as does the reporter himself via a daily pass. #FactsFirst,\" McDaniel wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn fact, as CNN said in court documents Tuesday, the White House denied Acosta's application for a day pass on November 8, the day after his hard pass was revoked following the post-midterms news conference.\n\nAnd on a Presidential trip in Paris over the weekend, the White House and the Secret Service continued to deny Acosta access to press events -- including at a ceremony that he had acquired separate credentials to cover from the French government \u2013 according to the suit.\n\nIn a signed declaration, CNN Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist wrote that \"reliance on daily passes\" to access other unscheduled events on the White House grounds like \"gaggles\" and off-camera briefings was \"impracticable at best, impossible at worst.\"", "(CNN) Before and after images are helping show the devastation the Camp Fire had on Paradise, California.\n\nThe fire, bigger than the size of Atlanta, is only minimally contained, but it's already the deadliest and most destructive in state history. Forty-two people are dead and over 6,500 homes have burned to the ground.\n\nThe day the fire broke out was like any other for Robert Hoffman. He left for work at 6:30 a.m. His daughter stayed home.\n\nSoon, he heard Paradise was being evacuated and he scrambled to get his daughter out. He couldn't get back to her to evacuate her; the roads were blocked.\n\nLuckily, she got out and was able to meet her father in nearby Chico.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley on Tuesday downplayed concerns raised by Democrats on multiple fronts about conflicts of interest involving acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker or that Whitaker might interfere in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nGrassley and other senior Republicans said they were confident Whitaker would get clearance from ethics officials at the Justice Department, and they rebuffed Democratic calls for hauling Whitaker up to Capitol Hill to testify.\n\n\"I heard over TV or radio that Whitaker is going to ask the ethics people whether he should be recused. I think that answers it,\" the Iowa Republican said. \"Doesn't matter what the Democrats think. If he is going through that process that's going to answer that question.\"\n\nAsked if Whitaker, who met recently with Grassley, provided assurances he would not interfere in the Mueller investigation, Grassley said President Donald Trump has made that assurance and that's what matters.\n\n\"It seems to me that the President is the chief executive and the President said that he wasn't going to do that,\" Grassley said. \"Doesn't matter what Whitaker thinks. The President said it isn't going to be done.\"\n\nGrassley's backing comes as Democrats have demanded that Whitaker recuse himself in the Mueller probe over his past comments criticizing the investigation -- and newly empowered House Democrats have signaled they will investigate Jeff Sessions' firing and Whitaker's appointment when they take power in January.\n\nDemocrats and others have also argued that Whitaker's appointment may not be lawful because he was never confirmed by the Senate. Maryland's Attorney General Brian Frosh filed a court challenge Tuesday to replace Whitaker with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein as acting attorney general.\n\n\"No matter what the Trump Justice Department says, there is no acceptable justification for this appointment,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. \"Even conservative justices on the Supreme Court have essentially made that argument.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent Grassley two letters calling for hearings with Whitaker and Sessions. \"The circumstances surrounding Attorney General Sessions' departure raise serious questions, including whether the appointment is lawful and the possible impact on Special Counsel Mueller's investigation,\" Feinstein wrote.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said he hopes \"Whitaker's time as acting AG is extraordinarily brief,\" calling on the President to pick a well-qualified candidate sooner rather than later.\n\nGrassley said a hearing with Whitaker was \"under consideration,\" and he hadn't made a decision yet. But the Iowa Republican also noted he was not concerned about past remarks from Whitaker that were critical of the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"As long as he made them as a private citizen, no,\" Grassley said.\n\nOther Republicans on the Judiciary panel said Whitaker should not testify.\n\n\"I don't see an advantage to doing that,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, adding that Democrats would likely try \"to smear him -- there may be some who may like to do that.\"\n\nHatch told CNN that he's not concerned that Whitaker will act improperly with the Mueller probe. \"Anybody who acts improperly will find themselves on the front page and not be in very good shape,\" he said. \"He's going to be in a very tough position and people are going to watch him very carefully.\"\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn told CNN that he hadn't yet spoken to Whitaker, and said it \"would be a mistake\" for him to interfere with the Mueller probe. But Cornyn added: \"I think Director Mueller needs to wrap this thing up. He needs to finish his job. This thing has been hanging out there for a long time. Certainly I would think he's got virtually all the information he needs in order to make a decision and write a report.\"\n\nCornyn added he was not interested in the attorney general job.\n\nPush for bill to protect Mueller\n\nDemocrats and a handful of Republicans are renewing a push for legislation to protect Mueller in the wake of Whitaker's appointment.\n\nLeahy said he wanted stand-alone legislation, asserting that many Republicans privately agree that Whitaker might try to shape the Russia investigation.\n\nThe special counsel legislation passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in the spring, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear he doesn't intend to bring it to the floor for a vote, a position the Kentucky Republican reiterated last week in the wake of Sessions' firing.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, the retiring Arizona Republican senator, tweeted that he would seek unanimous consent to vote on the bill on the Senate floor this week. But that effort is likely to be objected to, stopping it from going anywhere.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Democrats would also try to attach legislation protecting the special counsel to the must-pass spending bill that Congress needs to pass during the lame-duck session. Schumer also said that Congress wanted to be notified of the results of Whitaker's meetings with ethics officials.\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker has prejudged the outcome of an investigation he now oversees,\" Schumer said.\n\nGrassley, who helped broker a compromise on the legislation in the committee, said he supports the Mueller bill, but deferred to McConnell about moving it to the full Senate.\n\n\"The answer is, if it comes for a vote, I will vote for that bill. Whether it comes to a vote is up to the leader and I'm going to respect the leader's right to bring it up,\" he said.\n\nFinally, Grassley said he will have an answer \"in a few days\" on whether he will remain chairman of the Judiciary Committee or move over to be chair of the Finance Committee, something that would be available to him with Hatch retiring.\n\nHe said he needs to consult his GOP colleagues before deciding.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "(CNN) There are 10 more confirmed cases of acute flaccid myelitis, a polio-like illness that mostly affects children, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday , bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 90 in 27 states this year.\n\nThere are also 162 possible cases under investigation, 23 more than last week.\n\nAFM is a rare illness that affects the nervous system, especially the gray matter in the spinal cord, and can cause muscle weakness and sudden onset of paralysis. Last month, the CDC said that more than 90% of the 414 patients since 2014 have been children under the age of 4, although adults can also develop AFM.\n\nThe agency released a report Tuesday that said 99% of children with confirmed AFM had experienced a viral illness with symptoms such as fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis.\n\nThe CDC also seems to be getting closer to determining a cause of the disease. According to the new report, \"Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic evidence to date suggest a viral association.\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that the agency is \"not ruling anything out.\"\n\nIn the past two weeks, the agency has come under criticism from its own medical advisers for not zeroing in on a virus as a cause and instead also considering causes such as genetic disorders and environmental toxins.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany of the CDC's outside medical consultants have long thought that a virus -- specifically an enterovirus -- was most likely at the root of AFM.\n\nEnteroviruses are common; they cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.\n\nTypically, enteroviruses cause people to have cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and recovery is easy.\n\nSome of the patients whose cases are detailed in the new report tested positive for an enterovirus, but others have not, although it's not clear whether the testing was done in time to catch the presence of the virus.\n\nIt's unclear why a relatively small number of people develop paralysis after an enterovirus infection. Even within the same family, several siblings can develop the cold-like symptoms, but only one may become paralyzed.\n\nTwo weeks ago , four of the CDC's outside medical advisers on AFM expressed frustration to CNN that the agency insisted on casting its net wide, looking at genetic causes and possible environmental causes.\n\nThe experts felt that the agency shouldn't waste its time on those causes, which they said were highly unlikely, and instead should focus on a virus as the most likely reason behind AFM.\n\n\"I'm breathing a sigh of relief that they've acknowledged this,\" Dr. Keith Van Haren, an assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said of the CDC's new report. \"It's great.\"\n\nVan Haren said now the agency can move faster to figure out exactly which virus is causing the problem and how best to treat it.\n\nDr. Kenneth Tyler, a professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and another adviser to the CDC on AFM, agreed. \"I'm glad to see they're moving in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nBoth neurologists praised the CDC for becoming more communicative and responsive about AFM with doctors and patients over the past two weeks.\n\nJeremy Wilcox, a Virginia man whose son was diagnosed with AFM in September, also praised the agency for becoming more open.\n\nParents of children with AFM say that for years, their emails to the CDC went unanswered. Last week, Wilcox arranged a meeting between Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency's principal deputy director, and more than a dozen parents of children with AFM. That meeting is taking place on Tuesday.", "New York (CNN Business) Less than two months after Apple refreshed its smartphone lineup, investors are once again panicking about whether enough people are buying iPhones.\n\nApple's ( AAPL ) stock fell 1% Tuesday after tumbling 5% on Monday, shaving off tens of billions of dollars in market value. The stock fell after iPhone parts suppliers Japan Display and Lumentum Holdings cut their sales outlooks . On Tuesday, another Apple supplier, Qorvo, followed suit in cutting its forecast, citing \"recent demand changes for flagship smartphones.\"\n\nAlthough the suppliers did not mention Apple specifically, the announcements were quickly interpreted by Apple analysts and investors as a possible warning sign of weaker than expected iPhone demand.\n\nCiting the Lumentum cuts, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed \"concern\" in an investor note Tuesday that \"demand for new iPhone models is deteriorating.\" Yet in the very next sentence, the analysts said Apple \"could easily right itself given the bulk of demand comes in late December.\"\n\nSuch is the uncertainty that comes with trying to read the tea leaves for the world's most valuable company.

The plan came in response to the US Food and Drug Administration's September announcement that it would investigate major e-cigarette makers and review their sales and marketing practices.\n\n\"Our intent was never to have youth use JUUL,\" Kevin Burns wrote in the Tuesday statement that outlined an action plan divided into four key areas: flavors, retail stores, social media and the future.\n\nBurns said the company will be \"eliminating our own social media accounts and continuing to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party accounts.\"\n\nMore than 99% of all social media content related to the company is generated through third-party users and accounts \"with no affiliation to our company,\" Burns wrote.\n\n\"To remove ourselves entirely from participation in the social conversation, we have decided to shut down our U.S.-based social media accounts on Facebook and Instagram,\" he wrote. \"Our presence on Twitter will be confined to non-promotional communications only.\" YouTube posts will consist only of testimonials by former adult smokers who have switched to the Juul system, Burns said.\n\nStopping retail sale of most Juul flavors\n\nAdditionally, the company vowed to stop selling most flavored Juul pods to all 90,000-plus retail stores, including convenience stores and vape shops, while restricting flavor sales to adults 21 and older on its secure website. Juul will also continue enforcement against unauthorized sales in other online marketplaces.\n\nGoing forward, Burns said, the company will develop technology to ensure that retailers comply with age requirements and restrict access to its products.\n\nThe company is \"committed to improving the lives of the world's one billion adult smokers, with the ultimate goal of eliminating cigarettes,\" Burns said. \"We don't want anyone who doesn't smoke, or already use nicotine, to use JUUL products. We certainly don't want youth using the product.\"\n\nIn a move to reduce teen e-cigarette use, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb is expected to announce a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in convenience stores and gas stations as early as this week. The agency will impose age-verification requirements for online sales. Flavored e-cigarette products would be available in vape and tobacco shops.\n\nIn the September statement, Gottlieb said smoking \"remains the number one preventable cause of death in America, killing nearly half a million people a year.\" He added that the agency's observation is that \"youth use of e-cigs is rising very sharply.\"\n\n'What's the counter-move?'\n\nJon-Patrick Allem , a research scientist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, said that Juul's removal of its Instagram and Facebook accounts is \"a good first step.\"\n\nYet he noted that the company is going to keep its Twitter account.\n\n\"In my research , I've demonstrated that Juul is discussed quite often on Twitter,\" he said, and among those doing so are teens and young adults.\n\n\"They create little communities to discuss which products or flavors they like and when and where they are using Juul,\" he said. The consequences of these online discussions include awareness of, use of and misperceptions about the product. Interventions may be needed to deter interest among young people and to correct these misperceptions, he said.\n\nFor example, he said, \"all Juul products have nicotine; many adolescents are unaware of that. Many young adults -- about 40% of college-aged students, 18 to 24 -- were unaware that all Juul products have nicotine in them. This is part of the landscape that influences product uptake.\"\n\nAllem believes that removing most flavored Juul products from retail stores, which will reduce and limit accessibility, is another good move.\n\nThe next question is \"something along the lines of: What's the counter-move? How will youth circumvent these new restrictions?\" he said. Though it's \"great to initiate restrictions,\" the company needs to see how young people respond and then update the restrictions.\n\nAllem's research also shows that one of the more appealing characteristics of the sleek, small Juul device is its ability to be used in places where smoking and vaping are restricted.\n\nResearch shows that Juul is used \"all the way down to elementary schools,\" he said. Many teachers wouldn't be able to identify a Juul product, so \"raising awareness\" among educators \"in school systems from elementary up to high school and into college is also an important step\" to deter teen use.\n\n'The minimum first steps'\n\nKar-Hai Chu , assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health, considers Juul's action plan \"the minimum first steps needed.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, while their social media action plan was a necessary response, it is like trying to put the genie back in the bottle,\" Chu wrote in an email. \"Unlike traditional media platforms, social media messages are not spread from a single source, but exponentially through each person's entire social network. The youth that JUUL's messages have already reached, whether on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, will be the ones that are doing JUUL's marketing.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nChu explained that \"nicotine impacts brain development during adolescence. Research has also repeatedly found that adolescent use of e-cigarettes increases the risk of using traditional cigarettes.\" For these reasons, he remains concerned about e-cigarette use among teens.\n\nIn his statement in September, Gottlieb said the FDA will \"continue to work to find out why so many kids are using and abusing these products.\"\n\nJuul's Burns said he believes his company and the FDA have a common goal: \"We want to be the off-ramp for adult smokers to switch from cigarettes, not an on-ramp for America's youth to initiate on nicotine.\"", "(CNN) Optatius Buyssens was a Belgian solider who fought the Germans during World War I.\n\nHis great grandson, Vincent Buyssens, just found out that he had six coins to thank for saving -- and endangering -- his great-grandfather's life during the war.\n\nVincent Buyssens, who lives in Antwerp, Belgium, said the coins stopped a bullet and saved his great-grandfather's life.

The US Attorney's Office in Vermont declined to comment, telling CNN it did not comment on investigations. A message left with the senator's office was not immediately returned Tuesday.\n\n\"Jane is grateful the investigation has come to an end. She has said from the beginning that she did nothing wrong and she is pleased that the matter has come to a conclusion,\" Weaver said.\n\nJane Sanders was the president of Burlington College from 2004 to 2011. The college announced its closure in 2016 due to debt it had taken on from a real estate deal the school made during her tenure. CNN reviewed the loan application for the deal, which was signed by Jane Sanders. The loan application stated the college would take in millions of dollars' worth of pledged donations, many of which never materialized.\n\nVermont lawyer Brady Toensing, a former state Republican vice chair who was once Donald Trump's campaign chair in the state, leveled accusations of bank fraud related to the land deal.\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) A federal judge has blocked the Georgia secretary of state from certifying election results before Friday, as the state's governor's race remains unsettled.\n\nLate Monday night, Judge Amy Totenberg ruled that state and local officials must conduct a \"good faith review\" of all provisional ballots that had been rejected because a voter's name was not found on the voter registration list.\n\nThis includes using \"all available registration documentation\" from voters to verify their identity, instead of solely relying on the voter registration list. The Secretary of State's office has reported that more than 21,000 provisional ballots were cast.\n\nTotenberg has ordered the state to establish a hotline for voters to determine whether their provisional ballots were counted -- and if not, the reason why.\n\nTotenberg's ruling does not require the extension of any certification deadlines.

The ruling, however, does bar the secretary of state from certifying election results before Friday, giving the state more time to address various issues stemming from the election.\n\nRead More", "Anna Sophia Lotman is a junior at the Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, California. The views expressed in this commentary are her own.

In my middle school, only the girls were required to take self-defense. And my mom made sure my sister and I, as well as some close friends, had pepper spray at the tender age of 12. Her mother had worried that her daughter might be hit by a car; now, she was worried her daughter might be a victim of an unwanted advance.\n\nI suppose the tool kit was a smart investment since I first got catcalled when I was 13. If the acne and awkwardness of middle school wasn't enough, now I had to add being leered at to my list of things about which to worry. Since then, outfits I couldn't wait to debut have been hanging all alone in the back of my closet. My brand-new, light pink floral spaghetti-strap summer dress has been orphaned.\n\nBut teenagers shouldn't have to grow up this fast. And we shouldn't have to make these sacrifices.\n\nWhenever a woman is the victim of sexual violence, the aftermath is far too predictable. Questions from \"What was she wearing?\" to \"Did she lead him on?\" often color the conversation -- our collective focus falling to what the woman, not the assailant, could have done differently in the situation.\n\nAnd now the business community has bought into this idea -- creating products to arm girls and women better. Two entrepreneurs fundraised to launch a line of \"rape proof\" underwear, which they marketed as \"underwear only you can take off!\" Similarly, a handful of students from North Carolina State University have developed a nail polish to detect date rape drugs.\n\nWhile I can see the values in these products, they fail to address the underlying systemic problem of rape culture -- one driven not by the victims, but the men (and sometimes women) who perpetrate these crimes.\n\nThankfully, this viewpoint is beginning to gain traction. Activists such as Jackson Katz, who recently visited my high school, are advancing the notion that so-called women's issues are, in fact, men's issues.\n\nSpecifically, Katz advocates what's called the \"bystander approach\": In the face of harassment, men can no longer stand by. Instead, they need to stand up.\n\nUltimately, our goal should be to end the current female checklist.\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

justice and are part of an agreement reached with Mueller's team to \"move forward,\" according to the source.\n\nBut there are other issues that have not been resolved, including answering questions about obstruction and whether the President will sit down for an interview with special counsel.\n\nAs CNN previously reported , Trump was meeting with lawyers about the questions before the midterms

return to Washington after the midterms, a group of former Capitol Hill staffers is calling for the passage of long-stalled sexual harassment legislation before the current session of Congress ends and warning that \"time is running out\" to enact reform.\n\nIn a letter sent to House and Senate leaders, the former staffers write, \"we have been encouraged by reports of progress and positive discussion. Unfortunately, time is running out to make these improvements a reality. As the lame duck session begins, many critical and time-sensitive issues will be competing for Congress' attention. We implore you to continue making this one your focus.\"\n\nLawmakers are coming back to Washington to a busy few weeks, including an upcoming showdown over spending and funding for President Donald Trump's promise of a US-Mexico border wall that could trigger a partial government shutdown.\n\nBut the letter shines a spotlight on the fact that lawmakers have yet to reach a final agreement to overhaul the process for how sexual harassment claims are made and handled on Capitol Hill after the House and Senate passed their own versions of bills addressing the issue earlier this year.\n\nIt has been more than a year since the #MeToo movement focused national attention on the issue of sexual harassment and misconduct. Over the past year, Congress has grappled with #MeToo moments of its own as a number of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were forced to resign after women came forward with misconduct allegations

(CNN Business) When Amazon arrives in the northern Virginia suburb of Crystal City, eventually bringing 25,000 jobs as part of its vaunted headquarters expansion, the tech behemoth will quickly become one of the region's biggest employers.\n\nIt will be as big as the Pentagon, where about 26,000 people work. It would almost match the District of Columbia's local government payroll. It would be more than double the staff of the House and the Senate combined.\n\nAnd finding all those people? That's going to be a challenge.\n\nThe DC-area unemployment rate is 3.3%, well below the national average \u2014 but that likely masks the even lower availability of the types of professionals Amazon will be looking for.\n\nThe Seattle-based behemoth announced Tuesday that it will expand to both Crystal City and the New York neighborhood of Long Island City , splitting the 50,000 jobs it had originally said would go to a single second headquarters.\n\nIn its request for proposals from prospective host cities, Amazon said that the positions at its new headquarters will include executives and managers, software development engineers, lawyers, accountants, and administrators. Tuesday's announcement said they will have an average salary of at least $150,000 a year.\n\nWhile Amazon will certainly recruit from outside the area, people who already live in the Washington area would be easy targets, especially since the company will simultaneously be trying to recruit 25,000 people for its other new headquarters location in New York.\n\n\"It's a name that you want to work for. It's a name that everybody knows,\" says Chris Vennitti, president of the Reston, Virginia-based recruiting and staffing firm HireStrategy. \"This area has never seen anything on the size and scale of an Amazon coming to our area and pulling from other companies.\"\n\nEmployers are already under pressure to attract and retain talent given the booming economy in the area.\n\nThe consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, for example, has hired 780 net new people over just the past quarter. In its recruiting materials, it emphasizes how its employees make an impact, collaborate with diverse colleagues, and stay on the leading edge of technology \u2014 all things that young workers say they care about. In 2016, Booz's DC office opened an \" Innovation Center \" to host teams that work on projects including cybersecurity, data analytics, and healthcare IT.\n\n\"We are very much holding our own in the current environment and expect that will continue,\" says Betty Thompson, Booz Allen's senior vice president for people services. \"We are not afraid of the competition.\"\n\nAlthough not as flashy as Silicon Valley or Seattle, Northern Virginia has a long lineage of technology entrepreneurship, thanks in part to research performed at places like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, widely known by its acronym DARPA, as well as access to institutional clients like trade associations and government agencies.\n\nAmerica Online spent its formative years in an office park in what would become Tysons Corner, about halfway between downtown Washington and Dulles Airport in northern Virginia. Nextel, a wireless service provider that later merged with sprint, was born in Reston, a planned community near Dulles.\n\nIn an Instagram post about the Amazon news, AOL founder Steve Case said it was \"fitting\" that Northern Virginia will host the tech giant's new headquarters because of the region's role in advancing the growth of the internet. \"It has been great to see how the tech sector has evolved in VA over the past 35 years,\" he said.\n\nIn recent years, the region has tried to foster a buzzier tech scene, and now boasts successful home-grown companies like the educational technology provider EverFi as well as startup accelerators like the cybersecurity-focused Mach37 , which is funded by the state of Virginia.\n\nThat effort has been plagued by high-profile failures like LivingSocial, the daily deals company that expanded and contracted like a supernova before being bought by Groupon in 2016, and attrition by companies that have left to chase venture capital in San Francisco, Boston, and New York.\n\nWashington's population growth among people aged 20 to 34 has slowed in recent years, according to Census estimates. Northern Virginia Technology Council president Bobbie Kilberg says that despite the area's hot job market, young workers have been repelled by the rising cost of housing and transportation.\n\nShe hopes that Amazon will give them a better reason to come and settle. Even though Amazon's DC office will focus heavily on government, the company's overall profile is consumer-facing and omni-present.\n\n\"I think that Amazon will provide them with something exciting that they find very attractive,\" Kilberg says. \"So I think people will start reversing the out-migration and make it an in-migration.\"\n\nBig government consultants and contractors have also found that their best weapon in broadening the pipeline of candidates is cooperation. Northern Virginia's tech companies are working collectively to align local educational institutions' curricula with the skills needs of large employers, and to promote careers in computer science and engineering. They've also started accepting candidates with more specific vocational degrees, rather than full four-year bachelors' degrees, and have expanded their apprenticeship programs.\n\nOne of the leaders on that front has been Amazon itself: The company's cloud services division, which already has a large public sector office based in the Northern Virginia suburb of Herndon, has been one of the most active in employing apprentices after putting them through an intensive 6-month training program.\n\n\"They get that it has to be an industry-wide solution,\" says Steve Partridge, vice president of workforce development at Northern Virginia Community College. \"It can't be that one company implements something and sucks up all the talent.\"\n\nEven younger companies, which don't have the bandwidth to create training programs or the name recognition to woo people from hotter tech hubs, think Amazon might help with recruiting. Moving to a place with a large employer in your field lowers the risk of taking a job in a new city. If it doesn't work out, you can always walk across the street.\n\nKestrel Linder is the founder and CEO of GiveCampus, a DC-based startup that sells alumni fundraising software to universities. He has 24 employees and plans to scale up to 100 over the next year, and thinks Amazon coming to the region would make that task a lot easier.\n\n\"If you're a sought-after tech worker, when you think about moving to DC, as excited as you might be about working for the tech company that's offering you in a position, at the same time you wonder, 'What about 5 years from now, what's going to be there?'\" Linder says. \"It would really change what I've been referring to as the opportunity profile of Washington DC.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hynes, the establishment's owner, said he knows how he'll come to a decision.\n\n\"With what Borderline is to ... my community, I don't know if (reopening) is going to feel right. But once I stand inside that building, it's going to be like going to my childhood home, and I'll know. I'll know then,\" he told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"There's no way I'm not going to reopen out of fear or anything like that. If it works, we will definitely reopen, but right now ... with the fires going on in our same community ...

CNN has learned that Unmathallegadoo is the ex-husband of the victim.\n\nSana Muhammad -- previously named by police as Devi Unmathallegadoo -- was eight months pregnant with her baby, who was narrowly missed by the crossbow and was delivered safely in hospital.\n\nThe victim's husband, Imtiaz Muhammad, told the Evening Standard newspaper that the alleged killer had been hiding in the family's garden shed, before attacking her in front of her five other children.\n\nHe told the newspaper: \"I can't help thinking she took my arrow. Maybe it should have hit me. The kids were all there, it was horrific.\"\n\nRead More", "You've probably heard the business case for diversity . Advocates say this kind of progress doesn't only benefit the employees, it also benefits the employer's bottom line.\n\nBut how a company defines \"diversity\" is equally important.\n\nWhen some boards claim they have a diverse membership, they refer instead to a \" diversity of knowledge, skills and experiences \" \u2014 not necessarily a diversity of identities, according to Marta Geletkanycz, associate professor of strategic management at Boston College.\n\nResearch shows that when we water down the definition of diversity \u2014 moving beyond demographic differences, like identity and background, to instead prioritize experiential differences like job or title or work experience \u2014 we're not making progress on diversity.\n\n\"We've redefined diversity, and when we redefine diversity to include anything, well then, this is what's contributing to racial, ethnic gender diversity slowing down,\" she says.\n\nThis problem has felt all the more urgent in recent months. Even as California introduced legislation mandating at least one woman on every public company board, overall board diversity has made little progress. According to some studies , women of color have lost board seats across the Fortune 500. Over the last decade, the number of minority board directors has also declined.\n\nBut these other definitions of diversity are important, too, according to Cynthia E. Clark, professor of management at Bentley College. A board on which everyone thinks the same is not an effective board, she says.\n\n\"Cognitive diversity\" or \"diversity of thought\" is about differences in how people think and solve problems. A group of people with cognitive diversity may be made up of an accountant, a designer, an engineer and people from other disciplines.\n\n\"We're not ever going to say cognitive diversity doesn't matter,\" Clark says. \"On a board, it matters. We want people to say, 'I don't share that view. I want people to do X.'\"\n\nBut by putting too much weight on this broader definition of diversity, firms often drop the other aspects of diversity that are too often neglected.\n\nFocusing on this definition of diversity overlooks centuries of institutionally sanctioned oppression and discrimination, forces that kept minority groups from ever breaking into the boardroom, says Isaac Sabat, assistant professor of psychology at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"I think a lot of it comes down to this big question of 'What identities should we care about when it comes to diversity and inclusion?'\" he says.\n\nBut when organizations refuse to tackle this question, that means they also miss out on the benefits of a truly diverse membership, Geletkanycz says.\n\nThe solution: consider both of these definitions of diversity \u2014 the broader definition and the more specific, identity-based definition. Often, one feeds the other.\n\n\"I think that if you're focusing on knowledge, skills and experience, you could much more easily hire a board that's 12 white men,\" Clark says. \"That's not to say that board would be sub-optimally functioning. It could be a really good board, but it's not visibly diverse, and that's really important.\"\n\nCompanies need to be aware of the signal these choices send to people from underrepresented groups, Sabat cautions. A board of 12 white men may be diverse in some ways, like in how they think about work or approach problems. But on paper, it's likely still not representative of society at large.\n\n\"They haven't achieved diversity,\" he says. \"They've just achieved these differences in thought, and it's a homogenous group. It does a disservice to other people who have these minoritized identities.\"", "Washington (CNN) As the US Supreme Court rejected a series of death penalty appeals from Florida on Tuesday, key justices laid bare the enduring divisions over the fairness and effectiveness of the ultimate punishment.\n\n\"The flaws in the current practice of capital punishment,\" Justice Stephen Breyer, wrote, \"could often cast serious doubt on the death sentences imposed in these (Florida) and other capital cases.\"\n\n\"Rather than attempting to address the flaws in piecemeal fashion ... it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the problem -- the constitutionality of the death penalty itself,\" Breyer, a Bill Clinton appointee, added.\n\nBreyer, as he has done before, complained about inmates lingering on death row for decades.\n\nTo which Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the most vocal supporters of the death penalty, said capital sentences are taking too long to be carried out.\n\n\"That is reason to carry out the death penalty sooner, not to decline to impose it,\" the conservative Thomas wrote.\n\nHe opened his statement with grisly details of a 1998 murder of a father, mother and daughter committed by one of the men who was appealing his sentence.\n\n\"It is no mystery why it often takes decades to execute a convicted murderer,\" Thomas added, adopting some lines of his late fellow conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. \"'The labyrinthine restrictions on capital punishment promulgated by this court' have caused the delays that Justice Breyer now bemoans. As 'the Drum Major in this parade of new precedents,' Justice Breyer is not well positioned to complain about their inevitable consequences.\"\n\nThomas' evident sarcasm and the larger clash with Breyer reveal age-old differences between justices at two ends of the ideological spectrum over capital punishment. Despite objections from individual liberals over the years, a court majority has not wavered in its view of the constitutionality of the system that the Supreme Court reinstated in 1976.\n\nThe death penalty does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, the justices ruled 42 years ago, as long as safeguards exist for individual consideration of the offender and the crime.\n\nFuture of death penalty\n\nIn Tuesday's dispute, most justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and newest Justice Brett Kavanaugh, wrote nothing. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the only one of the nine who went beyond philosophical grievances and asserted that the court should take up the individual claims of the Florida men.\n\nIn the end, while the three justices' views, passionately laid out over a total 16 pages, are unlikely to change the majority sentiment, they call attention to the difficult legal issues still in the backdrop even as the number of death sentences has plummeted nationwide.\n\nDeath sentences and executions have declined in the last two decades -- from 295 sentences in 1998 to 39 last year -- according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Yet certain parts of the country, notably the south and southwest, continue to keep large death rows and carry out executions. Texas executed seven convicts in 2017 and Florida, the site of Tuesday's cases, executed three in 2017, according to the center. Hundreds of defendants remain on death rows nationwide.\n\nThe Florida case tested the retroactive effect of a 2016 Supreme Court ruling that found the state's death penalty procedure unconstitutional because it required a judge, rather than a jury, to determine the \"aggravating circumstances\" that warranted a death sentence, rather than life behind bars.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court had applied the decision, Hurst v. Florida, to past convicts but only back to 2002, based on separate court precedent.\n\nScores of capital defendants who have been denied the benefit of the 2016 ruling have petitioned the Supreme Court, and the justices have declined to hear their cases, as happened on Tuesday.\n\nBreyer went along with the majority's decision not to take up the cases on this round, but he used the occasion to highlight his worries about \"unconscionably long delays that capital defendants must endure as they await execution,\" as well as concerns about when rulings that favor defendants apply to past cases and the roles of jury and judge in the decision to sentence a convict to death.\n\nAs Thomas responded, he stressed that the death penalty does not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. \"The only thing 'cruel and unusual' in this case was petitioner's brutal murder of three innocent victims,\" he wrote in Reynolds v. Florida.\n\nSotomayor acknowledged the \"gruesome crimes\" and suffering of families but said the seven cases before the justices raised important constitutional questions about the limited role jurors had in the Florida defendants' fates.\n\n\"The consequences of error in these cases is too severe,\" she wrote, to leave their \"challenges unanswered.\" She dissented alone.", "Washington (CNN) Hate crime incidents reported to the FBI increased by about 17% last year compared to 2016, according to statistics released Tuesday by the FBI.\n\nThe statistics, which were released in the bureau's annual \" Hate Crime Statistics \" report, are a compilation of bias-motivated incidents submitted to the FBI by 16,149 law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe report found that 7,175 hate crimes were reported by law enforcement agencies in 2017, up from 6,121 reported incidents in 2016. While the number has increased, the number of agencies reporting also increased by about 1,000.\n\nOf the 7,106 single-bias hate crimes reported, 59.6% of victims were targeted because of the offenders' race/ethnicity/ancestry bias; 20.6% were targeted because of sexual-orientation bias; 1.9% were targeted because of gender identity bias; and 0.6% were targeted because of gender bias. Sixty-nine multiple bias hate crime incidents were also reported.\n\nNotably, of the 1,679 religious bias crimes reported in 2017, 58.1% were anti-Jewish while 18.6% were anti-Muslim.\n\nRead More", "(CNN) When Democrats take control of the House in early 2019, one of the first things they are likely to go after is President Donald Trump's tax returns.\n\nRep. Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, who is expected to take over as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has already signaled that he plans to ask Trump to voluntarily hand over the returns (ha!) and, if the President doesn't comply, to formally request that the Treasury Department release Trump's returns to a small-ish group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I assume that there would be some sort of a court case, but we'd have to wait and see,\" Neal told The Washington Post earlier this month\n\nIn case you've forgotten: Trump is the first president in the modern era to refuse to release any of his tax returns. Prior to his election, he was the first major party presidential candidate not to release his returns. There is no law that demands that presidents release their returns, of course, but past presidents have done so out of a desire to be transparent with the voting public about their financial status and ties.\n\nTrump has repeatedly rejected the idea that he release any of his returns, insisting that there's nothing in them that is particularly revelatory and noting that his taxes are under audit and, therefore, it's inadvisable for him to release them. He trotted out those same lines during his post-election news conference last Wednesday.\n\nHere's his full answer on his returns:\n\n\"Well, look, as I've told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them.\n\n\"They're done by -- among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms, the accountants are a very, very large, powerful firm from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A -- a great law firm, or you would -- you know it very well. They do these things. They put them in.\n\n\"But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed.\n\n\"And they saw the -- you know, the detail. You get far more from that. And I guess we filed that, now, three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.\n\n\"But when you're under audit -- and I'm on a very continuous audit because there are so many companies -- and it is a very big company, far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a -- it's a great company.\n\n\"But it's big, and it's complex and it's probably feet-high. It's a very complex instrument. And I think that people wouldn't understand it.\n\n\"But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit.\n\n\"And -- and really no lawyer -- even from the other side they say, often, not always -- but when you're under audit, you don't have -- you don't subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.\n\n\"So when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it.\"\n\nRiiiiiiiiiight.\n\nSo, the reason Trump isn't releasing his returns is because a) he's under \"a very continuous audit because there are so many companies\" and b) \"They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them.\"\n\nWhich, like ... what?\n\nThe truth of this is that Trump's explanations -- if that's what we're calling them -- are sort of secondary here.\n\nThe real issue here is a 1924 provision in the Internal Revenue Service tax code that allows the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and the chair of the Senate Finance Committee can ask for anyone's tax returns -- including the president's! -- from the Internal Revenue Service -- as long as they can demonstrate that the returns are necessary for an ongoing investigation.\n\nThat clause, according to this great piece by CNN's Jeanne Sahadi , could well lead to the eventual public disclosure of Trump's returns:\n\n\"The chairmen of the tax-writing committees -- whether they act together or alone -- don't need to disclose that they've requested the president's returns. But they may choose to -- and likely would -- share the returns with their committee members in closed session.\n\n\"If the committee thinks releasing the returns to the House or Senate would further a legitimate committee purpose, they're permitted to do so, according to George Yin, a former chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation and a professor of law at the University of Virginia.\n\n\"At that point it's up to the full chamber to decide whether to make the returns public. 'Of course, as a practical matter, it's a little hard to imagine information going to the full House or Senate and not becoming public,' Yin said.\"\n\nGiven that potential sequence of events, you can see why Trump -- who has been adamant in his refusal to release his returns -- would move to block the Treasury Department/IRS from releasing any of his returns to Neal. The legal challenge from the White House would likely center on whether or not Neal is conducting a legitimate investigation in which the returns are a critical piece or whether it's simply part of a broader Democratic effort to embarrass Trump in advance of the 2020 election.\n\nWhat seems certain now: House Democrats will make a move to see Trump's taxes. Trump, who, I believe, thinks the release of the returns could do him real political harm, will fight like hell to keep them from doing so.\n\nWho wins? No clue. But there's no question that we are closer to seeing Trump's tax returns today than we have been at any point since he began to run for president in 2015.", "Washington (CNN) American and Chinese negotiators have revived trade talks in the hopes of reaching a draft agreement before President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping meet face-to-face on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in Argentina.\n\nChinese negotiators will arrive in Washington \"shortly\" with the aim of ironing out an informal deal, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Tuesday at a panel event in Washington, though he did not specify an exact time frame for a meeting.\n\nTrade will be one of the issues up for discussion when the delegation arrives, a Treasury spokesperson told CNN.\n\nThe fresh momentum comes after months of widening stalemate between the world's two largest economies over trade, a key issue for Trump.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said later Tuesday morning on CNBC that the restart of talks is \"a good thing.\"\n\nTrump was scheduled to meet with members of his trade team on Tuesday to discuss a separate issue: auto tariffs. The US government is weighing whether to impose tariffs on Japanese and European SUVs, vans and auto parts, ostensibly to protect national security interests. It's unlikely a decision is imminent, according to a US official.\n\nThat issue is separate from the Chinese tariff talks.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke by phone on Friday, a spokesperson for the agency confirmed Tuesday, an effort to restart trade discussions ahead of the two leaders meeting, which Trump has boasted would be a \"good meeting.\" The call was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSo far, Chinese government officials have declined to comment directly on the reported call between Mnuchin and Liu, but have acknowledged recent communications following a phone conversation earlier this month between Trump and Xi.\n\n\"The two countries' economic teams are in touch to implement the consensus reached by the two leaders,\" Chinese Assistant Commerce Minister Li Chenggang said at a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. \"We hope to achieve positive results with efforts from both sides.\"\n\nRoss was slightly more equivocal Tuesday in his comments at the Yahoo! Finance's America Financial Future summit. When asked if the two sides were in the final innings of their negotiations, Ross replied, \"We are where we are.\"\n\nHe also addressed rumors that the President is considering replacing him with the head of the Small Business Administration Linda McMahon. \"I'll serve as long as the President wants, and I have no indication to the contrary,\" he said.\n\nThe United States is demanding that China come up with a clear offer before negotiations on a trade deal can start, but Beijing wants to talk first and then make a firm proposal later, according to the WSJ's report, citing people familiar with discussions.\n\nBoth sides have been working toward a path to end the trade war, which has left investors jittery over the lasting effects on American consumers and corporations.\n\nPresident and CEO of the Business Roundtable Joshua Bolten speaking at the same Yahoo summit said the Trump administration had made \"mistakes\" in its strategy with China by slapping rounds of tariffs as the opening gambit.\n\n\"It would have been much more productive to hold those threats [of tariffs] and sit down and try to have some constructive negotiations with the Chinese,\" said Bolten, who previously served as President George W. Bush's chief of staff and budget director. \"This is not a country that's going to be easily bullied.\"\n\nTop Trump administration officials have sent conflicting signals in recent weeks.\n\nMnuchin on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund meeting in Bali, Indonesia, last month dismissed the idea the US had set any pre-conditions for the leaders' meeting, leaving the decision in the hands of the President. \"To the extent we can make progress toward a meeting, I would encourage that and that is something we are having discussions about,\" he said.\n\nShortly thereafter, Kudlow warned of the differences between the two sides when he said last month, \"China has not responded positively to any of our asks.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has been divided between free traders \u2014 including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Mnuchin and Kudlow \u2014 and hardliners like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nJust last week Navarro took a shot at Wall Street, warning \"globalist elites\" against meddling with the Trump administration's policy on China. \"If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald J. Trump's terms -- not Wall Street terms,\" Navarro said during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn Tuesday, Kudlow said Navarro, a former economics professor, \"misspoke\" and \"wasn't authorized\" to speak on the matter.\n\nIn New York, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson offered a dim view on rising tensions between the two countries, calling on China to \"do no harm\" and the US to \"dial down the rhetoric\" in a sweeping speech at the Asia Society.\n\n\"The US-China strategic interaction is by far the most consequential in the world,\" said Paulson. \"I am very sobered by the trajectory we are on.\"\n\nHe called on US leaders to work with like-minded partners to reach a multi-party investment agreement with China by jointly withholding access to the US, European Union and Japanese markets, to test Beijing's willingness to open up its markets.\n\nThe United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese products ranging from food seasonings and baseball gloves to network routers and industrial machinery parts. China's retaliatory tariffs have hit thousands of US exports including meat, alcoholic drinks, chemicals, clothes, machinery, furniture and auto parts.\n\nAnd doubts remain over whether the two economic superpowers can reach a deal anytime soon.\n\n\"The issue with China is not just tariffs,\" said Ross at the Yahoo! panel. \"If it was just tariffs, I think we could work it out very, very, very quickly.\"\n\n\"The real issue is intellectual property rights, forced technology transfers, industrial espionage, that kind of thing. We can't tolerate abuses of that sort,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has already slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase to 25% from 10% on January 1, which would further escalate the conflict.\n\nChina has so far retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase at the start of January.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to take an aggressive stance against China for what he says are unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. He's threatened to escalate the trade war further by imposing tariffs on all the remaining goods that China sells to the United States.\n\nMany American manufacturers, farmers and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they appreciate the administration's efforts to change China's trade policies. But some argue the tariffs aren't the best way to address the problems. They pose a dilemma for US importers who must decide whether to absorb the higher cost of the goods or pass it on to consumers, and some exporters are hurting from China's retaliatory tariffs.", "London (CNN) Wet wipes marketed as \"flushable\" are to blame for 80% of blockages in Britain's sewers, a BBC investigation found.\n\nInsiders interviewed by the broadcaster said the flushable versions of the moist cloths -- which are used for everything from toilet training to household cleaning -- are responsible for the extensive blockages, which cost millions of pounds to rectify.\n\nAn investigation by BBC Radio 4's \"Costing the Earth\" described the ongoing problem as an \"environmental menace.\" In the radio program, host Tom Heap went out with the teams responsible for unblocking drains -- and found that the culprits are usually wet wipes.\n\nWhile flushable wet wipes will disappear around the U-bend of the toilet, most then go on to join up with \"fatbergs\" that have to be broken down -- ultimately leading to the recovered wipes being disposed of in landfills.\n\n\"Despite what the label says, these wipes definitely shouldn't be flushed down the toilet,\" Natalie Fee, founder of campaign organization City to Sea, told the BBC.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) 17 cities in North America didn't land prizes in the Amazon sweepstakes, but they laid the groundwork to become tech hubs for years to come.\n\nFor Austin, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Denver, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Montgomery County, Maryland, Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Toronto, and Washington, D.C., the year-long battle for Amazon ( AMZN ) allowed them to promote their cities and opened up new development opportunities.\n\nThe search, which was narrowed from 238 bids down to 20 finalists and ended Tuesday with New York City and Northern Virginia splitting Amazon's second headquarters , helped many cities remake their images.\n\n\"Just being in the top 20 has put the spotlight on the city and has made people pay attention that we're not just a sunny, low-tax city,\" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said in an interview. \"We're a city full of innovators.\"\n\n\"Some people still had an outdated perception of Pittsburgh as a Midwestern, industrial town,\" said Pittsburgh Regional Alliance President David Ruppersberger. \"Being in the top 20 for Amazon's HQ2 has likely caused some of these individuals to give Pittsburgh a second look.\"\n\nThe losing cities can now look to Nashville, which got the consolation reward on Tuesday, to start preparing for Amazon's next project.

Marathon talks this week had stretched late into the night.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman said the Cabinet would meet at 2 p.m. Wednesday to \"consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps. Cabinet ministers have been invited to read documentation ahead of that meeting.\"\n\nKey ministers were seen entering the Prime Minister's office to be briefed one by one on the text, believed to run over hundreds of pages.\n\nIt was a significant moment for May, whose rocky premiership hangs on reaching a Brexit deal. She had hoped to strike a draft agreement by this week to have any chance of getting the deal through the required ratification processes by the time Britain leaves the EU at the end of March.\n\nRead

Hyde-Smith later issued a statement saying that she \"used an exaggerated expression of regard [for a supporter], and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\"\n\nKoritha Mitchell\n\nBut her remark underscored a simple truth that many Americans prefer to ignore: Lynching and politics are inextricably linked. Lynching literally shaped the political landscape Americans have inherited; our politics today are in part defined by the belief that white people should have the right to hold themselves and each other to incredibly low standards -- that they shouldn't have to be decent toward people who aren't white.\n\nWhen white people have not actively worked to create a society fueled by fair play and equal opportunity, they have often ignored the political repression that mobs bent on extra-judicial \"justice\" achieved -- and the benefits, like power and economic success, they themselves have reaped as a result. Only a person whose ancestors or family members bore no risk of being lynched themselves would dismiss as \"ridiculous\" objections to making hanging into a public political joke in Mississippi.\n\nHyde-Smith's remarks and her defensiveness are indicative of the flawed but common arguments made by some white Americans that they bear no responsibility for structural racism and -- as argued even recently by the President -- that pointing out instances of racism is itself \"racist.\" We need the majority of white people to stop being content with the fact that there's no literal blood on their hands. We need them to hold themselves to a higher standard.\n\nJUST WATCHED Espy calls public hanging comments 'harmful' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Espy calls public hanging comments 'harmful' 01:30\n\nMany Americans underestimate lynching's political role because they focus on \"strange fruit,\" the image of black bodies dangling from trees during the Jim Crow era, and think of those who left those bodies as bygone extremists. However, there was a social and political purpose for producing visual evidence of black people's vulnerability: to make them accept their \"proper,\" subordinate place in society. \"Strange fruit\" was also evidence of white people's freedom -- to exercise power, to be citizens, to kill. Even those who did not take their freedom to that extreme were assured of it. If all they did was insult a black person or exclude them from opportunity, they could by comparison see themselves as liberal and tolerant.", "Valerie Jarrett is a lawyer and politician who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.

That person is Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAs a senior adviser to President Barack Obama for eight years, I saw Pelosi lead in some of the most climactic negotiations and showdowns with the administration and Congress.

It also boasted strong sales and lifted its outlook for the year.\n\nHome Depot seems to be benefiting from a nesting phenomenon -- Americans are willing to spend on home improvements even if they are not looking to sell.\n\nCEO Craig Menear said in a press release that both professional builders and do-it-yourself customers were spending more.\n\nSales at Home Depot ( HD ) grew more than 5% in the quarter despite new and existing home sales falling in September in the wake of higher mortgage rates.\n\nThe growth \"is a testament to the overall strength of demand in the home improvement market,\" Menear said.\n\nTo that end, executive vice president of merchandising Ted Decker said during a call with analysts that sales of big ticket items that cost more than $1,000, such as vinyl flooring, appliances, and windows, were up more than 9% in the quarter. Big ticket purchases account for about 20% of overall Home Depot sales.\n\nConsumers are still spending on home improvements\n\nOne analyst called it a particularly encouraging sign for the economy. Even if people may not be looking to buy new homes, they are still confident enough to spend more to fix up their existing house.\n\n\"Consumers are not in scrimping mode like they were in 2008,\" said Bob Phibbs, CEO of New York-based consultancy the Retail Doctor . \"They are treating themselves to higher quality products, especially if they think they are going to be in that home for awhile.\"\n\nThe threat of more US tariffs on foreign-made washing machines and other appliances may not have that much of an impact on Home Depot either.\n\nMenear said during the conference call that current tariffs affect about 1% of total US purchases at Home Depot. Even if a 25% tariff winds up going into effect early next year, Menear said that would hit just 3.5% of purchases.\n\nDecker added that any impact from higher tariffs were \"more than manageable,\" noting that Home Depot has already dealt with higher costs because of steel tariffs.\n\nHome Depot also appears to be taking advantage of continued turmoil at its top rivals. Lowe's ( LOW ), which will report its latest results next week, recently announced it would close 47 stores.\n\nLowe's is trying to get back on track with new CEO Marvin Ellison, formerly the head of JCPenney ( JCP ). Lowe's sales are only expected to increase by about 3.5% in the third quarter.\n\nJCPenney, which is trying to make a bigger push into the appliance market, continues to struggle, too. And the bankruptcy of Sears ( SHLDQ ), another major seller of appliances, could be helping Home Depot as well.\n\nTake that Amazon? Home Depot posting impressive digital growth\n\nOn the digital front, it looks like Home Depot is more than holding its own against Amazon ( AMZN ), Walmart ( WMT ) and Best Buy ( BBY ).\n\nMenear said digital revenues were up about 28% from a year ago.\n\nBut all this good news wasn't enough to lift Home Depot's stock. Shares of Home Depot were lower in late morning trading as investors remained nervous about rising interest rates eventually hurting retailers.\n\nMenear brushed aside those worries though.\n\n\"Even in the downturn of 2008, which was obviously the most difficult since the [Great] Depression, customers were willing to spend for new innovative products,\" he told analysts.", "Washington (CNN Business) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won't take office until January, but the progressive firebrand is already casting herself as the voice of the people in the debate over Amazon's arrival in New York, even as fellow Democrats rushed to welcome the company.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company,\" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter late Monday. \"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\"\n\nWe've been getting calls and outreach from Queens residents all day about this.\n\n\n\nThe community's response?

All adults, including pregnant women, should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use by their primary care physicians, the United States Preventive Services Task Force advises. For those patients who drink above the recommended limits, doctors should provide brief counseling to help them reduce their drinking, according to the new task force statement published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nAs far as teens, the independent panel of medical experts came up empty. The task force said it did not find enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against alcohol screening and counseling for those under the age of 18. The panel is calling for more research.\n\nUnhealthy alcohol use means drinking beyond the recommended limits. No more than four drinks in a single day and 14 drinks in a week is the line drawn for men age 21 to 64, according to National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism . For women and older men, the institute advises no more than three drinks in one day and no more than seven drinks in a week. There is no safe level of alcohol for pregnant women, according to the institute.\n\nThe negative consequences of too much alcohol include illness, injury, and death -- unhealthy alcohol use ranks as the third leading preventable cause of death in the US according to the task force. When pregnant women drink, birth defects and developmental problems in their children may follow.\n\nToo many doctors don't speak up about alcohol\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) The likely incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is warning acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker from interfering in the Mueller investigation and called on him to recuse himself from overseeing the probe.\n\n\"The president and Whitaker should heed this warning: The new Democratic majority will protect the special counsel and the integrity of the Justice Department,\" California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff wrote in an op-ed published by The Washington Post on Monday. \"Should Whitaker fail to recuse himself \u2014 all indications are that he plans not to \u2014 and seek to obstruct the investigation, serve as a back channel to the president or his legal team or interfere in the investigations in any way, he will be called to answer. His actions will be exposed.\"\n\nSchiff said Whitaker's recent appointment places the Mueller investigation in \"imminent danger.\"\n\nWhitaker assumed the role of acting attorney general after Trump fired Jeff Sessions last week, and he is expected to take charge of the Russia investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The new acting attorney general has given no indication he believes he needs to step aside from ultimately overseeing the probe, one person familiar with his thinking told CNN last week\n\nIn the op-ed, Schiff echoed other Democrats ' criticism of Trump for bypassing normal succession in \"handpicking\" Whitaker, citing the acting attorney general's deep skepticism of the probe.\n\n\"If he does not recuse himself, Whitaker could seek access to the special counsel's plans and evidence, including grand jury testimony, and would be in a position not just to funnel information to Trump and his legal defense team but also to abuse his authority to cripple or end the investigation,\" Schiff wrote. \"Whitaker could attempt to prevent evidence from reaching Congress and the public or stop the special counsel from subpoenaing important testimony, including from Trump himself.\"\n\nSchiff called for Congress to ensure that whoever oversees that probe should \"publicly pledge to protect the integrity of the special counsel.\"\n\n\"Trump, and those who would abet him in undermining the independence of the Justice Department, should understand this: The truth will come out.\"", "A

Vivendi owns 24% of the shares.\n\nElliott has scored a series of victories, including the ouster of Genish and board members backed by Vivendi ( VIVEF ). Yet shares in Telecom Italia have plunged by over 30% since March, suggesting investors are skeptical.\n\nThe hedge fund has claimed there is a \"clear and overwhelming case for change\" at the telecoms group.\n\nIt argued in a letter to shareholders in March that Vivendi, which is controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollor\u00e9, had harmed smaller investors by exercising \"disproportionate control\" over Telecom Italia.\n\nElliott said the Italian company should spin off or sell part of its phone network business to reduce its debt levels and capitalize on a push into broadband. Telecom Italia has agreed to separate the network but wants to keep full ownership.\n\nThe hedge fund also wants Telecom Italia to sell part of its submarine cables business, and resume dividend payments.\n\nTelecom Italia has 32 million mobile users, and its traditional phone network is among the strongest in Europe. Including operations in Brazil, its sales reached \u20ac14.7 billion ($16.6 billion) in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nThere are signs that the spat could get worse before it gets better.\n\nVivendi and Elliott traded barbs on Tuesday following the announcement that Genish would depart as CEO.\n\n\"Genish had the opportunity to create value; we supported him. In actuality, he did precisely nothing and instead proved to be an impediment to value creation,\" an Elliott spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nRepresentatives for Vivendi did not respond to questions from CNN Business on Tuesday, but a spokesman told Reuters : \"We decry, we condemn the destabilization behind this decision and the disgraceful methods. We reserve all our rights to defend all shareholders interests.\"\n\nThe board of Telecom Italia, where Elliott now has more loyalists than Vivendi, will meet on November 18 to select a replacement for Genish.", "Rahila Gupta is a freelance journalist and writer.

The rumor mill is working overtime because peace in Pakistan depends on the whereabouts of the Christian woman, acquitted of blasphemy charges after nine years in prison.\n\nNews of her acquittal on October 31 was met with the shutdown of major roads in cities such as Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, where cars were burnt and smashed by mobs organized by the Tehreek e Labbaik party (TLP), an extremist religious party.\n\nEven the news of her release from prison was greeted by a baying mob of thousands of men who waved banners demanding that she be hanged -- a terrifying and visceral picture of the patriarchy in action.\n\nDespite being declared innocent by the courts, it is Asia who is on the run like a criminal and needs to leave the country before the mobs track her down.\n\nEven her lawyer, Saiful Malook, had to uproot his life and family and seek asylum in the Netherlands. Other less well-known members of her legal team like Muhammad Aman Ullah, who has stayed behind in Pakistan, is fearful for his life.\n\nHow did this happen in a so-called democracy like Pakistan? Ever since the military dictator Zia ul Haq began the Islamisation process of Pakistan in the 1980s, religious leaders have acquired unprecedented power. Saiful Malook, who I interviewed in late 2017 while he was preparing Asia's case, lays the blame firmly on Zia ul Haq.\n\n\"He made them ministers, gave them cars, built them bungalows, got them involved in government. Before that the religious leaders were quite weak, now they are stakeholders in government and in corruption.\"\n\nIt was Zia ul Haq who revived the dormant British law on blasphemy by increasing the maximum penalty from 10 years to death. Yet the irony is that to date no one has been executed by the state on the charge of blasphemy, but many have been killed by the mob -- one estimate is 75.\n\nIt is also this mob rule that prevents the quick dispatch of blasphemy cases in the lower courts, even when the evidence provided is as flimsy as a flight of fantasy.\n\nJUST WATCHED Pakistani Christian on death row acquitted Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pakistani Christian on death row acquitted 01:13\n\nThe political strategy of the extremists has been to pack out the courts at every blasphemy hearing so that judges are reduced to nervous wrecks and refuse to take on cases, pleading ill health.\n\nIf they do hear the cases, they simply do not acquit defendants. Lower-court judges are typically less educated and more sympathetic to the religious lobby.\n\nSaiful Malook recounts the story of the judge who sentenced Asia Bibi to death, who has preserved the pen which he used to sign off her judgment as a source of pride.\n\nThe higher up you go in the Pakistani legal system, the more likely you are to get justice because judges further up the hierarchy are paid well and have security provided by the state.\n\nOf course, even this security can turn out to be illusory as Salman Taseer, Governor of Punjab, was to discover when he was killed by his own guard in 2011 for visiting Asia in prison and calling for her to be released.\n\nThe few lawyers who take on these life-threatening cases command huge fees. Many of the blasphemy victims, like Asia, are just too poor to go all the way up to the Supreme Court and languish for years in prison.\n\nBut Asia caught the public imagination and donations poured into her campaign from all over the world. Rights organizations like Amnesty International also stepped in to help fund some of the legal fees.\n\nAlthough the leadership of subsequent governments after Zia has been drawn from the liberal elites whose personal lives have eschewed religion to a greater or lesser degree, all of them, except General Pervez Musharraf, have relied on religious parties for their power. It was a strategy of appeasement and vote garnering.\n\nBenazir Bhutto was the great feminist hope when she succeeded Zia but failed to overturn his Hudood ordinances, which, for example, required women to produce four witnesses to prove rape to avoid charges of adultery. Nawaz Sharif condemned religious violence against minorities but did very little to reverse the sharification of Pakistan.\n\nMusharraf cultivated an image of Enlightened moderation, introduced some women-friendly laws and pushed back against religious forces.\n\nHowever, Afiya Zia, a Pakistani activist and academic, in her new book \"Faith and Feminism in Pakistan\" says his policies were \"more symbolic than transformative\" while the backlash of radical conservatism against women went unchecked.\n\nImran Khan, elected to power recently, and yet to shake off his image as playboy of the Western world, plays a similarly duplicitous game.\n\nHe has valorized the Pakistani Taliban for standing against US imperialism, has aligned with religious-right parties like Jamaat-e-Islami at provincial level, has expressed his support for blasphemy laws, publicly supports the acquittal of Asia Bibi and then behind the scenes, does a deal with TLP accepting its demand for a review petition of the Supreme Court judgment and to keep Asia Bibi in the country.\n\nThe US Commission on International Religious Freedom produces an annual report surveying the state of religious freedoms across the world. Pakistan has appeared regularly as a \"Country of Particular Concern\" and is the only country to be put on a special watch list in its 2018 annual report.\n\nThe religious right has so far not managed to win power at the ballot box, but its ability to rouse a rabble and paralyze the country has given it a disproportionate and vicious grip on what's left of democracy in Pakistan.

Martha McSally, curled up on the couch with her dog, announcing via a video on Twitter that she had conceded the state's Senate race to fellow Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat.\n\n\"I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\" said McSally of Sinema. \"I am convinced Arizona is the best state in the country and our best days are still yet to come.\"\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nIt was a strikingly different tone than President Donald Trump took toward the race in a tweet over the weekend.\n\n\"Just out \u2014 in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!,\" Trump tweeted , despite zero actual evidence of election fraud or even the allegation of the fraud. And a very different approach than that of the Senate Republican campaign arm, which emailed reporters after the election suggesting that election officials in Maricopa County (Phoenix) were trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nAnd the McSally concession came before all the votes were counted. According to CNN figures , Sinema held a 38,000-vote lead (out of more than 2 million cast).\n\nSo why did she do it -- particularly given that the President of the United States seemed convinced that she should have kept fighting?\n\nThe answer is that McSally is playing the long game. Or given the timing, the medium-ish game.\n\nRemember that Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, when accepting Gov. Doug Ducey's appointment to fill the seat of John McCain following the late senator's passing, made very clear that he wasn't planning to stick around the Senate all that long. \"I have committed to serving at least through the second session of the 115th Congress,\" Kyl said\n\n\"I do know I will not seek this seat in 2020, nor any other office in the future.\" Kyl told the Arizona Republic earlier this month that he planned to talk to Ducey about his future plan soon. \"I have family needs, as well, and so, we'll decide what to do at that point,\" said Kyl. \"I'll talk to the governor.\"\n\nAt a minimum then, we know that there will be another open-seat special election in Arizona in 2020. (That race will be for the remaining two years left on McCain's term; he was re-elected in 2016 and the race for the next full 6-year term will be in 2022.) And McSally, with an eye on that race, likely wants to not look like a sore loser or to keep up a nasty fight in a race she is very unlikely to win. Most voters like their election to end somewhere close to the actual vote and with a clean result -- either way. Continuing to charge at the electoral windmill rarely behooves a candidate's long-term political prospects.\n\nBut the truth of the matter is that McSally may not even have to wait that long. Kyl's quotes about his future plans make clear that he was only wiling to pledge to serve until the end of the 115th Congress, which will come to an end shortly. If Kyl resigns his seat in early 2019, it would, again, be up to Ducey, who just got reelected, to appoint a successor to serve until the 2020 special election. McSally is far and away the likeliest pick for Ducey.\n\nAnd it's not hard to imagine that Kyl wanted to wait and see what happened in the 2018 election before making a decision on when he will walk away from the Senate. With McSally losing, Kyl now likely is further incentivized to leave before 2020 so as to give a Republican the best chance to hold the seat.\n\n\"Republican Martha McSally soon could be called Sen. McSally. More than one million Arizona voters wanted to see the former fighter-pilot-turned-southern-Arizona congresswoman in the Senate. Gov. Doug Ducey could grant them their wish. ... Ducey, with one stroke of a pen, could apply some desperately needed salve to the open, gaping wound that is post-election Arizona.\"\n\nSeen through the lens of her future political prospects, McSally's decision not to fight until the last vote makes a whole lot more sense. She's got an even-money (and maybe better) chance at making it to the Senate sometime in 2019. Why even risk jeopardizing that by fighting out a race that she almost certainly can't win?", "New York (CNN Business) General Electric is speeding up a plan to divorce itself from oil-and-gas giant Baker Hughes.\n\nGE ( GE ), which has been racing to repair a bloated balance sheet, announced a complex agreement on Tuesday to unload up to 166 million shares in oilfield services firm Baker Hughes ( BHGE ). The transactions would raise about $4 billion at current prices.\n\nGE had to reach an agreement to escape a lock-up period that prevented the company from exiting the Baker Hughes investment until July 2019.\n\nNew GE CEO Larry Culp, who took over on October 1, is under immense pressure to bolster the company's balance sheet by rapidly selling off businesses. Panicked investors have sent GE stock plunging 50% this year, on track for its worst year since 2008. GE shares closed 8% higher on Tuesday,\n\nCulp vowed on Monday to move with a \"sense of urgency\" to get GE's debt problem under control. \"We do have a lot of leverage,\" Culp told CNBC . \"We have a number of options to bring that leverage down over time.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Culp said the Baker Hughes agreements \"accelerate\" the company's plan to pursue an orderly separation from Baker Hughes. GE has said the process could take several years to complete.\n\nBuying high, selling low\n\nGE accumulated a mountain of debt partly because of a series of poorly timed deals. For instance, GE's 2015 purchase of Alstom's power business turned out to be a disaster, plunging the company deeper into fossil fuels just as renewable energy began stealing market share.\n\nThe Baker Hughes sale may not help GE's reputation for buying high and selling low. Consider that Baker Hughes was trading at around $38 when GE, under former CEO Jeff Immelt, agreed to merge its oil and gas business with the oilfield services company. Today, Baker Hughes is trading at around $24.\n\nJohn Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett, described GE's Baker Hughes agreement as a \"fire sale.\"\n\n\"We believe the move highlights how liquidity issues remain on the front burner for GE,\" Inch wrote to clients on Tuesday, \"despite company and analyst assurances to the contrary.\"\n\nUnder the deal announced on Tuesday, GE and Baker Hughes signed a series of long-term commercial agreements that would have expired with the lockup in 2019. Those agreements include the creation of a joint venture and a deal for Baker Hughes to buy GE's gas turbine technology at current pricing.\n\nThe transactions call for GE to sell up to 101 million shares of Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes has agreed to repurchase about 65 million of its shares from GE.\n\nThese sales are expected to keep GE's stake in Baker Hughes just above 50% for now. The remaining stake will be subject to a 180-day lock-up period that prevents further sales unless the underwriting banks consent.", "London (CNN) Scientists and policy makers from around 60 nations voted unanimously Friday to redefine the kilogram.\n\nThe decision at the General Conference on Weights and Measures in Versailles, France was greeted with great excitement as officials approved the new definition, which is based on the Planck constant -- a physical constant observed in the natural world -- rather than the precise weight of a piece of metal kept under lock and key.\n\n\"The vote is a unanimous one, yes.

It started with 238 cities vying to host Amazon's second headquarters. Then it dropped to 20 finalists . Now, half of HQ2 is landing in my backyard.\n\nAmazon, based in Seattle, has picked two locations for its second headquarters . One is Arlington, Virginia and the other is Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York City. I moved to LIC, as New Yorkers call it, in 2015. Let me tell you about it.\n\nYears ago, Long Island City was a bustling industrial area. Then it went through a rough and desolate phase. Now it's known for high-rise buildings, spectacular views of Manhattan, parks and turf fields and trendy restaurants.\n\nIt makes sense that Long Island City caught Amazon's eye. There's a lot of residential construction in development and plenty of land to build on. It has become particularly appealing to young professionals (read = me) and families. My subway commute under the East River to work in Manhattan is about 20 minutes door to door, and it takes me five minutes to get to Grand Central Terminal.\n\nMy neighborhood is changing and growing \u2014 fast. The current population is estimated to be about 80,000, a 21% jump from five years ago, according to the Long Island City Partnership , a local development group. And the population is expected to increase. The partnership predicts it will exceed 100,000 by 2021. Just over half the population is between the ages of 20 and 44, and about half have a bachelor's degree or higher, per LICP data.\n\nAmazon says it will inject more than 25,000 workers to the neighborhood over time. Of course, they wouldn't all live in the area, but the company put a high priority on locating in a place with a big, skilled workforce. The New York metro area has that. And Amazon's jobs are high-paying, too \u2014 the average annual salary will be $150,000.\n\nLong Island City is a neighborhood in Queens, New York.\n\nJuan \"Rick\" Rosa, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman, has lived in Long Island City for almost 20 years. He calls it a former \"industrial wasteland\" that was home to factories, rail yards and manufacturing facilities.\n\nBut then the neighborhood began to change. Citigroup opened a skyscraper in 1990. The area was rezoned in 2001 in an effort to add more offices, stores and places to live. Experts say growth in the neighborhood has accelerated especially fast in the past five years.\n\nVernon Boulevard, a neighborhood main street with shops and restaurants, reminds me of small-town Vermont, where I'm from. A New American restaurant recently opened up on the corner. But the waterfront is what really drew me to Long Island City. It has plenty of new sidewalks for running or walking, and the views of Manhattan are incredible.\n\nBut off the water, many corners feel like a construction zone. I see cranes and apartment buildings under construction every day on my way to work, and frequently notice new buildings. Over 11,700 residential units are projected to open by 2020.\n\nAnd housing prices are rising. The median home value in Long Island City was nearly $1.2 million as of September, according to data from real estate listings site Trulia. That's up from $741,900 in 2013. (It's also much higher than the national median home price of $220,100 in 2018 and $161,300 in 2013).\n\nOne of the major concerns about the HQ2 process was how a city would absorb the arrival of so many new workers. But the impact would be muted in the New York City area. According to research from Apartment List, bringing half of HQ2 to the New York City area would result in less than a 0.1% increase in rent growth.\n\nInfrastructure is a challenge. According to Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, Long Island City has to address core infrastructure issues and sewage problems, as well as open more schools.\n\n\"These are real issues that exist in cities everywhere \u2014 it's nothing new,\" Lusskin said. \"We're going to continue to need more schools, more open space, an upgraded street [design] and intra-Long Island City transportation. It's a big neighborhood.\"\n\nIf thousands of new Amazon workers come to town, it would also put extra strain on the already-struggling New York City subway system, and add more congestion to the 7 train line.\n\nNew York City recently announced it would help by spending $180 million on infrastructure in the neighborhood. \"These are issues that we have to work on, no matter what,\" Lusskin said. \"This is a rapidly growing area.\"\n\nAmazon's announcement on Tuesday is set to be one that shapes the future of where I live.", "Washington (CNN) Maryland's Attorney General on Tuesday filed papers asking a federal judge to replace Matthew Whitaker as acting US attorney general with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nBrian Frosh argues Whitaker was not properly appointed and his appointment violates the Attorney General Succession Act in addition to the Appointments Clause of the Constitution.\n\nHis court challenge seeks a preliminary injunction that would stop the Justice Department from proceeding in defending a lawsuit involving the Affordable Care Act unless Rosenstein replaces Whitaker.\n\nMaryland, along with more than a dozen other states, are seeking rulings that the Affordable Care Act remains enforceable despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle it.\n\nSince Maryland's lawsuit named former Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a defendant, the state now says the judge overseeing the lawsuit should declare that the proper defendant as attorney general is Rosenstein, not Whitaker.\n\nRead More", "New York (CNN Business) After running a year-long competition that drew interest from hundreds of cities and a number of states, Amazon has chosen New York City and Northern Virginia to split duty as its second headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Amazon announced it has chosen New York's Long Island City and Virginia's Arlington for HQ2. Both locations will receive a $2.5 billion investment from Amazon, and each will have more than 25,000 workers over time. Hiring begins next year.\n\nThe reason behind the surprise decision to divide the facility was due to the talent pool. Amazon realized it could recruit more skilled workers and offer employees choice if it offered two locations.\n\nThe development projects promise to bring the cities a giant infusion of high-paying jobs and tax revenue, but are almost certain to draw fire from critics concerned about their impact on infrastructure and property values.\n\nAmazon said it in a blog post it will receive incentives of about $1.5 billion based on job creation in Long Island City, and incentives of $573 million for Arlington. Jobs in both cities will have an average annual salary of $150,000, the company said.\n\nIn Long Island City and Arlington, Amazon will have four million square feet of office space with the possibility of expanding to 8 million square feet. Amazon estimates an incremental tax revenue of over $10 billion in the next 20 years as a result of its investment and job creation in Long Island City and New York, and $3.2 billion over the same time period in Arlington and Virginia.\n\nJay Carney, SVP of Worldwide Corporate Affairs at Amazon, said the process of cities offering incentives to companies looking to enter new regions is standard across the US.\n\n\"If you look at some of the packages that were put forward by other cities, the incentives ... in New York and the DC area, Northern Virginia are actually lower than were offered elsewhere,\" he told CNN's Julia Chatterley. \"The talent was really the driving factor for us.\"\n\nCarney said it was important for Amazon to be in spots that would be attractive to potential new employees.\n\nThe Arlington headquarters will be located in what Amazon is calling \"National Landing,\" which is less than 3 miles from downtown Washington DC. The newly-branded neighborhood includes parts of Pentagon City and Crystal City in Arlington and Potomac Yard in Alexandria.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York City office will be in the fast-growing Queens neighborhood of Long Island City , just across the East River and minutes from downtown Manhattan on the subway.\n\nThe company also announced a new hub in Nashville to oversee customer fulfillment, transportation and supply chain activities. It will employ 5,000 people. Nashville was on Amazon's short list for HQ2.\n\nThe second headquarters search began in September 2017 when Seattle-based Amazon announced it would start accepting proposals for what quickly became known as HQ2.\n\nDuring the process, Amazon narrowed 238 bids to 20 finalists , including Chicago, Denver, Indianapolis, and Miami. Executives traveled across the United States -- and to one Canadian city -- to tour sites to find the company's next home.\n\nAmazon's criteria for HQ2 included proximity to a major airport, ability to attract technical talent and a suburban or urban area with over 1 million people.\n\nIn a surprise twist, Amazon ultimately decided to choose two winners instead of one. It originally said HQ2 would create 50,000 high-paying jobs and would be a full equal to its Seattle headquarters.\n\nOne of the main concerns about the process was how a city would navigate an influx of 50,000 new workers. Splitting the project in half could ease the impact, and help Amazon avoid some of the blame for higher housing prices or more traffic in those regions. The move also allows Amazon to recruit top talent from two major Metropolitan areas.\n\nThe search ignited a frenzy among cities looking to boost their economies. Some cities responded with elaborate gestures to try to woo Amazon. Tucson, Arizona, famously sent Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a giant cactus, and Birmingham, Alabama, installed massive Amazon delivery boxes around the city.

Republicans led in Florida, Nevada, Montana and Arizona. The only \"good\" news for Democrats was that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin (D) had been re-elected in a overwhelmingly Republican state -- and even that news wasn't all that great given that Manchin is anything but a reliable Democratic vote.\n\nBoy, can a week change things.\n\nLate Monday, Rep. Martha McSally (R) conceded defeat to Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) in the Arizona Senate race , a pickup for Democrats. It was the latest in a series of positive developments for Senate Democrats over the past week -- from come-from-behind wins in Montana and Nevada to an ever-shrinking deficit (and an ongoing recount) in the Florida race between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R).\n\nAt the moment, Democrats have lost a total of one seat from where they were before the 2018 election. The worst they will do is a net loss of two seats -- assuming Scott's 12,000-ish vote lead stands after the recount and appointed Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is doing herself no favors , wins the November 27 runoff against former Rep. Mike Espy (D). The best-case scenario for Democrats -- and, to be clear, this is NOT likely -- is a net gain of a single seat; that would mean Nelson somehow comes from behind in Florida and Espy wins the runoff in an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nLet's say that at the start of the next Congress Senate Republicans have gained two seats, expanding their majority from 51 to 53 seats. Which is, obviously, good for Republicans because, um, controlling more Senate seats is usually a better thing than a worse one.\n\nBut, context! Everyone seems to forget that the 2018 election cycle was a once-in-a-generation sort of map for Republicans. Democrats had to defend 26 seats as compared to just 9 for Republicans. Of those 26 Democratic seats, 10 -- 10! -- were in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016 including five (Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia) he won by double digits. When the 2018 cycle began, there was not-crazy talk among Republicans that they had an outside chance at controlling 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority -- at the start of 2019.\n\nFrom that to a modest gain (at best) is a big, big difference. And the reason that's important is that the battle for control of the Senate majority isn't a one-cycle affair. It's about minimizing your losses in bad cycles (when you have lots and lots of vulnerable seats up) and maximizing your gains in good ones.\n\nWhich brings us to the 2020 Senate map , in which 22 Republicans are up for re-election as compared to just 12 Democrats. Two Senate Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado -- will have to win reelection in states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats are also likely to target Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, the Arizona seat (Sen. Jon Kyl is expected to resign sometime in early 2019 and will be replaced by an appointee chosen by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey) and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. For Democrats, Alabama Sen. Doug Jones is their biggest problem, and Republicans may seek to target Michigan Sen. Gary Peters as well.\n\nGo forward even two more years and you see another advantageous map for Democrats. Republicans will be defending 21 seats as compared to just 12 for Democrats. Democrats will take a very hard run at Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and the possible open seat currently held by Iowa's Sen. Chuck Grassley. Democratic vulnerabilities are somewhat limited, with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Colorado's Sen. Michael Bennet on the top of the list.\n\nHere's the point: If Democrats had lost, say, seven Senate seats in the 2018 election -- which was not an impossible thing to imagine back in January 2017 -- then the 2020 and 2022 cycles would be about shrinking the GOP majority rather than trying to take back control of the Senate. But with Republicans' best-case scenario looking like 53 seats, Democrats can now make a plausible case that they can retake the world's greatest deliberative body as soon as 2020.\n\nIf they do, the roots of that success were planted in 2018 -- and specifically how the party survived what could have been a generational wipeout that might have taken a decade or more to recover from. In politics, winning is always the goal. But minimizing your losses can be a kind of win too -- even if you have to wait for the ultimate reward.", "(CNN) A recount is underway in Florida for the Senate , governor and agriculture commissioner races following the 2018 midterm elections. On Saturday, the Florida secretary of state announced the recount, which was triggered because the margins in all three contests are under .5%. Each county is recounting votes and the results from the machine recount are due back by Thursday.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, Republicans are seeking to cast doubt on the election process, and Democrats are leveling increasingly heated charges in return.\n\nRecount votes could start rolling in\n\nAre you ready to recount? Tuesday should bring our first significant data haul that will give an idea of if this machine recount will be demonstrably different than the original count. Many smaller counties are expected to wrap up their process as soon as Tuesday and both sides expect them to certify and post their results. The key will be to compare the vote totals issued Saturday to the vote totals now coming in on a county-by-county basis. It won't tell us the whole story, but it should provide a glimpse of what to expect.\n\nWill it get done on time?\n\nWe feel marginally better Tuesday than we did Monday that we will get a full recount of at least the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, which is the race with the most at stake. The main source of worry was Palm Beach County where Susan Bucher, the Supervisor of Elections, predicted gloom and doom on Sunday, but on Monday after they got moving felt a lot better about their prospects. In fact, privately Democrats are holding onto the option of filing a lawsuit to extend the deadline, but at this point they are not moving forward because it looks like Palm Beach County will be done on time. Broward County remains confident they will get done on time, but they were slow to get up and running. While they are talking a good game, there are some nerves outside of the office that they will likely be pushing it right up to the deadline (you know, just like Election Night). Remember this is an enormous undertaking and even the best run counties, like Miami-Dade, expect to be done, but it requires them to count 24 hours a day, and they started soon after the order was issued Saturday afternoon.\n\nHearing pregame\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are beginning to believe that Wednesday's hearing in Federal Court could prove to be an enormous harbinger of the ultimate outcome in this race. Judge Mark Walker will be hearing a Democratic argument to revisit tens of thousands of ballots that were not counted because they did not strictly adhere to Florida law. Marc Elias, the lead Democratic lawyer, has repeatedly said that the way these ballots were handled disenfranchised a whole host of voters, particularly in minority communities. Not everyone agrees with that assessment. Mark Earley, who is the Supervisor of Elections in Leon County has been called to testify by the judge in this case. Earley is a veteran of the 2000 presidential recount. He said he is open to any suggestions to make the process better, but from his point of view the only ballots that are not allowed under these circumstances are the ones with egregious errors. \"We err on the side of the voter,\" said Earley. \"I think we try to make sure those votes are tabulated. But in my position, from my frame of reference, there has to be some check or guard against voter fraud.\"\n\nUltimately, Judge Walker will decide, and that decision could play a huge role in how this plays out.\n\nBay County problems\n\nA new, surprising, problem popped up on the radar Monday. Mark Anderson, Supervisor of Elections in Bay County, told CNN's D.J. Judd that he accepted 158 ballots from voters who were impacted by Hurricane Michael via email or fax. That decision was in direct violation of a specific order from Florida's secretary of state that gave special guidance to counties ravaged by the storm. Anderson claims other counties made the same choice. He also was clear that he took special precautions to make sure the votes were cast appropriately. \"I think the important part to realize that we actually were able to pull off a successful election with checks and balances, we just didn't do willy-nilly e-ballots, they have security that was on them. We have documentation that's on them,\" Anderson said. \"We have all the processes to backup and protect why we did what we did.\" ( READ : CNN's full story on the decision)\n\nThere is no question that Anderson was dealing with a unique and difficult circumstance after the devastation of the hurricane. Still, Anderson appears to have broken the rules. The question is will anyone call him on it? That could be a precarious position for both sides. Bay County is a Republican County. If Democrats cry foul, that could run counter to their standard of \"count every vote.\" If Republicans defend this action, it takes a lot of steam out of their argument that the law is the law.\n\nShould Scott recuse himself\n\nA lot of noise was made on Monday about Scott removing himself from the recount process in his official capacity as governor. Scott has taken some controversial action, like asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate possible voter fraud (they found none), and asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to get involved. Scott was hit with a lawsuit Monday by the League of Women voters and Common Cause designed to force him to recuse himself. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Wednesday morning in federal court in Tallahassee. This, like much of the legal activity surrounding this story is theatre. So far Scott's actions, while bold, have had minimal impact on the actual counting of votes. In fact, both Palm Beach and Broward County agreed with him that some level of law enforcement monitoring the election equipment and ballots was a smart idea. However, Scott certainly runs the risk of taking it too far. He has already opened the door to Democrats describing him as a socialist dictator. In terms how this plays out, know this: only a court order will force Scott to recuse himself from anything having to do with being governor.", "Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, is a CNN legal analyst and Rutgers University scholar. Follow him on Twitter @eliehonig. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) After last week's midterms, President Donald Trump faces a stark new political reality. Now that the House of Representatives has flipped to Democratic control, Trump -- for the first time -- must contend with a Congress that can and will seek to use its investigative authority to hold the administration accountable.\n\nElie Honig\n\nHouse Democrats have formidable power and plenty of crucial oversight work to do. Most importantly, the new Congress must protect the Department of Justice from political interference -- particularly given Trump's appointment of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general. In doing so, however, House Democrats must proceed carefully to avoid (perhaps inadvertently) impeding the ongoing criminal probes being conducted by special counsel Robert Mueller and the US attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). In short, House Democrats have a vital role to play in reining in abuses by the Trump administration, but they need to leave the prosecuting to the real prosecutors.\n\nDemocratic House leaders already have eagerly unveiled their investigative wish lists. Rep. Adam Schiff, who will likely chair the House Intelligence Committee, has announced his intent to investigate Trump's firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointment of Whitaker and to guard against potential efforts by Whitaker to impede Mueller's investigation. Expected incoming House Judiciary Committee chair, Rep. Jerry Nadler, told CNN that, immediately upon taking the gavel, he will seek to question Whitaker about his expressed hostility to Mueller's investigation. Nadler also will focus on Trump's potential violation of campaign finance laws through hush money payments, which is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the SDNY.\n\nJUST WATCHED Nadler: Dems may subpoena Whitaker first thing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nadler: Dems may subpoena Whitaker first thing 02:57\n\nWithout question, congressional hearings are a powerful means to ensure transparency and expose impropriety in the administration. Perhaps the most important practical consequence of the midterms is that the House Democrats now hold investigative and subpoena power. That investigative authority is particularly consequential given the looming threat that Whitaker's appointment poses to Mueller and the SDNY.\n\nWhitaker's predisposition to limit Mueller -- or perhaps stifle him entirely -- is undeniable: Shortly before he went to work for the Department of Justice in 2017, Whitaker declared that Mueller's investigation was going too far , that \"there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign,\" and that an attorney general might reduce Mueller's budget \"so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\"\n\nRead More", "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump launched a scathing new broadside Tuesday against a onetime friend, French President Emmanuel Macron , who, after denouncing nationalism in a speech this weekend , appears to have been relegated to a long list of Trump's global adversaries.\n\nTrump's messages, which began before dawn, came a day after he returned from a peculiar and controversy-laden trip to Paris .

It was viewed widely as a reprimand of Trump, who proudly embraces the \"nationalist\" title.\n\nTrump, who some advisers described as sullen during the 44-hour trip, did not respond immediately to Macron's remarks. Listening to the speech through an earpiece, he remained stone-faced. But on Tuesday, his enmity spilled out.\n\n\"The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%,\" Trump wrote, citing figures indicating political trouble for the French leader.\n\n\"He was just trying to get onto another subject,\" Trump went on. \"By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!\"\n\n\"MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\" he said.\n\nThe problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%.

Once his top global partner, Trump has soured on Macron -- 32 years his junior -- over the course of the past months. The two men have found themselves at odds on climate change, trade and Iran -- but perhaps most notably they have diverged on the idea of nationalism and its dangers.\n\nMacron's office declined to comment on Trump's string of tweets on Tuesday. But the French ambassador in Washington, G\u00e9rard Araud, tweeted that Trump was citing \"erroneous press reports\" in his criticism of the European military cooperation.\n\nFor the sake of truth, Pres.@EmmanuelMacron didn't say that EU needed an army \"against the US\". It was an erroneous press report. \u2014 G\u00e9rard Araud (@GerardAraud) November 13, 2018\n\nMacron has warned against old ideologies becoming resurgent, including during his United Nations address last month and in interviews. He defeated an avowed nationalist candidate, Marine Le Pen, during elections last year.\n\n\"I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death,\" he said on Sunday. \"History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.\"\n\nImmediately after touching down in Paris on Sunday, the President tweeted his indignation at recent comments Macron made about bolstering European security cooperation, misrepresenting Macron's call for Western self-reliance. Trump was referring to remarks Macon made last week in which the French President called for a \"real European army\" and said the European Union has to \"protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America.\"\n\nA senior French official said at the time that Trump took Macron's words out \"out of context\" and clarified the language Macron used, saying that the French leader did not mean he wanted a European army but better coordination and funding of Europe's already-existing resources.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Trump, Macron was able to explain a \"misunderstanding\" about the European force and the two put the matter to rest, a French presidential spokesman said over the weekend.\n\nBut on Tuesday it was evident the matter had not been resolved.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump wrote early in the morning. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!\"\n\nHe didn't stop there. The President went on to raise the prospects of applying tariffs on French wine.\n\n\"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\" he wrote.\n\nEmmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia.

Speech next day at American Cemetary in pouring rain! Little reported-Fake News!\"", "Kampala, Uganda (CNN) Police in Uganda say 10 students died and 30 students were injured when a boys dormitory at a boarding school was set ablaze after the doors were padlocked.\n\nThree former students expelled for disciplinary reasons and a school guard have been arrested in connection with the Monday fire at St. Bernard Secondary School in Rakai district in Uganda's southwest, police said Tuesday.\n\nUganda Deputy Police spokesman Patrick Onyango told CNN the students who were arrested were part of a group of 15 expelled by school authorities this year. Some of them had threatened to harm students in the school after they were expelled, police said.\n\nPolice said the death toll might rise as many students who sustained burns are in critical condition at hospitals and might not survive.\n\nOnyango said early investigations into the incident revealed that \"the arsonists locked the dormitory doors with padlocks to ensure none of the occupants escaped the inferno.\"\n\nRead More", "\u0623\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0629

granted a visa to the United States in time to attend an event focusing on Islam with Republican lawmakers in Washington this week, according to organizers of the event.\n\nTommy Robinson, the founder of the far-right English Defence League (EDL), was due to attend the event with seven Republican congressmen on Wednesday.\n\nBut the conservative Philadelphia-based Middle East Forum, which is organizing the event, told CNN on Tuesday that Robinson had not been granted a visa in time to attend.\n\nMiddle East Forum president Daniel Pipes said Robinson had applied for a visa, but the application was still \"in the administrative processing phase.\" Pipes added that Robinson was set to take part in the event via video link.\n\nRobinson has not replied to a CNN request for comment. The US State Department told CNN that US law prohibits discussion of individual visa cases.\n\nRead More", "\"This is not a step we have taken lightly. But the White House action is unprecedented,\" CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker said in an internal memo to staff.\n\nSanders responded to the suit by saying that CNN is \"grandstanding\" by suing. She said the administration will \"vigorously defend\" itself. ( Read the White House's full response here.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday morning, CNN said it is seeking a preliminary injunction so that Acosta can return to the White House right away, and a ruling from the court preventing the White House from revoking Acosta's pass in the future.\n\n\"CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration this morning in DC District Court,\" the statement read. \"It demands the return of the White House credentials of CNN's Chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta. The wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta's First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process. We have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents' Association said it \"strongly supports CNN's goal of seeing their correspondent regain a US Secret Service security credential that the White House should not have taken away in the first place.\"\n\nCNN also asserted that other news organizations could have been targeted by the Trump administration this way, and could be in the future.\n\n\"While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,\" the network said. \"If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.\"\n\nSanders pointed out that lots of other CNN reporters and producers have press passes. But to many journalists and press defenders, that's not the issue. Echoing the views of many journalists, the correspondents' association said the president \"should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\"\n\nTrump's actions and threats fly in the face of decades of tradition and precedent. Republican and Democratic administrations alike have had a permissive approach toward press passes, erring on the side of greater access, even for obscure, partisan or fringe outlets.\n\nThe ACLU, in a statement supporting CNN, said \"it is un-American and unlawful for the president to expel a reporter from the WH briefing room for doing his job. It shouldn't take a lawsuit from CNN to remind the president of the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe legal battle\n\nOn CNN's side, CNN Worldwide chief counsel David Vigilante is joined by two prominent attorneys, Ted Boutrous and Theodore Olson. Both men are partners at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n\nLast week, before he was retained by CNN, Boutrous tweeted that the action against Acosta was \"angry, irrational, false, arbitrary, capricious content-based discrimination,\" and thus a clear violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday morning, Boutrous said CNN tried to resolve the matter privately, but the White House was not responsive so \"we really had no choice but to sue.\"\n\n\"We didn't want to have to go to court. We wanted to just report the news,\" he said. \"Mr. Acosta wants to report the news. CNN wants to report the news.\"\n\nCNN's lawsuit cites, among other precedents, a 1977 ruling in favor of Robert Sherrill, a muckraking journalist who was denied access to the White House in 1966.\n\nEleven years later, a D.C. Court of Appeals judge ruled that the Secret Service had to establish \"narrow and specific\" standards for judging applicants. In practice, the key question is whether the applicant would pose a threat to the president.\n\nThe code of federal regulations states that \"in granting or denying a request for a security clearance made in response to an application for a White House press pass, officials of the Secret Service will be guided solely by the principle of whether the applicant presents a potential source of physical danger to the President and/or the family of the President so serious as to justify his or her exclusion from White House press privileges.\"\n\nThere are other guidelines as well. Floyd Abrams, one of the country's most respected First Amendment lawyers, said case law specifies that before a press pass is denied, \"you have to have notice, you have to have a chance to respond, and you have to have a written opinion by the White House as to what it's doing and why, so the courts can examine it.\"\n\n\"We've had none of those things here,\" Abrams said.\n\nCNN's suit makes the same point.\n\nWhite House's shifting rationales\n\nAcosta found out about his suspension when he walked up to the northwest gate of the White House, as usual, for a live shot last Wednesday night. He was abruptly told to turn in his \"hard pass,\" which speeds up entry and exit from the grounds.\n\n\"I was just told to do it,\" the Secret Service officer said.\n\nAround the same time Acosta was denied entry to the White House grounds, Sanders announced the decision and claimed that he had behaved inappropriately at a presidential news conference earlier in the day.\n\nAt first Sanders accused Acosta of \"placing his hands\" on an intern who was trying to take a microphone away from him. In reality, Acosta held onto the mic, said \"pardon me, ma'am,\" asked a followup question, then gave up the mic.\n\nOn Twitter, Sanders shared a distorted video clip of the press conference that didn't show the complete back-and-forth. The same video had been posted by an InfoWars personality two hours earlier.\n\nThe White House's rationale was widely mocked and dismissed by journalists across the political spectrum. And Trump himself has cast doubt on the rationale: He said on Friday that Acosta was \"not nice to that young woman,\" but then he said, \"I don't hold him for that because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.\"\n\nIn Tuesday's response to the lawsuit, Sanders did not repeat her claim about Acosta \"placing his hands\" in the intern. Instead, she accused Acosta of being disrespectful and unprofessional.\n\nAs for the argument that Acosta isn't respectful enough, that justification \"is not sufficient as a matter of law,\" CNN's lawsuit asserts.\n\n\"The content and viewpoint of CNN's and Acosta's reporting on the Trump administration\u2014not his interaction with the staffer at the November 7 press conference\u2014were the real reason the White House indefinitely revoked his press credentials,\" the suit states.\n\nAcosta is on a previously scheduled vacation this week. He declined to comment on the lawsuit. Since his pass was suspended, he has continued to do part of his job, contacting sources and filing stories, but he has been unable to attend White House events or ask questions in person -- a basic part of any White House correspondent's role.\n\n\"Relevant precedent says that a journalist has a First Amendment right of access to places closed to the public but open generally to the press. That includes press rooms and news conferences,\" Jonathan Peters, a media law professor at the University of Georgia, told CNN last week. \"In those places, if access is generally inclusive of the press, then access can't be denied arbitrarily or absent compelling reasons. And the reasons that the White House gave were wholly unconvincing and uncompelling.\"\n\nLast Thursday, according to the suit, Zucker wrote to Kelly and requested reinstatement of Acosta's credentials. Zucker's message said that \"no complaints were raised with CNN and there was no attempt to reach anyone at CNN before taking this unlawful action.\"\n\nThe next day, CNN sent a formal letter to the White House repeating the request and warning of a possible lawsuit.\n\nOver the weekend, Acosta reported on the president's trip to France. Ahead of Trump's planned visit to an American military cemetery, he requested and received a credential from the French government, but was denied access by the Secret Service.\n\n\"It was not without irony to me that a U.S. White House correspondent who is an American citizen was denied access to a ceremony by his own government but was granted access by the government of France,\" CNN Washington bureau chief Sam Feist noted in a declaration attached to the lawsuit.\n\nFeist said \"Jim's ability to cover a public event of historic international importance was completely blocked by the White House.\"\n\nA high-stakes case\n\nDavid McCraw, the top newsroom lawyer at The New York Times, said instances of news organizations suing a president are extremely rare.\n\nPast examples are The New York Times v. U.S., the famous Supreme Court case involving the Pentagon Papers in 1971, and CNN's 1981 case against the White House and the broadcast networks, when CNN sued to be included in the White House press pool.\n\nThe backdrop to this new suit, of course, is Trump's antipathy for CNN and other news outlets. He regularly derides reporters from CNN and the network as a whole. But he also seeks out attention from CNN and other outlets.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump told CNN that, if elected, he would not kick reporters out of the White House. But since moving into the White House, he has mused privately about taking away credentials, CNN reported earlier this year. He brought it up publicly on Twitter in May, tweeting \"take away credentials?\" as a question.\n\nAnd he said it again on Friday, two days after blacklisting Acosta. \"It could be others also,\" he said, suggesting he may strip press passes from other reporters. Unprompted, he then named and insulted April Ryan, a CNN analyst and veteran radio correspondent.\n\n\"The revocation of Acosta's credentials is only the beginning,\" CNN's suit alleges.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this article listed the former director of the Secret Service as a defendant; the actual defendant is the current director.", "Washington (CNN) GOP Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger said Tuesday he was \"very disgusted\" by President Donald Trump for mocking House Republicans who did not back him enough during their midterm election campaigns.\n\n\"A little more grace would have been a lot better, I was very disgusted when I heard that,\" Kinzinger said in an interview with CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\" \"Let's go forward and look at how we're gonna do better in 2020.\"\n\nLast week, Trump blamed House representatives who did not or may not win re-election, including Utah Rep. Mia Love, during a post-election news conference for not supporting him during their campaigns. CNN has not yet called Love's race.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost. Too bad,\" Trump said.\n\nKinzinger said Love supported Trump \"a lot,\" which may cost her a seat in the still-undecided race for Utah's fourth congressional district.\n\nRead More", "West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) Republicans in Florida and nationally who are trying to paint the statewide recount as a Democratic effort to steal the election have zeroed in on one woman as the face of the effort: Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n\nAs votes are recounted in Florida's Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner races, Snipes, a Democrat, has been the target of repeated and direct attacks from Republicans up and down Florida. Former Gov. Jeb Bush, the man who first appointed her to the post, called for her to step down on Monday. Gov. Rick Scott, whose Senate race is central to the recount, sued her and has used her as a foil for days. And dozens of supporters of President Donald Trump outside of Snipes' office in Broward County, some holding signs labeling her the \"Supervisor of Corruption,\" have personally vilified her.\n\n\"Lock her up,\" the protestors yelled, repeating a chant that had been used against Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nSnipes has kept a low profile through much of it, but even Democrats in Florida admit the criticism is not entirely without reason: Broward County's elections office has been hampered by controversies for years and Snipes has been plagued by questions of bias for much of her tenure. And with Republicans leading in the state's two top races -- Senate and gubernatorial -- members of the party from the President on down are clearly eager to besmirch Snipes, and the entire recount, in the process.\n\nOn Tuesday, while speaking with reporters, Snipes hinted that she may not be in the job very long and said that it was \"hard to rule out race\" as a factor in the criticism being lobbed at her.\n\n\"It is time to move on, to let someone else (do the job),\" Snipes said. When a reporter followed on whether she will step down, the election official backed off slightly.\n\n\"Well, I haven't finalized that. I'll just check with my family. They'll tell me what I'm doing,\" she said.\n\nIt was clear during her conversation with reporters that Snipes had been following the criticism, especially the call for her removal by Bush.\n\n\"Jeb Bush did put me here in this position in 2003 and that was following the removal of another black woman,\" she said. \"It's unfortunate that we've had some issues that have gotten continuous. ... If that is Jeb Bush's opinion, then there is nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nSnipes has been up front about the fact that there have been issues with the vote counting.\n\n\"There have been issues that didn't go the way we wanted,\" Snipes said on Monday of the days leading up to the recount. \"We can call it a mistake, we can call it whatever you want to call it.\"\n\nScott thrust Snipes into the center of the debacle when he sued her and her counterpart in Palm Beach County, Susan Bucher, last week. Scott -- in conjunction with the National Republican Senatorial Committee -- won that suit, requiring Snipes and Bucher to hand over voter-related information and giving Republicans a powerful talking point to accuse the duo of violating the state's constitution.\n\nSnipes argued on Monday that the lawsuits were nothing more than an attack on her integrity.\n\n\"The lawsuits as they are written certainly cast dispersions on my character and usually we build character over a period of time and character is always on display. And I have worked here for about 15 years and I have to say this is the first time that this office or I have been under such attacks,\" she said. \"If we make mistakes, we own mistakes. If there is something that the public needs to know, then we provide that information.\"\n\nWith Republicans using a strategy that largely mimics Trump's attacks on institutions, the President has also jumped into the fray, attacking Broward County in particular.\n\n\"They have had a horrible history, and if you look at the person, in this case a woman involved, she has had a horrible history.\" Trump said.\n\n\"And all of the sudden they're finding votes out of nowhere,\" Trump added, without evidence, before he left for France last week. \"There's bad things that have gone on in Broward County, really bad things.\"\n\nSnipes fired back at Trump on Monday.\n\n\"We are in an era when people oftentimes speak without having vetted the information,\" she said. \"I'm not sure where the President gets his information from. I have not spoken with him. And I don't want to make any other comments on that.\"\n\nJuan Pe\u00f1alosa, the executive director of the Democratic Party of Florida, said of the Republican strategy to hone in on Snipes: \"She (Snipes) is trying to swim and it is like Republicans are tying an anchor around her ankle.\"\n\nSuits against Snipes\n\nJUST WATCHED Rep.

She is following the law and she is diligently working to get the ballots reprocessed,\" said the Democrat, who would not criticize Snipes on the record and requested anonymity to speak candidly about the Democratic elected official. \"Does that mean that she is a perfect SOE? Absolutely not. She is far from a perfect SOE. And I think most Democrats would rather have their elections in Broward County, one of our most important counties, be administered with someone with a better track record of success.\"\n\nSnipes, a teacher before she became an election official, was born in Talladega, Alabama, but has lived in Broward County for over five decades ago, according to her biography. Snipes worked as principal of C. Robert Markham Elementary School during her career and retired as the area director of a group of 16 local schools.\n\nSnipes was appointed to the position by Bush, a Republican, in 2003 after the then-governor removed her predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, for a series of missteps. Snipes has since won re-election four times, most recently in 2016.\n\nThe most recent questions about Snipes have been the most potent for Republicans: A Florida judge ruled that Snipes violated state and federal laws in when she destroyed ballots too soon after the 2016 election, despite one of the Democratic candidates in a primary race taking her to court to preserve the ballots and a federal requirement that mandates ballots be kept for 22 months after an election.\n\nAt the time, Snipes blamed her staff for the \"mistake.\"\n\n\"When I sign, I sign folders filled with information,\" Snipes said in her testimony. She later said, \"I trust my staff. They have the responsibility of giving me information that's correct.\"\n\nThe lawsuits have been the backbone of attacks against Snipes, whom Republicans have cast as a scandal-plagued liberal who is trying to tip the election in the favor of Democrats.\n\nTo date, there has been no evidence of fraud -- a charge routinely made by Republicans on behalf of the Scott campaign -- but Snipes' history has opened the door for Republicans to villainize her in the fierce public relations battle.\n\nCalls for her to step down\n\nJUST WATCHED Around-the-clock recount underway in Florida races Replay More Videos ...

Brian Mast, acting as a surrogate for the Scott campaign, said Snipes had \"failed\" and called for she and Bucher to be ousted.\n\n\"We have two counties out of all Florida counties that have failed. And not just failed once -- this is something where they have been a historical track record with these supervisors of elections,\" he said.\n\nAnd Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has laid the entirety of the blame for the recount on Snipes.\n\n\"If it's not the worst elections department in America or the worst-run elections department in America, I would hate to see the one worse run than this department,\" Rubio said.\n\nThe person who hasn't called for her ouster is Scott, the Republican governor who has the power to remove her, despite the fact she is involved in his race for the US Senate. Republicans in the state are clear-eyed about the fact that it would look unseemly for Scott to fire Snipes in the midst of a recount he is directly involved in.\n\nProtesters focus on Snipes\n\nJUST WATCHED MAGIC WALL: Florida begins recount in razor-thin Governor, Senate races Replay More Videos ...

That strategy contributed to the view that she was avoiding the public scrutiny as votes were counted throughout Florida.\n\n\"All resources around the clock are being placed both by Dr. Snipes office as well as the independent canvassing board to make this happen by the deadline on Thursday and we have every intention of meeting that,\" Eugene Pettis, Snipes' attorney, told reporters.\n\nBut that did not quell the protests, with a number of Republicans sporting Trump and DeSantis gear camping out outside her office to make sure their voices were heard.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - La vista desde la ventana del avi\u00f3n se volvi\u00f3 un poco m\u00e1s rara, o al menos lo hizo en Irlanda.\n\n\n\nMIRA: Video muestra el presunto encuentro de un piloto de la Marina con un ovni\n\nVarios avistamientos a\u00e9reos de al menos un objeto volador no identificado \"muy brillante\" se vieron el viernes pasado, de acuerdo con los registros de audio del control de tr\u00e1fico a\u00e9reo.\n\nLas conversaciones entre los pilotos de las aerol\u00edneas y el control del tr\u00e1fico a\u00e9reo irland\u00e9s se centraron brevemente en los avistamientos, y al menos cuatro aviadores confirmaron que hab\u00edan visto el fen\u00f3meno.\n\nEl intercambio comenz\u00f3 cuando un piloto le pregunt\u00f3 al control de tr\u00e1fico a\u00e9reo de Shannon si hab\u00eda actividad militar cercana.

There has never been a female president at any of Ireland's seven universities and only two of the 14 presidents in the technology institutes have been women, it said.\n\nRead More", "\u0623\u0643\u062f \u062c\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0623\u0632\u0639\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0648\u0622\u0633\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0635\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u064a\u060c \u0623\u0646 \u062a\u0623\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u064a\u062c\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0645\u0639 \u0642\u0637\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f\u0627. \u0648\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0632\u0639\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0642\u0627\u0628\u0644\u0629 \u0645\u0639 CNN\u060c \u0645\u0634\u064a\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0631\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645.\n\n\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0621 \u060c 13 \u0646\u0648\u0641\u0645\u0628\u0631 / \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a 2018", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

President Donald Trump has been eyeing potential replacements for several senior positions in his administration -- both inside the West Wing and across the Cabinet , multiple officials familiar with the matter said.\n\nWith the exception of his family working inside the White House, few aides feel completely secure as he considers a major shakeup, the officials said.\n\nKirstjen Nielsen, his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, is potentially the next to go, multiple officials with knowledge of the matter said. Her departure could portend another high-profile exit: chief of staff John Kelly, Nielsen's top advocate in the administration.\n\nTrump could ask Nielsen to resign in the coming days, multiple officials familiar with the matter predicted, describing the President's continued frustration at her handling of his signature issue: immigration and border security.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly is also on the list of possible resignations, despite Trump saying earlier this year he is welcome to stay in the post until the end of the President's term. Trump has been discussing a handful of replacements, including Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff. The President had a long conversation with him on midterm election night last week, and has grown to like him, two officials said, but they cautioned it is far from certain whether Trump will dismiss Kelly and elevate Ayers.\n\nAyers is not traveling with the vice president in Asia this week.\n\nIn recent weeks, the President has resumed polling advisers on potential replacements, as he did several months ago before ultimately announcing that Kelly would remain on as his chief of staff through his 2020 re-election campaign\n\nAyers has told at least two friends he is in the running for the position, but it's unclear whether he knows his true standing in the volatile West Wing. He has grown close to the President and key members of the administration, including the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and is valued for his political acumen -- something Trump allies have long grumbled that Kelly lacks.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House questioned how serious Ayers was under consideration. Other top aides, such as adviser Johnny DeStefano and budget director Mick Mulvaney, are also being discussed -- as well as others outside the administration.\n\nDeStefano has presided over a growing portfolio inside a White House known for its complicated internal dynamics. He started out overseeing of the Office of Presidential Personnel, and has since been placed in charge of the political shop and the Office of Public Liaison.\n\nA source close to Mulvaney said he is no longer interested in the chief of staff position. He is now far more interested in a Cabinet position as a next move, the source said.\n\nSome Trump allies are urging the President to bring someone in from the outside, but it's an open question how attractive the position would be.\n\nTrump hints at change\n\nJUST WATCHED Jeff Sessions out as attorney general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jeff Sessions out as attorney general 03:18\n\nSpeaking at his post-midterms news conference last week, the President made clear he was planning to shake up his staff, though declined to offer details.\n\n\"As we make changes, we'll sit down and talk to you about it. I mean, there's no great secret,\" he said. \"A lot of administrations make changes after midterms. I will say that, for the most part, I'm very, very happy with this Cabinet. We're doing a great job.\"\n\nTrump said he hadn't \"heard about John Kelly\" departing, but acknowledged any job at the White House is tiring.\n\n\"People leave. They come in, they're here. It's a very exhausting job,\" he said. \"I love doing it, I must tell you. But it's exhausting for a lot of people.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported Monday that Trump has told advisers he has decided to remove Nielsen and that he wants her out as soon as possible, citing five current and former White House officials.\n\nTrump has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules, even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAsked to comment, Tyler Houlton, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, said Nielsen \"is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately return CNN's request for comment.\n\nNielsen's pending departure\n\nJUST WATCHED Who is Kirstjen Nielsen? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Who is Kirstjen Nielsen? 02:43\n\nNielsen's potential departure would come after a midterm election campaign in which Trump focused heavily on immigration, often overlooking economic matters in favor of false or fear-mongering language about a crisis at the southern border.\n\nNielsen, who served in President George W. Bush's administration, never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly, who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary.\n\nWhen Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff.\n\nNielsen is widely viewed as an acolyte of Kelly, the retired Marine general who has his own complicated relationship with the President. Kelly has staunchly defended Nielsen against criticism of her performance on immigration-related matters. He's also been forced to defend her to the President, who has expressed suspicion over the jobs she held in the Bush administration.\n\nTrump has angrily aired his frustrations with Nielsen's handling of border security during contentious meetings at the White House, claiming she isn't up to the task of fulfilling the campaign promises he made to curb illegal immigration. That, in turn, has led to an internal dynamic where some officials have griped to the President about Nielsen's performance in order to gain favor with him.\n\nThe President has not sought to quell that dynamic, believing that pitting camps of aides against each other is a way to produce better results. But the constant arrows have led Nielsen to tell some associates that she is unhappy in her post.", "(CNN) Boeing allegedly withheld information about the potential hazards of new flight-control features on the model of plane involved in the deadly Lion Air crash in Indonesia last month, according to a US pilots group.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association rejected Boeing's assertion that a safety bulletin issued last week was meant to reinforce procedures already in the 737 MAX flight manual.\n\n\"They (Boeing) didn't provide us all the info we rely on when we fly an aircraft,\" said Captain Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the group. \"The bulletin is not re-affirming, it's enlightening and adding new info.\"\n\nThe manual did not tell pilots that, when the plane's computer detects the aircraft is in a stall, it automatically triggers a response, such as lowering the airpane's nose, to prevent or exit the stall.\n\nThat is critical information for pilots, which the association says was never communicated to them.\n\nThe Allied Pilots Association says while there are no immediate safety concerns about the Boeing 737 MAX \"the fact that this hasn't been told to pilots before calls into question what other info should we know about this aircraft.\"\n\nThe news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it is not conducting a probe separate to the ongoing Lion Air accident investigation, of which it is a part.\n\nCiting \"safety experts involved in the investigation, as well as midlevel FAA officials and airline pilots,\" the WSJ reported Monday that the automated stall-prevention system on Boeing 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models -- intended to help cockpit crews avoid mistakenly raising a plane's nose dangerously high -- \"under unusual conditions can push it down unexpectedly and so strongly that flight crews can't pull it back up.\"\n\nAccording to the WSJ, Boeing told airlines that such a situation \"can result in a steep dive or crash -- even if pilots are manually flying the jetliner and don't expect flight-control computers to kick in.\"\n\nCaptain Daniel Putut Kuncoro Adi, Managing Director of Lion Air Group, told CNN Wednesday that the airline is \"collecting all information in our internal investigation, we were working with our experts in (operations and engineering) departments, but again we do respect the investigation process done by (Indonesian safety inspectors), and we look forward to the report.\"\n\nIssue with AOA sensors\n\nBoeing released an operational bulletin last week, warning all airlines about how to address any erroneous readings related to the angle of attack (AOA) sensors. The FAA later issued its own directive that advised pilots about how to respond to similar problems.\n\nAn AOA sensor is an instrument, similar to a small wind vane, that sits outside the plane just below the cockpit and sends information to its computers about the angle of the plane's nose relative to the oncoming air. The sensor helps to determine whether the plane is about to stall and dive.\n\nBoeing said the operational bulletin pointed crews to \"existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input\" from the sensors involved in the Indonesia incident, the AOA sensors.\n\nIn a statement following the WSJ report, Boeing said: \"We are taking every measure to fully understand all aspects of this incident, working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved.\"\n\n\"We are confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. Safety remains our top priority and is a core value for everyone at Boeing,\" the company said.\n\n\"What seems to have happened here is that a new version or a modified anti-stall capacity was added which pushes the nose down automatically. If it's true, it is beyond comprehension that Boeing did not tell the airline and pilots about this,\" said CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest.\n\nHe added that if important information hadn't been communicated to pilots, it would be a matter for aviation regulators, rather than individual airlines.\n\n\"The issue is how much information to give the pilots about the systems on board so they can respond in an emergency,\" Quest said, adding that pilots are often overloaded with readouts and signals from multiple devices and monitors that can risk distracting them at the worst possible moment.\n\nLion Air sensor replaced\n\nLast week, investigators working on the Lion Air Flight 610 crash -- in which 189 people died -- said the AOA sensor on board the aircraft had been replaced the day before the incident , but problems persisted.\n\nIndonesian authorities confirmed last Wednesday that the AOA sensor was replaced after a flight from Manado, in North Sulawesi, to Denpasar, Bali, on October 28. The Boeing 737 MAX 8 then made another flight to Jakarta that same day, and the pilots reported further problems.\n\nInvestigators said the jet experienced problems on its last four flights -- including, crucially, the flight that crashed, according to Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT).\n\nJUST WATCHED Families grieve at airport after plane crash Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Families grieve at airport after plane crash 02:19\n\nSearch for voice recorder\n\nMore than three weeks after the crash, authorities are still searching for the plane's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which is believed to be buried under deep mud. If found, it should reveal what happened in the cockpit in the final seconds of the flight.\n\nInvestigators are already examining the flight data recorder (FDR) that was pulled off the sea bed , some 30 meters under water, on November 1. Preliminary findings suggested there were problems with the air speed indicator on the past three flights before the crash.\n\nThe airspeed indicator is like a speedometer and tells the pilot how fast the plane is moving through the air. It does this by gathering data from the plane's pitot tube and the static port, which essentially compare differentials in the air pressure to arrive at the plane's speed and the altitude.\n\nAfter problems were reported with the air speed indicator, the AOA sensor was replaced by a Lion Air technician in Bali before the plane departed for Jakarta on its penultimate flight.\n\nPassengers on that flight told CNN that the plane experienced a significant drop in altitude shortly after takeoff. \"After 10 minutes in the air the plane dropped as if it was losing power. People panicked. It dropped about 400 feet,\" passenger Robbi Gaharu said\n\nOnce in Jakarta, a Lion Air technician checked the plane again and gave it the green light to fly on its final flight, from Jakarta to Pangkal Pinang.", "Washington (CNN) The Justice Department is expected to issue an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel on Tuesday that will defend Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general under federal law, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nAlmost immediately after President Donald Trump appointed Whitaker last week, various high-profile lawyers, professors and former Justice officials have weighed in on the legality of the move and more formal legal challenges are widely expected soon.\n\nSome legal scholars -- as well as George Conway , the husband of Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway -- have said they thought Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed official. Yet others have argued that the appointment is valid because he's only serving on a temporary basis under the Federal Vacancies Act.\n\nOLC serves as the chief interpreter of federal law for the administration, but its conclusions are not binding on federal courts, and Tuesday's opinion is unlikely to abate the brewing controversy over Whitaker's appointment.\n\nTop Democrats on Capitol Hill have slammed Trump's decision to appoint Whitaker as acting attorney general, skipping over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- the next Justice official in the succession line who is Senate-confirmed and was previously overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. While Rosenstein is still managing the probe on a day-to-day basis, Whitaker's critics have worried that he could take steps to curtail Mueller's work given his past fierce criticism of the probe.\n\nRead More", "New Delhi (CNN Business) Walmart's big bet on India has suffered another major setback.\n\nThe head of Flipkart, the Indian online retailer Walmart bought in May, stepped down on Tuesday following an independent investigation into allegations of \"serious personal misconduct.\"\n\nBinny Bansal, co-founder and CEO of Flipkart, resigned after the investigation by a global law firm revealed \"lapses of judgement,\" Walmart said.\n\nWalmart ( WMT paid $16 billion for 77% of India's biggest e-commerce company with the aim of gaining a much bigger slice of the fast growing market.Flipkart has managed to maintain a lead over Amazon ( AMZN ) \u2014 it accounted for nearly 40% of India's online retail market when the Walmart deal was signed.\n\nBut six months in, the deal has lost some of its gloss. Walmart told investors in October that the Flipkart purchase would shave about $740 million off its quarterly profit.\n\nThe sudden departure of Bansal, who co-founded Flipkart in 2007, is the second blow in two months.\n\nBansal 'stunned' by the allegations\n\nIn a statement, Walmart said Bansal strongly denied the allegations made against him. The company told CNN Business that it first found out about the allegations in July this year.\n\nBansal told Flipkart employees that he was \"stunned\" by the allegations, according to a letter Walmart shared with CNN Business.\n\nFlipkart co-founder Binny Bansal denied the allegation of \"serious personal misconduct.\"\n\n\"While the investigation did not find evidence to corroborate the complainant's assertions against Binny, it did reveal other lapses in judgement, particularly a lack of transparency, related to how Binny responded to the situation,\" the company said in its statement.\n\n\"Binny has been an important part of Flipkart since co-founding the company, but recent events risked becoming a distraction,\" it added.\n\nRepresentatives for Walmart declined to comment further on the allegations.\n\nBansal was CEO of the broader Flipkart Group, which includes subsidiaries such as digital payments company PhonePe and fashion retailers Myntra and Jabong. He kept that role when Walmart took over in May. Co-founder Sachin Bansal \u2014 the company's chairman at the time \u2014 chose to exit. (The two men are not related.)\n\nWalmart said Tuesday that Binny Bansal had been \"contemplating a transition for some time\" and that it was accelerating a succession plan that was already in the works.\n\nKalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of the group's main e-commerce business, will remain in that role but take on responsibility for the fashion retailers. PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam and Krishnamurthy will both report directly to the Flipkart board.\n\n\"We have full confidence in the strength and depth of leadership across the company,\" Walmart said.\n\nIn his resignation letter to Flipkart employees, Bansal said he had been planning to stay for a few more quarters to continue the transition following the closing of the Walmart deal.\n\n\"However, my decision to step down has been accelerated by certain personal events that have taken place in the recent past,\" he wrote.\n\nBansal added that he would continue to serve on Flipkart's board and would remain a \"large shareholder.\"\n\n'A huge opportunity'\n\nIn an interview with CNN Business in October, Bansal spoke about Flipkart's importance to Walmart and the company's plans for the future.\n\n\"For Walmart, India was a huge opportunity which should not be missed,\" he said. \"The future of retail obviously is e-commerce so Flipkart was a good partner of choice.\"\n\nHe identified sectors such as furniture, groceries and digital payments as key focus areas for the next decade.\n\n\"From a five, 10-year view ... we want to build an ecosystem around hundreds of millions of customers in India,\" he said. \"It's a huge country, huge opportunity.\"", "\u062f\u0628\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a

Fueled by trolls, extremists, false information, and a group mentality, this kind of cruelty against a religion, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender, race -- or anything, really -- has reached a fever pitch. And while some kids will be attacked, and some may be swept up in the powerful rhetoric, the vast majority of kids will be victims of everyday, casual exposure. Just by playing a game on the internet, looking up a definition, or maybe checking out some music, they'll encounter some of the most vile and offensive words and images that can be expressed in the comments section of a YouTube video, a meme in their feed, or a group chat. The intensity of these ideas, the frequency with which kids see them, and the acceptance by so many that it's just part of internet life mean that it's critical to talk to kids about this difficult topic. They'll be much better equipped to handle whatever comes their way when they can talk to you about all aspects of hate speech: what it is and why it's hurtful, what to do when they encounter it, and even what to do if they're drawn to it.\n\nHate speech is actually legal under the First Amendment -- unless it specifically targets someone, includes threats and harassment, or creates a hostile environment (such as at school or work). But the line between what's OK and what's absolutely unacceptable is still very much up for debate in the digital age. And when you think about it, today's kids are guinea pigs for the giant social experiment of free and open public speech. On one side are mainstream sites like Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube trying to walk the tightrope between freedom of expression and decorum. Their unsuccessful attempts to tamp down the hateful rhetoric on their platforms send a mixed message to kids. Are tech companies really that dedicated to free speech, or do they just want more users? On the other side are fringe sites like Gab and 4Chan whose no-holds-barred forums test the boundaries of free speech -- which the companies defend as fiercely as their offensive views. But when kids see the horrific race-, religion-, and gender-based attacks committed in the real world by members of online extremist groups, they must wonder why adults can't stop these hate crimes.\n\nLet's be clear: The internet didn't create hate speech. Although it may change some people's minds, the internet (and specifically social media) simply provides a place for people to express themselves. But the idea that exposure to hateful ideas is a necessary evil for the right to say whatever you wish doesn't account for the role of the internet itself. The online world is rife with false information, which is easily created, easily distributed, and easily believed by those who want their own hateful ideas confirmed. And remember, tech companies profit off connecting and engaging people -- and nothing gets people going like inflammatory ideas.\n\nSomewhere in this mix are your kids, who are stumbling into online spaces that are confusing, scary, and shaky. We can't -- and shouldn't -- rely on the tech companies to figure it out. We don't have that much time. And plus, they have too much skin in the game. Ultimately, hate speech is an area where sharing your own family's values -- around compassion and tolerance, appropriate communication, and empathy toward other -- sets a stable path forward for your kids to follow even in unsettled times. Here are some ideas for you to discuss with your kids and tips to handle hate speech.", "(CNN) The existence of more than a dozen supposedly secret North Korean missile bases should come as a surprise to nobody -- certainly not the United States or South Korea.\n\nBoth have access to military intelligence that far exceeds what is available in the private sector.\n\nIf anything, the latest findings of a Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), only underscore the vast, messy complexities of stalled denuclearization talks, and raise further questions about the true impact of the historic June 12 summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe CSIS report used satellite imagery to locate the site of \"undeclared\" North Korean missile bases, notably Sakkanmol, an operational missile base equipped with short-range ballistic missiles that could \"easily accommodate\" medium-range ballistic warheads.\n\nThe New York Times (NYT) first reported the CSIS imagery with the headline \" In North Korea, Missile Bases Suggest a Great Deception .\"\n\nThe Blue House said Tuesday the existence of the missile sites was \"nothing new\" and rejected the use of the word \"deception\" by the Times and similar framing of the story by other news outlets, including CNN, citing a risk of undermining sensitive talks.\n\n\"Talk of 'secrets' or 'undeclared' or 'deception' can possibly bring misunderstanding at this moment when there is a need for US North Korea dialogue, because it can block the talks and undermine the opening of negotiation,\" the Blue House official said.\n\nThe official said North Korea had not previously pledged to close the Sakkanmol Missile Base, the focus of the CSIS report, saying \"There had been no treaty or negotiation that mandated closing the missile base.\"\n\nIt's true that the North Korean missile program was never included in the Singapore statement signed by both leaders, and would not appear to breach any other agreements signed by Pyongyang.\n\nIn the vaguely worded agreement, Trump and Kim pledged to build a \"lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\" and to \"work toward complete denuclearization\" of the peninsula.\n\nPyongyang is not violating that pledge by continuing to operate missile sites. In fact, most analysts agree Kim would be foolish to dismantle active facilities without a signed agreement.\n\nIn his New Year's address , the North Korean leader called on his nation to bolster its nuclear deterrent by mass producing missiles and nuclear warheads.\n\nKim is just doing exactly what he promised.\n\nTangible results?\n\nFrom the moment the June 12 statement was signed, experts voiced skepticism about the lack of specifics and questioned whether the deal would yield any tangible results.\n\nUnsurprisingly, five months of sporadic talks have led to little, if any, progress on the key issue of denuclearization. This is largely due to vastly different views in Pyongyang and Washington over how to achieve it.\n\nNorth Korea has long viewed denuclearization as a series of reciprocal steps taken over a long period of time, with both sides making concessions along the way.\n\nThe Trump administration insists on \" complete denuclearization \" of North Korea and the elimination of its ballistic missile programs upfront -- a nonstarter for a nation that remains deeply suspicious of the outside world and would never leave itself strategically vulnerable simply for the promise of economic gain.\n\nNorth Korean rhetoric has noticeably sharpened recently. State media warned again this month that Pyongyang might be forced to resume nuclear development if sanctions are not eased.\n\nUS ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, and other Trump administration officials, have repeatedly stated North Korea has done nothing to warrant the economic relief it demands.\n\nNorth Korean media has called US actions \" conniving psychological tactics.\"\n\nTrust issues\n\nWhat little trust may have developed this year between the two longtime enemies seems to be quickly evaporating, as evidenced by North Korea's abrupt cancellation of talks last week in New York between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his negotiating counterpart, former North Korean spymaster Kim Yong Chol.\n\nBut even as recently as last week, President Trump said there is \"no rush\" and reiterated the misleading claims that his historic diplomacy has neutralized the North Korean nuclear and missile threat.\n\nIn reality, Kim's arsenal remains as potent as ever -- albeit far less public.\n\nThis fact is well known to US intelligence, and has been acknowledged by members of the Trump administration, though not publicly by the President himself, who is known to favor optics over substance.\n\nAnd in terms of optics, there has been a dramatic shift.\n\nKeeping up appearances\n\nAs I witnessed first-hand on my 19th trip to North Korea in September , propaganda images celebrating Kim's nuclear program no longer line the streets of Pyongyang. Intercontinental ballistic missiles notably did not roll through Kim Il Sung Square during a military parade to mark the nation's 70th anniversary.\n\nIn May, we were invited to witness the destruction of tunnel entrances at North Korea's only known nuclear test site , a largely cosmetic and reversible step, analysts said, perhaps aimed more at building President Trump's confidence than achieving complete and irreversible denuclearization.\n\nThe strategy may be working for Kim, at least in terms of his relationship with the US President. Merely keeping his arsenal out of sight, and continuing a yearlong suspension of missile launches and nuclear tests, has thus far been enough to earn the praise of Trump, who has touted the Korean d\u00e9tente as a major foreign policy win and even claimed in September that he and Kim \" fell in love .\"\n\nBut an official with knowledge of the North Korean position on denuclearization told me last week that the political power shift in Washington after the midterms only reinforces existing North Korean concerns that Kim's government would be left vulnerable if it agreed to denuclearize upfront, as the US insists, only to face a politically weakened Trump administration unable to deliver on its promises.\n\nIn other words, North Korea's missiles and nuclear warheads are not going anywhere, anytime soon.\n\nThe latest developments only threaten to further erode this fragile relationship.\n\nAnd the South Korean response shows just how delicately it's being handled.", "Written by Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN\n\nIf you happen to visit the ancient Isle of Man, you might bump into miniature buildings that evoke the island's rich fairy folklore.\n\nWith their intricate, quaint design and astonishing details, the fairy houses and castles have appeared on hillsides and woods of the mythical island.\n\nCourtesy of Mikael Buck\n\nBut more are still to be found, according to the project's creators, the Swedish art collective Anonymouse MMX\n\n\"We built 4... that people know of,\" Anonymouse's Yasha Mousekewitz told CNN, adding that the project \" aims to \"bring a tiny bit of magic for those walking by... drawing inspiration from Astrid Lindgren, Beatrix Potter and Disney.\"\n\nCourtesy of Mikael Buck\n\nMousekewitz added that Isle of Man's mythology and folklore was an exciting source of inspiration for the collective.\n\n\"The Isle of Man has a long history with fairies, and their appearance and demeanor is not unlike those in Swedish folklore so we quickly found a kinship with that,\" Mousekewitz said. \"We've visited the isle on multiple occasions and tried to research it as best as we could.

That's bigger than Japan's annual gross domestic product at the end of the second quarter \u2014 and more than five times the size of Apple's ( APPL ) market value.\n\nThe years of heavy stimulus have warped parts of Japan's financial markets and left the central bank with dwindling options to juice growth if a new crisis hits. But the splurge is unlikely to end anytime soon.\n\nThe Bank of Japan has accumulated most of the enormous stockpile of assets since its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, embarked on an unprecedented plan in 2013 to buy vast amounts of government bonds. Its goal was to push down interest rates, encouraging consumers and businesses to spend more money.\n\nInflation still isn't anywhere near Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's target.\n\nThe move was similar to the extraordinary monetary easing programs launched in the United States and Europe in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

Others that were surveyed included Handmade Burger Company and TGI Fridays, both of which were among several companies that do not publish nutrition information about their shakes.\n\nBattling obesity\n\nThe UK has been battling the rising tide of childhood obesity, with almost a third of children aged 12-15 overweight or obese. This is not only associated with social and psychological problems but also a host of serious diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer.\n\nIn August 2016, Public Health England (PHE) set out its approach to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by launching a structured sugar reduction program to remove sugar from everyday products. All sectors of the food and drinks industry were challenged to cut sugar content by at least 20% by 2020.\n\n\"Despite milkshakes being incorporated into Public Health England's sugar reduction program as part of the government's childhood obesity plan, it is clear from our survey that much more needs to be done than a 20% reduction, said Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar. \"These very high-calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffer from tooth decay -- that is not acceptable.\"\n\nThe group is urging health authorities to go further by calling for mandatory traffic light colored nutrition labeling across all menus. In addition, the group has called for an outright ban on the sale of milkshakes containing more than 300 calories per serving.\n\nAccording to the charity's research, nine out of 10 milkshakes sold in UK supermarkets would be eligible for a red label for the excessive level of sugar they contain. Nevertheless, these products contained far less sugar than the freakshakes sold in fast-food outlets.\n\n\"Milkshakes can contain significant amounts of sugar,\" said Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE in response to the report. \"The food and drink industry -- including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers -- has a key role in helping to tackle this by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nA spokesman for Toby Carvery said: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children.\"\n\nThe chain is \"very mindful of our role in helping guests make informed decisions\" and makes public the nutrition information for its menu, the spokesperson said.

Some social media users say that drinking celery juice has cured them of mental health problems and infertility . Others credit it with healing eczema that nothing else could cure. One website even claims that it can prevent cancer. Stories touting its \"potent healing properties\" have appeared on Gwyneth Paltrow's controversial lifestyle site, Goop\n\nBut are these health benefits real?\n\n\"It's not a surprise to me that anything a celebrity or an influencer with lots of followers would mention would get a lot of attention,\" Lisa Drayer, a registered dietitian who writes about nutrition for CNN, said of the celery juice trend.\n\nCelery certainly has health benefits, according to Drayer. \"There are some beneficial flavonoids that have been discovered in celery that have been shown to perhaps play a role in reducing inflammation in the brain or reducing age-related memory decline,\" she said.\n\nCelery also provides a healthy dose of fiber, as well as vitamins C and K and potassium, and it is a very low-calorie snack.\n\n\"A 5-inch stalk has only three calories, so that's very low-calorie. A cup of chopped celery has only 20 calories,\" she said. But turning it into juice can change this.\n\n\"Any time you concentrate a vegetable or a fruit, it's going to be higher in sugars and carbohydrates and calories,\" Drayer said. A cup of juiced celery jumps to 42 calories.\n\n\"I'm much more likely to recommend celery as a snack. It's crunchy, it's low-calorie, and it will fill you up,\" Drayer said. In fact, she often advises it this for people who are trying to lose weight.\n\nResearch around the benefits of celery and celery juice is limited, she noted, and we \"really can't say there's anything magical about celery that's going to help cure cancer or help you to quickly shed pounds.\"\n\nJuicing celery has other drawbacks beyond raising the calorie count.\n\n\"Juicing celery (and any other vegetable) strips away the beneficial fiber that helps you feel fuller longer, improves intestinal health and feeds the health bacteria in your gut,\" Malina Malkani , registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , wrote in an email.\n\nCelery juice does lend itself to \"gorgeous\" social media images.\n\nAlthough she agrees that there are several health benefits to eating celery, she also agrees that there is little evidence to back up the claims made by some supporters of the juice trend.\n\n\"There isn't much scientific evidence to support the majority of health claims about drinking celery juice,\" she said. \"In general, if a food fad, diet or service sounds too good to be true, you can assume that it is.\"\n\nThere's something else about celery juice that could explain its popularity on social media: \"The beautiful green color of celery juice also lends itself to gorgeous photos in an Instagram feed,\" said Malkani, who is also creator of the Wholitarian Lifestyle, which promotes foods that \"are nutrient-dense, minimally processed, plant-based and as close as possible to their original state when first harvested.\" However, she pointed out that this doesn't mean there is evidence behind the health claims.\n\nNeither Drayer nor Malkani thinks that drinking celery juice is problematic, but they stress that it is probably not a miracle cure.\n\n\"If you enjoy the flavor of celery juice, have at it!\" Malkani said. \"But don't jump on the Instagram bandwagon, hoping that celery juice will be the cure-all you've been searching for all your life.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBoth suggest that celery should be eaten as part of a balanced and inclusive diet and that everyone should be wary of celebrity-endorsed food trends.\n\n\"In general, just because a celebrity is touting a food or a beverage for particular reasons doesn't mean it's backed by sound science, even beyond celery juice,\" Drayer said. \"What I always tell people is that there's no one magical food or beverage that will be able to totally make over your health or cure an illness.\"", "(CNN) Tennis great Serena Williams has been named GQ's Woman of the Year -- but the magazine's cover has caused a stir on social media with many questioning why \"Woman\" was in quotes.\n\nThe 37-year-old, called \"The Champion\" by the magazine, features in one of four covers of December's 'Men of the Year' issue wearing a black long-sleeve turtleneck leotard.\n\nGQ, which first made women part of its Men of the Year honorees in 2003, included the American alongside actors Michael B Jordan, Henry Golding and Jonah Hill.\n\nWilliams features in one of four covers in the December issue of GQ\n\nIn February, Williams told CNN she almost died giving birth to her daughter last year, yet within months she was back training and returned to the sport earlier this year, reaching both the Wimbledon and US Open finals.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl pr\u00edncipe no es mencionado espec\u00edficamente por su nombre durante la grabaci\u00f3n, de acuerdo con el Times\n\nRiad sostiene que ni Bin Salman ni su padre, el rey Salman, sab\u00edan de la operaci\u00f3n contra Khashoggi\n\n(CNN) -

But it can take years for chains to get all of their franchises on the same page.\n\nMcDonald's is in a unique position, said Oches, because franchisers trust the company to deliver results.\n\n\"New store prototypes, remodels ... those things are expensive,\" Oches said. It's easier for a brand like McDonald's to convince franchises to spend that money. For others, it's more of a struggle.\n\nWendy's has spent the better part of a decade upgrading its stores to include lounge seating, digital menu boards and Wi-Fi. The company said this month that it's remodeled nearly half of its stores. Wendy's is also thinking about other improvements to stores: Last year the company announced a new series of smart design restaurants that use less energy than its traditional stores.\n\nBurger King may have also struggled because unlike Wendy's ( WEN ) and McDonald's, it's part of a holding company.\n\nBurger King and Tim Hortons merged in 2014 to form Restaurant Brands, which snapped up Popeye's last year.\n\n\"When you become this enormous multi-brand holding company ... [it's] hard to focus on details,\" said Sam Oches, editorial director of Food News Media at QSR magazine.\n\nCatching up\n\nTo regain its footing, Burger King needs to increase traffic to stores and boost how much customers spend on regular orders.\n\n\"Regular trade is the bread and butter,\" said Saunders. \"The marketing and the seasonal occasions are much less important.\"\n\nBurger King is still in the early stages of the project, Schwartz noted in October, adding that there are already pilot restaurants operating in Miami.\n\n\"To refresh a store, that takes a long time,\" said Oches. \"So the fact that we're still at the very early stages of this tells me that they have a long road.\"", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

airborne sightings of at least one \"very bright\" unidentified flying object were seen last Friday, according to air traffic control audio logs.\n\nChatter between airline pilots and Irish air traffic control focused briefly on the sightings, with at least four aviators confirming that they'd seen the phenomenon.\n\nThe exchange began when one pilot asked Shannon air traffic control if there was nearby military activity. When the air traffic controller replied in the negative, the pilot said that she had seen something moving \"so fast.\"\n\nRelated content Pilot's spectacular photos taken from an airplane cockpit\n\n\"It came up on our left hand side (rapidly veered) to the north, we saw a bright light and it just disappeared at a very high speed ... we were just wondering. We didn't think it was a likely collision course .. (just wondering) what it could be,\" she said.\n\nA pilot on Virgin Flight 76 added that his flight crew had seen \"two bright lights at 11 o'clock (which) seemed to bank over to the right and then climb away at speed.\"\n\nSupersonic sighting\n\nAnother pilot chimed in, saying the speed that the object -- or objects -- were traveling was \"absolutely astronomical, like Mach 2 or something.\"\n\nCommercial jetliners travel at a cruising speed of around 430 knots, or Mach 0.64. The F-18, the mainstay fighter of the US Air Force, can travel at up to Mach 2.5 .\n\nHowever, the possibility of little green men visiting the Emerald Isle seemed to be a fanciful explanation.\n\nOne pilot chimed in that it was in all likelihood a \"meteor or some kind of object re-entry appears to be multiple objects following the same sort of trajectory... very bright where we were,\" and an aviation expert told Irish media that he also thought that the sighting was likely to be a meteor.\n\nRelated content Meet the 24-year-old pilot taking off on Instagram\n\n\"In all probability, they were meteorites,\" aviation journalist Gerry Byrne told the Irish Examiner\n\n\"It's not uncommon for meteorites to come in at a low angle, a low trajectory into the Earth's atmosphere.\"",

relaunched the world's longest nonstop scheduled passenger service , flying from Singapore to New York, has now capped a successful year with a new accolade.\n\nThe carrier has pipped Air New Zealand to be named Airline of the Year by Australia-based aviation safety and product rating agency AirlineRatings, in the company's annual Airline Excellence Awards\n\nIt's a big upset for Air New Zealand, which has spent five consecutive years in the top spot.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nThe awards celebrate the carriers soaring highest -- from the swankiest first-class suites to the comfiest economy seats, via the roomiest lounges and tastiest culinary offerings.\n\n\"For years Singapore Airlines has been the gold standard and now it is back to its best leading in passenger innovations and new state-of-the-art aircraft models,\" says AirlineRatings Editor-in-Chief Geoffrey Thomas.\n\n\"The editors said that the competition for top spot was tight with Air New Zealand, Qantas Airways and Qatar Airways just being nudged out,\" he adds.\n\nIn-flight product\n\nQatar Airways was praised for its culinary offerings. Qatar Airways courtesy of AirlineRatings.com\n\nThe awards are compiled using major international industry and government safety audits, plus 12 key criteria including fleet age, passenger reviews, profitability, investment ratings, staff relations and product offerings.\n\n\"In our objective analysis Singapore Airlines came out number one in many of our audit criteria, which is a great performance,\" explains Thomas.\n\nEmirates' inflight entertainment was also awarded. Emirates courtesy of AirlineRatings.com\n\nMeanwhile Qatar Airways, which placed number four on the overall ranking, saw its great food and luxury offerings secure Best Catering and Best Business Class.\n\n\"The airline's Qsuite is a first-class experience in business class,\" says AirlineRatings. \"It leaves little to chance and our judges rated it as one of the best overall business-class products they had seen. It sets a standard to which some airlines can only aspire.\"\n\nAussie airline Qantas picked up the Best Lounges gong for the second year.\n\nWhile Air New Zealand may no longer be reigning champion, the airline was recognized for Excellence in Long Haul Travel (Pacific).\n\nVirgin Australia won Best Cabin Crew. Virgin Australia courtesy of AirlineRatings.com\n\nAirlineRatings also praised Emirates, number six on the overall round-up, for its continued pioneering of top inflight entertainment options.\n\n\"Emirates was one of the pioneers of IFE, and one of the first to install seatback videos in economy,\" says AirlineRatings. \"Today its IFE platform ICE is in a class of its own.\"\n\nEconomy options were also awarded.

The first trailer for the live-action \"Detective Pikachu\" movie, starring Ryan Reynolds as the walking, talking and distinctly furry sleuth, has been released -- and it's divided fans of the franchise.\n\nThe film, based on a 2016 spin-off game, recasts the most popular Pok\u00e9mon species as an amateur crime-solver.\n\nIt marks the first foray into live-action for the wildly popular Japanese franchise, and will give enthusiasts the chance to hear Pikachu saying more than just \"pika pika\" for the first time.\n\nI think we all knew I'd wind up as a miniature detective repeatedly saying the same two words.

California wildfires\n\nCalifornia's most destructive wildfire is now also its deadliest . The death toll from the Camp Fire in Northern California rose to 42, as the remains of 13 more people were found. With two people killed in Southern California's Woolsey Fire, the statewide death toll stands at 44 . And with about 100 people still missing, fears are strong that the number of dead may rise even more. Most people killed in the Camp Fire died in the town of Paradise, which was destroyed. Harrowing tales of close calls and fiery escapes were shared by survivors. So, what caused these fires? No one's sure yet, but California regulators are investigating two utility companies that reported incidents close in time and location to the start of the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\n2. Politics\n\nThe midterms were a week ago, but results are still rolling in. Democrats got another big win with Kyrsten Sinema's victory in the Arizona Senate race. Sinema's triumph over Republican Martha McSally gives the Dems a seat the GOP had held for 24 years. And it helps soften the blow of Democrats losing high-profile Senate races in Texas, Tennessee and Missouri.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sinema gives tribute to McCain in victory speech Replay More Videos ...

Their calls came as Republicans dropped millions in purple and red districts to tie Democrats to the longtime San Francisco liberal, a woman depicted as the face of the resistance in ads splashed across TV screens all over America.\n\nThe candidates faced immense pressure to distance themselves from her. Abigail Spanberger, who beat incumbent Republican David Brat in Virginia, was crystal clear. \"I won't vote for her under any circumstances,\" Spanberger told Roll Call, and she told CNN on Monday that she wants a leader who would \"heal some of the divisions in our communities.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, Joe Cunningham, who defeated Republican Katie Arrington, announced his position early on Twitter.\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs new leadership now. If elected, I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. Time to move forward and win again,\" he tweeted, telling CNN on Monday that on the speaker issue, \"My position has been the same since day one, and that has not changed.\"\n\nAnd in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin, who defeated incumbent Republican Mike Bishop, told her local station prior to being elected, \"I have made very clear, publicly that I would not support Nancy Pelosi as our next speaker.\"\n\nBut as the freshmen come to Washington this week, they are also under growing pressure from their caucus to avoid a messy floor fight and to back Pelosi after she's expected to win the Democratic nomination for speaker later this month. If they don't, they risk provoking chaos in their new majority -- while alienating themselves with their new colleagues and party leaders who could help them ascend in their caucus and land plum committee spots.\n\nPublicly, Pelosi was nonchalant during the campaign. Her message to those candidates: \"Just win, baby.\" She went on to raise more than $6.7 million for the party's program that supports candidates aiming to flip their districts for Democrats -- many of whom opposed Pelosi. Overall, Pelosi raised $129 million for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nThe midterms are over, and as those elected candidates head to Washington and with no challenger willing to step forward to run against her, they'll continue to face pressure to either carry through with their campaign promise to oppose Pelosi, or unite with the rest of the caucus and support her in the end. Neither Cunningham nor Spanberger would name an alternative candidate to Pelosi whom they would support.\n\n\"I don't know who may step forward, but I really do think that it's incredibly important that if we are going to change the conversation in Washington we need to change the people having it and directing it,\" Spanberger told CNN. \"It's not in any way a negative assessment that the job that anybody is doing but at times cyclical change, I believe, is a good thing.\"\n\nCunningham is going to wait and meet fellow members in DC soon, saying he can \"name on one hand\" the number of Congressmen and women that he has met before.\n\nTechnically, they could do both. The freshmen could oppose Pelosi in the initial caucus vote for speaker nominee on November 28. Pelosi only needs support from the majority of the caucus to clinch the nomination, so she can afford to lose these members in that first round of voting.\n\nBut those who oppose Pelosi initially will be urged to unify with the rest of the caucus and support her during the final floor vote in January. On Monday, a group of 14 Democrats issued a letter urging the caucus to stand behind the eventual nominee on the floor. Powerful outside groups, like End Citizens United and Emily's List, have also expressed support for Pelosi.\n\nSome incoming freshmen have already been clear they will not support Pelosi under any scenario -- \"I am not going to vote for her. No ifs, ands or buts, under any circumstances,\" Max Rose of New York said Monday on Fox -- while others haven't been as specific.\n\nMany of the incoming freshmen are already getting calls from both sides, offering them encouragement and support as they navigate their new environment.\n\n\"We will need to do what's best for our districts, no matter who's calling us,\" Slotkin told CNN on Monday.\n\nCNN projects Democrats so far have a 225-seat majority, so Pelosi would need to shore up support from over 90% of her caucus to reach that 218 threshold on the floor.\n\nTraditionally, that's easy. There are rarely few defections from the party of a speaker nominee during the final vote. Even when 63 Democrats voted against Pelosi in the leadership election in 2016, almost all of them ended up voting for her on the floor.\n\nOne Democratic strategist and former top official at the DCCC -- who asked not to be named due to their work with 2018 races -- said new members will still be able to say they opposed Pelosi in the caucus vote, but opposing her on the floor could help Republicans.\n\n\"Voting against her in caucus is what they promised to do - to try to get someone else,\" the strategist said. \"Voting against her on the floor is a vote for Trump and (House Republican Leader Kevin) McCarthy, and that's not what they told voters. In fact, it would effectively overturn the election result.\"\n\nDemocrats who oppose Pelosi don't have to vote for the Republican nominee on the floor -- they can voice any name they like. But if enough Democrats don't vote for the Democratic nominee, then it could ultimately help tip the scales for the Republican choice.\n\nBut Pelosi may not necessarily need 218 votes after all. Due to procedural rules, if some members vote \"present,\" that could lower the threshold and she could win with fewer than 218 votes.\n\nPelosi detractors argue that urging these freshmen to support Pelosi on the floor could be politically damaging for them, given that it's their first vote as members of Congress.\n\n\"Leadership asking new members to make a choice: break campaign promise on your 1st vote, or stand up to a status quo that will punish you,\" Rep. Seth Moulton posted Friday on Twitter. \"We've been fielding lots of calls from incumbents. We're the voices of a silent majority who want new leadership & to protect new members.\"\n\nThe caucus is expected to debate a proposal this week that would change the caucus rules and make it more difficult for anyone to secure the speaker nomination, including Pelosi. Incoming freshmen, in town for orientation this week, will get a first-hand look at the party's internal dispute over its leadership on Capitol Hill -- a split that many want to avoid fresh after a major victory.\n\nA day after winning back the House last week, Pelosi was boasting about the unprecedented number of women who were elected to the House. A reporter pointed out that some of those women say they won't support her.\n\n\"What I say to those women: Congratulations on your election,\" she said. \"Welcome.\"", "Late-night comedians reacted to a photo of President Trump grinning as Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at a ceremony in Paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.", "The results of last week's election demonstrated how powerfully national trends now shape election outcomes in every region. The election produced remarkably consistent divides along demographic and geographic lines in states as diverse as Arizona, Georgia and Texas on one side, and Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on the other. Though some important regional differences remained, voters who shared the same characteristics or resided in similar places largely voted the same way no matter what state they lived in.\n\nIn virtually every state, Democrats last Tuesday displayed a clear advantage in densely populated, culturally and racially diverse white-collar metropolitan areas, while Republicans relied on elevated margins in the preponderantly white, religiously traditional, smaller places beyond them. In almost all cases, the outcome in each state was determined less by how much they varied from that persistent pattern than by how much of each group was present in the state's electorate to begin with.\n\nThe continued nationalization of American politics threatens greater polarization and social tension as the lines harden between these two distinct political coalitions. But paradoxically, it means that the party that can generate the most exceptions to these solidifying trends may be the one most likely to control Congress and the White House.\n\nWhether measured by demography or geography, the 2018 election produced remarkably consistent patterns.\n\nA surprise twist among older voters\n\nViewed by age, the results offered a vivid portrait of the price Republicans are paying among younger voters as Trump redefines the party in his confrontational image.\n\nThe exit poll measuring preferences in House elections found that Democrats carried fully two thirds of voters aged 18-29. That was their best showing with them in exit polls since at least 1986 (narrowly exceeding their level even in former President Barack Obama's sweeping 2008 victory) and a big improvement on Hillary Clinton's 55% among them in 2016. And preliminary calculations indicate that youth turnout may have been half again as large in 2018 as it was in 2014, the most recent midterm.\n\nEven more striking was the consistency of the Democratic advantage around the nation. The Democratic candidate won voters aged 18-29 in all 21 Senate races with an exit poll except for Indiana, where Joe Donnelly tied Republican Mike Braun. (These figures do not include the exit poll in California, where two Democrats ran against each other after claiming the top spots in last June's state top-two primary.) Senate Democrats carried about three-fifths or more of these younger voters in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota (both for incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, who was elected in a special election), Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Democrats also reached at least 60% with them in governor's races in Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In the California governor's race, Democrat Gavin Newsom carried 69% of younger voters.\n\nJust as important, the Democratic advantage extended up the age ladder. Against Trump in 2016, Clinton carried only 51% of voters aged 30-44; while Trump won just 41% of them, a substantial 8% scattered to third-party candidates.\n\nThis time, those voters consolidated behind Democrats. In the national House exit poll, Democrats won 58%. The margins weren't always as large in the Senate races with exit polls. But every Democratic Senate candidate carried the voters in this age group except for Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. In states from Pennsylvania, Minnesota (both races) and Wisconsin to Florida and Nevada, Democrats carried about three-fifths of these voters. (The Arizona exit poll results combined voters aged 18-44: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema carried 59% of the combined group.)\n\nRepublicans in turn consistently performed better with older voters -- though with a surprising crack in their armor. In the national House exit poll, voters aged 45-64 split almost exactly evenly between the two parties. But Republicans won them, often convincingly, in most of the closely contested Senate races, including Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. That group of older workers, often described as the \"anxious generation\" facing the final years before retirement, has emerged as a key Republican constituency.\n\nThe results among seniors, though, were competitive. About four-fifths of today's seniors are white and they have moved right in recent elections: Trump won them in 2016, and Republicans have consistently carried them in recent congressional contests, exit polls have found. But this year they split about evenly in the national House exit poll (48% for Democrats versus 50% for Republicans) and in the state races they scattered more than most groups.\n\nRepublicans won them convincingly in the contested Senate races in Florida, Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, Texas and Nevada; but Democrats won them with solid margins in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, carried them narrowly in North Dakota and West Virginia and essentially split them in Montana and Wisconsin. (In the tight Arizona Senate race, Republican Martha McSally comfortably carried voters in the combined category of 45 and older.)\n\nThe racial and educational divide grows\n\nAcross the country, the results converged along educational lines too.\n\nIn the national House exit poll, Republicans carried 61% of whites without a college education, Trump's best group. It's difficult to precisely compare that to previous years, because the exit polls changed the way they weight the results for education. What is clear from last week's results is the Republican advantage with these voters persisted in all regions: Klobuchar in Minnesota was the only Democratic Senate candidate to win most white voters without a college education, although Tester and Manchin came close.\n\nBoth Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who had shown appeal to these voters earlier in their careers, each carried only about on -third of them while losing their Senate seats to Republican challengers. In southern states, where many non-college whites are also evangelical Christians, the numbers were even more lopsided: Ron DeSantis carried almost two thirds of them against African-American Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor's race; Ted Cruz carried nearly three fourths of them in his Texas Senate race against Beto O'Rourke; and Brian Kemp won over four fifths of them against African-American Democrat Stacey Abrams in their Georgia governor's contest.\n\nDemocrats, by contrast, carried 53% of whites with a college education in the national House exit polls. Again, it's difficult to precisely compare that with earlier results because of the changes in the poll's methodology. But on Tuesday Democrats won these voters in 13 Senate races and tied in another (North Dakota). Democrats won about three fifths or more of college-educated white women in Senate races from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, to Nevada, Florida and Montana. White-collar whites also helped Democrats win governorships in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nevada.\n\nThe persistence of these demographic trends through all corners of the country largely explains the lopsided geography in results for the House of Representatives. Republicans suffered very few dents in their dominance of small town and rural House seats last week. Democrats won only three districts whose rural population ranks in the top 20% of the House, while losing two of their own in those ranks, according to tabulations by CNN producer Aaron Kessler.\n\nBut the palpable recoil from Trump among white-collar voters in all regions explains why the GOP losses in suburban House seats extended so widely. It was perhaps not a surprise that Democrats ousted many of the last House Republicans who had survived for years in suburbs of otherwise blue-trending metro areas, such as Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. But the breadth of the movement toward Democrats among well-educated white voters explains why the GOP also lost suburban House seats last week in Atlanta, Charleston, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Des Moines, Oklahoma City, Orange County (CA), and possibly Salt Lake City, all places that had earlier resisted the white collar Democratic tide. Of the 33 Republican-held seats that CNN has called for the Democrats, 26 (or nearly four-fifths) are in districts where the share of college graduates exceeds the national average, according to Kessler's calculations.\n\nThese are the new swing states\n\nThe result is a politics that is converging across different regions. Political analysts, with justification, are accustomed to thinking of Pennsylvania as a quintessential swing state and Texas as the foundation of the Republican coalition. But the results in both places on Tuesday shared many similarities. In both states, Republicans continued to run very well in small towns and rural places (though Democrat Bob Casey in Pennsylvania regained ground in such mid-sized blue-collar communities as Erie and Scranton). And just like Casey, Beto O'Rourke ran up the score in diverse and younger urban places (he won each of the counties including Austin, Dallas and Houston by 200,000 votes or more and amassed a 100,000-plus margin in San Antonio), and made marked gains in previously red-leaning suburban areas around those metropolitan centers, from Collin and Denton counties near Dallas to Williamson and Hayes outside of Austin. Until now, Republicans had dominated both the urban and rural parts of Texas since the mid-1990s. In terms of its political alignment -- a suddenly competitive contest between growing Democratic strength in metro areas and undiminished Republican dominance beyond them -- 2018 may be the year that Texas rejoined the union.\n\nYet for all the consistency of these geographic and demographic trends, the results in the 2020 presidential race may be shaped most by each party's ability to defy them -- or at least to bend them at the margins. In the Rust Belt states that tipped the 2016 election to Trump -- especially Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- Democrats won both Senate and governor's races last week by restoring an old advantage that Trump had largely erased: In all three states, the Democratic nominees ran slightly better among whites without a college degree than their party did almost anywhere else. They'll need to continue that revival to recapture the states in two years from Trump, who may present a more formidable challenge in them than the Republicans on last week's ballot.\n\nConversely, despite the Democratic gains in Southern suburbs, Republicans continued to run better among college-educated white voters in Florida, Texas and Georgia than they did in most places. (Although exit polls weren't available in North Carolina, the voting results there point to a similar conclusion.) To hold those states in 2020, Trump will need to prevent any further erosion, even as white-collar voters elsewhere appear to be hardening in their hostility to him.\n\nEven in a politics increasingly homogenized by the same national trends, these small regional variations could provide the tipping point for the epic confrontation approaching in 2020.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN Espa\u00f1ol) - Gracias a su investigaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1rea de la agricultura para mejorar las pr\u00e1cticas en el manejo de cultivos de banano, el acad\u00e9mico ecuatoriano \u00c1ngel Llerena fue nominado al Premio Nobel de Medicina este a\u00f1o.\n\nFue p\u00fablico en Ecuador pese a que, seg\u00fan las reglas del premio, los nombres de los preseleccionados no se pueden conocer sino hasta 50 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s.\n\nUna nominaci\u00f3n que ha generado inter\u00e9s por el uso del ozono como sustituto de los pesticidas para combatir la Sigatoka negra en las plantaciones bananeras.

Their energy, perspective and determination will reshape one of the power centers in a man's town. These are the stories of Badass Women all around Washington . \u2014 Dana Bash, Bridget Nolan, Rachel Smolkin & Abigail Crutchfield\n\nThere are the obvious reasons, not the least of which is her place in the history books as the first female House speaker.\n\nBut it is more than that. It is how she got there -- excelling in a man's world and playing in what was traditionally a boy's club of politics -- as well as, and often better than, her male counterparts.\n\nShe's had plenty of detractors and naysayers, even among Democrats. But she is seen as effective, so much so that even her political opponents -- mostly men -- have repeatedly told me over the years that they marvel at her leadership of her caucus.\n\nFor all the interviews Pelosi does, she doesn't talk often about her struggles and challenges as a woman. But here, she spoke quite candidly about it all.\n\n\"I get some names called, because if you're effective as a woman, then they have to undermine you, because that's a real threat,\" Pelosi told us in an interview.\n\n\"I'm probably more of a target than anybody, except for somebody who runs for president,\" she said.\n\nTalk about an understatement. For years Pelosi has been the ultimate Republican boogeyman -- or boogeywoman, as it were. She's a frequent target of Republican ire for being too far to the left -- and she's also a target among progressives for not being far left enough.\n\nSome fellow Democrats are now distancing themselves from Pelosi, promising not to vote for her as House speaker again even though her party has won a majority in the House of Representatives in the midterm elections and shifted the power dynamics in President Donald Trump's Washington.\n\nSo far, no one has emerged to challenge her. And Pelosi is unmoved.\n\n\"I have a broad base of support in the country, financially, politically, and otherwise, which is valuable to our caucus,\" argued Pelosi.\n\n\"None of us is indispensable, but some of us are just better at our jobs than others,\" she added matter-of-factly.\n\nShe toots her own horn to show women how it's done\n\nAs she was telling me how qualified she is to be House speaker again, it struck me how unusual it is to hear a woman talk so confidently about how uniquely qualified she is for a job or position she is seeking. Though I am no shrinking violet, it is often hard for me to toot my own horn that way, something I admitted in the moment to Pelosi.\n\n\"For most women, frankly, myself included, it is hard to say those words, 'I am uniquely qualified. I deserve this. I earned this. I can do this better than anyone else,'\" I told Pelosi.\n\n\"You know why I do it? I do it, because I want women to see that you do not get pushed around. You don't run away from the fight,\" she responded.\n\nWhere it all started: Little Italy, Baltimore\n\nI have covered Pelosi for years, and always wondered how she learned to operate and excel in politics the way she does.\n\nFor the answer, we went with Pelosi back to where it all started: Little Italy, in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was born to US Rep. Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and Anunciata D'Alesandro.\n\nWhen she was six years old, her father became Baltimore's first Catholic mayor.\n\n\"He leapfrogged over the Irish. That was a big deal, but it took political organizing to do that,\" Pelosi explained in an interview at Sabatino's, an Italian restaurant she frequented with her family growing up.\n\nMuch has been made of her father's influence on her. Less known is her mother's. Anunciata, who also went by Nancy, was an inventor who patented a device to apply steam to the face -- effectively an at home facial.\n\nBut she didn't pursue that passion. She was held back, Pelosi has said, by the times -- and by her father.\n\nInstead, Pelosi's mother helped her father in politics, who was a US representative from Maryland's 3rd Congressional District before he went on to be mayor.\n\n\"My mother was very much a part of the organizing. My father was the orator,\" recalled Pelosi.\n\nHer older brothers said their mother ran what they jokingly called her \"moccasin brigade\" of other women who would go to political events and get the message out.\n\n\"There are two things about what I bring with me from my family in this regard,\" Pelosi said. \"One is to know how to count. That's very important. Count your votes to win the election. Count your votes to win a vote on the floor. The other is listen to your constituents.\"\n\nBut Pelosi says the idea that because she grew up in politics, she always knew that was where she was headed is a myth.\n\n\"People are always saying, 'Oh, she knew when she was a little girl she wanted to run for office.' I never thought of that at all, ever, until I did,\" she insisted.\n\nAfter college, she wanted to go to law school. Instead, like many in her generation, she got married and started a family.\n\n\"When I got married and I had a baby, and then another baby, five in six years,\" Pelosi recalled.\n\nThe Pelosis moved back to husband Paul's hometown of San Francisco. Over the years, she became more and more active in the Democratic Party. But it wasn't until her youngest daughter, Alexandra, was a senior in high school that she ran for an open House seat.\n\nPelosi tells the story that she went to Alexandra and told her she had a chance to run for Congress. She said her daughter's response was \"get a life.\"\n\n\"And I did,\" Pelosi added.\n\nPelosi in 'awe' of female lawmakers with young children\n\nWhether she planned it or not, the path that Pelosi took to the House is the one most women used to follow. Women raised their kids, and then they went into politics. \"I was sequential,\" is how Pelosi explains her experience and that of the few women of her generation who actually ran for office.\n\nBut that's not the case anymore. Historic numbers of women with young children were already serving in the House and Senate before the election, and that will spike even more once the new 116th Congress is sworn in early next year.\n\nShe says she is in awe of the women she serves and works with who are in the throes of parenting.\n\n\"I want more young women in Congress who are in the course of raising their children, because it's important for women in that situation to see someone who shares their experience at the table,\" she said.\n\n\"Being a mom, what are you? You're a diplomat, interpersonal relationships. You're a chef. You're a chauffeur. You're a problem solver. You're a nurse. You're a health care provider. You have so much, and that's just with the children, not to mention the other aspects of family,\" said Pelosi, who notes that motherhood made her much more efficient.\n\n\"I don't think that before I had five children in six years that I used time as effectively as I did as a mom. ... I didn't even have time sometimes to wash my face,\" she laughed, knowing every mother can relate.\n\nThe young kids by her side now are her grandchildren. Two of them, Paul and Thomas, were at the podium for her election night victory speech when Democrats learned they'd retaken control of the House.\n\nNot long ago, Democratic men didn't think much of women in leadership\n\nRight now, a historic 102 women are set to be sworn into the House, and that number could rise even more as a handful of outstanding races are decided.\n\nWhen Pelosi got to the House in 1987, there were only 24 women serving. She says having five older brothers came in handy.\n\n\"Growing up in a family of boys helped me, because I was unimpressed,\" she said.\n\nWhen she first ran for House leadership 18 years ago, her male Democratic colleagues didn't get it.\n\n\"When people came to me and said, 'You should run for leadership,' and I agreed to look at it, then some of the men said, 'Who said she could run?' That was a real motivator.\"\n\nShe also remembers the men being told that \"a lot of the women are supporting Nancy to run.\"\n\nThe men responded by saying, \"'Well, why? Do the women have a list of things they want us to do? Why don't they just make a list and give us the list?' This is the Democratic Party in the year 2000,\" Pelosi recalls, a tone of disbelief still in her voice.\n\nHow does she wield power differently than a man?\n\nPelosi says that after meetings, people ask her, \"Do you understand how different that meeting would have been if a man were conducting it?\"\n\nShe says she is told that she listens more carefully than men who conduct meetings.\n\n\"You build consensus,\" Pelosi adds.\n\nShe used that female sensibility to gather votes for hard-to-pass legislation many times over the years, but passing the Affordable Care Act, more commonly referred to as Obamacare, is probably the prime example.\n\nIt has been widely reported that in January 2010, after Senate Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority when Republican Scott Brown won a special election, many thought passing the Affordable Care Act, which was not going to get GOP votes, was a lost cause. But Pelosi convinced then-President Barack Obama and others in the White House that it was doable -- and, along with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, they got it done.\n\nTo be sure, the GOP backlash contributed to Democrats losing control of the House in 2010 and Pelosi losing the speakership. But it hasn't been repealed, and she still counts that -- getting Democrats to vote yes despite, for many, the political peril, as one of her biggest legislative accomplishments.\n\nHer advice for women transcends politics\n\n\"Have you ever been to a meeting when you're at the table, and a woman makes a suggestion, and then they go to the next person, and then two persons later a man makes the same suggestion, the other gentleman at the table say, 'That's a great idea'\"? Pelosi asked me.\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, because, what woman hasn't had that experience?\n\n\"What I have learned later in life, I've concluded, that the reason that they didn't recognize the merit when a woman suggested it is they didn't even listen. They did not even listen to the woman. That's why I say to people, 'Make sure that you have a give-and-take on what you suggest, because some man's going to get the credit for your idea.'\"\n\nShe says she likely would have stepped down had Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton become president. But when Clinton lost, Pelosi felt compelled to stay on so that there would still be a woman at the table for high-level meetings.\n\nShe calls President Donald Trump \"respectful of the office that I have,\" but notes they didn't have many bipartisan meetings to date.\n\nTrump praised Pelosi last week during his post-midterms news conference in the White House.\n\n\"I gave her a lot of credit, she works very hard and she's worked long and hard,\" he said when asked about opportunities for bipartisanship and working across the aisle. \"I give her a great deal of credit for how she's worked and what she's accomplished.\"\n\nWith her on track to hold the speaker's gavel again next year, that's likely to change -- and it will be up Pelosi to take her own advice for women.\n\n\"You know what the subjects are,\" she said. \"You know how to get it done. Be your authentic self. Be yourself. Know your power.\"", "(CNN) Parts of California have been burning for five days now.\n\nHomes have been destroyed.

I got over to the side of the fire truck, knocked on the doors ... and two firemen came out, picked me up and put me in their fire engine and put a fire blanket on the windows. It was just amazing.\"\n\nBut her ordeal wasn't over. The firefighters said they needed air support or they wouldn't make it. Then, \"out of nowhere,\" Jolly said she saw a bulldozer clear a path for the group.\n\nJolly says when she arrived to work, she and the other nurses had to stay busy helping others.\n\n\"We didn't think about ourselves and our possessions that we just lost.\"\n\n'Where we had beautiful trees, it's now black'\n\nAmber Toney and her mother Susan Miller filmed their escape from the devastating Camp Fire in Paradise. The two spoke with CNN's Dan Simon about the experience.\n\nJUST WATCHED Camp Fire evacuees film harrowing escape Replay More Videos ...

Please, please drive, just please drive,\" Toney says in a shaky voice.\n\n\"I'm trying,\" Miller, 59, says through sobs.\n\nLater in the video, Toney continues trying to calm her mom.\n\n\"It's OK, mama,\" Toney says.\n\n\"I'm so scared,\" Miller responds.\n\nMiller said she'll have nightmares for the rest of her life because of the experience.\n\n\"This was a bucket list I never wanted, of things I've hoped to have never gone through,\" she said.\n\nToney said as the two drove through flames, she thought the tires and car were going to melt.\n\n\"How can God take a town away that's called Paradise?\" Toney asked.\n\nJerry Krucell, Toney's grandfather, made a separate journey to safety.\n\n\"I'm homeless at 82 years of age, and that makes it hard,\" he said.\n\nParadise Mayor Jody Jones said 80% to 90% of homes in residential neighborhoods are gone following the Camp Fire.\n\n\"Where we had beautiful trees, it's now black,\" Miller said.\n\n'We thought the fire was going to kill us'\n\nWhitney Vaughan and her husband had just enough time to grab a laundry basket of dirty clothes and some pictures before fleeing their home in Paradise.\n\nThey had just fled their home as flames rushed them, Vaughan said. She saw a man \"sprinting past our house carrying a little baby, running as fast as he could.\"\n\nThe couple soon found themselves trapped with other evacuees in standstill traffic as the Camp Fire closed in.\n\n\"The flames were whipping and spreading so fast,\" Vaughan told CNN. \"It began to jump the road. There wasn't anywhere to go.\"\n\nPeople began to panic, Vaughan said. In the chaos, one driver backed up and slammed the front of Vaughan's SUV.\n\nMotorists began abandoning their cars, fleeing on foot with their children in tow.\n\n\"There were no firefighters in sight,\" Vaughan wrote on Facebook. \"I am hoping all of these people made it out.\"\n\nShe cried as she recorded video of the terrifying scene, which she posted to Facebook.\n\nVaughan and her husband escaped before flames could engulf their car, she said. It took more than 3 hours to make it through the gridlock.\n\n\"We barely stayed ahead of it,\" Vaughan said. \"And multiple times, as we followed the flow of cars, we thought the fire was going to kill us.\"\n\nCity officials lose everything, but help others\n\nA firefighter looks through a home destroyed by the Camp Fire where human remains were found, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Paradise, Calif. (AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nCity officials also fell victim to the flames.\n\nMalibu's Mayor Pro Tem Jefferson 'Zuma Jay' Wagner is recovering in a hospital after trying to save his home Friday night during the Woolsey Fire, according to a statement on the city's website\n\n\"The City extends its support and best wishes for a complete recovery and quick return to the community that he loves,\" the city added.\n\nMeanwhile in Northern California, the Camp Fire has left dozens of firefighters, police officers and sheriff's deputies in homeless.\n\nLeland Ratcliff, captain of the US Forest Service's Feather River Hotshot crew, is among them. He saw the smoke over Paradise on Thursday and said his intuition told him the fire was on a rapid path to destroy the town.\n\nHe was able to tell his wife, who took both children out of school before official evacuations began. As the family fled with their dog, cat and important documents, there were already spot fires near their home, Ratcliff told CNN.\n\nOnce they were safe, Ratcliff said, he had to make a decision: \"Do I go try to save other stuff (from our house) or do I go to try to let people know what was going on?\"\n\nHe chose the latter, evacuating residents from their houses and plucking them from the streets, putting them on Forest Service vehicles and racing them to points of protection set up by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nHe said it wasn't a difficult decision in the moment, but then he realized what things he lost forever in the house he left -- his children's handprints from kindergarten, and his wedding pictures.\n\n\"The guilt doesn't come until afterwards, when you realize you don't have that stuff anymore. ... You always want to think that life is more important than property, but it doesn't make it any easier in hindsight.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nLa pel\u00edcula se estrenar\u00e1 el 21 de junio de 2019\n\n(CNN) - Fan\u00e1ticos de \"Toy Story\", aj\u00fastense los cinturones porque hay un nuevo juguete en la ciudad.\n\nPixar dio a conocer el lunes un adelanto de \"Toy Story 4\" y cuando pensabas que conoc\u00edas a toda la pandilla - Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Slinky Dog, Hamm the Piggy Bank and Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head - con ellos llega alguien nuevo.

found themselves under pressure. Japan Display was down 9.5%, Hon Hai Precision Industry ( HNHPD ), known as Foxconn, dropped 3% and Taiwan Semiconductors ( TSM ) lost 2.5%\n\nThe slump was triggered by a 5% slide in Apple ( AAPL ) shares on Monday after supplier Lumentum ( LITE ) cut its earnings and sales forecast because of weak demand. JPMorgan also cut its target price on Apple's stock.\n\nThat caused widespread pain. Amazon ( AMZN ) shed 4.5% on Monday and Tesla ( TSLA ) fell more than 5%.

Coming this week:", "London (CNN) There is a gruesome moment in the Amazon Prime series \"All or Nothing: The Michigan Wolverines\" that embodies a new genre of filmmaking.\n\nIn a game against Wisconsin last season, third-string quarterback Brandon Peters is knocked unconscious for what seems like an eternity.\n\nHis hand is limp, his eyes are shut, and he's completely unresponsive. \"He's out,\" says a Michigan trainer.\n\nFinally, after 30 seconds of heart-stopping airtime -- with the 20-year-old's future teetering on edge as a microphone captures his eerie silence -- he regains awareness.\n\nPeters is carted off the field. Michigan lose. Coach Jim Harbaugh consoles his dejected, beat up players in the locker room.\n\nAnd viewers stream through the whole emotional saga.\n\nThe formula of revealing tense fly-on-the-wall moments is turning up at all levels of American football -- and proving addictive to binge watchers.\n\n\"All or Nothing,\" which also profiles three NFL teams, is one of a handful of football-focused docuseries shaking up the entertainment industry.\n\nAmong the most popular are the acclaimed Netflix series \"Last Chance U,\" the NFL and HBO-produced \"Hard Knocks,\" the high school quarterback-focused \"QB1: Beyond the Lights,\" Snoop Dogg's \"Coach Snoop,\" and \"Friday Night Tykes,\" which spotlights eight-year-olds playing in pee-wee league football.\n\nThere is even a series on the football marching band at Bethune-Cookman University, \"Marching Orders.\"\n\nViewers, it seems, can't get enough of the grit and drama surrounding the brutal sport, and production companies are taking notice.\n\nQuarterback Brandon Peters sustains a concussion against Wisconsin while miked up on \"All or Nothing: The Michigan Wolverines.\"\n\n'Emotional roller coaster'\n\nOakland Raiders rookie Maurice Hurst Jr., who was filmed driving an Uber car during his senior year at Michigan in \"All or Nothing,\" says the show painted an accurate picture of life as a student-athlete.\n\n\"It gives the fans a little bit of an inside look as to what our day-to-day is,\" Hurst tells CNN Sport after a recent Raiders game in London, \"what problems we deal with, players getting hurt and how tough that is on their families, and careers ending.\"\n\nThe series was miked up to hear quarterback Wilton Speight's groans after a season-ending hit, and the unfiltered bawling of defensive teammates Rashan Gary and Josh Metellus after a loss to Michigan State.\n\nCameras were focused on the mother of receiver Tarik Black, who cried after hearing her son would need surgery, and on Hurst who wept after his last game in a Michigan uniform, a loss to South Carolina.\n\n\"You know, it's such an emotional roller coaster, and on top of that you have school,\" says the four-time Academic All-American. \"It's a real tough duty being a college football player, and I think that showed it.\"\n\nHurst is a fan of other football reality-style series, including \"Hard Knocks.\" The NFL production, which recently wrapped its 13th season, depicts the struggles of unsigned players and promising rookies like the Cleveland Browns' Baker Mayfield.\n\nRefs and coaches don't always see eye-to-eye. #AllOrNothing pic.twitter.com/DjJEuZWmfT \u2014 All or Nothing (@allornothingtv) September 22, 2017\n\nBut his favorite show is the one which has shaken up the genre: \"Last Chance U.\"\n\nCurrently filming its fourth season, the Netflix series has shadowed two junior college programs in rural America that recruit troubled football players thrown out of Division I schools.\n\nNot surprisingly, the action on the field is matched by the drama off it.\n\nA few players like John Franklin III move on to bigger schools, graduate and take their shots at the NFL, while -- spoiler alert -- others like Bobby Bruce and Isaiah Wright run into legal troubles that spell their undoing.\n\n\"You could see there was a lot more than football,\" Hurst says of the show. \"There are a lot of life lessons that you can get from the game, and that's the stuff that people don't always think about.\"\n\n'Amazing what the show has done'\n\nEnglishman Daniel Shepherd, who has spent \"hundreds of hours\" watching football series, demonstrates the genre's allure among international viewers, many of whom were not raised on American football.\n\n\"It's kind of alien for us, coming from the UK,\" he says. \"If you played high school rugby like I did, you'd be lucky if there were a couple of parents and some guy walking his dog around the outside of the pitch.\"\n\nShepherd has re-watched every episode of \"Last Chance U,\" and even passed by Eastern Mississippi Community College, where the first two seasons were set, to grab a T-shirt while driving across America.\n\n\"They were super amused,\" he says, \"How does a Brit end up in Scooba, Mississippi in an RV?\"\n\nA favorite figure from the series is Eastern Mississippi's academic councilor Brittany Wagner, aka \"Miss Brittany\" to her students.\n\nFrom the moment the show began airing in 2016, Wagner has received \"tons of emails\" from places like Japan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Brazil and even China -- where Netflix is not readily available.\n\n\"It's hard for me to wrap my brain around having fans in places that I have not even been to,\" she marvels. \"It's just amazing what the show has done.\"\n\nHow do you define yourself? pic.twitter.com/EPBgOevUGR \u2014 Last Chance U (@LastChanceU) July 28, 2018\n\nWhen first approached by director Greg Whiteley, Wagner declined to be involved, nervous that it would exploit the student-athletes. Once appeased, she had little concept of how transcendent the show would become.\n\n\"It had been my everyday life for years, so I just didn't understand what the appeal was going to be,\" she reflects, admitting she had not used a streaming service like Netflix to that point.\n\n\"Why would people watch this show of kids being in this school in Mississippi?\"\n\nThe oddity of having two people filming in her cramped office for over six hours each workday while she encouraged players to attend class and do homework never really became normal.\n\nOn top of that, her air-conditioning had to be switched off because it was too noisy. \"It would get really hot in there,\" she recalls. \"It was just such a tight space, so it felt crowded all the time.\"\n\nThe exposure on the show led Wagner to launch a new career as a motivational speaker and establish her academic foundation 10 Thousand Pencils.\n\nIt also brought her plaudits and gratification after eight years of dueling with Eastern Mississippi's fiery coach Buddy Stephens, and a further seven years counseling in other schools.\n\n\"I felt unappreciated for a really long time,\" says Wagner, who noted that at least five NFL players she guided hold college degrees. \"And then the show comes on and I guess I'm getting 15 years of appreciation all in two.\"\n\n'Only getting the good stuff'\n\nThe success of \"Last Chance U\" made life easier for director Evan Rosenfeld when pitching his newly released series \"Warriors of Liberty City.\"\n\nProduced alongside LeBron James and Maverick Carter's SpringHill Entertainment, the filming is set in a rough patch of Miami, where the murder of youth players as young as eight is not uncommon.\n\n\"A show like this could not have been made even four years ago,\" says Rosenfeld. \"It was 'Last Chance U' that opened up the door.\"\n\nUsing the backdrop of football -- where stakes are high in every game, if not every play -- to tell human stories translates well to the masses.\n\n\"You're only getting the good stuff,\" he explains. \"It's done with an eye specifically knowing you want people who don't like sports to watch it.\"\n\nAs distasteful as the documented head injury risks of the sport are, football's danger provides tension to TV audiences that is missing from baseball, basketball or soccer.\n\n\"These people put everything into the sport,\" Rosenfeld says, \"and one weird tackle or landing when you're making a catch, or getting hit too hard with a helmet, it's all gone. Everything you worked for is done.\n\n\"That's something you struggle to find when you're doing something outside of sports or outside of football,\" he adds. \"What are the stakes? To have that built-in when you're a storyteller is nice.\"\n\nCongrats to the #LibertyCityWarriors Jr Bandit B team on their Sean Taylor (Super Bowl) win today! #WarriorsOfLibertyCity pic.twitter.com/vMtWSoZvxV \u2014 Evan Rosenfeld (@evansss) November 3, 2018\n\n'Fighting for their jobs'\n\nEven though the sport lends itself to gripping plot lines, not every football show is a smash hit.\n\nKevin Oberding was a producer on the ill-fated series \"4th and Loud\" that followed the exploits of the Los Angeles Kiss, an arena league team founded by Kiss bandmates Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley.\n\nFrom the start, the show that aired in 2014 was plagued by the difficulty of shadowing a rotating cast of players and a coach fired in mid-season.\n\n\"In the Arena Football League people are getting cut every week; it's not like the NFL,\" says Oberding, who played football at the University of Oregon and is now a marketing manager with the Portland Trailblazers.\n\n\"As producer I can say (it was) probably a little bit of a miss on our part.\"\n\nOberding says the show was aimed to capture a \"behind the scenes\" look into \"working for rock stars.\" He followed the LA Kiss for 13-weeks, entering the homes of players and coaches.\n\n\"That was quite a bit of drama,\" he says. \"You're dealing with people who are not (on-air) talent, who are not used to having that reality show kind of camera in their face.\"\n\nLike most expansion teams, the LA Kiss fared badly, which created friction off-air.\n\n\"We were there to film a TV show, but the coaches and the players were there to win,\" Oberding says. \"If you've ever been around a team, the last time they want a camera in their faces is when they're on an eight-game losing streak.\n\n\"I still had to be that guy asking them to run something again, or do interviews, and they're fighting for their jobs.\"\n\n'You end up cheering for these guys'\n\nUltimately, the success of reality football programming hinges on viewers rooting, and empathizing with, the players.\n\n\"You watch these shows and you end up cheering for these guys,\" says Oberding, who often Googles players from the NFL Network series \"Undrafted,\" which ran until 2016, and \"Hard Knocks\" to check on their careers.\n\nPosting updates on \"Last Chance U\" alumni is a cottage industry online -- though search results can be unpleasant.\n\nFormer Eastern Mississippi running back Wright served nearly a year in prison on what was initially a criminal homicide charge. While inside, he called Wagner as a voice of comfort and the two have spoken again since his release in August.\n\n\"I think it's tough when you're playing football and you're on a very successful TV show, and you get out and have all these expectations and some of them don't pan out,\" she says.\n\n\"He found himself right back where he started, and it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nWagner says Wright is now \"trying to make good decisions\" and even finish his college education. Fans of \"Last Chance U\" will no doubt keep tabs on his future.\n\n\"It restored my faith in humanity that people took to (the show) because of the stories and the relationships,\" Wagner says.\n\n\"It really had nothing to do with the game itself, which is very enlightening and inspiring for me.\"", "(CNN) The Camp Fire has claimed 48 lives and 8,800 structures in Northern California, officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe blaze, the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in the state's history, kept growing Tuesday, though firefighters got some reprieve as winds died down.\n\nStill, though swirling winds and limited visibility at times remained challenging, Cal Fire operations section chief Joshua Bischof said the day was a successful one.\n\nWinds Tuesday weren't as brisk, something forecasters said should be the case for the next few days.

I was one of them recently, and after jumping into the uncertain abyss, I came away with the undisputed highlight from a week-long trip to the fabled island -- not to mention newfound respect for the power of the sea.\n\nColloquially known as \"coasteering\" and first invented in nearby Wales, the amphibious activity combines rough sea swimming, intertidal caving, cliff-climbing and leaping from extreme heights into the exposed sea below.

Courtesy The Jungle NI\n\nIn truth, coasteering in Ireland is a lot safer, less extreme and more enjoyable than it sounds. For around $60 per person, local guides will typically fully outfit you with a warming wetsuit, safety helmet, protective gloves, water shoes, a mega life jacket and an exhilarating -- and probably exhausting (in a good way) -- itinerary.\n\nAll told, it's a fantastic way to not only see the country's famous cliffs and shorelines in a new light, but to gain a new appreciation for an often-hostile environment.\n\nFrom County Cork in the southern peninsulas to the cliff coasts of Kerry, Clare and Galway in the middle, and then all the way up to County Donegal and Northern Ireland's timeless Giant's Causeway, nearly two dozen guiding companies provide coasteering tours around much of the island.\n\nAccording to glowing consumer reviews and my own personal experience, here are some of the best locations to cliff-jump off the western edge of Europe.\n\nCounty Antrim\n\nA few miles east of Northern Ireland's spectacular Benone Strand, part of one of the island's longest beaches, you'll find near-ideal coasteering conditions when jumping with Causeway Coasteering in Portrush or Coasteering NI in Ballintoy.\n\nThe world-famous Giant's Causeway is the draw for most tourists traveling this far north, but there's plenty to discover along the whole of the Causeway Coastal Route.\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" fans will recognize Ballintoy Harbour as the filming location for the Iron Islands, and you may need nerves of steel to handle the rush of adrenaline when coasteering on the island's northern edge.\n\nCounty Donegal\n\nOver the border in the Republic of Ireland, if you really want to go out of your way to the most uninhabited and unspoiled areas in all of the island, look no further than County Donegal.\n\nNestled in one of Europe's finest and most untouched coastal landscapes, Wild Atlantic Adventure Centre guides patrons to some of the most impressive jumps among the most outstanding sea stacks in all of Ireland or Britain. Located in the small village of Clonmany, the outfitter provides year-round coasteering tours, but ideal conditions are usually found in spring.\n\nCounty Sligo\n\nRain or shine, coasteering offers an exhilarating adrenaline burst. Courtesy The Jungle NI\n\nPrimarily known for its big-wave surfing, Mullaghmore in County Sligo is both extreme and abundant when it comes to coasteering. According to North West Coasteering , \"there are so many routes here, you could come every week for a year and still do a different tour every time.\"\n\nFor maximum adrenaline from high-jumping cliffs, head to Mullaghmore proper. For more mellow routes with a focus on sea-cave swimming, tours are also available at nearby Bundoran.\n\nCounty Galway\n\nSituated on the northwest corner of County Galway, Connemara is a hotbed for Irish coasteering.\n\nAlthough you can't (nor would you want to) jump the deathly Cliffs of Moher just south of here, Real Adventures Delphi Resort and Clare Island Adventures all offer highly rated trips to the jagged and sometimes tightly quartered coastline of Connemara.\n\nWhen you're finished, consider soaking up the fairytale good looks of nearby Connemara National Park.\n\nNote: To get a better idea of what you'll be jumping from and into, talk to a guide before booking.\n\nRelated content 6 outdoor adventures in Ireland\n\nCounty Kerry\n\nIn the likely event you'll visit the very popular and very scenic County Kerry -- which includes Dingle, Gap of Dunloe and Killarney National Park -- you'd be well-advised to add coasteering to your itinerary while there.\n\nWhile touring with Wild Water Adventures from Tralee, you'll be treated to thrilling versions of the above, not to mention one of the friendliest and most experienced experts along the coast. Like all good coasteering guides, John Edwards never pressured anyone in our group, but was always encouraging, empathetic and reassuring.\n\nWhichever way you go, adventure tourism along the Wild Atlantic Way is burgeoning and bucking the tour-bus trend when it comes to seeing the legendary Irish coast.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nEl puente de Brooklyn cerrar\u00e1 cada vez que una caravana de la Polic\u00eda traslade a Guzm\u00e1n desde y hacia la c\u00e1rcel\n\nAgentes federales fuertemente armados y oficiales con perros rastreadores de bombas hacen guardia fuera de la corte\n\nEl juicio ante el juez de distrito Brian Cogan, en una corte federal de Brooklyn, se inicia este martes con las declaraciones de apertura\n\nNueva York (CNN) - Casi dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de ser extraditado desde M\u00e9xico, el narcotraficante Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n Loera enfrenta este martes a un jurado estadounidense en el juicio penal m\u00e1s importante de las \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas.\n\nEl que alguna vez fue considerado el mayor narcotraficante del mundo est\u00e1 acusado de encabezar un negocio criminal que abarc\u00f3 continentes y gener\u00f3 olas de derramamiento de sangre en M\u00e9xico.\n\nSu juicio, largamente esperado, ante el juez de distrito Brian Cogan en una corte federal de Brooklyn se inicia este martes con las declaraciones de apertura, en medio de medidas de seguridad sin precedentes, incluyendo protecci\u00f3n armada para los miembros del jurado.\n\nIncluso antes del inicio de un juicio que podr\u00eda durar cuatro meses, agentes federales fuertemente armados y oficiales con perros rastreadores de bombas hacen guardia fuera de la corte.

Three people and an alleged shooter were injured, she added.\n\nThen, after Roberson had apprehended an alleged gunman, the Midlothian officer shot Roberson outside the bar, according to a federal lawsuit filed Monday that calls the fatal shooting \"excessive and unreasonable\" and says it violated Roberson's civil rights.\n\nWitnesses said security had asked several drunk men to leave the bar, and at least one person returned and opened fire, CNN affiliate WGN reported. A bartender was among those victims, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter that shooting, Roberson \"had somebody on the ground ... with his knee in back, with his gun in his back like, 'Don't move,' \" Adam Harris, a witness, told WGN.\n\nThe officer responding to the scene then fired at Roberson, the TV station reported, citing witnesses.\n\n\"We all yelled. 'He's a security. He's a security,' and without ... giving any thought, they shot him,\" Harris told the station . \"The vest said security as well ... and they shot him in the side.\"\n\nThe Midlothian Police Department has asked the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force to investigate, which is department policy for an officer-involved shooting, according to Midlothian police Chief Daniel Delaney.\n\nIn a statement, the Illinois State Police said its officials are investigating the shooting. It said that according to witness statements, \"the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject.\"\n\nIt also said Roberson was in plain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard and armed with a gun.\n\nThe department did not initially identify Roberson as a security guard because it immediately relinquished the investigation to the State Police and did not know his name or position at the time, Delaney said Tuesday.\n\n\"What we have learned is Jemel Roberson was a brave man who was doing his best to end an active shooter situation at Manny's Blue Room,\" Delaney wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"The Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel , his family and his friends. There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\"\n\nThe suspected gunman in the initial bar shooting is being treated at a local hospital and has not been charged, Ansari said.\n\n'Jemel was trying to save people's lives'\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Roberson's mother lists the unnamed Midlothian officer and the village of Midlothian as defendants. It seeks damages of more than $1 million.\n\n\"Jemel was trying to save people's lives. He was working security because a shooting had just taken place in the establishment,\" the family's attorney, Gregory Kulis, told CNN affiliate WLS\n\n\"So, he was doing his job and holding on to somebody until ... police arrived,\" Kulis said. \"And a police officer, our feeling is, did not make the proper assessment and fired and killed Jemel.\"\n\nRoberson had a Firearms Owners' Identification Card, which allows Illinois residents to legally possess firearms or ammunition, according to Ansari.\n\nMidlothian police confirmed that two of its officers responded to the bar shooting and one opened fire, WGN reported\n\n\"A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,\" Delaney said in an earlier statement.\n\nThe officer involved in the shooting is a four-year veteran of the police department, WLS reported, citing Delaney.\n\nKaren Sheley, director of the Police Practices Project for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, suggested that Roberson's race influenced the decision to shoot.\n\n\"Working as a security guard while Black should not be a death sentence. In this case, police were more dangerous to him than an active shooter who he apparently subdued,\" Sheley said in a statement\n\n\"The police killing of Mr. Roberson was avoidable. Here, a police officer's assumptions about Mr. Roberson, apparently impacted by bias, rather than a clear-headed assessment of the situation, resulted in a tragedy.\"\n\nA church musician who wanted to be a cop\n\nJemel Roberson is seen with his young son, who is now 9 months old.\n\nRoberson was the father to a 9-month-old son, and the boy's mother is expecting their second child, according to family attorney S. Lee Merritt.\n\nHe was a gospel musician at several churches, according to according to WGN . Kulis said Roberson played the organ and was scheduled to perform at church on the Sunday morning he was killed.\n\nRoberson was also preparing to embark on a career as a police officer, WGN reported. Roberson had planned to take a police exam in March, according to Eric Russell, an activist.\n\n\"The very people that he wanted to be family with took his life,\" the Rev. Patricia Hill of Purposed Church said.\n\nRoberson's family members are \"just distraught,\" another pastor, the Rev. Walter Turner, said.\n\n\"They are hurt, trying to find out answers, trying to figure out why did this have to happen,\" Turner told the TV station.\n\nLoved ones and supporters held a vigil Monday

(CNN Business) If the tech industry can make cars that drive themselves, why can't it do better when it comes to sexual harassment?\n\nThat's the question Google's chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, was asking at a tech conference on Monday.\n\n\"Why can't we solve this? We should do better. And, if we're holding ourselves to a view that if you can change one thing, then you should be able to change more than that,\" said Porat, who is also the CFO of Google's parent company, Alphabet ( GOOGL ).\n\nSpeaking on stage at the The Wall Street Journal Tech D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, California, Porat said sexual harassment is \"sadly a too pervasive issue \u2014 and that doesn't in any way excuse it.\"", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nObama y Trump se han visto en tres ocasiones desde la elecci\u00f3n de Donald Trump como presidente\n\n(CNN) - En su nuevo libro de memorias, \"Becoming\", la ex primera dama de Estados Unidos, Michelle Obama, describe en un pasaje c\u00f3mo su predecesora, Laura Bush, le ofreci\u00f3 su ayuda cuando ella apenas estaba llegando a esta posici\u00f3n y le dijo que si la necesitaba, ella estaba \"a una llamada telef\u00f3nica de distancia\".\n\nObama dice que ella hizo lo mismo por Melania Trump, cuando fue el turno de esta de ocupar la posici\u00f3n.

"(CNN) The driver of a car which plowed into pedestrians on a busy street in central Melbourne in January 2017 has been found guilty of six counts of murder.\n\nA jury in the Australian city deliberated for just 57 minutes before finding James Gargasoulas guilty on six charges of murder and 27 charges of reckless conduct endangering life, according to CNN affiliate Nine News\n\nGargasoulas pleaded not guilty, though he admitted that his actions -- driving through the busy pedestrian mall and along footpaths crowded with people -- caused death and injury.\n\nFive people died as a result of the crash, while another died later after her family turned off life support.\n\nPolice said after the crash the then 32-year-old Gargasoulas had a history of drug use and mental health issues , and was known to the authorities for minor offenses.\n\nRead More", "Sousa, Syria (CNN) Syrian Kurdish forces are resuming the final phase of operations against ISIS, as the terrorist group is pushed back into its last remaining slivers of territory.\n\nThe resumption comes as CNN releases remarkable and rare frontline footage of the recent intense fight against ISIS, filmed by Brazilian photographer Gabriel Chaim.\n\nThe latest Kurdish push against ISIS follows a lengthy and contentious stand-off with Turkish forces. Turkey, a NATO member, considers the Syrian Kurds -- the US coalition's main ally in the fight against ISIS -- a terrorist group.\n\nYPG fighters are seen on the frontline on October 18, in Baghoz, Syria, during an operation to retake the last stronghold of ISIS in Syria.\n\nClashes between the Turkish military and the Syrian Kurds -- also known as the SDF when allied with Syrian Arab fighters against ISIS -- have intermittently plagued and delayed the final operations against ISIS. The most recent suspension occurred November 1, but operations restarted Sunday, the SDF said in a statement.\n\nThe SDF said operations resumed after \"positive calls from our allies to de-escalate and focus the efforts on defeating ISIS, as it would contribute to the stabilization of the area and the benefit of all parties.\" The US has long been mediating between Ankara and the SDF to lessen tension to the point where the SDF can focus on ISIS.\n\nRead More", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic aqu\u00ed para compartir en LinkedIn (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nHaz clic para compartir en Twitter (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\n(CNN) - No todos los d\u00edas sucede que el primer ministro de Canad\u00e1, Justin Trudeau, retuitea un tuit tuyo.\n\nPero eso es lo que le pas\u00f3 a Rebecca Davies, residente de Toronto, cuando public\u00f3 un adorable video de dos refugiados de Eritrea viendo nevar por primera vez.\n\nVestidos con gruesos abrigos de invierno, a los dos hermanos se les ve corriendo haca el patio trasero para dar vueltas mientras caen los copos de nieve, en un momento de pura felicidad.\n\nEn Twitter, Trudeau escribi\u00f3: \"Incre\u00edble - ahora conv\u00e9ncelos de que palear es divertido y todo listo.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.\n\nErdogan told reporters that after the intelligence officer had heard the recording, he said: \"I guess they were on heroin; only someone who is on heroin would do such a thing.\"\n\nThe comments, reported by the pro-government Turkish newspaper The Daily Sabah on Tuesday, came after The New York Times reported that people familiar with the audio recording say it contains an instruction to \"tell your boss.\" American intelligence officials believe is a reference to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince.\n\nThe report suggests that one of the 15-strong \"kill team\" allegedly sent to Istanbul to assassinate Khashoggi can be heard on the tape making a phone call in Arabic to say \"the deed was done,\" or words to that effect.\n\nThe same person also told the person on the other end of the line to \"tell your boss,\" a reference intelligence officials believe is the strongest evidence yet linking de facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin

MUST WATCH What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?: A timeline 04:28\n\nRiyadh has maintained that neither bin Salman nor his father, King Salman, knew of the operation to target Khashoggi, an American resident.\n\nThe crown prince is not specifically mentioned by name during the audio recording, according to the Times.\n\nCiting three unnamed people familiar with the recording, the Times report says the call was made by Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, one of the Saudi team allegedly sent to kill the Washington Post columnist.\n\nThe assertion is backed up by Turkish intelligence officials, who told their American counterparts that Mutreb was speaking to one of Prince Mohammed's aides, the Times reports.\n\nCNN has not heard the recording and is unable to verify the voices on the tape or what they're purported to say.\n\nTurkey has claimed for weeks to have audio evidence that exposes how the Saudi journalist was killed on October 2, while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain papers for his upcoming marriage.\n\nThe Turkish chief prosecutor has previously said that Khashoggi was strangled as soon as he entered the consulate as part of a premeditated plan, and his body dismembered.\n\nJUST WATCHED Prosector: Khashoggi strangled immediately Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Prosector: Khashoggi strangled immediately 01:18\n\nThe Saudis have presented shifting stories about the journalist's death, initially denying any knowledge before arguing that a group of rogue operators were responsible for his death.\n\nUS officials have speculated that such a mission -- including the 15 men sent from Riyadh -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of bin Salman, heir apparent to the Saudi throne.\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia admitted that Khashoggi was killed in its Istanbul consulate, five high-ranking officials were dismissed, including bin Salman's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service.\n\nTapes disseminated to friendly countries\n\nThe details of the tape have emerged as Ankara confirmed that the intelligence had been shared with allies.\n\nTurkey's Erdogan said Saturday that his country had shared the recordings with Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, although confusion has swirled over which countries have and haven't listened to the recordings.

Due process is in train at the moment in Saudi Arabia and I was led to believe there will be rapid progress in making sure that people are brought to justice.\"\n\nOn Sunday, his US counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told bin Salman that the US will hold all those involved in the killing of Khashoggi accountable, and \"that Saudi Arabia must do the same,\" spokeswoman Heather Nauert

The credit for the photo says the hat is \"from a stylist's collection.\"\n\nThough BTS has for years been one of the biggest bands in South Korea and East Asia, their international profile has skyrocketed in 2018.\n\nThis year, the BTS became the first K-pop band to win a Billboard Music Award; the first K-pop act to sell out a US arena; and broke the record for biggest music video debut, a distinction previously held by Taylor Swift.\n\nSome of the group's fans have leaped to their defense online, claiming that at least some images of the hat have been photoshopped to include the controversial symbol.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2018\n\nBut the President's intervention did underline how Washington's calendar seems to have already flipped to 2019.\n\nTrump and Democratic leaders are making calculations and staking out positions that will shape the new political environment, set the stage for the 2020 election, and could ultimately dictate Trump's political fate.\n\nThe arrival of a new class of lawmakers for orientation Tuesday will exacerbate the feeling of a fresh start, though critical business remains in the lame duck twilight of the GOP-led House \u2014 that could even degenerate into a government shutdown before year's end.\n\nOn talk shows in recent days, incoming Democratic committee chairmen fleshed out earlier promises to look into Trump's policies and personal affairs.\n\nAt the same time, the likely next House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to keep talk of impeachment f rom bubbling over.\n\nSome Washington veterans are already seeking parallels from the past, including the period after the 1994 midterms, when a new GOP majority that came to be seen as overzealous gave President Bill Clinton a foil that he used to win re-election two years on.\n\nWith that in mind, House Democrats know they have to do enough to appease their voters outraged by Trump, 77% of whom, according to exit polls, support impeachment.\n\nBut moving too fast could harm the credibility of Democratic oversight and foster an impression it is motivated by purely political motives rather than being in the national interest, and could offer Trump an opening.\n\nThe party must also keep faith with the policy agenda that helped them win last week. That involves passing bills on securing coverage for Americans with pre-existing health conditions, acting to control the cost of college, and possibly working on infrastructure, even if most such measures hit a brick wall in the GOP Senate.\n\n\"I think the key word is balance in this,\" said Jim Kessler, senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank.\n\n\"There needs to be aggressive oversight of this administration,\" Kessler said. \"There has been no oversight for two years. I think the watchword would be -- make these investigations in the taxpayers' interests.\"\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming House Intelligence Committee chairman, one of Trump's most aggressive critics on Russia, says the political delicacy of the coming clash is one reason Democrats should retain Pelosi as leader, and speaker, even if more radical members of the new class want change.\n\n\"We need the strongest general that we have,\" Schiff said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend. \"We need the best tactician, we need the best organizer.\"\n\nPelosi wants her party to stay unified and temperate as they erect the new checks and balances against the President.\n\n\"We are responsible. We are not scatter shot. We are not doing any investigation for a political purpose but to seek the truth,\" she said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, a message she repeated in a letter to members Monday\n\n\"I think a word that you could describe about how Democrats will go forward in this regard is we will be very strategic,\" she told CBS.\n\nTrump's new reality\n\nThe President has been in a dark place since election day, as Democratic gains in slow moving counts underscored his rebuke by voters.\n\nHe and his top officials will soon be facing Democratic probes, hearings and potentially subpoenas on everything from his unreleased tax returns to the family separations storm, from his alleged obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe to his family finances.\n\nHe is already seeking to brand Democrats as a party obsessed with attacking him, while ignoring the challenges he believes many Americans care about, like the humming economy and what he sees as an immigration crisis.\n\nHe is leaving open the door to cooperation on some issues but warning that once Democrats crank up investigations, he is ready to use his power to target them, and grind government to a halt.\n\n\"I would blame them because they now are going to be coming up with policy. They're the majority in the House,\" the President said at a post midterm election news conference last week.\n\nTrump's first goal is to curate the battlefield ahead of his re-election bid in 2020 after Democratic gains repaired gaps in the party's blue wall in the Midwest that Trump tore down in 2016.\n\nBut, with the possibility of impeachment looming, depending on the contents of Mueller's final report, the President knows he must also act to shore up his support base in Congress, especially in the Senate.\n\nThere is no sign at this stage that there would be a two-thirds majority in the GOP-led chamber to convict him after any successful impeachment push in the House -- a factor that may convince Democratic leaders to avoid such a route.\n\nBut the most dangerous threat to his presidency -- as unlikely as it seems now -- would lie in any gathering political weakness that would erode his support among Senate Republicans.\n\nAfter all, President Richard Nixon resigned during Watergate not after admitting guilt, but after concluding that he no longer had \"strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing\" in office.\n\nTrump's desire to avoid a similar fate seems to lie behind his own obsessive efforts to bolster his political \"base\" and to show Republican lawmakers they would face a terrible price in their districts from deserting him. It also helps explain the aggressive campaign to discredit Mueller's \"witch hunt\" undertaken with the enthusiastic aid of conservative media.\n\nThe opening shots between Trump and resurgent Democrats show that the political battle between each end of Pennsylvania Avenue will be bitter and prolonged.\n\nAt the outset of this existential clash, it is less clear whether, given the polarization in Congress and the nation, there is any potential resolution, however it turns out, that will spare the stressed political system even more blows to its tattered legitimacy.", "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

The truth is, he was the leader of nothing,\" Lichtman said.\n\nGuzman's escapes from Mexican prisons furthered the myth of him as a dangerous cartel boss, his lawyer said.\n\n\"A conviction of Guzman is the biggest prize the prosecution could have dreamed of,\" he told the jurors. \"They claim he is the biggest drug dealer in the world. It's false.\"\n\nGuzman, wearing a dark suit and tie, smiled and waved to someone as he entered court.\n\nBefore opening statements Tuesday, a juror -- in a letter to the judge that was read aloud in court -- asked to be dismissed from the case because she has suffered from anxiety since jury selection. The prosecution and defense agreed to excuse the juror.\n\nThe defense was unable to finish its statement because of time and will pick it up Wednesday morning.\n\nUnprecedented security\n\nThe court proceedings -- the most significant criminal trial in decades -- come nearly two years after Guzman's extradition from Mexico.\n\nThe man once considered the world's biggest drug trafficker is accused of heading a criminal enterprise that spanned continents and triggered waves of bloodshed throughout his native Mexico.\n\nHis long-awaited trial, which could last four months, began under unprecedented security measures, including armed escorts for the anonymous and partly sequestered jurors\n\nHeavily armed federal marshals and officers with bomb-sniffing dogs stood guard outside the courthouse. Those who wished to witness the trial in person had to go through two separate security screenings -- an X-ray machine and metal detector -- to enter the courthouse and a similar screening to enter the courtroom. The Brooklyn Bridge shut downs each time a police motorcade -- including an ambulance and a SWAT team -- shuttled Guzman to and from the Manhattan federal lockup.\n\n\"El Chapo, despite his defense that he was just a minor player, was reputed to be the innovative spirit behind the Sinaloa cartel,\" said Bruce Bagley, an expert on Mexico's drug cartels at the University of Miami. \"He is, in many ways, a survivor.\"\n\nHis capture fueled an alarming surge in violence\n\nGuzman, 61, has pleaded not guilty. If convicted of international drug trafficking, conspiring to murder rivals, gun charges and money laundering, he faces a sentence of life in prison.\n\nHe allegedly earned nearly $14 billion as kingpin of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which employed planes, boats and submarines to move hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico before shipping it to US distribution hubs.\n\nA near-mythical figure celebrated in Mexican ballads, Guzman oversaw the smuggling of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana to wholesale distributors in Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New York, Arizona and Los Angeles, federal prosecutors have alleged.\n\nHe is also accused of taking part in at least 30 killings as he reigned over one of Mexico's oldest and most influential cartels.\n\nThe defense placed blame for the continuing drug trade on Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, a man who they say benefited from Guzman's capture. Lichtman alleges the current and former presidents of Mexico \"received hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes from his organization.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto denied the accusation in a statement posted on Twitter. \"The government of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto persecuted, captured, and extradited the criminal Joaquin Guzman Loera,\" the statement said. \"The accusations made by his lawyer are completely false and defamatory.\"\n\nFormer President Felipe Calder\u00f3n also denied the accusation via Twitter. \"The claims made by Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's lawyer are absolutely false. Neither he nor the Sinaloa cartel nor anyone else made any payments to me.\"\n\nFels, the US attorney, said in court Tuesday that the government will prove Guzman is guilty through audio and video evidence, text messages and testimony from law enforcement officials and former associates of Guzman.\n\nFels said the government had access to his communications, despite his concerted efforts to keep communications private.\n\n\"For a short period of time, the government was listening, the government was recording,\" Fels said.\n\nCartel battles bloody Mexico\n\n\"No single individual has been more consequential than Guzman in the waves of violence that Mexico has experienced in the last decade,\" said David Shirk, director of the Justice in Mexico program at the University of San Diego.\n\nGuzman reportedly initiated deadly conflicts with other major cartels that led to massive spikes in violent crime from 2008 to 2012, according to Shirk.\n\nHis capture and extradition to the United States early last year created a power vacuum that fueled an alarming surge in the bloodletting.\n\n\"Of all of the symbols involved in the kingpin strategy (of targeting high-profile crime leaders in order to weaken their organization), El Chapo was by far the most important because he grew like a rocket, because he became so rich and so powerful,\" Bagley said.\n\n'An equal opportunity corrupter'\n\nOver two decades, Guzman transformed the Sinaloa cartel into one of the world's most significant organized crime groups, Bagley said. Its dominance of the international cocaine trade began with Guzman's implementation of a more horizontal leadership structure, his propensity for violence and largesse toward corrupt public officials.\n\n\"He spread money around in industrial quantities, as they say in Mexican Spanish,\" Bagley said. \"He was willing to pay million-dollar bribes or even more -- going from the municipality to the state up to the federal government. He was an equal-opportunity corrupter.\"\n\nThe case against Guzman will be built in part on the testimony of more than a dozen cooperating witnesses, including former cartel associates already incarcerated or who have been given new identities and relocated by the US government.\n\nTheir names have remained unknown to Guzman's defense lawyers until the eve of the trial, with prosecutors arguing that witnesses in previous cases have turned up dead.\n\nThe twins became informants for the feds and went into protective custody, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The Flores brothers pleaded guilty to narcotics distribution conspiracy after recording phone conversations in which Guzman is heard agreeing to decrease the price of a load of heroin.\n\nTheir father was \"kidnapped and presumed killed as a result\" of their cooperation with federal authorities, a defense attorney said when the Flores brothers were sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2015.\n\nSinaloa cartel remains dominant player in cocaine trade\n\nGuzman is also known for his dramatic prison escapes. In 2001, while serving a 20-year sentence for criminal association and bribery in Mexico, he reportedly broke out by hiding in a laundry cart. He was recaptured in 2014 at a hotel in the Pacific beach town of Mazatlan.

But doubts remain over whether they can reach a deal anytime soon.\n\nFriday's talks didn't resolve the stalemate between the two sides, but were seen as positive step toward reaching an understanding, the Journal reported.\n\nThe Trump administration has already slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products since July. The tariffs on $200 billion of those goods are set to increase to 25% from 10% on January 1, which would further escalate the conflict.\n\nChina has so far retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of US products and is likely to respond with more if the United States goes ahead with the increase at the start of January.\n\nThe United States has imposed tariffs on Chinese products ranging from food seasonings and baseball gloves to network routers and industrial machinery parts. China's retaliatory tariffs have hit thousands of US exports including meat, alcoholic drinks, chemicals, clothes, machinery, furniture and auto parts.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent mixed messages about whether the two countries are nearing a truce.\n\nThe Trump administration is divided between free traders \u2014 including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow \u2014 and hardliners like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nKudlow highlighted the differences between the two sides last month when he said, \"China has not responded positively to any of our asks.\"\n\nBut Trump has been talking up the prospects for a positive meeting with Xi.\n\n\"We'll have a good meeting and we're going to see what we can do,\" he said at a news conference last week following the midterm elections. Days before US voters headed to the polls, Trump said he and Xi had held \"productive\" talks over the phone call, but he didn't specify any details.\n\nStill, fault lines between the United States and China were on clear display Friday during a meeting between senior military officials, who challenged each other over the South China Sea, Taiwan, religious freedom and trade.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to take an aggressive stance against China for what he says are unfair trade practices, including intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. He's threatened to escalate the trade war further by imposing tariffs on all the remaining goods that China sells to the United States.\n\nMany American manufacturers, farmers and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle say they appreciate the administration's efforts to change China's trade policies. But some argue the tariffs aren't the best way to address the problems. They pose a dilemma for US importers who must decide whether to absorb the higher cost of the goods or pass it on to consumers, and some exporters are hurting from China's retaliatory tariffs.\n\nFormer White House economic adviser Gary Cohn left the administration earlier this year in the wake of a fierce disagreement over tariffs on steel and aluminum.

I'm a nationalist.\"\n\nHe told the crowd, \"We're not supposed to use that word,\" perhaps because he knew of its overtones of cultural superiority to others.\n\nTrump batted away a question about whether his words emboldend white nationalists, saying the question itself was racist.\n\nBut he would not clarify when asked about it the day after the election by Yamiche Alcindor of \"PBS Newshour,\" who said of his words, \"Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\" Trump brushed her off with \"That's such a racist question.\"\n\nWhen she followed up with, \"There are some people that say that now the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric,\" he replied: \"Oh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.\"\n\nBut others apparently do believe it.\n\nA commenter on the 4chan bulletin board joked Trump was winking at them.\n\nEarlier, another poster declared Trump was venerated by white supremacists: \"What Dems, all leftists and pundits do not understand is that TRUMP is patriots' and Western/American Heritage's CHAMPION.\"\n\nTo Alcindor, Trump repeated two more times how racist the question was. But he also never flatly denounced white supremacists. They were overjoyed, calling the press conference \"glorious,\" and \"beautiful\" on 4chan, with one commenter writing: \"I am honestly in awe of this man as a leader.\"\n\nKeegan Hankes reviews propaganda from the far right for the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"It doesn't take an overt slur for these individuals to basically become emboldened and to recognize and be excited by policies that they see would further their goals,\" said Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project.\n\n\"When they hear the President say things like, 'I'm not a racist,' they turn around amongst themselves and say, 'He just has to say that for practical reasons,' 'he just has to say that basically to get himself cover, to do the things that we want him to do,'\" Hankes says.\n\nThat was also the reaction after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August last year where torch-carrying crowds marched through the streets saying: \"Jews will not replace us.\" A woman was killed when a car was driven into a group of counterprotesters.\n\n\"You had some very bad people in that group,\" Trump said in remarks about the Unite The Right rally. \"But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.\"\n\n\"President Trump's response to Charlottesville absolutely legitimized these individuals,\" Hankes says.\n\nWhile some language is seen as a \"dog whistle\" -- a code heard with a special meaning by the like-minded -- at other times, harsh and false terminology from the White House takes over.\n\nTrump was combative with reporters the day after the elections, doubling down on his assertion that migrants in Mexico were would-be invaders.\n\nAt the Wednesday news conference, CNN's Jim Acosta challenged Trump on his description of the caravan of Central American migrants heading through Mexico toward the United States as an \"invasion\" when it was not.\n\nBut Trump batted away the challenge. \"I consider it an invasion,\" Trump told Acosta.\n\nOn places like 4chan, false talk of the migrant caravan as \"invaders\" has taken over on some of the message boards and become a popular meme topic. Analysts say \"the browning of America\" where whites become a minority is what the white supremacists fear most.\n\nThere are threads with memes containing photos doctored to look like people breaking down walls at the US border with Mexico. There are jokes about how the traditional rush of Black Friday shoppers is nothing compared to what would happen next. In another thread on 4chan, commentators speculate about how many people would be shot as they come over the border. The thread appeared to reference Trump's comment that US troops on the border could fire on someone in the migrant caravan if the person threw rocks or stones. \"All of them,\" one poster wrote of a possible casualty count. \"Not enough,\" said another.\n\nThe Daily Stormer publisher exhorted his readers to go to the polls with this post featuring President Trump.\n\nBefore the midterm election, the Daily Stormer site urged followers to vote for their overt and implicit agendas. It featured a flashing image of Donald Trump front and center with the words \"it's happening.\" There was also a vile meme on the site, which is visited more than 2.5 million times a month, according to data from analytics firm SimilarWeb. A commenter posted a picture of white men dressed for war with the words \"us if we win\" followed by \"them if we win\" on a photo of Jews being led to slaughter at gas chambers during the Holocaust.\n\nThe administration's approach to immigration in particular has \"electrified\" many racists, Hankes said, \"to the point where they're begging their followers to go out and find ways to put Republicans in office.\"\n\n\"They believe it will be easier for these policies to sail through,\" he said. \"And these are things that they think are essential for creating a white ethno-state.\"\n\nPerhaps this election did energize white nationalists to vote, if they thought they had a champion in government. But there is also the fear -- and the example -- of men taking matters into their own violent hands.\n\nBowers, the accused synagogue killer, echoed Trump talking points when he wrote on the free-speech forum Gab that \"I have noticed a change in people saying 'illegals' that now say 'invaders'.\" The post, made six days before the shooting, continued, \"I like this.\"", "(CNN) Immigration advocates who filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration's asylum ban are waiting for the court's first move, which is expected on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation setting into motion a ban on most asylum claims for immigrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally. The proclamation put into effect a new administration rule submitted to the federal registry Thursday that serves as the legal vehicle for the ban.\n\nBefore the ban even became operational Saturday morning, the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for Constitutional Rights sued the administration on behalf of various asylum and refugee assistance groups.\n\nThe parties accused the administration in their lawsuit of \"violating Congress's clear command that manner of entry cannot constitute a categorical asylum bar,\" as well as violating the Administrative Procedure Act by not providing public notice or comment on the rule.\n\n\"The asylum ban is flatly unlawful and will put people's lives in danger.

In a recent on-camera interview with CNN, a group of parents gave the agency an \"F\" for its handling of the outbreak.\n\nA CDC official said while she couldn't comment directly on the boys' cases, there may be a \"lag\" in AFM reporting from physicians to health departments to the CDC.\n\n\"I think we want to catch up with the backlog,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, a 30-year veteran of the CDC and a retired rear admiral in the US Public Health Service. \"Even the past week we've expanded the number of disease detectives on the program.\"\n\nSchuchat, who twice served as acting director of the agency and helped lead the fight against pandemic flu, SARS and anthrax, said she was sorry to hear that the parents think the CDC is hiding something.\n\n\"I certainly want to make sure the information that we have is shared as quickly as possible,\" Schuchat said. \"We wish we understood all that we need to about this disease and how to best diagnose it, how to treat it and how to give families enough information about what to expect. I think it's very challenging when your child has been through something quite traumatic to not even know what the prognosis is.\"\n\nShe added that there's no simple lab test for AFM, so CDC disease detectives have to carefully review medical records.\n\nJUST WATCHED Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parents fear polio-like deaths underreported 02:43\n\nTwenty-six states have confirmed cases of AFM, and 11 additional states have possible cases, according to a survey last week by CNN of state health departments. This year there have been 90 confirmed cases of the illness, and 162 cases are currently under investigation, according to the most recent CDC data\n\nOn its AFM surveillance webpage, the CDC doesn't mention any deaths from AFM. At a press briefing last month, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, mentioned that the agency knew of one death in 2017, but did not mention any deaths this year, even when asked about it by a reporter.\n\nChris and Robin Roberts lost their 5-year old son, Carter, in September after a 2-year battle with AFM. CNN has seen portions of Carter's and Alex's medical records, which show their doctors had diagnosed them with AFM. In Carter's case, doctors at three medical centers -- Virginia Commonwealth University, Johns Hopkins and Boston Children's Hospital -- diagnosed him with the disease.\n\nThe CDC has set up a system where physicians report cases of AFM to their state health departments, which in turn report the cases to the CDC.\n\nTwo pediatric neurologists who serve as medical advisers to the CDC on AFM say they think the agency could be faster in reviewing and reporting cases and deaths.\n\n\"It shouldn't be taking this long to confirm these cases,\" said Dr. Keith Van Haren, assistant professor of neurology at the Stanford University School of Medicine and one of the CDC advisers. That kind of a turn around time for mortality reviews is a symptom of a disconnect at the CDC.\"\n\nCarter's parents agree.\n\n\"They're doing a s*** job of measuring this, excuse my French,\" said his mother, Robin, a healthcare IT specialist.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\n'Mommy, mommy, help me'\n\nOn July 29, 2016, Carter vomited after dinner. The next day he had a fever of 99 degrees but was feeling well enough to eat and drink.\n\nIt's just a virus, thought his parents, who have two older children. It was nothing alarming.\n\nThe next morning, Robin went into her son's room and found him on the floor.\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, help me,\" his mother remembers him saying.\n\nRobin remembers trying to help Carter stand up. His head flopped back. He couldn't use his right arm. She scooped up her son and took him to the emergency room.\n\nWithin a few days, Carter couldn't move anything below his neck. He was put on a ventilator and never came off.\n\nFor the next two years, his family and nurses did everything for him. They fed him. They scratched his nose when he had an itch. All day and all night they turned him every 90 minutes so he wouldn't get bedsores.\n\nCarter was undeterred by his illness. He could read books by the time he was four. He instructed his father on how to construct characters out of Legos and medieval swords out of aluminum foil.\n\nCarter went to pre-school, and in August of this year started kindergarten. He came home from his first day beaming about circle time and a pretty little girl in his class who wore a rainbow dress.\n\nA few weeks later, on September 22, he was having trouble breathing. Robin was home alone with him and called an ambulance. His last words to her were: \"Mommy, I'm fine.\"\n\nToday, Carter's ashes sit in an urn in his family's living room.\n\nCarter Roberts\n\nA doctor wants answers\n\nBoth Carter's parents and Alex's parents say they're not sure if the CDC ever accepted their sons as official AFM cases back when they got sick in 2016.\n\nAlex's mother says his doctor told her he reported his death to the California Department of Public Health, but she doesn't know what happened after that.\n\nIn Carter's case, his neurologist Dr. Sanjai Rao, told CNN he filled out paperwork on the CDC's website and following the CDC's instructions, sent the paperwork, lab specimens and MRI findings to the Virginia Department of Health.\n\nAn epidemiologist there confirmed Carter's information was sent along to the CDC, according to Rao, assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nDoctors and parents say part of their frustration is that when they've asked the CDC about cases and deaths, they haven't received responses.\n\nRao says he reached out to a scientist on the CDC's AFM team, but never heard back.\n\n\"I would like answers,\" said Rao, an assistant professor of pediatric neurology at Children's Hospital of Richmond at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nHis voice chokes with emotion as he talks about Carter, whom he cared for for more than two years. \"I want to know that the process benefits future cases of children with AFM,\" he said.\n\nOther experts agree with Rao. \"We want accurate numbers,\" said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, professor and chair of the department of neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and an adviser to the CDC on AFM.\n\nAn accurate count could help answer questions, he said. Where are the cases? How old are the patients? Are they male or female? \"That helps us understand causation,\" he said.\n\n\"The CDC is in the place of trying to understand the long-term [consequences], and a death is really important,\" added Van Haren, the pediatric neurologist at Stanford and adviser to the CDC.\n\nSchuchat said the CDC is working hard on AFM. \"We are working 24-7 on this and really take this seriously,\" she said.\n\nShe said the agency has established a case definition for AFM, done laboratory testing on samples sent to them by state health departments, and worked with outside experts to publish information in medical journals.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman said in the past two weeks, the agency has added 14 officers from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Services -- known as \"disease detectives\" -- to help review AFM reports filed by state health departments.\n\nIn 2016, when Alex Bustamante was five years old, he had a headache, and then the next day developed paralysis. He became a paraplegic and a ventilator breathed for him. He died in May of this year.\n\nAn enterprising parent\n\nOn June 10, 2017, about ten months after Carter got sick, Robin reached out to the CDC.\n\nShe was angry.\n\n\"I know it may seem menial, a request from a clinically educated mother, but you are doing these children and family a disservice to not further educate physicians or demand surveillance similar to that of Zika,\" she wrote to an email address she found on the CDC's website.\n\n\"Please do what is right by public health standards and gather more data,\" she continued. \"Or, god forbid if you know more than what you say in a limited fashion online please share it with the public and these patients. My son was immunized on schedule we observed very good hygiene precautions and still became a vent dependent quadriplegic overnight.\"\n\nShe received a response two days later.\n\n\"We are sorry to hear about your son,\" it said. \"Your comments have been forwarded to the appropriate CDC program for their information. They will contact you directly if they have any questions.\"\n\nShe never heard from the CDC again.\n\nCNN relayed Robin's story to the CDC.\n\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that. That's very concerning,\" Schuchat told CNN. \"We are trying to better connect with families, and it's so important that we listen to them.\"\n\nSeveral other parents told CNN their emails to the CDC have also gone unanswered. Some of those emails offered help to the CDC from the families' Facebook group , which has gathered medical information on hundreds of AFM patients.\n\nMessonnier, the CDC doctor, told CNN last month that she'd never heard of the Facebook group.\n\nLast week another enterprising parent got a response from the federal agency. Four-year-old Joey Wilcox of Herndon, Virginia, was diagnosed with AFM in September. His father, Jeremy, works with government agencies as part of his job at a high-tech consulting firm. Wilcox knows how to seek out -- and find -- officials.\n\nJoey Wilcox\n\nHe aimed high. Online he found Schuchat's email address, and asked her to meet with him and other parents. He says she responded within 15 minutes.\n\nHe thinks one of the reasons for the quick response is the \"F\" that parents gave the CDC.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat was a pivotal moment,\" he said of the CNN story.\n\nMore than a dozen families are scheduled to meet with Schuchat Tuesday in Washington.\n\nCarter Roberts' and Alex Bustamante's parents will be among them.", "Back home in Baltimore's Little Italy, Rep.

And while it is true he became famous for the creation of Marvel Comics and characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Thor and The Incredible Hulk, the reason why he is loved isn't child's play at all.\n\nLZ Granderson\n\nHis famous characters may have started off as comics but they never stayed on the page. They outgrew the merchandising. They overflowed out of our televisions. They even are larger than their fictional lives portrayed on the big screen. That's because Stan Lee did more than create characters. He created hope and hope cannot be contained.\n\nThose who would hear of Stan Lee's passing and not feel a tremendous sense of loss do so, I would argue, because they are not able to see all that he gave the world. And that's OK. If everybody could lift Thor's hammer, it wouldn't be that special. Even Stan Lee said he was initially embarrassed to tell people what he did because other people were building bridges or going on to medical school. But he eventually understood that what he did was more than kid stuff.\n\nHis series \"X-Men\" and \"Black Panther\" are essentially manuals on discrimination and how to combat it. \"Iron Man\" explores the uneasy marriage of capitalism and weapons making. \"Captain America\" wrestles with patriotism: what to do when your country is on the wrong side?\n\nUltimately it doesn't matter if you know Stan Lee because we all know him by his principles. And principles aren't weakened if the author of those principles goes unnoticed. They are only weakened if they are not applied. So, as long as we remember this: \"With great power comes great responsibility,\" Stan Lee lives.

Now, she's helping to reduce flooding in the city with her innovative urban design.\n\nBangkok, a city of more than 8 million people , sits in the low-lying Chao Phraya River Delta and is on average just 1.5 meters above sea level. Heavy rainfall in the wet season makes it vulnerable to flooding\n\nTo make matters worse, sea levels are rising, and the city is sinking -- under the weight of its buildings and because too much water has been pumped from the aquifers beneath it.\n\nBut help is coming from an unlikely source -- a park in the heart of the city.\n\nCentennial Park, built on the campus of Chulalongkorn University, is a beautiful green space complete with fountains, exercise bikes and a children's playground.\n\nDesigned by Voraakhom and her landscape architecture firm Landprocess, there's more to this 11-acre (45,000 square meter) park than meets the eye.\n\n\"This park isn't just (about) beautification or recreation,\" Voraakhom told CNN. \"It's helping the city deal with water.\"\n\nAccording to Landprocess, Centennial Park can hold up to one million gallons of water. Credit: Courtesy Landprocess\n\nHow it works\n\nNumerous design features combine to help the park store rainwater and save the surrounding streets from flooding during heavy rains.\n\nThe park is built on an incline, and its slanted main lawn and the angled roof of the park's museum combine to funnel rain water into its sloped gardens.\n\nAs it runs through the gardens, the water collects in artificial wetlands. From there, the water flows into a retention pond, which can hold nearly 480,000 gallons (1,800 cubic meters).\n\nBeneath the porous ground is a water tank with a capacity of nearly 160,000 gallons (600 cubic meters). In all, the park can hold up to one million gallons (4,546 cubic meters) of water.\n\n\"We need to rethink our city,\" said Voraakhom. \"It's not about getting rid of floods or engineering solutions of building a big dam, but it's about how (we) can live with water.\"\n\nFlood waters rush through a market near to the overflowing Chao Phraya River nearby on October 29, 2011 in Bangkok.

He told CNN the project is a good example of how to creatively use the landscape for a multifunctional purpose.\n\n\"This kind of project ... starts where the rain is landing on the surface -- on open spaces, on green parks, on rooftops -- and it's delaying and handling the water the right way,\" he said.\n\nGreening the city\n\nThe park also provides green space in a heavily developed city, says Dreiseitl, making Bangkok more attractive and people friendly.\n\nAccording to the Asian City Green Index , which compares 22 major Asian cities, Bangkok has just 3 square meters of green space per person, which is far below the index average of 39 square meters per person.\n\nThe park, which was completed in March 2017, is too small to have an impact beyond the immediate neighborhood, but Voraakhom wants it to act as a case study for other places, showing that cities can be re-engineered to combine landscape architecture with green solutions.\n\n\"This is a kind of soft revolution in city planning,\" said Dreiseitl. \"It will take some time, but these good solutions are convincing for other private investors and government structures or municipalities to follow this model.\"\n\nHe added that this kind of park could work in other cities, but a lack of space and resources might be an issue.\n\nCentennial Park incorporates various anti-flooding features.

The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nIn October, US news site Vox attempted to collate the name of every influential person accused publicly of sexual misconduct over the last 18 months. The shockingly extensive list (which currently contains more than 250 names) includes everyone from business and media moguls, to academics, actors, and politicians -- highlighting not only the extent of the problem, but also how power, wealth and influence is often weaponized to keep alleged victims silent.\n\nDiscussion of this dynamic resurfaced in the House of Commons when, using his Parliamentary privilege, Lord Hain named Arcadia Group CEO Sir Philip Green as the alleged abuser at the heart of the \"British #MeToo scandal.\"\n\n\"(I have been) contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payouts to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying which is compulsively continuing,\" Hain said, noting that Green had recently slapped The Telegraph newspaper with an injunction , essentially preventing them or any other publication from reporting details of the case.\n\nAs depressing as this might sound, none of it is remotely surprising. Not only is Green a billionaire whose retail empire includes high-street giants Topshop and Topman, he's also been awarded a knighthood and held up as an example of entrepreneurial excellence. He's rich, powerful and highly influential: a #MeToo-busting trifecta.\n\nPhilip Green attends the British Fashion Awards in 2015. Credit: Mike Marsland/WireImage/WireImage\n\nBut one thing sets Green apart from the names of businessmen on the Vox list: he works in the fashion industry. Recent mainstream #MeToo conversations has been dominated by Hollywood, which has subsequently become known as a sort of epicenter of abuse. This isn't necessarily the case. As Bronx-born activist Tarana Burke -- who founded the first iteration of the #MeToo movement back in 2006 to empower victims, the majority of which were young girls and women of color -- knows all too well, the problem is that some stories sink to the bottom of the news cycle whereas others, buoyed by fame and salacious detail, rise to the top. Burke has argued that countless experiences are erased.\n\nIn the case of fashion, it doesn't help that the industry has often normalized extreme sexual imagery and behavior. Terry Richardson's \"practice\" is a case in point , and it took decades for the women accusing him of sexual misconduct to have their allegations taken seriously. Not only was he hailed as a provocative pioneer , he enjoyed a lengthy spell of success: he shot for Vogue, lensed a portrait of Oprah, and even followed Lady Gaga on a world tour whilst photographing her for a coffee table book.\n\nThe currency of Richardson's name within the fashion industry made redundant the voices of women who had been accusing him repeatedly since 2001 . Stories trickled out over the years, and the truth of the events were often evident in his photography: there are photos of women jerking him off; in one shoot he clutches the loose tampon string of a faceless model between his teeth; in countless photos there are women performing oral sex on him on camera. (Richardson denies the allegations of assault, claiming that all such sexual acts were consensual).\n\nAn in-depth 2010 Jezebel piece summarized the accusations , but it wasn't until 2017 that Richardson's public fall from grace finally came, with Cond\u00e9 Nast and other publications instituting a ban on working with him. \"This man has built his business/pleasure empire on breaking the cardinal rule of asking a young girl you don't know to come over to your house and hang out naked: don't be a f--king creep,\" model Jamie Peck wrote in 2010.\n\nJust months after \"Uncle Terry\" was finally vilified for his actions and the multiple allegations, a legion of models began speaking out against endemic abuse in the fashion industry. In January this year, dozens of men stated that Mario Testino and Bruce Weber had sexually exploited them on set. Next, similar allegations were leveled against Patrick Demarchelier\n\nThe domino effect commenced: within just a few months, a handful of fashion's most powerful photographers had been dethroned, denounced and accused of exploiting their immense power. Yet the backlash was muted, and a wider, mainstream ripple was basically nonexistent. The men weren't publicly slated in the way that various Hollywood figures had (rightly) been, and most publications chose to quietly phase them out as opposed to issuing public statements.\n\nOne exception was Vogue, which published a personal response from Anna Wintour detailing new photo shoot regulations (no underage models, no alcohol, revealing shoots must be approved by the subject) but also reinforcing the \"value of remorse and forgiveness.\"\n\nTellingly, she describes both Weber and Testino as close friends in the previous sentence. The statement hints at the industry's nepotism -- which keeps alleged rapists like Ian Connor on the front row of the season's hottest fashion shows -- but it came only because high-profile names were involved. This week's allegations against Green ought to reignite similar fashion industry debate, but that seems as likely to happen as not.\n\nFashion's new vanguard\n\nFashion's victims are often more or less anonymous -- from low-paid, behind-the-scenes assistants, to models without a public profile -- making them essentially powerless; how can we believe these women if we never even hear them? As an industry, fashion is intensely hierarchical. At the very bottom of the food chain are garment workers -- the majority of them struggling young women of color working excruciatingly long hours in developing countries.\n\nNon-profit organizations including Global Labor Justice and the International Labour Organization spend months interviewing workers about their lives, yet their testimonies rarely make the news. As a journalist, I recently learned this firsthand when trying to place a story about these accounts of abuse; I was told in no uncertain terms that these stories don't attract an audience, and that nothing could be written unless the violations had already made major headlines. It's a vicious cycle, and one that leaves untold the stories of fashion's most vulnerable assault victims -- poor women of color being threatened with violence or dismissal if they don't comply with their bosses' demands.\n\nMore than many other industries, fashion actively turns a blind eye to rumors, accusations and allegations of sexual exploitation. The industry largely didn't question Richardson when he plucked beautiful, unknown models from obscurity and masturbated with them on-camera; and, although less explicit, Testino built his career on a homoerotic aesthetic that was only described as \"weird and creepy\" in the aftermath of the New York Times report. Fashion loves nothing more than provocation, and this desire to shock has historically outweighed basic respect, facilitating dynamics that apparently only seem abusive in retrospect.\n\nFashion editor Carine Roitfeld and fashion photographer Terry Richardson in 2016. Credit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images North America\n\nFashion at its highest level relies on a close, nepotistic circle of creatives, elevated to \"genius\" status that, in turn, renders them untouchable. This is precisely why Sara Ziff, a former model and founder of the Model Alliance in New York, didn't question anything when a casting agent asked her to strip almost naked at 14 years old. It's why interns work for free; because, to quote \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" a million others would kill to be in their position.\n\nElsewhere, garment workers endure abuse because they need the work and are largely powerless to stop it, which leaves consumers in developed countries in a tricky position. If we consume fast fashion, we're complicit. If we boycott, their garment industries could collapse entirely, leaving them unemployed (and therefore potentially destitute).\n\nExploitation and abuse in the fashion industry is happening at every level. Sometimes it's sexual, allegedly perpetrated by billionaire tycoons like Philip Green. Sometimes it's financial, driven by budget-conscious CEOs secure in the knowledge that students will work themselves to the bone for a byline, or an unpaid internship.\n\nWhatever form it takes, the issue is systemic, and facilitated (intentionally or not) by intrenched hierarchies. A chain of power that creates victims and simultaneously gags them -- for fear of being blacklisted (by photographers), silenced by NDAs (tycoons) or deliberately erased (garment workers).\n\nThe question we must ask isn't why fashion hasn't yet had its own major #MeToo moment. It has. The real question is why the powerful people who could affect change are so hellbent on maintaining the status quo.", "(CNN) \u2014 With its pastel-hued shop houses, labyrinthine lanes and impenetrable swarms of motorbikes, the Old Quarter is among the most-visited areas of Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nIt's here where you'll find Hanoi Opera House, Hoan Kiem Lake and the National Museum of Vietnamese History -- not to mention a maze of guild streets.\n\nThough you could easily explore on foot, there's another way to tackle the tangle of leafy streets -- one that affords a unique perspective.\n\nEnter Sidecar Tours Vietnam, which lets visitors cruise around the Old Quarter in Soviet-era Ural motorbikes.\n\n\"You get a chance to see everything, looking up at the buildings and watching history go by.\"\n\nHit the streets\n\nChristensen picks up travelers on his vintage motorbike, originally used by army and police, to start the adventure through the Old Quarter.\n\nEstablished centuries ago during imperial times, the storied district has long been the center of commerce in the city.\n\nThere are 36 \"guild streets,\" each of which was more or less dedicated to a specific craft from bamboo to copper, cotton, manufacturing, silk and lacquerware, to name a few.\n\nSidecar Tours Vietnam uses Soviet-era Ural motorbikes for its tours.

Martha McSally and flipping a seat that had been in GOP hands for 24 years.\n\nMcSally conceded the hard-fought race on Monday night -- six days after the election -- as county-by-county tallies of mailed-in ballots continued to increase Sinema's lead.\n\n\"I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on becoming Arizona's first female senator after a hard-fought battle. I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the Senate,\" McSally said in a video posted on Twitter Monday night.\n\nCongrats to @kyrstensinema . I wish her success. I'm grateful to all those who supported me in this journey. I'm inspired by Arizonans' spirit and our state's best days are ahead of us. pic.twitter.com/tw0uKgi3oO\n\nThe concession by McSally means the Senate will have 51 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the upcoming Congress. The Senate race in Florida remains undecided and the Mississippi Senate race is going to a runoff later this month.\n\nThe win comes despite President Donald Trump and Republicans pushing false conspiracy theories about why ballots in Arizona were taking so long to count.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday that \"electoral corruption\" was taking place and suggested Arizona should have a new election. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in an email to reporters, accused the Maricopa County recorder of trying to \"cook the books\" for Sinema.\n\nThe reality is about three-fourths of Arizona's ballots are cast by mail. Because of a state law requiring ballots to be sealed and signed, and signatures to match those on voter registration forms, it routinely takes the state longer than most to tally its results.\n\nMcSally's campaign and state-level GOP officials ignored national Republicans' tactics of casting doubt on the election's results.\n\nA shifting Sun Belt\n\nSinema's victory showed that Democrats are continuing to gain momentum in the rapidly diversifying Sun Belt and firmly places Arizona among the most important presidential and Senate battlegrounds.\n\nThe race was certain to deliver Arizona its first female senator. And it came at a time of major change in the state's delegation.\n\nTrump long sought to recruit a Republican to run in the primary against Sen. Jeff Flake, a critic of the President's incendiary rhetoric. At a 2017 rally in Phoenix, Trump huddled backstage with then-state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former state GOP Chairman Robert Graham and then-Rep. Trent Franks to discuss a potential primary.\n\nRather than face an all-but-certain loss to a Trump-aligned candidate in a primary, Flake retired, opening up the seat on this year's ballot.\n\nThen, in August, longtime GOP Sen. John McCain died. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey appointed Republican former Sen. Jon Kyl to the seat, but Kyl has committed to filling it only through this year -- leaving the possibility that Ducey could have to select another new senator in the coming weeks or months. Either way, McCain's seat is on the ballot in 2020 and is sure to be a top Democratic target.\n\nThe upheaval comes as Arizona, long a Republican bastion, emerges as a swing state in presidential elections. Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by just 4 percentage points there. The result, and the state's growing Latino population, solidified Arizona as a battleground moving forward.\n\nThe fight between McSally and Sinema was bitter, with both drastically shifting their previous positions.\n\nAttempting to prove her conservative bona fides during a primary fight with former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, McSally abandoned her previous support for moderate immigration bills.\n\nSinema's House record ranks her among the most centrist Democrats -- but McSally seized on her rival's past as an anti-war activist, airing a television advertisement featuring Sinema protesting in a pink tutu. McSally told The Arizona Republic that Sinema \"has a lot of explaining to do if you look at her Green Party-pink tutu, proud Prada socialist past and her extreme makeover.\"\n\nLatino Democratic strategists, meanwhile, groused that Sinema had moved too far right on immigration to appeal to a crucial, growing portion of the Democratic electorate.\n\nThe focal point of the contest, though, was health care -- particularly pre-existing conditions. Sinema and Democratic groups lambasted McSally's vote for a House GOP bill to repeal Obamacare, which nonpartisan experts said would weaken the Affordable Care Act's protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMcSally responded with advertisements claiming to be \"leading the fight\" to ensure those people are protected -- even though, under Obamacare, they already are, and the fight in Congress was over Republicans' efforts to change those protections.", "New commercial satellite images have identified more than a dozen undeclared North Korean missile operating bases, another sign that Pyongyang is continuing to move forward with its ballistic missile program amid indications that talks with the US have stalled in recent months.", "Hac clic para enviar por correo electr\u00f3nico a un amigo (Se abre en una ventana nueva)\n\nCortez enfrenta cargos de intento de asesinato agravado, en un juicio que deb\u00eda empezar este lunes pero fue reprogramado para el pr\u00f3ximo 17 de diciembre\n\nImelda Cortez, de 20 a\u00f1os, dio a luz a la beb\u00e9 de su padrastro en una letrina en abril del a\u00f1o pasado\n\nUna joven que qued\u00f3 embarazada despu\u00e9s de que su padrastro la violara enfrenta un juicio en El Salvador por intentar asesinar a su beb\u00e9\n\n(CNN) \u2013 Una joven que qued\u00f3 embarazada despu\u00e9s de que su padrastro la violara enfrenta un juicio en El Salvador por intentar asesinar a su beb\u00e9, seg\u00fan las estrictas leyes del pa\u00eds contra el aborto.\n\nImelda Cortez, de 20 a\u00f1os, dio a luz a la beb\u00e9 de su padrastro en una letrina en abril del a\u00f1o pasado, seg\u00fan el Centro por la Justicia y el Derecho Internacional (Cejil), organizaci\u00f3n que ha estado apoyando su caso.\n\nLa ni\u00f1a sobrevivi\u00f3 y Cortez fue puesto bajo custodia, indic\u00f3 el CEJIL.\n\nCortez enfrenta cargos de intento de asesinato agravado, en un juicio que deb\u00eda empezar este lunes pero fue reprogramado para el pr\u00f3ximo 17 de diciembre.

Japan's second-largest island, it's home to some of the country's most famous fishing waters.\n\nRivers teem with trout and salmon, while the ocean provides everything from scallops to dozens of types of sea urchin. But really it's the crab -- kani, in Japanese -- that's most sought after.\n\nThere are several seasonal varieties of crab, all of which are available in the countless restaurants and market stands across Hokkaido's capital, Sapporo.\n\n\"The Sea of Okhotsk is a cold water sea, bringing some of the world's richest fishing waters north from the Aleutian Islands and Kamchatka down to Hokkaido,\" says Ido Gabay, founder of Hokkaido Nature Tours , which offers gourmet food journeys through Sapporo and beyond.\n\n\"The plankton-filled waters are perfect for the bottom-dwelling crabs.\"\n\nThese include kegani (hairy crab), known for its delicate, sweet flesh. And then there's zuwaigani (snow crab), only harvested in winter.\n\nMeanwhile, tarabagan is the largest type of king crab. It's in season from September to January.\n\nAnd finally there's also hanasaki, which is especially famed for its roe and traditionally served from late summer to mid-Autumn.\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy Hokkaido's crustaceans, but Gabay says true gourmands seek out crab sashimi.\n\n\"Only master chefs can prepare the dish as it requires painstaking preparation to make the meat tender enough to enjoy,\" he says.\n\n\"The hundreds of precise cuts requires perfect concentration, and nearly an hour to prepare. Most chefs will not attempt to prepare the dish as it can easily leave diners unsatisfied with chewy, unforgiving texture.\n\n\"However, the master chef knows the correct strength and number of strokes to cut into the crab's flesh. Although the meat itself has a completely different flavor than grilled or boiled crab, the experience of eating crab sashimi in Hokkaido, and at other locations in Japan, is almost unique in the world.\"\n\nReady to kick off your own crab fest?

El Nasdaq cay\u00f3 2,8% y el S&P 500 cay\u00f3 2%.\n\nApple cay\u00f3 un 5% despu\u00e9s de que el proveedor Lumentum redujera sus ganancias y su previsi\u00f3n de ventas debido a la d\u00e9bil demanda, y JPMorgan redujo su precio objetivo en las acciones de Apple.\n\nEso pes\u00f3 sobre otras acciones tecnol\u00f3gicas, incluidas Amazon, que baj\u00f3 casi un 4,5%, y Tesla, que cay\u00f3 m\u00e1s de un 5%. Facebook, Google, Netflix y Microsoft cayeron m\u00e1s del 2%.\n\nEl d\u00f3lar fuerte tambi\u00e9n pesaba sobre las acciones. La moneda estadounidense subi\u00f3 a un m\u00e1ximo de 16 meses porque los inversionistas temen que la econom\u00eda europea podr\u00eda detenerse si no se alcanza un acuerdo con Brexit esta semana. Las perspectivas de otro aumento de tasas de la Reserva Federal el mes pr\u00f3ximo tambi\u00e9n han ayudado a levantar el d\u00f3lar. El d\u00f3lar en alza es una se\u00f1al de una econom\u00eda fuerte, pero perjudica las ventas y ganancias para las compa\u00f1\u00edas estadounidenses que hacen negocios en el extranjero.\n\nLEE: La raz\u00f3n por la que un d\u00f3lar m\u00e1s fuerte es malo para algunas empresas\n\nAunque Trump culp\u00f3 a los dem\u00f3cratas por la ca\u00edda, el Dow realmente se hab\u00eda recuperado desde las elecciones intermedias, subiendo la semana pasada en su mejor desempe\u00f1o desde marzo. A Wall Street le suele gustar el estancamiento en Washington, por lo que los inversores est\u00e1n realmente bien con que los dem\u00f3cratas tomen el control de la C\u00e1mara.\n\nEn cuanto a lo que Trump calific\u00f3 como la \"perspectiva de acoso presidencial\", no hay mucha evidencia de que el mercado de valores se vuelva loco si los l\u00edderes dem\u00f3cratas en la C\u00e1mara de Representantes inician investigaciones sobre la administraci\u00f3n de Trump. Las acciones subieron antes, durante y despu\u00e9s del juicio pol\u00edtico del presidente Bill Clinton.\n\nLas acciones cayeron en el per\u00edodo previo al proceso de juicio pol\u00edtico del presidente Richard Nixon y durante unos meses despu\u00e9s de su renuncia. Pero la econom\u00eda estaba en recesi\u00f3n en ese momento.\n\nEl mercado de valores hab\u00eda aumentado de manera constante despu\u00e9s de la elecci\u00f3n de Trump hasta 2017. Sin embargo, en enero de 2018 fracas\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que Trump introdujera el primero de muchos paquetes de aranceles destinados a hacer crecer la industria sider\u00fargica de Estados Unidos y reducir las compras estadounidenses de productos de fabricaci\u00f3n extranjera.\n\nLas acciones se recuperaron a mediados de a\u00f1o, pero se han debilitado nuevamente porque los inversores est\u00e1n preocupados por el aumento de las tasas, y por la gran cantidad de deudas causada por el recorte de impuestos que las tasas m\u00e1s altas har\u00e1n m\u00e1s caros de pagar.", "Kate Maltby is a broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics, and a theater critic for The Times of London.

Ron lost his sight 75 years ago in the service of his country -- and the Allied Powers, which include Britain, France and the United States -- due to the malnutrition he endured in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during World War II. He spent four years in the camp after the fall of the British military base at Fort Stanley.\n\nOn Sunday, Ron led 100 fellow veterans down the streets of London as part of the UK's commemorations of the armistice, 100 years since the end of the First World War. There was a light drizzle -- it doesn't seem to have deterred him .\n\nTwo months ago, he made the journey to lay a wreath at the Dernancourt Communal Cemetery in France, where his father lost his own life in 1918. Ron was 3 years old when his father died in the First World War; he nonetheless joined the army at age 15, eight years before the outbreak of the Second World War. Two generations of a family sacrificed to the service of a nation.\n\nThere has been plenty written in the last few days about President Donald Trump's failure to attend the armistice commemorations at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in France on Saturday -- and on what it means for his status in America as commander in chief of the armed forces. Less has been written on what it means for America's relationship with its allies.\n\nUS veterans have every right to be offended by Trump's inability to face a little rain. (Aisne-Marne cemetery had been chosen by the international community to show respect to the Americans; Trump's absence led to the bizarre image of foreign leaders gathering together in a predominantly American cemetery.)\n\nBut consider, too, the message it sends to those of us whose nations have served alongside American troops, often under American command. US presidents, it seems, are happy to send European troops into the face of battle in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not to travel 50 miles to mourn our shared war dead.\n\nAs a Brit, I have spent my life in love with the idea of America. I have lived in America, been educated in America, loved in America. No surprise, then, that I've always been deeply committed to the idea of Anglo-American military cooperation: Get a gin and tonic into me and I've even been known to try to convince British leftists that the invasion of Iraq, with better planning, could have been a good thing.\n\nI'm just one person, political idiosyncrasies and all. But Trump's insult to the joint military forces who served in both world wars will appall many of America's friends abroad. It makes it harder and harder to justify our continued alliances. As the British columnist Matthew d'Ancona wrote on the day of Trump's inauguration , \"for a passionate Atlanticist like me, this is an hour of sheer despair.\" With each affront to America's allies, the rest of us feel the same.\n\nNo one can seriously believe the various excuses made by Team Trump for what appears to be sheer laziness this weekend, so I will not grace them with much analysis here. There is no difficulty getting from Paris to Belleau in a light drizzle. Helicopters can fly in rain; presidents can take cars. (The other world leaders all managed.)\n\nAs the former Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes tweeted , on presidential trips, \"There is always a rain option. Always.\" True, the President is a man of 72. Here in Britain, the queen's consort Prince Philip continued to accompany her to public commemorations until his recent retirement at age 96. Then again, unlike President Trump, he is a war veteran who despite his flaws understands the concept of service.\n\nOne thing's for sure. In pulling this sulk, President Trump has managed to ensure the story of this armistice centenary is all about him -- in splendid American isolation. For other world leaders, the weekend was a carefully planned show of diplomatic alliances. British Prime Minister Theresa May paid her respects at WWI graves on Friday, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel (a member of the public crashing into their cavalcade didn't stop them), before returning to London to lay a wreath alongside the German President at Britain's Cenotaph memorial.\n\nFor more opinion...

For all her wealth and privilege, she is loved here in Britain for having got her hands dirty as a truck mechanic in World War II.\n\nI believe,unfashionable as it is, that European and American military might has a major role to play in spreading democracy around the world. Living in the United States, I put my hand on my heart to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on Veterans Day and shook the hands of American servicemen in gratitude for their service.\n\nBut it gets harder and harder to explain to my countrymen why they should fight and die alongside the flag of a nation whose commander in chief sees honoring our shared war dead -- or celebrating peace with our former adversaries -- as a chore better evaded.\n\nIf Ron Freer can make it to a French cemetery at the age of 103, I'm not sure why Donald Trump can't. Then again, perhaps President Trump doesn't believe in honoring men like Freer. I understand he prefers war heroes who didn't get captured."]
