Add Interest\n\nLittle more than a week ago, he insisted he deserves \"no blame\" for what he called the \"hatred\" seemingly coursing through parts of the country, and outside of the White House on Friday, Trump accused news outlets of fomenting the very violence they've been asking him about.\n\nBut a nationwide review conducted by ABC News has identified at least 17 criminal cases where Trump's name was invoked in direct connection with violent acts, threats of violence or allegations of assault.\n\nNearly all -- 16 of 17 -- cases identified by ABC News are striking in that court documents and direct evidence reflect someone echoing presidential rhetoric, not protesting it. ABC News was unable to find any such case echoing presidential rhetoric when Barack Obama or George W. Bush were in the White House.\n\nThe perpetrators and suspects identified in the 17 cases are mostly white men, as young as teenagers and as old as 68, while the victims represent an array of minority groups -- African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims and gay men.\n\nFederal law enforcement authorities have privately told ABC News they worry that -- even with Trump's public denunciations of violence -- Trump's style could inspire violence-prone individuals to take action against minorities or others they perceive to be against the president's agenda.\n\nEd Kennedy via Reuters\n\nWhile asserting that \"fake\" media coverage is exacerbating divisions in the country, Trump has noted that \"a fan\" of former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opened fire on Republican lawmakers playing baseball in a Washington suburb last year.\n\n\"Nobody puts ... 'Bernie Sanders' in the headline with the maniac,\" Trump said last week. But there's no indication the shooter mentioned Sanders while launching his attack, and no criminal case was ever brought because he was fatally shot during his assault.\n\nIn identifying the 17 Trump-related cases, ABC News excluded incidents where charges were never brought and incidents of Trump-inspired vandalism.\n\nIn conducting its review, ABC News did find several cases where pro-Trump defendants were charged with targeting minorities, or where speculation online suggested the defendants were motivated by Trump, but in those cases ABC News found no police records, court proceedings or other direct evidence presenting a definitive link to the president. So those cases also were excluded in the ABC News tally.\n\nABC News found at least one case out of Chicago featuring anti-Trump rhetoric in connection with violence.\n\nOn Thursday, ABC News sent a list of the cases it identified to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders for comment. As of Sunday evening, three days later, she had yet to respond. Trump has previously told reporters he's \"committed to doing everything\" in his power to not let political violence \"take root in America.\"\n\nHere are the cases identified by ABC News:\n\nSuffolk County District Attorneys Office\n\nAUG. 19, 2015: In Boston, after he and his brother beat a sleeping homeless man of Mexican descent with a metal pole, Steven Leader, 30, told police \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\" The victim, however, was not in the United States illegally. The brothers, who are white, ultimately pleaded guilty to several assault-related charges and were each sentenced to at least two years in prison.\n\nDEC. 5, 2015: After Penn State University student Nicholas Tavella, 19, was charged with \"ethnic intimidation\" and other crimes for threatening to \"put a bullet\" in a young Indian man on campus, his attorney argued in court that Tavella was just motivated by \"a love of country,\" not \"hate.\" \"Donald Trump is running for President of the United States saying that, 'We've got to check people out more closely,'\" Tavella's attorney argued in his defense. Tavella, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to ethnic intimidation and was sentenced to up to two years in prison.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice\n\nAPRIL 28, 2016: When FBI agents arrested 61-year-old John Martin Roos in White City, Oregon, for threatening federal officials, including then-President Barack Obama, they found several pipe bombs and guns in his home. In the three months before his arrest, Roos posted at least 34 messages to Twitter about Trump, repeatedly threatening African Americans, Muslims, Mexican immigrants and the \"liberal media,\" and in court documents, prosecutors noted that the avowed Trump supporter posted this threatening message to Facebook a month earlier: \"The establishment is trying to steal the election from Trump. ... Obama is already on a kill list ... Your [name] can be there too.\" Roos, who is white, has since pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered explosive device and posting Internet threats against federal officials. He was sentenced to more than five years in prison.\n\nJUNE 3, 2016: After 54-year-old Henry Slapnik attacked his African-American neighbors with a knife in Cleveland, he told police \"Donald Trump will fix them because they are scared of Donald Trump,\" according to police reports. Slapnik, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to \"ethnic intimidation\" and other charges. It's unclear what sentence he received.\n\nAUG. 16, 2016: In Olympia, Washington, 32-year-old Daniel Rowe attacked a white woman and a black man with a knife after seeing them kiss on a popular street. When police arrived on the scene, Rowe professed to being \"a white supremacist\" and said \"he planned on heading down to the next Donald Trump rally and stomping out more of the Black Lives Matter group,\" according to court documents filed in the case. Rowe, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to charges of assault and malicious harassment, and he was sentenced to more than four years in prison.\n\nCleveland Police Department\n\nSEPT. 1, 2016: The then-chief of the Bordentown, New Jersey, police department, Frank Nucera, allegedly assaulted an African-American teenager who was handcuffed. Federal prosecutors said the attack was part of Nucera's \"intense racial animus,\" noting in federal court that \"within hours\" of the assault, Nucera was secretly recorded saying \"Donald Trump is the last hope for white people.\" The 60-year-old Nucera has been indicted by a federal grand jury on three charges, including committing a federal hate crime. Nucera, who is white, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. He retired last year.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2016: After 40-year-old Mark Feigin of Los Angeles was arrested for posting anti-Muslim and allegedly threatening statements to a mosque's Facebook page, his attorney argued in court that the comments were protected by the First Amendment because Feigin was \"using similar language and expressing similar views\" to \"campaign statements from then-candidate Donald Trump.\" Noting that his client \"supported Donald Trump,\" attorney Caleb Mason added that \"Mr. Feigin's comments were directed toward a pressing issue of public concern that was a central theme of the Trump campaign and the 2016 election generally: the Islamic roots of many international and U.S. terrorist acts.\" Feigin, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sending harassing communications electronically. He was sentenced to probation.\n\nOCT. 13, 2016: After the FBI arrested three white Kansas men for plotting to bomb an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas, where many Somali immigrants lived, one of the men's attorneys insisted to a federal judge that the plot was \"self-defensive\" because the three men believed \"that if Donald Trump won the election, President Obama would not recognize the validity of those results, that he would declare martial law, and that at that point militias all over the country would have to step in.\" Then, after a federal grand jury convicted 47-year-old Patrick Stein and the two other men of conspiracy-related charges, Stein's attorney argued for a lighter sentence based on \"the backdrop\" of Stein's actions: Trump had become \"the voice of a lost and ignored white, working-class set of voters\" like Stein, and the \"climate\" at the time could propel someone like Stein to \"go to 11,\" attorney Jim Pratt said in court. Stein and his two accomplices are awaiting sentencing.\n\nNOV. 3, 2016: In Tampa, Florida, David Howard threatened to burn down the house next to his \"simply because\" it was being purchased by a Muslim family, according to the Justice Department. He later said under oath that while he harbored a years-long dislike for Muslims, the circumstances around the home sale were \"the match that lit the wick.\" He cited Trump's warnings about immigrants from majority-Muslim countries. \"[With] the fact that the president wants these six countries vetted, everybody vetted before they come over, there's a concern about Muslims,\" Howard said. Howard, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights violation, and the 59-year-old was sentenced to eight months in prison.\n\nNOV. 12, 2016: In Grand Rapids, Michigan, while attacking a cab driver from East Africa, 23-year-old Jacob Holtzlander shouted racial epithets and repeatedly yelled the word, \"Trump,\" according to law enforcement records. Holtzlander, who is white, ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of ethnic intimidation, and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\nJAN. 3, 2017: In Chicago, four young African-Americans -- sisters Brittany and Tanishia Covington, Jordan Hill and Tesfaye Cooper -- tied up a white, mentally disabled man and assaulted him, forcing him to recite the phrases \"F--k Donald Trump\" and \"F--k white people\" while they broadcast the attack online. Each of them ultimately pleaded guilty to committing a hate crime and other charges, and three of them were sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nJAN. 25, 2017: At JFK International Airport in New York, a female Delta employee, wearing a hijab in accordance with her Muslim faith, was \"physically and verbally\" attacked by 57-year-old Robin Rhodes of Worcester, Mass., \"for no apparent reason,\" prosecutors said at the time. When the victim asked Brown what she did to him, he replied: \"You did nothing, but ... [Expletive] Islam. [Expletive] ISIS. Trump is here now. He will get rid of all of you.\" Rhodes ultimately pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of \"menacing,\" and he was sentenced to probation.\n\nFEB. 19, 2017: After 35-year-old Gerald Wallace called a mosque in Miami Gardens, Florida, and threatened to \"shoot all y'all,\" he told the FBI and police that he made the call because he \"got angry\" from a local TV news report about a terrorist act. At a rally in Florida the day before, Trump falsely claimed that Muslim refugees had just launched a terrorist attack in Sweden.\n\nWATCH WALLACE'S INTERVIEW WITH THE FBI AND POLICE:\n\nPlay\n\nWallace's attorney, Katie Carmon, later tried to convince a federal judge that the threat to kill worshippers could be \"protected speech\" due to the \"very distinctly political climate\" at the time. \"There are courts considering President Trump's travel ban ... and the president himself has made some very pointed statements about what he thinks about people of this descent,\" Carmon argued in court.\n\nHEAR CARMON'S REMARKS IN COURT:\n\nPlay\n\nWallace, who is African American, ultimately pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of his victims' religious beliefs, and he was sentenced to one year in prison.\n\nFEB. 23, 2017: Kevin Seymour and his partner Kevin price were riding their bicycles in Key West, Florida, when a man on a moped, 30-year-old Brandon Davis of North Carolina, hurled anti-gay slurs at them and \"intentionally\" ran into Seymour's bike, shouting, \"You live in Trump country now,\" according to police reports and Davis' attorney. Davis ultimately pleaded guilty to a charge of battery evidencing prejudice, but in court, he expressed remorse and was sentenced to four years of probation.\n\nMAY 3, 2017: In South Padre Island, Texas, 35-year-old Alexander Jennes Downing of Waterford, Connecticut, was captured on cell phone video taunting and aggressively approaching a Muslim family, repeatedly shouting, \"Donald Trump will stop you!\" and other Trump-related remarks. Police arrested downing, of Waterford, Connecticut, for public intoxication. It's unclear what came of the charge.\n\nAUGUST 2018: After the Boston Globe called on news outlets around the country to resist what it called \"Trump's assault on journalism,\" the Boston Globe received more than a dozen threatening phone calls. \"You are the enemy of the people,\" the alleged caller, 68-year-old Robert Chain of Encino, California, told a Boston Globe employee on Aug. 22. \"As long as you keep attacking the President, the duly elected President of the United States ... I will continue to threat[en], harass, and annoy the Boston Globe.\" A week later, authorities arrested Chain on threat-related charges. After a hearing in his case, he told reporters, \"America was saved when Donald J. Trump was elected president.\" He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.\n\nLATE OCTOBER 2018: Over the course of a week, Florida man Cesar Sayoc allegedly mailed at least 15 potential bombs to prominent critics of Trump and members of the media. Sayoc had been living in a van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, and he had posted several pro-Trump messages on social media. While federal prosecutors have accused him of \"domestic terrorism\" and filed several bomb-related and assault charges against him, he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nABC News' Luke Barr, Karen Travers, Meredith McGraw and Alexis Scott contributed to this report.", "President Trump ripped into Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams at a rally in Macon, Georgia, on Sunday, calling her \"radical,\" and \"one of the most extreme far-left politicians in the country.\"\n\nInterested in Donald Trump?

Add Interest\n\nThe president was headlining a rally for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who he also endorsed during the primary, likely catapulting Kemp from second place to Republican nominee in the general election.\n\nA crowd of thousands in a Middle Georgia Regional Airport hangar cheered raucously for \"six more years\" of a Trump presidency. They also chanted \"lock her up\" during Trump's references to a woman who admitted to falsifying rape claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Those claims were not considered serious by Senate investigators, and stand in contrast to the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump baselessly told the crowd that if Abrams is elected, \"your 2nd Amendment is gone.\"\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nAbrams has campaigned on increasing gun control in Georgia while \"having respect for the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nTrump also said Abrams \"wants illegal aliens to vote,\" a common criticism of Abrams referencing a video that surfaced of her saying undocumented immigrants are part of the so-call \"blue wave\" of Democratic voters expected to vote in this year's elections.\n\nAbrams refuted that accusation in an interview with ABC News' Deborah Roberts. \"I know that the only people who are allowed to vote are eligible citizens,\" said Abrams.\n\nThe president further riled up the crowd with references to the \"caravan\" of migrants moving from Central America towards the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"You saw last week I called up the U.S. military, we\u2019re not playing games,\" he said of the thousands of U.S. troops headed to the border just days before the midterm election. \"Because you look at what\u2019s marching up, that\u2019s an invasion,\" he said. Trump also accused the caravan of including criminals.\n\nTrump is scheduled to hold another rally on Sunday night in Chattanooga, Tennessee.", "An ex-convict was found guilty of first-degree murder and other charges Sunday in the fatal shooting of a police officer in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nA jury in state court convicted Tremaine Wilbourn on Sunday in the August 2015 killing of Officer Sean Bolton. Wilbourn also was found guilty of carjacking and weapons charges, news outlets reported.\n\nBolton, who was white, was one of four police officers to be fatally shot in Memphis since July 2011. Wilbourn is black.\n\nPolice said Bolton interrupted a drug deal in a car Wilbourn occupied in a residential neighborhood. Wilbourn got out of the vehicle, and he and Bolton got into a physical struggle, according to authorities. Wilbourn took out a gun and shot Bolton, police said.\n\nAn autopsy report shows Bolton was shot eight times.\n\nWilbourn already has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison on weapons charges. His lawyer said his client did not intend to kill Bolton. In court documents during his federal trial, prosecutors said Wilbourn carjacked a vehicle a few minutes after the shooting, telling the motorist that \"he needed the car because he had just shot a police officer.\"\n\nWilbourn led officers on an intense, two-day manhunt before turning himself in to U.S. marshals.\n\nAt the time of the shooting, Wilbourn was on federal probation after serving prison time for armed bank robbery.", "Baghdad police say four people have been killed in four bomb blasts in the Iraqi capital, including two inside commuter minivans.\n\nThe blasts occurred after Sunday's evening rush hour and appeared to target Shiite districts around Baghdad, including Sadr City and Kadhimiya.\n\nPolice officials say the individual blasts were relatively small. They say about 20 people were wounded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, in line with police regulations.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility in a statement posted by its Amaq News Agency and circulated on social media.\n\nThe militant group continues to terrorize Iraqis with kidnappings and bombings despite losing nearly all its territories to Iraqi forces last year. The group promotes violence against Shiites across the Islamic world.", "A Texas Republican congressional candidate has chided \"Saturday Night Live\" comic Pete Davidson for poking fun at the eyepatch he wears because he was badly wounded during his third tour in Afghanistan as a Navy SEAL.\n\nDavidson said during Saturday's \"Weekend Update\" segment that Dan Crenshaw, whose photo was displayed, was \"kinda cool\" but that viewers might be \"surprised he's a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie.\" He added, \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\"\n\nCrenshaw, who is running against Democrat Todd Litton for an open suburban Houston district seat, replied in a tweet on Sunday, saying: \"Good rule in life: I try hard not to offend; I try harder not to be offended. That being said, I hope @nbcsnl recognizes that vets don't deserve to see their wounds used as punchlines for bad jokes.\"", "Vermont is poised to make history for the LGBTQ community if voters in the Green Mountain State oust their current governor in favor of first-time candidate Christine Hallquist.\n\nThe Democrat running in Vermont\u2019s gubernatorial election, will be the first transgender governor in the nation if elected on Tuesday.\n\nAfter securing her party\u2019s nomination in August, Hallquist is up against Republican incumbent Gov. Phil Scott, who is running for a second term in the historically blue state. Scott is facing a tough challenge since his approval ratings with his GOP base have tumbled following recent efforts to tighten gun control in Vermont.\n\nDespite being a liberal stronghold, particularly in presidential elections, Vermont residents are staunch supporters of gun rights -- with the state scoring an \"F\" according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nAdvancing a progressive platform focused on economic and social justice, including a $15 minimum wage, environmentally sustainable rural development and expanding access to internet services, the Democratic hopeful edged out challengers in a crowded primary.\n\n\"I am so proud to be the face of the Democrats tonight,\" Hallquist said during her primary victory party.\n\nAlong with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed Hallquist. During her primary race, she received the backing of Justice Democrats, a progressive political action committee founded by former Sanders campaign leaders, including Cenk Uygur of \"The Young Turks,\" which helped propel leftist superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to her victory over longtime New York 14th Congressional District incumbent Joe Crowley earlier this summer.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nHallquist joins three other openly LGBTQ candidates for governor this year -- a historically high number -- including Lupe Valdez of Texas, Kate Brown of Oregon and Jared Polis of Colorado, all Democrats.\n\nBefore making a bid for governor, Hallquist was the chief executive of the Vermont Electric Cooperative for 12 years. She transitioned from male to female in 2015, and became the first business leader in the country to transition while in office.\n\nABC News partner FiveThirtyEight lists the race as likely electing the Republican candidate and forecasts a 11.6 point lead for Scott, as of Nov. 4.\n\nABC News\u2019 Lee Harris contributed to this report.", "A western Wisconsin community on Sunday was grieving the deaths of three Girl Scouts and a parent who were collecting trash along a rural highway when police say a pickup truck veered off the road and hit them before speeding away.\n\nAuthorities have not released the names of the girls or the woman who were struck by the truck Saturday in Lake Hallie, or the name of a fourth girl who survived but was in critical condition at a Minnesota hospital. The girls were fourth-graders and members of Troop 3055 in nearby Chippewa Falls, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of Minneapolis.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken for the girls and families of the Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes,\" CEO Sylvia Acevedo of Girl Scouts of the USA said in a statement Sunday. \"The Girl Scout Movement everywhere stands with our sister Girl Scouts in Wisconsin to grieve and comfort one another in the wake of this terrible tragedy.\"\n\nHundreds of community members gathered in 40-degree weather Sunday evening for a vigil outside Halmstad Elementary School, where some of the girls were students. Many in the crowd held candles and umbrellas in the light rain. Several Girl Scouts sang songs in memory of the victims.\n\nEarlier Sunday, teddy bears, balloons and candles sat on two wooden benches in front of Halmstad Elementary while dozens of families met inside with faith leaders and counselors. Families did the same at Southview Elementary School, the other school the girls attended, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.\n\n\"It's been very nice. There's been a lot of people \u2014 it's been a very supportive environment,\" said Michelle Golden, human resources director for Chippewa Falls School District.\n\nIn a message to parents, Superintendent Heidi Eliopoulos said: \"This is a difficult time for our students, families and staff. We will be providing ongoing support for both students (and) families and staff for as long as needed.\"\n\nLake Hallie police Sgt. Daniel Sokup said the pickup, a black Ford F-150, crossed a lane and veered into a roadside ditch, striking the victims. Other members of the troop were picking up trash from the opposite shoulder.\n\nThe 21-year-old driver, Colten Treu of Chippewa Falls, sped off but later surrendered. He will be charged with four counts of homicide, Sokup said. It was unclear Sunday if Treu had an attorney who could speak for him. Police misspelled Treu's first name as \"Colton\" in initial news releases.\n\nSokup said it was not immediately known if there were other factors that might have led the driver to leave the road. The Star Tribune reported that the crash happened before a hill and there were no blind spots, and Sokup said it was \"not an unsafe area.\"\n\nBut Cecily Spallees, a personal care attendant at a group home near the crash site, told the newspaper that drivers regularly speed on that stretch of road, which quickly changes from a 55-mph to a 35-mph zone.\n\n\"I'm always telling one of my residents that he shouldn't walk this strip at night,\" Spallees said. \"It's not safe.\"", "Just past 4 a.m., under a star-streaked sky, the Central American migrants shouldered their bags and picked over broken sidewalks -- first as a trickle, then as a flood -- to the edge of the Mexican town of Mapastepec.\n\nInterested in Immigration?

Their compass point was north, towards the U.S.\n\nTheir goal for the day was to reach Pijijiapan. The town, 30 miles away, was the next stop on a trek by thousands in a caravan that has so enraged U.S. President Donald Trump he has threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border and slash aid to Central America.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nHonduran boys Adonai, 5, and Denzel, 8, set off from Mapastepec still fogged with sleep. Their mother, Glenda Escobar, 33, clutched her youngest's hand. Her friend, Maria, held onto Denzel's T-shirt.\n\nNo one had a torch. Potholes were treacherous. Only the floodlights of the odd truck in the opposite lane of the highway helped them see a few feet at a time.\n\nWithin minutes, a young man lay on his back, hugging his knee to his chest. He'd smashed his ankle on a rock, he said, and was in too much pain to stand. The single mother and her boys strode past, keeping pace with the long train of people.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar\u2019s ultimate destination: Los Angeles, a city where she knows no one. \"It's because in my dreams, God told me that's where he's sending me,\" she said.\n\nTrump, who campaigned against illegal immigration and won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has seized on this caravan in the run-up to the Nov. 6 midterm elections, firing up support for his Republican Party.\n\nYet the caravan\u2019s members make up a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who every year flee violence and poverty in Central America for the United States.\n\nEstimates on the size of the caravan vary from around 3,500 to more than double that. Some migrants have abandoned the journey, deterred by the hardships or the possibility of making a new life in Mexico. Others joined it in southern Mexico.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar kneaded her shin. Agile and slight, she used to exercise regularly back home in the crime-wracked city of San Pedro Sula. But even the hardiest person would have struggled to cover the roughly 30 miles every day since she joined the caravan on Oct. 14.\n\nIf she and her boys were lucky, a passing car or minivan would give them a ride before the sun turned the day from sticky warm to sticky hot.\n\nSoon the boys watched wide-eyed as dozens, mainly young men, sprinted for the backs of slowing trucks and jumped aboard -- an impossible feat for a mother with two small children.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nEscobar\u2019s family had had no food or water since residents of Mapastepec provided them a dinner of rice, beans, and eggs about 12 hours earlier.\n\nThat morning, there had been nothing to eat at the school where they slept on a three-foot square patch of floor, squeezed among dozens of parents with small children.\n\nAt least they had found shelter from the night's downpour that soaked hundreds who slept on the sidewalks.\n\nA shifting committee of self-appointed representatives in green jackets decide when to rise, move or sweep the streets they borrow for a night. The caravan follows like clockwork.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nThrough Guatemala to southern Mexico, private citizens, church groups and local organizations offered help at almost every stop and on the walks in between.\n\nSince entering Mexico, they have been assisted by members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant rights group that has guided caravans through the country for several years, including this current one that drew the ire of Trump in April.\n\nHis broadsides against that caravan have generated enormous publicity, convincing others desperate to leave Central America that caravans are a safer way to travel. Others have begun forming behind Escobar's group.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nBy 9 a.m, two hours past sunrise, the first hitchhikers reached Pijijiapan.\n\nThe Escobars followed far behind.\n\n\"We've been going so many days,\" Escobar said, watching her sons flag, then suddenly leap to life and give each other piggy backs. \"Should we rest here a bit?\"\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nThe boys dropped down and started wrestling, which did nothing to stir Maria, who fell asleep in seconds on her backpack. Escobar, splayed on her back, stared at the sky, relating the many reasons that led to her journey.\n\nThe eldest of seven children, she abandoned school and dreams of becoming a detective to help her mother.\n\nLife spiraled down at 18, she said, when on her way to work, a man she knew kidnapped her. She escaped but was pregnant with the child of her rapist, a former policeman who turned out to be a member of Barrio-18, she said. That brutal gang, together with MS-13, dominates much of El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nHe disappeared, believed to have been killed, but no one ever found the body, she said.\n\nShe raised his girl and had a son with another man. In time, he fled to the U.S., promising to send for her. Within a year, his sister told her he had married someone else.\n\nFinally, she fell for a mototaxi driver, who fathered Denzel and Adonai. But he began to throw things at her and abuse her and the boys. Then he forced her out of the house she had paid for with money saved from years working as a cook and a seamstress, she said.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nWhen a neighbor told her about the caravan, she packed fast: a plastic tarp, clothes for the children, some soap. She left her two eldest children with family, hoping to fetch them later.\n\nCoordinators have not said definitively when and where the caravan might reach the U.S. border, saying it will likely fragment as many people decide to stay in Mexico.\n\nEscobar and her family heaved to their feet. Denzel unfolded a discarded pamphlet that workers from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees distributed to the caravan two towns back.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nTo disperse the convoy, Mexico has offered the Central Americans temporary jobs and identification papers if they submit requests for asylum in the south. But most have rejected the offer.\n\n\"No, no,\" Escobar told her son. \"The United States is better. For everything.\"\n\nAfter six hours, Escobar started hitchhiking.\n\nUeslei Marcelino/Reuters\n\nIn Pijijiapan, hundreds had turned the main square into a mix of carnival and refugee camp. The family headed for a warehouse-sized shelter reserved for anyone with children.\n\nA medical aide squeezed iodine on a woman's bleeding foot. People swarmed into the bathroom. Many went for a dip in a river.\n\nIn mid-afternoon, the warehouse was stifling with the crush of bodies. Escobar searched outside and set her plastic tarp under a tree. Two more stops and they would board a northbound freight train known as \u201cLa Bestia\u201d (the Beast), she said.\n\nAll around, adults fell asleep, exhausted.\n\nBut Adonai was sprinting for his third bottle of water.

Gen. Jefferson S. Burton, the adjutant general of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor's mission was to help train and build the capacity of the Afghan national army.\n\n\"He was with folks he was helping and training. That's what's so painful about this. It's bitter,\" Burton said. \"I do believe that Major Taylor felt he was among friends, with people he was working with.\"\n\nUtah media outlets cited a statement from NATO saying that Taylor was shot by one of the commandos being trained and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.\n\nTaylor leaves behind a wife and seven children.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nNot once during his public remarks to a small group of ardent Democrats in this picturesque mountain town did Jared Polis talk about his personal life.\n\nHe talked about his accomplishments in Washington and his goals for Colorado. He talked about the Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness, and Camp Hale Legacy Act and he talked about the Helicopter Fuel System Safety Act. He talked about how lowering the cost of early childhood education would benefit the state's neediest families and how if his opponent is elected, he will serve as a \"yes-man\" for the president. But Jared Polis didn\u2019t talk about his personal life.\n\nIn a year in which candidates across the country are sharing tales of their health ailments and job layoffs, racial discrimination and childcare struggles, Polis -- who could make history next week as the first openly gay man to win a U.S. gubernatorial election -- is instead deflecting attention away from his potential historical accomplishment and towards the message of inclusivity that has been embraced by his fellow Democrats in the most diverse election cycle in modern memory.\n\n\"I really think that we are at our best as a nation, as a society, when our elected officials are fully representative of the people they're elected to work for,\" Polis told ABC News. \"That means we should have our communities of color represented, women represented, the LGBTQ community represented. And the more diversity we have in elected leadership, responsible positions, I think the better result we'll have.\"\n\nThough he's chosen not to make his sexual orientation a talking point on the campaign trail, Polis' shot at history comes as part of this year's \"rainbow wave,\" an influx of LGBTQ candidates across the country who are running for office.\n\nIn Vermont, Democrat Christine Hallquist is the first transgender woman to be a major party's gubernatorial candidate. Gov. Kate Brown, up for re-election in Oregon, became the first openly bisexual person to serve as a state's governor upon her ascension to the position in 2015. ABC News has identified an additional 22 candidates who identify as members of the LGBTQ community running as the major party nominee in House and Senate races nationwide.\n\nAndy Cross/Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nTo Polis however, already the first openly gay man to be out when first elected to the House of Representatives, such progress is not unusual, at least in his home state.\n\n\"Colorado is a groundbreaking state,\" said Polis. \"We've had LGBT speakers in our state assembly, Senate minority leaders, commissioners.\"\n\nBut as he referenced the various achievements of LGBTQ community members across the state, Polis neglected to mention moments that it did not distinguish itself as progressive. Namely, the 1992 referendum formally called the \"Colorado No Protected Status for Sexual Orientation Amendment.\" The initiative, which was approved by a 53.4 to 46.6 margin stripped legal protection for homosexual, lesbian and bisexual residents on the basis of their sexual orientation. This led Colorado to acquire the nickname, \"The Hate State.\"\n\nThough the result of the 1992 referendum startled the state's LGBT community, it also spurred a call to action that has led to significant developments for the LGBTQ community over the past 25 years.\n\n\"Activism around Amendment 2 really helped, I believe, Colorado become more politically sophisticated and more organized,\" said Rex Fuller, the vice president of communications at the non-profit GLBT Community Center of Colorado in Denver.\n\nFuller linked the amendment's passage to the 1980s AIDS crisis, which disproportionately affected LGBT persons, describing the era as a low-point for the community from which it has gradually recovered. A number of legal advancements since have come in the form of Supreme Court decisions. In 1996, Amendment 2 was thrown out as a result of the decision in Romer v. Evans, the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down via United States v. Windsor in 2013, and 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges decision affirmed the right of same-sex couples to marry.\n\n\"They're the rights that anyone should have under our Constitution,\" Fuller said, explaining that though the LGBT community may appear insular to outsiders, its members should be treated no differently.\n\n\"I think that's always where we've been trying to move. Any minority group wants to enjoy a shared heritage that they share because of shared experiences, but that doesn't govern everything.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court decisions and a broader societal shift towards LGBTQ acceptance have not, however, ended the harassment of the community. Fuller recounted a number of incidents in the past two years in which local LGBT individuals have been hassled because of their sexual orientation, including once by a person wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. According to Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ civil rights organization, 22 transgender people have died due to fatal violence in 2018. Last year the total was 29, the highest number ever recorded by the organization. https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2018\n\nAdditional legal protections for the LGBTQ community are being sought by legislative means, and though community members are optimistic about Colorado's increasingly progressive laws -- those governing marijuana possession and use were among the first of their kind in the country -- LGBTQ advocates have run into roadblocks over the past four years when they attempted to make it easier for transgender people to change their birth certificates and outlaw conversion therapy on LGBTQ minors.\n\nDaniel Ramos, the executive director of One Colorado, an LGBTQ advocacy organization located in Denver, said that while gathering bipartisan support, the both measures failed in recent years in the state's Republican-controlled Senate. In addition to Polis' history-making campaign, Colorado Democrats' top priority this week is to win back that chamber.\n\n\"For the work that we do, we know that the governor can only do so much,\" Ramos said. \"And that the more work we do to change hearts [and] minds in Colorado and across the country around LGBTQ issues is even more important.\"\n\n\"While we may have a pro-equality majority in state legislature and a pro-equality governor, the important work we still need to do is to tell stories and to humanize the impacts of legislation for LGBTQ folks. Having a gay governor doesn't make everything else go away.\"\n\nThough Polis has been a public figure in the state for decades -- prior to his run for the House he was a chairman of the state board of education and a prolific philanthropist -- he has not been immune to attacks on his sexual orientation. The appearance of homophobic bumper stickers against Polis were reported in the town of Eagle, Colorado, and police have located a person of interest, according to Fox's Denver affiliate KDVR.\n\nBut as for his sexual orientation's impact at the polls, the Democrat was adamant that voters are focused on the bigger picture.\n\n\"I think what the people of Colorado care about is: who's going to make my life better?\" Polis said. \"They don't care about who you are and who you love.\"", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

He didn't warn Georgians that their personal information may be compromised. He instead launched politically motivate accusations against his political opponents.\u201d\n\nAbrams, who with a victory on Tuesday would become the first African-American woman to be elected governor in the United States, told ABC News\u2019 affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta that Kemp was \u201ctrying to distract voters with a desperate ploy.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s gubernatorial forecast listed the Georgia race as a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d with both candidates projected to receive just shy of 50 percent of the total vote.

Just days after the 2016 presidential election, Kemp requested a federal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, citing 10 suspected unauthorized attempts by DHS personnel to penetrate the state\u2019s firewall.\n\nA report from the Inspector General of DHS released in July 2017, concluded that allegations were unsubstantiated. The investigation determined that the activity flagged by Kemp was the \u201cresult of normal and automatic computer message exchanges,\u201d and that there were no unauthorized intrusion attempts.\n\nVoting rights have been a central issue in the campaign over the past several months, and Kemp has resisted calls, including from former President Jimmy Carter, to recuse himself from overseeing an election in which he is running.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has been under fire for weeks after an investigation by the Associated Press found that more than 50,000 registrations, the vast majority from African-American voters, had been put on hold because data in their voter registration applications did not exactly match other government records.\n\nBob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP\n\nCivil rights\u2019 groups have sued Kemp over that so-called \u201cexact-match\u201d law and over allegations that hundreds of absentee ballot were tossed after election workers determined that the signatures on the ballot applications did not match those on file. Federal judges ruled against Kemp in both instances.\n\n\u201cHe twice this week was told by federal judges that he was wrong when it comes to voter suppression,\u201d Abrams said Sunday. \u201cThey forced him to restore access to the right to vote for those who are casting absentee ballots and those who on the exact match list. He is trying to rile up his base by misleading voters yet again.\"\n\nKevin D.

Still, there were only about 100 troops at the border as of Friday, working at and near a bridge leading to McAllen, Texas, the Rio Grande Valley's second-biggest city, with a population of about 140,000.\n\n\"Donald Trump is saying that everybody in here they're violent.

Some in the group, according to Trump, threw rocks at the police.\n\nGarcia is traveling with his two daughters, one 13 years old and the other 14 months old. He said Trump's rhetoric has discouraged him from traveling to the United States.\n\nMarcus Moore/ABC News\n\nInstead, he said he plans to go to Mexico City, where people have promised him shelter and a job.\n\nGarcia said he used to live in the United States, and spent about 35 years in Los Angeles before he was deported when he was cited for driving under the influence.\n\nIn Guatemala, Garcia said he started a small business.\n\n\"I had a good little business and I was being extorted by criminals sent by police, corrupted police,\" he said. \"I was paying them but they kept on asking me for more and more and after that, I couldn't give them more, so they killed my wife.

So, when I heard about the caravan I decided we have to take off.\"\n\nHe said many of the migrants, who have been traveling since early October, have left the caravan and returned to their homes because of Trump's decision to send soldiers to the border.\n\n\"These people [migrants] think that they\u2019re going to get over there and the soldiers are going to start shooting at them,\" Garcia said. \"That's what the government in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador do.\"\n\nAnother migrant, Nelmy Ponce said she, too, has a message for Trump.\n\n\"I want to send a message to Donald Trump and ask him to soften his heart,\" Ponce told ABC News in Spanish during an interview near Isla municipality in the port city of Veracruz.\n\nABC News\n\n\"I will want to work,\" she continued. \"Give us permission to enter the country, because we are not delinquent.

They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.\n\nNow, Alvarez, a 32-year-old from Cuba, is worried that large waves of migrants in a caravan still more than 800 miles away from the border might provoke the U.S. government to reject them altogether.\n\n\"Our idea is to enter before the caravan,\" he said. \"We are afraid that the group of migrants will reach us and that they will judge us together with them.\"\n\nAsylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. President Donald Trump last week threatened to detain asylum seekers in large tents and send as many as 15,000 active-duty soldiers to the border. He's also spoken of closing the border.\n\nU.S. government officials say the bridges remain open to asylum seekers. But in South Texas, the busiest corridor for unauthorized border crossings, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stand at the center of bridges to check documents and stop most asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in San Diego, people at the San Ysidro crossing wait more than a month, and volunteers operate an informal take-a-number system to spare migrants from having to wait in line or sleep out in the open.

Some days, five or 10 people are allowed. On other days, the asylum seekers said, no one is.\n\nAt another bridge separating Brownsville and Matamoros, four women and their children slept under a blue tarp on the bridge. The tarp had been left behind by previous asylum seekers. One of the women said she had waited there for two days.\n\nSeeking asylum at a port of entry is legal under U.S. law, as government officials have reaffirmed this year. Trump has proposed banning people crossing illegally between ports of entry from claiming asylum \u2014 something many immigration experts say he can't do under the law.\n\nThe U.S. fielded nearly 332,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double that of two years earlier and the highest of any country in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And many asylum seekers wait for years to have their claims adjudicated, a delay criticized by administration officials and immigration lawyers alike.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions ruled in June that fleeing gang or domestic violence would generally not be considered grounds for asylum, a decision that would affect many people's claims.\n\nJodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, said she believes the government was trying to frustrate asylum seekers into giving up.\n\n\"I think they're using a lot of ruse and double-speak to try to circumvent the law,\" she said.\n\nTwo women and three children were waiting Saturday at the center of the bridge between McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, a day after soldiers had installed concertina wire on the bridge and the riverbank below.\n\nAfter some time, an official from Mexico's migration bureau came up to the group of five and directed them off the bridge, away from U.S. customs.\n\nAssociated Press journalists followed as the official and then a private security guard led the group back into Mexico and into a migration bureau office. An employee inside the building would not let the AP interview the group, and U.S. border inspectors on the bridge declined to comment.\n\nAt the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, Alvarez continued to wait with others from all over the world: Honduras, Peru, Venezuela and Cameroon.\n\nThey insisted they will only enter peacefully and lawfully, waiting their turn at the bridge.\n\nJavier Mederos Mendez, a 44-year-old from Havana, said he was fleeing political repression because he disagreed with the ruling Castro family. He said he had flown from Cuba to South America, then crossed through jungles and violence-torn areas of Central America and Mexico to reach the bridge.\n\nHe and others had seen people drown or starve along the way.\n\nAsked what he thought of Trump's announcements about asylum, Mederos said, \"It would be unfair of me to decide what is good or bad for a country.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"I will wait as long as necessary until they receive me.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.", "Officials confirm it was a tornado that ripped apart some of an Amazon distribution warehouse in Baltimore, killing two men who worked for outside employers.\n\nThe National Weather Service reports the tornado Friday night packed winds peaking at around 105 mph (169 kph) and traveled 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) through Baltimore.\n\nThe twister also blew over a tractor-trailer on Interstate 95 and smashed through garage doors at a van rental facility.\n\nThe storm pulled off part of the Amazon building's roof, including iron rafters.

Add Health Care Overhaul as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Health Care Overhaul news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nVoters this year have told pollsters in no uncertain terms that health care is important to them. In particular, maintaining insurance protections for preexisting conditions is the top issue to many.\n\nBut the results of the midterm elections are likely to have a major impact on a broad array of other health issues that touch every single American. And how those issues are addressed will depend in large part on which party controls the U.S. House and Senate, governors\u2019 mansions and state legislatures around the country.\n\nAll politics is local, and no single race is likely to determine national or even state action. But some key contests can provide something of a barometer of what\u2019s likely to happen \u2014 or not happen \u2014 over the next two years.\n\nFor example, keep an eye on Kansas. The razor-tight race for governor could determine whether the state expands Medicaid to all people with low incomes, as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. The legislature in that deep red state passed a bill to accept expansion in 2017, but it could not override the veto of then-Gov. Sam Brownback. Of the candidates running for governor in 2018, Democrat Laura Kelly supports expansion, while Republican Kris Kobach does not.\n\nHere are three big health issues that could be dramatically affected by Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\n1. The Affordable Care Act\n\nProtections for preexisting conditions are only a small part of the ACA. The law also made big changes to Medicare and Medicaid, employer-provided health plans and the generic drug approval process, among other things.\n\nRepublicans ran hard on promises to get rid of the law in every election since it passed in 2010. But when the GOP finally got control of the House, the Senate and the White House in 2017, Republicans found they could not reach agreement on how to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the law.\n\nThis year has Democrats on the attack over the votes Republicans took on various proposals to remake the health law. Probably the most endangered Democrat in the Senate, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has hammered her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, over his votes in the House for the unsuccessful repeal-and-replace bills. Cramer said that despite his votes he supports protections for preexisting conditions, but he has not said what he would do or get behind that could have that effect.\n\nPolls suggest Cramer has a healthy lead in that race, but if Heitkamp pulled off a surprise win, health care might well get some of the credit.\n\nAnd in New Jersey, Rep. Tom MacArthur, the moderate Republican who wrote the language that got the GOP health bill passed in the House in 2017, is in a heated race with Democrat Andy Kim, who has never held elective office. The overriding issue in that race, too, is health care.\n\nIt is not just congressional action that has Republicans playing defense on the ACA. In February, 18 GOP attorneys general and two GOP governors filed a lawsuit seeking a judgment that the law is now unconstitutional because Congress in the 2017 tax bill repealed the penalty for not having insurance. Two of those attorneys general \u2014 Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley and West Virginia\u2019s Patrick Morrisey \u2014 are running for the Senate. Both states overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nThe attorneys general are running against Democratic incumbents \u2014 Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. And both Republicans are being hotly criticized by their opponents for their participation in the lawsuit.\n\nAlthough Manchin appears to have taken a lead, the Hawley-McCaskill race is rated a toss-up by political analysts.\n\nBut in the end the fate of the ACA depends less on an individual race than on which party winds up in control of Congress.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats take the House \u2026 then any attempt at repeal-and-replace will be kaput,\u201d said John McDonough, a former Democratic Senate aide who helped write the ACA and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nConservative health care strategist Chris Jacobs, who worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill, said a new repeal-and-replace effort might not happen even if Republicans are successful Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, if they maintain the majority in the House, will have a margin of a half dozen seats \u2014 if they are lucky,\u201d he said. That likely would not allow the party to push through another controversial effort to change the law. Currently there are 42 more Republicans than Democrats in the House. Even so, the GOP barely got its health bill passed out of the House in 2017.\n\nAnd political strategists say that, when the dust clears after voting, the numbers in the Senate may not be much different so change could be hard there too. Republicans, even with a small majority last year, could not pass a repeal bill there.\n\n2. Medicaid expansion\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2012 made optional the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to cover all low-income Americans up to 138 percent of the poverty line ($16,753 for an individual in 2018). Most states have now expanded, particularly since the federal government is paying the vast majority of the cost: 94 percent in 2018, gradually dropping to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nStill, 17 states, all with GOP governors or state legislatures (or both), have yet to expand Medicaid.\n\nMcDonough is confident that\u2019s about to change. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if we\u2019re on the cusp of a Medicaid wave,\u201d he said.\n\nFour states \u2014 Nebraska, Idaho, Utah and Montana \u2014 have Medicaid expansion questions on their ballots. All but Montana have yet to expand the program. Montana\u2019s question would eliminate the 2019 sunset date included in its expansion in 2016. But it will be interesting to watch results because the measure has run into big-pocketed opposition: the tobacco industry. The initiative would increase taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products to fund the state\u2019s increased Medicaid costs.\n\nIn Idaho, the ballot measure is being embraced by a number of Republican leaders. GOP Gov. Butch Otter, who is retiring after three terms, endorsed it Tuesday.\n\nBut the issue is in play in other states, too. Several non-expansion states have close or closer-than-expected races for governor where the Democrat has made Medicaid expansion a priority.\n\nIn Florida, one of the largest states not to have expanded expanded Medicaid, the Republican candidate for governor, former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, opposes expansion. His Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, supports it.\n\nIn Georgia, the gubernatorial candidates, Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, also are on opposite sides of the Medicaid expansion debate.\n\nHowever, the legislatures in both states have opposed the expansion, and it\u2019s not clear if they would be swayed by arguments from a new governor.\n\n3. Medicare\n\nUntil recently, Republicans have remained relatively quiet about efforts to change the popular Medicare program for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nTheir new talking point is that proposals to expand the program \u2014 such as the often touted \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d which an increasing number of Democrats are embracing \u2014 could threaten the existing program.\n\n\u201cMedicare is at significant risk of being cut if Democrats take over the House,\u201d Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) told the Lee Montana Newspapers. \u201cMedicare-for-all is Medicare for none. It will gut Medicare, end the VA as we know it, and force Montana seniors to the back of the line.\u201d\n\nGianforte\u2019s Democratic opponent, Kathleen Williams, is proposing another idea popular with Democrats: allowing people age 55 and over to \u201cbuy into\u201d Medicare coverage. That race, too, is very tight.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Washington, congressional Republicans are more concerned with how Medicare and other large government social programs are threatening the budget.\n\n\u201cSooner or later we are going to run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d said Chris Jacobs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested in an Oct. 16 interview with Bloomberg News that entitlement programs like Medicare are \u201cthe real driver of the debt by any objective standard,\u201d but that bipartisan cooperation will be needed to address that problem\n\nRepublican Jacobs and Democrat McDonough think that\u2019s unlikely any time soon.\n\n\u201cWhy would Democrats give that up as an issue heading into 2020?\u201d asked McDonough, especially because Republicans in recent years have been proposing deep cuts to the Medicare program.\n\nAgreed Jacobs, \u201cTrump may not want that to be the centerpiece of a re-election campaign.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

The Democrats need for Nancy Pelosi to be guaranteed she'll be the speaker first of all this policy is probably one of the best whip commas in the Democratic Caucus so. I wouldn't. Still hot under the bus right now because she knows how to win she's raise Obama 130 million dollars for Democrats across the country. When a reasons why we have a diverse lineup of candidates is because Nancy Pelosi went out there and encouraged those candidates to run so I see Nancy Pelosi I mean she's gonna fight like hell. There is a call for new blood more people in the leadership and just remember towards fifteen to 25% of those newly elected Democrats. They will look for someone who can carried a mammal for them in 20/20 and beyond and Chris for the White House the house and subpoena powers and. Brand new ball game but it is the White House brace for that are they ready for are they prepared well to give the new White House counsel. Who knew should be in place in time. For January and you know if it's his democratic house it's very well could be their main job is to be do it via subpoena processor over the White House and I think. Mary was right there that there is real political risk in that as well we saw that happen with who the Republican House and Bill Clinton. In the ninety's. You know if you go too aggressive in that regard it to be a backlash against those people so. I've that's why figure but what every car my pocket if they when the house if you poses to be speaker. Sharpest elbows best counter she is going to be the speaker every health and pretend. We are all going to be here on teasing I wanna get everybody's taken with a can be watching for Martha let me start with you what's the big to do Washington's. I think I didn't even going beyond Tuesday night I think one of the things you watched Tuesday night is not whether the Democrats gain control of the house but it's also how people campaign. And what this is meant about these incendiary ads. That's a lesson that everybody will learn going forward not just to 20/20 but beyond its isn't this the kind of fear mongering that works.

There's another visit and another race in Georgia though if if Stacey Abrams as well for so we should say that if neither she nor Brian can get 50% there's a runoff that's around me in the seat of Georgia secondly. Does she have the strength to carry loosened that and other key senate race I think so if you look how stressful absolutely look. She has done something that I think Democrats should have done long time ago. That is she's expanded the electorate she has campaigned in rural areas like Doug Wilder who won back in 1989.

People talking to each other across the aisles and if you have extremists the fire in the belly liberals over here and a fire in the valley conservatives over here. If you can't push them this way.

And he he he stands up and says it's great if your body slam reporter he calls. The press the enemy of the people. Well I don't believe the president has ever come out and says he's against the First Amendment or the press. He has attacked what he calls fake news and the fake news media. And in my opinion the fake. News media whatever you want a quote the mainstream media is unquestionably. Hissing when most dangerous weapon. In this country because it's dividing this country. I will say that. I think the way the president speaks about certain. Groups in this country. On op hall and I'm angered and I just feel like. It's gone way beyond what.

I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.\"\n\nAn Allegheny General Network representative confirmed the authenticity of the post.\n\nBowers, 46, pleaded not guilty Thursday to a 44-count grand jury indictment charging him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes, for which he could face the death penalty. Authorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the massacre. He remains jailed without bail.\n\nMahler, whose Facebook page noted that he started his job in the hospital's emergency department March 1, said he didn't see evil in Bowers' eyes but \"a clear lack of depth, intelligence, and palpable amounts of confusion.\" He said he couldn't go into detail about their interaction due to medical privacy requirements, but Bowers thanked him \"for saving him, for showing him kindness, and for treating him the same way I treat every other patient.\"\n\nHe noted that this came from the same person accused of mass murder who \"instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.\"\n\nMahler, who said that his father was a rabbi and that he experienced anti-Semitism \"a lot\" as a kid, said he acted out of love.\n\n\"Love. That's why I did it,\" he said. \"Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we're all here. ... I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish instill in you. If my actions mean anything, love means everything.\"", "The Latest on Week 9 in the NFL (all times EST):\n\n7:49 p.m.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams' undefeated run is over.\n\nDrew Brees threw four touchdown passes and Michael Thomas had 12 receptions for 211 yards and a score in a 45-35 win for the New Orleans Saints over the previously unbeaten Rams.\n\nNew Orleans led 35-14 late in the second quarter.

Rivers started his 200th straight game in the regular season, a milestone reached by just three other NFL quarterbacks: Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have built another double-digit cushion against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nDrew Brees' 72-yard touchdown pass to Michael Thomas converted a third down and helped New Orleans take a 45-35 lead with 3:52 left to play.

Brown landed on his right foot and then got his left foot down as he twisted near the sideline before lunging to get the ball over the goal line.\n\nThe Rams pulled into a 35-all tie early with 9:58 left to play after trailing by 21 points late in the second quarter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:14 p.m.\n\nDrew Brees and the New Orleans Saints have the Los Angeles Rams on the brink of defeat.\n\nThe Saints led the undefeated Rams 35-17 at halftime.\n\nBrees had a lot to do with that.

Brown lined up behind three teammates in the end zone. Two of them slid to the left and two slid to the right, parting the way for Brown to finish off the fun with some dance moves.\n\nIn last week's win at Detroit, the Seahawks acted out a baseball scene in the end zone.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:32 p.m.\n\nDeshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes in the first half at Denver, giving him 36 career touchdown passes and putting him in company with two Hall of Famers.\n\nThe Houston Texans quarterback threw 19 passes in seven games as a rookie in 2017 and is nearing that total in his second season through nine games.\n\nDan Marino and Kurt Warner are the only other players in NFL history to throw at least 35 touchdown passes over the first 16 games of their career.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nPhilip Rivers is starting in his 200th consecutive game, a milestone just three NFL quarterbacks have ever reached.\n\nRivers took the first snap for the Los Angeles Chargers against Seattle to join Brett Favre, Eli Manning and Peyton Manning as the quarterbacks in league history to start at least 200 games. Favre started an NFL-record 297 straight times in the regular season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:40 p.m.\n\nHouston didn't waste time getting Demaryius Thomas the ball in his Texans debut against his old team.\n\nThe standout receiver turned a screen pass into a 31-yard gain on Houston's fourth play of the game and he had an 18-yard reception on the next snap against the Denver Broncos.\n\nHis two catches for 49 yards set up a touchdown pass to Jordan Thomas.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:14 p.m.\n\nJulio Jones' touchdown drought is done.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons wide receiver caught a 35-yard scoring pass from Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter against the Washington Redskins, dragging safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix on the way into the end zone.

He had played in 12 games since his previous score.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:04 p.m.\n\nThe Washington Redskins' banged-up offensive line got a break with the return of Morgan Moses against Atlanta. Or, maybe not. The right tackle returned in the second quarter after limping off the field in the first. Moses was then called for holding, negating a 28-yard gain that would have put Washington in position to attempt a field goal.\n\nWashington lost left guard Shawn Lauvao to an injured left knee on its first drive against the Falcons. The Redskins started the game without Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams after he had surgery on his right thumb. Lauvao was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair.\n\nAtlanta was leading 38-14 late in the game.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3:50 p.m.\n\nPittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger seemed to survive a scare.\n\nRoethlisberger went down after landing hard on the field after a sprint from the pocket, but was able to return after being out briefly. He was tackled from behind by Baltimore's Za'Darius Smith and remained prone for a lengthy stretch of time. It appeared he landed hard on his shoulder, but appeared OK after being helped off the field.\n\nThe play occurred early in the fourth quarter with Pittsburgh leading the Ravens 20-13. Josh Dobbs came in to play quarterback for one play before Big Ben returned.

He hooked up again with Kelce on a 13-yarder early in second half.\n\nBy halftime, he had more yards passing (3,042) and touchdown passes (28) in his first 10 career games than any other player in league history since 1950.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:47 p.m.\n\nDalvin Cook has made an immediate impact for the Minnesota Vikings in his return to action after missing five of the past six games because of a hamstring injury.\n\nThe second-year running back had a career-long, 70-yard run in the second quarter against Detroit. That set up a short touchdown pass from Kirk Cousins to Adam Thielen. Cook has eight carries for 86 yards in the first half against the Lions, who are last in the league in run defense.\n\nDefensive end Ziggy Ansah is back for the Lions after a six-game absence because of a shoulder injury.

It's not unusual for players to share secrets about their former team after being released or waived, but it is difficult to recall anyone talking about it publicly.\n\n\"When I came in I had the playbook and said, 'It will be on my desk and what you do with it is on you,'\" Smith recalled .\n\nSmith said the playbook was missing from his locker for a couple of days before it was returned and he took it home. Smith said he had a copy of the Panthers' playbook because it was given to him by another player who was cut a couple years before he was released by the team. Smith said he thought the playbook might be helpful if he got into coaching after his playing career.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1 p.m.\n\nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is wearing custom cleats emblazoned with a Star of David, adorned with the phrase \"Stronger Than Hate,\" in response to recent shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.

Under the lights in New England, Tom Brady will match up with the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014NFL", "A woman who was caught on camera berating two African-American women in a parking lot lost her job and has turned herself in to police in Sunset Beach, North Carolina, according to authorities.\n\nSusan Jane Westwood, 51, turned herself in on Saturday. She was served with an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for the misuse of the 911 system and four criminal summons for simple assault and communicating threats, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. She was transferred to the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department and her bond was set at $500.\n\nWestwood was caught on video on Oct. 19 berating sisters Leisa Meria Garris, 52, and Mary Michelle Garris, 49, while they were waiting for AAA to arrive in the parking lot for the Camden Fairview Apartments in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m white and I\u2019m hot. So what are you doing here?\u201d Westwood said to the sisters. \u201cI\u2019m still going to make $125,000 Monday morning. Who are you, do you live here?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I need to bring out my concealed weapon too?\u201d asked Westwood at one point during the encounter.\n\nWestwood called 911 and falsely claimed that the women were trying to break into residences, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.\n\n\"Folks that are trying to break into apartments, they\u2019re actually people that I\u2019ve never see here before but they are African-American,\" Westwood said on the 911 call. \"They\u2019re trying to cause a problem.\"\n\nAlong with recording Westwood's behavior, the Garris sisters also called 911 to report the harassment. Police arrived at the scene, but were unable to locate Westwood, and issued a warrant for her arrest on Oct. 30.\n\n\u201cShe assaulted us both. So there should be charges,\u201d said Mary Garris when she spoke with ABC News on Saturday. \u201cWe want to bring justice. We want to bring awareness to the community. People are being judged for the color of their skin.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s been an eye-opener,\u201d continued Garris. \"This happened only because we were standing out and waiting for AAA. This is alarming and upsetting.\"\n\nPrior to her termination, Susan Westwood was employed at Charter Communications.\n\n\u201cThe incident recorded in Charlotte is a blatant violation of Charter\u2019s code of conduct and clearly disregards the company\u2019s commitment to inclusion and respectful behavior,\" said Scott Pryzwanky, a spokesperson for the company, in a statement. \"As such, Ms. Westwood\u2019s employment with the company has been terminated, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Westwood had retained or was assigned an attorney.\n\nThis is the latest in a series of high-profile incidents in which a white person has called the police to report black people taking part in everyday activities.\n\nLast month, a white woman in Brooklyn called the police after accusing a 9-year-old African-American boy of groping her. Security footage proved this was false.\n\nAnother white woman in St. Louis was fired from her job after a video went viral in which she blocked a black man from entering his own apartment building.", "Transcript for Sen. Van Hollen: Dems have 'narrow path to a majority' despite difficult Senate map\n\nNow we're gonna bring in the chair the democratic senate campaign committee senator Chris van Holland Merrell center that Hong thanks for joining us this morning is turn to predictions there Toronto McDaniel it is true. The year democratic senators are up against the wall on TJ you. Are you confident. That you can take the senate. What George inside great to be with few here's where we are we have lots of races within the margin of error son back in and make any. Predictions what I can say is that as you discussed earlier on this program. Senate Democrats really face the toughest political map in sixty years so it's remarkable that weren't as strong a position as we are. And that is a testament to our senators and to our senate democratic candidates. Who were running as candidates or we're gonna stand up for there are states that their job. Is to put politics aside stand up for their states sometimes that means working with president trump if it's good for their state. As sometimes it means opposing the president that's bad for their state like the president's effort Republican effort to take away protections for people with. Preexisting health conditions a big issue in. All these races in bid that is a big issue in all these cases you have seen as you said your democratic senator Brian Donnelly and in Indiana is advertising about how much he supporting president trump I I can't. In North Dakota has done the same thing. But seems to be especially high camp in North Dakota punished for the Kavanagh nomination how Democrats handle the kind Kavanagh nomination any regrets. Well first of all never I count Heidi hi camp out in her last election six years ago she was ten points down with a week to go. It's much closer than that in North Dakota don't count her out. The reality is that Heidi hide camp and did as she always does what she thought was the best thing. For the country sometimes that means supporting the president on issues as she did with the earlier justice side gore such and sometimes that means opposing. The president on these issues health. Well Bob Menendez in new juries listen it's a race we haven't talked too much about of course he was indicted later acquitted. And on corruption issues but he has he does seem to be in a tighter race in New Jersey and you would expect. Are you confident he's gonna pull it out are you concerned that he may be holding back. Democratic house candidates. I'm actually confident that among Bob Menendez is will win that race the people of New Jersey have been very clear. They do not want a rubber stamp for Donald trawl and that is what. Bob Menendez is opponent is that has done. And will do and his opponent has spent thirty million dollars of of money that he gained as the CEO or form from pharmaceutical company. Where he really gal edged prices for cancer patients so. That's why you have a competitive race in New Jersey obviously there are other issues Bob Menendez has to litigate but. People of New Jersey do not want to Donald Trump rubber stamp. Democrats hoping they can pick up seats in Nevada and Arizona one of the big X factors there is will look Tina's turn out to vote. Will that. Yes they well and wordy see in their early voting results in those states and you are seeing a good health the up turnout among. Latino voters as well as younger voters in your seeing a pattern. Of good turnout for Democrats and independence. Who were supporting democratic candidates. Around the country George and again. That issue that has been front and center for the last two years the Republican efforts to. Take away important health care protections. That is one that senate Republican candidates. Have been running away from their records on and we're making sure. That people know exactly what they they did which was a vote either in the congress the senate. Or through lawsuits to take away those protections for people with preexisting conditions and I'll also say that the Republican senate leader's comments the other day. About the Republican plan to cut Medicare and Social Security. It gives away there they're playbook that the debt went way up to two trillion dollars as a result of the tax cut for big corporations now they wanna come back. And take it out on people who have Medicare and Social Security you prepare for world Wednesday were Republicans pick up seats in the senate. And George were were prepared for whatever result we have but let me just say that the fact that we still have a narrow path. Two majority is a sea change from a where we were eighteen months ago and as I said it's 'cause our candidates have always said. They'll stand up for their states first and foremost put aside the politics do what's right. And were seen the results here these are some very close races and of course there in states that Donald Trump one. Big and it's a testament to these candidates that they're so focused on what matters to people in her state when it comes to health care. That is not a top down issue it's not like you know president trump going out there and talking about immigration. Try to divide people and by the way. We've just seen a litany of documented false statements and lies from the president. On that issue. But on the health care issue this is a bottom up issue when Republicans. I tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act you've found people in rural areas and rural hospitals say no you found. The American Cancer Society the American Diabetes Association all these local chapters who had nothing to do with politics said. Don't take away our protections for health care and yet Republicans continue to try to do that senator Kristen Holland and much thank you.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for RNC chair: 'Obviously we have headwinds' but GOP can keep House, Senate majorities\n\nJoined now by the chair of the Republican National Committee Rodham again erotic thank you for joining us this morning unusually subdued president there almost resigned it seems. Two losing their house or you. Absolutely not. I especially with the economic numbers that we stop. On Friday it went. That 250000 jobs added to the economy with wages over 3% for the first time in a decade I mean the American voters are looking. At what happened over the past two years they're making more money more jobs are coming back that is a great closing argument in a lot of these house races that are within the margin of error. And they're gonna say Republicans that have offered a record of results and Democrats are offering resistance and going back east they disagree Claire you say it's a great closing argument knock on the president's not making. He has he's talking about many different things that he's accomplished as president because the list is cell line. I think he's highlighting the fact that we need immigration. Reform Democrats are coming to the table on that ought to strengthening our military taking care for our back trends take an OPEC crisis. And the national security issues that he's. Take a nine North Korea I ran Syria out all the things that. He's accomplished in these first years but the economy is a driving force with the tax cuts and the deregulation and people's lives are battered they're taking home more money to spend on their families and that is a very compelling argument for many of these voters across the country. Who are looking at who they want to keep in the majority and Republicans the party that's deliver. So Lisa you wondering you want voters focused on the economy on Tuesday the president every single day over the last week is talked about immigration talking about sending troops talking but the migrant care event talking about birthright. Citizenship even tweeting out that at we're not gonna play the whole lever to show. That ad the president put out about illegal immigration showing that illegal. Immigrant who commit a murder bringing that. On Democrats that's caused even some Republicans. C react John Kasich Republican governor. Of Ohio they're tweeted out the politics of fear hatred and division should have no place in our country or the Republican Party let alone the presidency. All Americans should reject this ad and its motives do you. I think the president's highlighting I have failure in our immigration system that this disgusting person got into our country twice under Democrat and a Republican president. He labeled only Democrats we don't want that in our immigration system obviously we recognize that we have a broken immigration. The policy right now in this country with these caravans coming towards our country with 121000 kids that have come unaccompanied that are coming on their own because their parents so desperately want to get into this country I know why they want to get here. Our economy's doing great we have a lot of jobs. And the president has said let's get merit based immigration let's focus on eliminating the visa lottery system something that Canada's it doesn't do. And let's strengthen our border and Democrats again walk under the table on an important issue like immigration they didn't come to the table on the east tax cuts. Stating come to Vickie table at this president on anything because they've refused to work with him. And he's closing with the argument of we are the party of results and they're the party of resistance. There's division in the Republican party of course an immigration as well but you're not concerned about that the possibility as we were talking matches earlier in the program. That the president's focus on immigration the ads like that are gonna cause a backlash in suburban districts you need to hold. In order to hold the house. I'm with the president at these rallies the president's talking about all of the accomplishments I think the media is focusing on immigration constantly and I get that. But he's focusing on the economy he's talking about the jobs he's talking about the lowest unemployment in history for the African American and Hispanic communities. And that our country is on a great comeback and the fact that Nancy Pelosi has said she's gonna raise taxes. And the president recognizes the historical trends. With the house and the senate usually the party that holds the White House loses three seats in the senate and thirty seats in the house and he's doing everything he candid turn out every about. With his exhaustive schedule. But is a whole variety of issues that he's talking about an accomplishment that he's made. As president that have made our country stronger more prosperous safe are. I'm and has given the American people more jobs more money. And a comeback that frankly a lot of Democrats didn't think was possible they certainly didn't help what. They've charity or do you blame you blame the media but it's the president himself from city wants election to be about the caravan. The press has not said he wanted to be just about the caravan the president saying let's look at the record are you better off than you were two years the Al he's talking about the economy. It's just not getting that same coverage mean the economy should be for first and foremost and a lot of people's minds as they're going to the polls because remember. President Obama said will never get about 2% GDP. And now where at 3.5. Percent GDP over 4% in some cases we've seen at four million people call off of food stamps we've seen four million new jobs come to this country. There's a lot of good things to talk about the president's talking about a stunt man a lot of other things. You know he can walk and chew gum at the same time we're to the house and senate stand Wednesday morning. It's tight. George it's tight it's gonna depend on voter turnout on Election Day and Democrat enthusiasm is definitely there we are seeing that an early voting. It and qualities that key house and senate races and Republicans have been matching so. Literally Election Day voting it's gonna determine the balance of the house it's a there's about 27 seats within the margin of air obviously.

That was well beyond expectations, which had pegged the film closer to $35-40 million in its opening weekend.\n\nBut audiences rushed to theaters to see the widely praised performance by Malek, the \"Mr. Robot\" star, and to hear Queen's foot-stomping anthems like \"We are the Champions,\" ''Another One Bites the Dust\" and the operatic title song. The movie, which Bryan Singer directed before being replaced by Dexter Fletcher, at times has an almost concert-like feel, including a lengthy re-creation of the band's 1985 Live Aid performance.\n\n\"It really is a celebration of Queen and their music, and I think we did a really good job of letting people know that that's what this is,\" said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Fox.\n\nIn soaring to No. 1, the Fox release trounced one from Disney, which will soon own the studio. Despite a production budget of $125 million, the Walt Disney Co.'s lavish, big-budget \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" opened with just $20 million. Disney is set to merge with Fox in the coming months, effectively ending the 103-year-old Fox, one of Hollywood's six major studios.\n\n\"We were hoping for a stronger start, but we do think it's a film that people will find as we head into the holidays,\" said Cathleen Taff, head of theatrical distribution for Disney.\n\nThough Disney's record of success is the envy of Hollywood, \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" marks the studio's third misfire this year following the underperforming \"A Wrinkle in Time\" and \"Solo.\" The studio's CGI-stuffed resurrection of E.T.A. Hoffmann story was positioned as an early holiday season release, but flopped with critics (34 percent \"fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes) and sparked only modest interest from audiences. It grossed $38.5 million overseas.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" made for $52 million, was largely dismissed by critics as an overly conventional rock biopic (60 percent \"fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes). But the film proved more popular with moviegoers, who gave the PG-13 release, produced by Graham King, an A CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars out of five on Comscore's PostTrak audience survey.\n\n\"Even in the negativity that came out of critics, there was always a 'but,' almost universally: 'But Rami is great,'\" noted Aronson. \"I'm very happy for Graham and Rami and the entire filmmaking team. And I'm happy for the home team. This is a big win for Fox.\"\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, praised Fox's rollout of the film as \"pitch perfect.\" Dergarabedian also cited Malek's breakout big-screen performance and the sustained interest in all things musical at the box office. Musically based films have lately been major draws in theaters, from Fox's own \"The Greatest Showman\" earlier in the year to Warner Bros.' Oscar favorite \"A Star Is Born,\" which collected another $11.1 million in its fifth weekend for $165.6 million overall.\n\n\"It seems that audiences can't get enough of movies that have music baked into their DNA,\" Dergarabedian said. \"That's proving to be a very successful formula.\"\n\nAnother winning formula \u2014 Tiffany Haddish plus anything \u2014 came up short over the weekend.\n\n\"Nobody's Fool,\" which paired Haddish with another box-office force in writer-director-producer Tyler Perry, opened in third with a so-so $14 million. While far from disastrous for a movie that cost $19 million to make, the muted performance of \"Nobody's Fool\" seemed likely a result of oversaturation. Two films starring Haddish \u2014 \"Night School\" and \"The Oath\" \u2014 have opened in the past six weeks, and \"Night School\" is still No. 12 at the box office.\n\nIn limited release, Joel Edgerton's acclaimed gay conversion therapy drama \"Boy Erased,\" starring Lucas Hedges, opened with a strong per-theater average of $44,000 in five theaters.\n\nMatthew Heineman's \"A Private War,\" starring Rosamund Pike as war correspondent Marie Colvin, opened in four theaters with a per-theater average of $18,000.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

More than 60 heads of state and government, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, are expected to attend an international ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on the Nov. 11 anniversary.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron started a six-day tour of World War I battlegrounds Sunday night in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. Accompanying him were his wife, Brigitte, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to attend a ceremony in memory of the soldiers who died early in the war, during the Battle of Morang in 1914.\n\nIn Trieste, Italy's president singled out the memory of a \"simple soldier,\" Vittorio Calderoni, who died from his wounds at age 17 just after World War I ended. Calderoni was the son of Italians who had immigrated to Argentina, but he sailed to Europe to enlist in the army and fight for Italy.\n\nMattarella said he chose to pay tribute to him \"because Vittorio Calderoni was Jewish, the youngest of some 400 Italians of Jewish origin who died in the Great War.\" The president said he considered it his duty to note that in the same square where he spoke, late Italian dictator Benito Mussolini delivered a 1938 speech that ushered in \"the dark and tragic\" period of the Fascist regime's anti-Jewish laws.\n\nMattarella encouraged young people to keep an \"active\" memory for the victims of wars as a way to consolidate freedom and harmony as \"irreversible\" choices for Europeans.\n\nIn contrast, Mattarella said, the war demonstrated the \"incapacity of the European ruling class\" to pursue \"national aspirations and interests in a peaceful\" way and to thus surrender to \"aggressive nationalism\" and the desire for power.\n\nRome is a founder of the European Union, the unity of which is being tested by rising nationalist sentiments in several member countries, including Italy, where a populist government took over in June.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThomas Adamson in Paris and Luigi Navarra in Redipuglia, Italy, contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrances D'Emilio is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/fdemilio", "Iraqi officials and fishermen are at a loss to explain how hundreds of tons of carp have suddenly died in fish farms in the Euphrates River, fueling anxieties about soaring water pollution.\n\nLocal authorities used excavators to skim dead fish from the river surface near the town of Hindiyah, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Baghdad, where residents and local farmers have long complained about substandard water management.\n\nThe fish were being farmed in cages for sale in domestic markets, where grilled carp is considered a national dish, called masgouf.\n\nAyad Talibi, head of Iraq's Fish Producers' Syndicate, called it \"annihilation\" and a blow to the country's \"strategic fish reserve.\"\n\nWater pollution and scarcity have been on the forefront of Iraqi discourse after matters reached crisis levels last summer.\n\nHealth officials said some 100,000 people were taken to hospital for stomach illnesses in the southern Basra province, where sludge and yellow water was recorded flowing out of the taps. Demonstrators rioted, demanding better services.\n\nIraqi officials could not say for certain what caused the fish die out. Wissam Muslani, deputy governor for Babil province, which includes Hindiyah, said initial tests suggested it was the result of a virus that infected the gills.\n\nBut scientists speculated in media that the annihilation may have caused by low oxygen levels, agricultural runoff or wastewater pollution.\n\nAli Akbar, a medical officer for the World Health Organization, called it a \"man-made disaster,\" and advised Iraqis to stop eating fish.\n\n\"My first message is that make sure nobody eats any fish. And my second message is make sure that no fisherman does fishing these days until all this is cleaned,\" he said.\n\nPhotos and video of the carp-clogged Euphrates have had an immediate impact on fish sales, according to fishmongers from Hindiyah to Baghdad.\n\nAli Ibrahim, a vendor by the side of the highway outside Hindiyah, said he was closing his stall and returning to his family.\n\n\"People are no longer eating fish,\" said Ibrahim. \"It's all over.\"", "President Donald Trump's recent assertion that U.S. troops should respond to rock-throwing migrants \u2014 a hypothetical scenario \u2014 as if they were armed has sparked a debate about the appropriate use of force.\n\nNigerian troops swiftly used Trump's comments about the migrants as justification for a deadly crackdown on demonstrators over the weekend.\n\nFrom the Gaza Strip to Africa and Europe, security forces have faced stone throwers in very different ways, from firing live rounds to limiting themselves to non-lethal means.\n\nA 1990 U.N. document calls on law enforcement officials to show maximum restraint and to use firearms only in cases in which an \"imminent threat of death or serious injury\" is identified.\n\nThese standards have been interpreted differently around the world.\n\nLast week, Trump called attention to a migrant caravan of several thousand Central Americans making their way toward the U.S. border. It is a largely peaceful procession, though some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexico police, hurling stones.\n\nAlthough the caravan is still some 1,200 kilometers (800 miles) from the border, Trump has mobilized troops and declared that if U.S. soldiers face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \"rifles.\"\n\nTrump later said he was merely calling for the arrests of stone throwers.\n\nBut following Trump's comments, Nigeria's military sent out a tweet that appeared to use his words as justification for shooting and killing Shiite protesters. It later removed the tweet.\n\nOmar Shakir, the Israel-Palestine director of the international group Human Rights Watch, said he fears Trump's comments could encourage other forces to loosen their rules of engagement.\n\n\"Trump's brazen, inflammatory statements, days before U.S. midterm elections, have already been seized on by rights abusers to justify more expansive open fire standards,\" he said.\n\nHere is a look at how countries around the world respond to stone throwers.\n\nISRAEL/PALESTINIANS:\n\nIsraeli forces have been confronting Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for decades. Israeli tactics have evolved over the years, particularly with the increased use of what are presented as non-lethal crowd-dispersal tools such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nIsraeli officials say that live fire is used only as a last resort, when soldiers' lives are threatened. But critics accuse Israel of unnecessarily, and perhaps illegally, using deadly force.\n\nIn recent months, for instance, over 160 Palestinians have been killed during mass protests along Gaza's border with Israel. Many have been unarmed.\n\nIsrael says threats go beyond stone throwing, and that protesters throw grenades and firebombs, or try to break through the border to attack Israeli civilians.\n\nDavid Tzur, a former commander of Israel's paramilitary Border Police, said non-lethal force is sufficient in most cases, but that troops could be justified using live fire in more chaotic situations, if a moving vehicle is pelted with stones in a tense locale, for instance.\n\nGREECE:\n\nIn Greece, firebombs and stone-throwing are routine occurrences at anarchist demonstrations held on most weekends. Police typically respond with tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowds.\n\nIn 2008, a policeman fired his gun at a group of youths in central Athens, killing a 15-year-old protester. The death sparked two weeks of riots in major cities across Greece, and the policeman was jailed for murder.\n\nMIGRANTS IN EUROPE:\n\nMigrants making their way to Europe have clashed with security forces in various countries.\n\nIn Spain, migrants from Africa have on several occasions stormed across the border, assaulting police officers with acid, skin irritants and other objects.\n\nBut police are not permitted to use live ammunition and have not even used rubber bullets against migrants since a much-criticized crackdown in 2014. Spanish police did use rubber bullets last year in clashes with Catalan separatists.\n\nHungary, which takes one of the hardest lines against migrants, used only tear gas and water cannons in a major clash with migrants three years ago. One Syrian migrant, however, was sentenced to five years in prison on terrorism charges for entering the country illegally and throwing stones at police.\n\nKASHMIR:\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, a disputed territory divided between India and Pakistan, protesters have long viewed stone throwing as legitimate protest against Indian rule.\n\nIndia has often responded with tough measures, including live fire and metal pellets that have killed, maimed or blinded hundreds of people over the last decade. India says its troops are in life-threatening situations that justify the heavy use of force.\n\nProtesters caught throwing stones at soldiers and police \u2014 often identified through video recordings of demonstrations \u2014 are usually accused of attempting to murder government officials, a charge that carries long imprisonment. Many stone throwers have been shot dead by soldiers.\n\nRebels have been fighting Indian control since 1989. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Aijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India; Elena Becatoros in Athens; Thomas Adamson in Paris; Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary; Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain, and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "A man trying to stop a shooting attack on a Florida yoga studio said Sunday that he wrestled with the attacker after his gun jammed, a move credited with giving others time to flee the rampage that killed two people and wounded six others.\n\nYoga student Joshua Quick spoke to ABC's Good Morning America on Sunday and said he grabbed Scott Paul Beierle's gun after it jammed, and hit him.\n\nTallahassee Police have identified Beierle as the man who posed as a customer to get into the studio Hot Yoga Tallahassee during a Friday night class and started shooting. Police said Beierle, 40, then turned the gun on himself but authorities have offered no motive in the attack.\n\nQuick said Beierle was able to grab the gun back and then pistol-whipped him.\n\n\"I jumped up as quickly as I could,\" said Quick, who had visible facial injuries. \"I ran back over and the next thing I know I'm grabbing a broom, the only thing I can, and I hit him again.\"\n\nIt gave some in the studio time to flee.\n\n\"Thanks to him I was able to rush out the door,\" Daniela Garcia Albalat told Good Morning America.

The videos were posted four years ago, and were removed from YouTube after the shooting.\n\nNumerous disturbing details about him have emerged. He'd once been banned from FSU's campus and had been arrested twice for grabbing women even though charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos on YouTube in 2014 where he called women \"whores\" if they dated black men, said many black women were \"disgusting\" and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman would not confirm or deny the videos were Beierle's. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like Beierle and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle, including details of his military service. The poster's YouTube username included the word \"Scott,\" Beierle's first name. The existence of the videos was first reported by BuzzFeed.\n\nA woman who filed a police report against Beierle told The AP she's never forgotten how \"creepy\" he was.\n\nCourtnee Connon was 18 in 2012 when, she said, Scott Paul Beierle grabbed her buttocks at a Florida State dining hall. She declined to press charges, however.\n\nShe learned of Beierle's involvement Friday when a local reporter found her name in a police report and called her.\n\n\"I was totally just shocked,\" she said. \"Since then, I've been feeling a little guilt. If I'd pressed charges, would that have stopped him from doing this? How was he not monitored somehow?\"\n\nFour years after that, Beierle was arrested for misdemeanor battery after a young woman said he approached her at the swimming pool of a Tallahassee apartment complex, complemented her rear end and offered to rub sunscreen on it, records show. The woman said she declined the offer and, according to an affidavit, Beierle then slapped her on the buttocks and grabbed her.\n\nThe top prosecutor for the office that handled Beierle's 2016 charge, William N. \"Willie\" Meggs, has no personal recollection of that case. However, since the 2012 battery charges were dropped, Meggs said, it would have been routine for Beierle to receive a deferred prosecution deal.\n\n\"It would not have been atypical as a first-time offender for him to get diversion,\" said Meggs, since retired as state attorney for Florida's Second Judicial Circuit. \"We should have called the victim to make sure she was OK with him getting diversion.\"\n\nIt's not clear from the court file whether that occurred, and the woman didn't respond to emails seeking comment. The AP doesn't publicly identify sexual assault victims unless they choose to speak.\n\nCourt records indicate prosecutors agreed to dismiss the battery charge after Beierle completed a six-month diversion agreement requiring him to stay out of trouble, not drink alcohol to excess and to follow a psychologist's recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, yoga teachers in the Florida capital and the country at large were horrified such a violent act could unfold in a place intended for tranquility and nonviolence.\n\nSome teachers wondered what they would tell their students.\n\n\"As an instructor when you start every class, you ask students to close their eyes to relax, because you're in such a safe space,\" said Amanda Morrison, a Tallahassee instructor.\n\nThe safety of her students is on her mind as she prepares to teach a class Monday.\n\n\"I'm already thinking about locking the doors once class starts,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.", "Sri Lanka's president issued an order Sunday for Parliament to reconvene on Nov. 14, when lawmakers will get the chance to hold a confidence vote on the nation's former strongman who has been named prime minister.\n\nThe announcement made in a decree comes amid a political crisis in the South Asian island nation sparked when President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa last month.\n\nSirisena suspended Parliament in an apparent attempt to give Rajapaksa time to muster support to survive any no-confidence vote.\n\nPolitical opponents, rights groups and foreign governments including the United States and European Union have urged Sirisena to summon Parliament immediately and end the crisis.

A seasoned financial planner, she is senior vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., the company her father founded in 1971. Schwab-Pomerantz has advised two White House administrations and is the author of multiple personal finance books.\n\nSchwab-Pomerantz recently spoke to The Associated Press about financial literacy, gender parity and the importance of having a financial plan. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: Financial literacy has been a part of your entire life. What made you so passionate about it?\n\nA: I've been working for Schwab since I was 16. The company was basically a startup at that time. (My father) built the company on democratizing investing and creating more accessibility for everyday Americans. They say apples don't fall far from the tree, so I guess that my whole career has been about democratizing investing and making it more accessible for those not well-served by our industry.\n\nGrowing up, my father \u2014 before Schwab \u2014 was a struggling businessman. He had several ventures that didn't pan out. And when I was young my parents divorced. My mom was Stanford Phi Beta Kappa \u2014 my parents met at Stanford \u2014 but she was definitely a woman of the time. And with my dad struggling and the divorce I think it had an impression on me about women's financial empowerment. Women really (need) to be engaged in their finances and independent.\n\nI've been fortunate to learn about investing and saving at an early age and see the benefit of that.\n\nQ: You mentioned underserved populations, are there groups that should be taking better steps with their money, or who lack information?\n\nA: I have been working on this for 30-plus years and along with my colleagues have created financial literacy programs for women, for inner city kids, for working poor over 50 \u2014 everyday Americans. And I'm talking to our clients from rich to poor.\n\nWhat I have concluded is that the lack of financial literacy cuts across Americans from all walks of life. It is blind to economic status, gender and age.\n\nOur latest research found there was some positive news: women's attitudes and aspirations are in the right place. Unfortunately, cultural habits and society still get in the way of women having economic parity and that is discouraging.\n\nQ: How can that change?\n\nA: I think it is one thing where we all need to come together. (Financial education) can be embedded in school curriculums. And in the public sector, the government has a bully pulpit. And nonprofits \u2014 we have a partnership with the Boys and Girls Club. I think together we can all start to make the change.\n\nThe bottom line is a lot of these issues start at home\u2014 how we talk about money. The gender gap starts at early ages so we've got to be talking to daughters the same way as sons. Also, it's about creating a culture that it is our personal responsibility to be engaged in our finances.\n\nQ: What is the biggest hurdle for folks wanting to take control of their money?\n\nA: It's about making a plan for getting there. That intentional act of focusing on your finances can make such a difference.\n\nIt's also about being scrappy \u2014 you've got to know what you are spending your money on, where you are spending your money and where can you cut. You just have to be a little more disciplined sometimes. If you have aspirational goals you are more likely to be motivated.\n\nI think people think it is scarier than it really is.\n\nQ: I understand even you get professional financial advice?\n\nA: I recently revealed this. I always did it on my own and it wasn't until my 40s that I got outside help.\n\nI was flying all over the country. I had three kids, a husband and a big commute. I couldn't do it all on my own. I went into a Schwab program and we met on a quarterly basis and I did the work. Using an adviser felt kind of like a personal trainer. It creates more accountability. I meet with them on a regular basis and I learn from that person and I get better results.\n\nQ: What do you suggest for starting education with children?\n\nA: I did start early and I had a little system. When my kids were young \u2014 5 years old or so \u2014 I gave them an allowance, not very much. And that was the beginning of them experiencing money and putting value on it.\n\nI remember my middle child pleading to get Pokemon cards and I was tempted to buy them and move on. But I said 'You have an allowance, why don't you get them for yourself.' He thought about it and thought about it and said 'I think I'll pass.' He decided his money was more valuable than mine. Learning the value of money early and making choices is important.\n\nWhen it came to investing, I made them come to the Schwab office and fill out paperwork. I could have done it for them but I wanted them to experience working with a financial institution. It can be intimidating for a lot of people. And when the kids got jobs I opened up a custodian Roth IRA where they started saving.\n\nQ: Anything else we should know?\n\nA: Learning about finances isn't a one-point-in-time thing, it's a lifelong pursuit. Life changes and therefore your goals change.", "In \"Pass It On,\" AP beat reporters ask executives to share experiences and insights that will resonate with anyone managing a business.\n\nCarrie Schwab-Pomerantz is Senior Vice President of Charles Schwab & Co. and daughter of its founder. The bank and brokerage firm is one of the largest in the U.S. Schwab-Pomerantz is a seasoned financial planner and financial literacy leader, having advised two presidential administrations on financial capability and written several books on personal finance. She also oversees Schwab's corporate philanthropy and employee volunteer programs.\n\nQ. What advice would you give your younger self about managing people or running a business? What did you learn from your early mistakes?\n\nA. Never underestimate the power of a strong network. Early on in my career, I was timid about networking. But as I slowly built my confidence, I started to develop a strong group of peers to lean on and get advice from. Also, don't be afraid to seek out a mentor. Not only will you grow, but people are flattered to be asked about their experiences, so it's a win-win situation overall.\n\nQ. What have you learned about problem-solving over the years? What are the keys to tackling your most difficult challenges?\n\nA. Never make a decision in a vacuum, and leverage your strong network of partners and colleagues. When I'm facing a challenge, I seek out people who might have a unique insight or different point of view from mine. If you start by listening, the path forward usually becomes pretty clear.\n\nQ. How much do you pay attention to your competition, and what do you try to learn from them?\n\nA. If you follow the competition too closely, you can get bogged down in the weeds. I try to stay focused on my mission, along with the right intentions, and don't pay too much attention to outside news. For me, that's a winning formula.\n\nQ. What key things can a manager do in terms of workplace culture that separate a mediocre business from a high-performing one?\n\nA. Something I'm proud of at Schwab is our workplace culture, which is centered around service \u2014 serving our clients and serving our communities. It's a purpose we all believe in and can be a part of, and that sense of purpose really does drive performance. I'm also a big believer in being inclusive. I want everyone \u2014 regardless of their background, role or level of seniority \u2014 to have a voice and feel heard. I hold a weekly informal staff meeting where everyone shares challenges or issues they're dealing with, and we all chime in with ideas and solutions. It's really empowering to know your opinion matters, and it makes people feel valued.\n\nQ. What advice do you have for small business owners right now?\n\nA. Entrepreneurs have to be so focused on building their businesses that they often forget about their personal finances. So try to strike a balance between making your business and personal financial planning equally important. I say it a lot, but it's important to remember you don't get a second chance at saving for retirement.\n\nQ. How do you manage work-life balance?\n\nA. I haven't yet figured out how to add more hours to the day, but I do believe that focusing on what's important to you, rather than just looking for an escape, can add dimension to your work that renews you. That's why I focus less on work-life balance and more on work-life blend.", "The Democrat leading his party's campaign efforts for the Senate said the fact that there are some \"very close races\" in states where President Donald Trump won overwhelmingly is a significant change.\n\n\"Let me just say that the fact that we still have a narrow path to a majority [in the Senate] is a sea change from where we were 18 months ago,\" U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" Sunday.\n\n\"These are some very close races and of course, they're in states Donald Trump won big, and it's a testament to these [Democratic] candidates that they're so focused on what matters to people in their state,\" the senator from Maryland said.\n\nThe Senate election map in 2018 favors Republicans because, of the 35 seats to be decided Tuesday, 26 are held by Democrats and nine by Republicans, meaning Democrats have to defend far more seats than the GOP. In addition, all but one of the seats Republicans are defending are in states won by Trump in 2016.\n\nVan Hollen acknowledged that Senate Democrats face \"the toughest political map in 60 years,\" but called it \"remarkable\" that the Democrats are \"in as strong a position\" as they are.\n\nAn example of Democrats' challenge in the Senate elections is in North Dakota, where Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is in a tight race for re-election against GOP challenger Rep. Kevin Cramer. FiveThirtyEight gives Heitcamp a one in four chance of winning.\n\nBut Van Hollen said Heitkamp shouldn't be counted out.\n\n\"In her last election six years ago, she was 10 points down with a week to go,\" Van Hollen said. \"It's much closer than that in North Dakota. Don't count her out.\"\n\nDemocrats are also in a competitive race in New Jersey, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is running against challenger Republican Bob Hugin. Menendez faces potential doubts from some voters after a federal corruption case against him last year ended in mistrial. ABC News rates the seat as likely to stay Democratic.\n\nVan Hollen said he's \"absolutely confident\" that Menendez will win reelection in New Jersey.\n\n\"The people of New Jersey have been very clear,\" he said. \"They do not want a rubber stamp for Donald Trump, and that is what Bob Menendez's opponent has done and will do.\"\n\nVan Hollen said his party is seeing positive signs with high turnout in early voting so far, and he's confident that issues such as health care will drive Democrats to the polls on Tuesday.\n\nFiveThirtyEight forecasts that Democrats have a 1 in 7 chance of winning the Senate, roughly the same odds that the Republicans have of maintaining the House, according to FiveThirtyEight's prediction.", "The Republican National Committee chairwoman said the midterm election contest that will determine control of the House and Senate is \"tight,\" and the result will depend on who turns out to vote Tuesday.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Welcome to a special edition of This Week.\n\nThe race to finish. 48 hours to go.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This is one of the most important elections of our entire lives.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The closing arguments.\n\nMARTHA MCSALLY, ARIZONA SENATE CANDIDATE: We have to crack down on sanctuary cities.\n\nBETO O\u2019ROURKE, TEXAS SENATE CANDIDATE: Stop the walls of separation.\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS, GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: Georgia can do more, can be more.\n\nJOSH HAWLEY, MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE: Everything that you voted for is on the line.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Political star power.\n\nBARACK OBAMA, 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can vote for a politics that's decent, for a politics that's honest, for a politics that is lawful.\n\nTRUMP: The choice in this election could not be more simple.\n\nOPRAH WINFREY, MEDIA MOGUL: You all are on the very precipice of an historical election.\n\nBOB KNIGHT, FORMER INDIANA UNIVERSITY HOOSIERS BASKETBALL COACH: Go get him, Donald.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And white-hot rhetoric.\n\nTRUMP: If you don't want America to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans, you better vote Republican.\n\nJOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let's make it clear, we Democrats, we choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Republicans banking on the economy and the Kavanaugh effect, Democrats campaigning to check Trump and preserve health care.\n\nAmericans already voting in record numbers, control of Congress, the Trump presidency, our country's future all at stake.\n\nThis morning, we cover it all, our election team standing by with the races to watch. Plus our brand-new poll and the latest election forecast from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nANNOUNCER: From ABC News election headquarters it's This Week. Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Hello, again. You can see that we are broadcasting this morning from our election headquarters here in New York. This is where we're going to be tracking and analyzing results as they come in on Tuesday night. The team already here, ready to go for what is shaping up to be the most consequential midterm election in years.\n\nIt feels like a presidential election. Americans are engaged. Passions high. Early voting through the roof and President Trump is campaigning as if he were on the ballot.\n\nIn one way he is. If Democrats win the House or the Senate Tuesday night, Trump will wake up to a very different presidency Wednesday morning.\n\nOur brand-new ABC News/Washington Post poll shows the president coming into these midterms with the lowest approval of any president since Harry Truman. He's at 40 percent, with 53 percent disapproving of Trump's performance.\n\nThe president's average approval since inauguration is the lowest on record. And 59 percent of likely voters say it's important to them to vote for a candidate who shares their opinion of Trump. That is fueling a Democratic advantage with 48 hours to go. Democratic House candidates lead Republicans by 8 points among likely voters, 52 to 44. But that is down from 13 points last month.\n\nThe Republican base is clearly re-energized in the wake of the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democratic advantage among women, especially independent women, is shrinking.\n\nOn the issues, Republicans have an edge on handling the economy. Democrats have been advertising on health care, they have an advantage there. And as President Trump trains his fire on that migrant caravan, our poll shows split views -- 47 percent trust Democrats to handle immigration, but voters trust Republicans by a 10-point margin on border security.\n\nWe have a lot to analyze here with our team. I want to start by bringing our chief national affairs correspondent Tom Llamas. Tom, we're going to be focusing Tuesday on two key numbers, the two numbers we show right there, 23 and 2.\n\nThe House changes hands if the Democrats pick up 23 seats. In the Senate Democrats would need a net gain of two seats to change control. And those races you are going to show are taking place on two very different battlegrounds. Let's start with the House.\n\nTOM LLAMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, George. So, we're tracking the House races, but we've identified more than 100 competitive House races. These are the congressional districts, and you can see they stretch all along the map.\n\nWhat are we seeing here? We're seeing congressional districts that are part of suburbs and exurbs. And we see some clusters in the northeast. We're watching New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia, but we're also watching some red states -- Kentucky, Kansas, Texas, and in the blue state of California, we're tracking nearly a dozen races.\n\nWe have taken all these the competitive races. And we've aligned them like this on what we're calling our chip board, align them by the way polls are closing.\n\nRemember that key number you were talking about, George, 23, that's how many seats Democrats have to flip. And they may have an advantage. Historically, we have never seen a Democratic battleground this big. And there's a couple of reasons, a quarter of these districts, Hillary Clinton actually won but Republicans hold power. In others, Republicans were retired and even more, Democrats are generally excited about their candidates, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The Senate exactly the opposite.\n\nLLAMAS: A completely different story in the Senate. Let's talk a look at that now. When we flip over to our battleground board over here and we take a look at all the blue, these are all the Democratic seats. We're tracking 35 races. Let's go to the map right now. These are all the Senate races. But we've identified 14 key races.\n\nRemember, George, as you said, the Republicans have an advantage of two seats here but there are a lot of seats that Democrats hold in Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota. This was Trump country and they have a Democratic senator. But there are some races where Democrats feel they may have an advantage because of Republican retirements, in Tennessee and Arizona. We\u2019re going to be watching all those, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Lot of seats to watch. Want to bring in Nate Silver, also from FiveThirtyEight. And Nate, your forecast looking ahead to Tuesday pretty much mirror what we\u2019re seeing on those maps. Let\u2019s start with the House.\n\nNATE SILVER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: Yeah, for sure. So look at who is playing defense and how much defense they\u2019re playing. So in the House we have Democrats with about a four in five chance of winning the House. The national polls are pretty good for Democrats. The district polls are -- are very good for Democrats. They\u2019re pretty deep into red territory. In the Senate, it\u2019s the reverse where we have the GOP with a six in seven chance of holding on. Democrats are playing a lot of defense in states that they currently hold.\n\nThe terrain there is extremely red. So again, polls aren\u2019t always right. If polls are right, you would have a split outcome.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Polls aren\u2019t right and polls -- polls have a wide margin of error. Rick Klein is going to -- our political director. In part because this race is very hard to model the turnout for a midterm election.\n\nRICK KLEIN, ABC NEWS POLITICAL DIRECTOR: That\u2019s exactly right. And 52-44, eight points is exactly where Democrats need to be -- right on the cusp of where they need to be to be able to say that they have a good shot of taking the majority. If you narrow it down to the battleground districts, you\u2019ve got only a five point edge. So that\u2019s where the majority is either going to be won or lost. And Democrats are depending on groups that don\u2019t typically turn out in midterm elections. Bottom line, George, they need them to vote.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about younger voters, we\u2019re talking about non-white voters. Right now they\u2019re telling pollsters that they\u2019re likely to vote in unprecedented numbers. But that just hasn\u2019t been the history. They need those folks to show up.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Nate, let\u2019s educate voters a little bit on probability because we\u2019re all trying to learn the lessons of 2016, I think. Going into the 2016 election your forecast was actually lower than many others on predicting whether Hillary Clinton would win, about 71 percent. We learned that that wasn\u2019t a sure thing. Here you\u2019re up about 85 percent for the Democrats taking the House, so just explain -- break down statistically what that means.\n\nSILVER: So what our forecast accounts for is the chance that polls will be wrong. And you see how big of a lead a party has and how much uncertainty there is the forecast. The range of outcomes in the House is really wide. Our range, which covers 80 percent of outcomes, goes from -- on the low end -- about 15 Democratic pickups all the way up to the -- to low to mid 50s, 52 or 53. Most of those are above 23, which is how many seats they would need to take the House. But like -- but no one should be surprised if they only win 19 seats.\n\nAnd no one should be surprised if they -- if they win 51 seats. Those are both extremely possible based on how accurate polls are in the real world.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And one of the big X factors you\u2019ve written about this year is -- unusually for midterms -- Democrats actually have a huge fundraising advantage in the final days.\n\nSILVER: They have a fundraising advantage and so one thing we don\u2019t know about is there are lots and lots of districts on -- on the board where there are Republican incumbents in seats that are ordinarily safe and they might not have been aware of the fact that you have a Democrat who\u2019s raise twice as much money, their voters are very enthusiastic, they might be turning out voters who don\u2019t normally vote at midterms. So there are a lot of Republicans who will not be sleeping well tonight and tomorrow night.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why if Democrats beat their polls -- that can happen, it happened in Virginia in the governor\u2019s race last year -- then we\u2019re talking about really big numbers. So both ends of that range, the Republicans holding the House and the D landslide, if you will. I mean, that\u2019s as good as we can do based on how accurate polls are in the real world.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, let\u2019s broaden out the conversation a little bit. One of the other unusual things about this election is the ferocity of President Trump\u2019s campaigning, both in volume and what he\u2019s talking about in the final days. Here\u2019s a little bit of what he\u2019s done in the last three days.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Republicans want strong borders, no drugs, no gangs and we want no caravans, thank you.\n\nDemocrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation.\n\nThere\u2019s some bad people, as I said the other-- they\u2019re bad hombres. There\u2019s some bad hombres in that group.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chief White House correspondent Jon Karl here with me. The president every single day for the last week has done everything he can to put the focus on the border.\n\nJON KARL, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: George, with a president presiding over an economy as good as this one, you would expect there to be almost a morning in America message, stay the course, the economy\u2019s booming, let\u2019s keep with this. But instead it is midnight in America in Trump\u2019s campaign rallies. He is counting on fear and loathing to rally his base. It is a gamble. The gamble here is that they need to get Republicans as energized as clearly the Democrats have been. And largely they\u2019ve done it. You see it in the intensity in our polls.\n\n80 percent of both sides are saying that they\u2019re definitely going to vote. So you see that\u2019s worked. But the gamble here is is he alienating those independent and moderate voters in the suburban districts where the battleground for the House will be -- will be fought. It\u2019s a serious risk. They\u2019ve gotten their base as energized as they\u2019ve ever been. Going to those rallies, I\u2019m telling you, you see Trump supporters as energized as they were in 2016 but they are alienating a lot of moderates.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Even though, Cecilia Vega, that argument many times at odds with the facts.\n\nCECILIA VEGA, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ABC NEWS: Completely, in fact we\u2019ve seen not just a campaign in the last two, three weeks based on fear mongering but on misinformation and completely spreading falsehoods.\n\nI\u2019m struck by our poll, the number on immigration, how it ranks in terms of important issues for people. Six out of seven issues, that hasn\u2019t changed despite President Trump\u2019s repeated hammering on this issue.\n\nSo it really has the potential to backfire.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Martha Raddatz, one of the things the president hasn\u2019t been deterred by is sort of a push back from the military. Now 15,000 troops heading to the border, the cost could be up to $200 million by the end of the year.\n\nGeneral Mattis is going along with it, not so much former leaders.\n\nMARTHA RADDATZ, CO-ANCHOR, \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d: Definitely not some former leaders, including the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey who tries to stay out of politics, couldn\u2019t help himself this week, tweeting \u2018our men and women in uniform are better trained, better equipped and better led so they meet any threat with confidence, but a wasteful deployment of overstretched soldiers and marines would be made much worse if they use force disproportional to the threat they face,\u2019 they won\u2019t.\n\nI think that was kind of a look guys, don\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t pull your guns out if people are throwing rocks. We heard President Trump talk about that, if there are rock throwers coming at them, they will be seen as firearms.\n\nHe did back off of that and I have to think someone like Secretary Mattis got to him, those troops will not follow any kind of illegal order, disproportionate force, plus they\u2019re back there with concertina wire.\n\nAnd that just \u2013 just as Jon and Cecilia are saying, and you were saying as well, it\u2019s those images. He is appealing to that base. He\u2019s got soldiers down there, the military and helmets and \u2013 and body armor and concertina wire, those are the images that his base will see and he thinks the migrants as well.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Let\u2019s bring in Chris Christie, Republican, former governor of New Jersey, Trump ally as well. Address the \u2013 the argument that Jon Karl was making there. Is it wise to be focusing on this when you\u2019ve got an economy going gangbusters?\n\nCHRIS CHRISTIE, FORMER GOVERNOR, NEW JERSEY: Well I think two things, I think one there \u2013 you see that there\u2019s some real division on the who gets credit for the economy amongst some voters.\n\nBut secondly, George, I think they\u2019ve made a strategic decision, which is the House is much more difficult for them than the Senate. They have a bunch of red state Democrats who they want to try to get out of the Senate.\n\nAnd I think what you\u2019re seeing with the president is he\u2019s made a strategic decision that his ability to claim victory on election night will be by adding seats in the United States Senate.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t want to take the risk of looking like he\u2019s doing \u2013 trying too hard in the House, because then he may get blamed for losing there.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You started out saying they, but this is really being driven by him, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, George, as I\u2019ve said to you many times over the last nine, 10 months, he is his own strategist and he does not listen to other people generally in terms of political strategy.\n\nAnd you see this from getting involved in Republican primaries early on this year, which you very, very rarely would see presidents do. He\u2019s gotten involved in many of them, and a lot of the candidates that we have on the ballot today are because of the president\u2019s direct intervention.\n\nSo he is his own strategist, so when I say they I\u2019m using the royal \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: The royal they. Donna Brazile, one of the things we\u2019re seeing, picking up on what Chris was saying about the Senate strategy, are Democrat Senate candidate \u2013 candidates like Claire McCaskill kind of aligning themselves with the president on this immigration issue.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: There\u2019s no question that she is facing an uphill battle is Missouri, a state that Donald Trump claimed.\n\nBut you know, George, if Democrats win on Tuesday, it\u2019s because they are campaigning on hope, they are focusing on the \u2013 on healthcare, and they are also trying to overcome the odds in these midterm elections by trying to fuel independents and millennials to come to \u2013 come to the polls.\n\nWe see an increase in what we call infrequent voters who are now more engaged, they are more positive about voting, that\u2019s a plus sign for Democrats.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: But are \u2013 you know, that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s the hope with the early vote for Democrats, Matthew Dowd, but one of the things we saw back in 2016 is that those voters didn\u2019t come out, particularly Latino voters didn\u2019t vote in \u2013 in higher numbers despite the president\u2019s rhetoric on immigration.\n\nMATTHEW DOWD, POLITICAL ANALYST, ABC NEWS: Well I think this election, like the Trump \u2013 like the \u2013 President Trump\u2019s presidency has a whole unique batch of characteristics in \u2013 as we go into mid \u2013 the midterm.\n\nOur poll \u2013 just to touch again on our poll, our poll actually looks a lot like 2006. In \u2013 in 2006, the ABC poll said Democrats had a six point advantage, they won by eight points. George Bush\u2019s job approval rating was almost exactly where Donald Trump\u2019s is today.\n\nBut there\u2019s unique circumstances, we\u2019ve never had a president go into an election with an economy like this with a job approval in the low 40s. We\u2019ve never had that before, and we\u2019ve never had an election where both sides have been motivated.\n\nAlmost always one side is more motivated than the other side.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I want to \u2013 I want to pick up that, I\u2019m bringing this to Jon Karl as well, because I remember 1994 very well. President Clinton did not go out and campaign a lot in the final days.\n\nThe Democratic base was depressed. This is what\u2019s different about this election this time around, in an off year election, Republicans are engaged. They\u2019re not looking like they\u2019re going to stay home.\n\nKARL: No, and if you go back -- if you go back pre-Kavanaugh, there was real concern among Republicans that they were just not as energized. And the idea, driven by the president but also by some of his political advisors, is you had to find a way to get the base that turned out in 2016 riled up and fired up to vote this time. So the president\u2019s thrown himself right into this, I mean, he is out there non-stop.\n\nBut George, to the point about the House, he\u2019s not even touching any of the areas with -- with -- with the comparative House districts \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Because they don\u2019t want him there.\n\nKARL: \u2026 No. They -- they don\u2019t want him there. He\u2019s not going there. He\u2019s campaigning solely in the final stretch in states that he won, campaigning in the areas of those states where he is popular.\n\nCHRISTIE: George, let me just say this; I think if we\u2019re looking forward to Tuesday night, two places to look, that\u2019s what kind of night it\u2019s going to be, is the Florida Senate race and the Wisconsin governor\u2019s race. In the Florida Senate race you have the two-term governor against a long-term incumbent Bill Nelson against Rick Scott. And in Wisconsin you have a very close governor\u2019s race, Scott Walker looking for a third term -- the fourth time he\u2019s run in eight years. It\u2019s going to tell us a lot about voters, how they feel about politicians.\n\nAnd in those states that were so key to the presidential election, we\u2019re going to see what happens there in terms of that Republican intensity you\u2019re talking about. If Scott and Walker win then I think it\u2019s going to be a decent night for Republicans.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Those are too different.\n\nBut Matthew Dowd, you make a -- you -- you\u2019ve been talking about the fact that we haven\u2019t been paying enough attention to the governors\u2019 races now, huge potential that there are many flips to Democrats on -- on -- on the governors\u2019 races and that could have a much higher long-term impact.\n\nMATTHEW DOWD, ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah. I -- I mean, obviously, we\u2019re all -- everyone in America\u2019s concerned about who\u2019s going to hold the House, who\u2019s going to hold the Senate. But really fundamentally, when you look at politics going forward as we have in the last 20 or 30 years, it\u2019s the governors\u2019 races and it\u2019s the governors\u2019 races in purple states.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s the governor -- it\u2019s where Republicans have held the office, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, there is a real high chance they lose in all of those places. And when they lose in those places, it not only affects what happens today, it not only affects what may happen in -- in the 2020 presidential -- it affects redistricting which then they then draw the districts, which then goes forward. So to me is -- yes, we have two big things to watch, the House and the Senate -- but for me, what\u2019s going to really impact what\u2019s going to really impact what\u2019s going forward is those governors\u2019 races in purple states.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And -- and not only in purple states, Donna Brazile, but would everybody look at the possibility of having the first African American governors of Florida and Georgia?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: George, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to be a historic night. In addition to Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams of course, Ben Jealous in -- in the great State of Maryland, the African American lieutenant governor candidates in several states including Wisconsin as well as Illinois, 42 percent of all of the Democratic nominees this fall gubernatorial, Senatorial as well as House candidates are women, so a Democratic wave depend on women coming out to vote, minorities and other infrequent voters.\n\nCHRISTIE: And George, I was RGA chairman four years at the midterm the map has been \u2026\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You said Republican Governors Association.\n\nCHRISTIE: ... Yes, Republican Governors Association -- as bad as the map is for Democrats on the Senate side, it\u2019s that bad for Republicans on the governors side, of the 36 governors races, 26 are Republican defenses.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And -- and -- and you, of course, you were a governor. Explain what that means in a presidential year to have a governor from your state in charge.\n\nCHRISTIE: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you control the political apparatus in your state. You control who\u2019s counting the votes, most of the time who is the secretary of state or the chief election officer. And going forward from there, you control redistricting after the census or at least have a very large influence over it.\n\nSo as Matthew very aptly put, it\u2019s not only what happens tomorrow, it\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in 2021 and 2022 on redistricting these House seats, which will have a huge difference. That\u2019s been the Republicans\u2019 huge advantage, \u201909 and \u201910, set the stage for a Republican decade.\n\nDOWD: And -- and keep in mind that the president is the president today because he won three states in those purple states in the Midwest by less than 100,000 votes. And the likelihood that each of those has a -- ether a small blue wave or a large blue wave is very high. Pennsylvania Republicans have no chance, Michigan it looks like the Democrat\u2019s going to win the governor\u2019s race and Wisconsin is a race that\u2019s very tight but the -- it leans in the Democratic favor, that\u2019s where the president won the presidency.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Martha Raddatz -- Matt Dowd just talked about Pennsylvania. You spent a lot of time with voters there in the State of Pennsylvania. That is one of the places where Democrats are hoping to pick up a -- a raft of House seats.\n\nRADDATZ: Exactly. And when -- when you talk to voters in Pennsylvania, especially in those suburbs and some of those who voted for Donald Trump, he has just gone too far for many of them. There -- there is -- they\u2019re -- he\u2019s too divisive for them. For them, Donald Trump is absolutely the issue.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He\u2019s the issue. And we\u2019re likely to see changes also very changing faces, Cecilia Vega, in Congress no matter what happens on Tuesday night, record number of women running for the House.\n\nCECILIA VEGA, ABC NEWS SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Record number of women, record number of LGBT candidates -- LGBTQ candidates, Donna just mentioned the record number of African Americans running. But I -- I do want to say, the -- we can focus on the president\u2019s travel in the last few weeks and that tells us a lot about where he\u2019s looking, just to go back to Matthew\u2019s comments on Florida. He\u2019s headed to Florida twice in the last week. He is very concerned about having to win that state, not just for now, but for 2020 also.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Everybody stand by, we\u2019re going to be back. But coming up next, party leaders are going to make their closing arguments. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel and the chair of the Democrat Senate Campaign, Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: They will try to erase our gains and eradicate our progress, that's what's going to happen. They're going to work hard and we will be fighting. It will be -- it will be ridiculous, frankly, it will be bad for our country. The Democrats. And it could happen. It could happen. We're doing very well and we're doing really well in the senate. But it could happen.\n\nAnd you know what you do? My whole life. You know what I say, don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out. Does that make sense? I'll just figure it out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: President Trump in West Virginia this week.\n\nJoined now by the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, thank you for joining us this morning.\n\nUnusually, a subdued president there, almost resigned, it seems, to losing the House. Are you?\n\nRONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIR, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Absolutely not, especially with the economic numbers that we saw on Friday with 250,000 jobs added to the economy, with wages over 3 percent for the first time in a decade. I mean, the American voters are looking at what's happened over the past two years. They're making more money. More jobs are coming back. That is a great closing argument in a lot of these Houses races that are within the margin of error.\n\nAnd they're going to say Republicans have offered a record of results and Democrats are offering resistance and going back. I think it\u2019s pretty clear.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You say -- you say it's a great closing argument. How come the president is not making it?\n\nMCDANIEL: He is. He's talking about many different things that he's accomplished as president, because the list is so long. I think he's highlighting the fact that we need immigration reform. Democrats aren't coming to the table on that, strengthening our military, taking care of our veterans, taking on the opioid crisis. The national security issues that he's taken on, North Korea, Iran, Syria, all the things that he's accomplished in these first two years.\n\nBut the economy is a driving force with the tax cuts and the deregulation. People's lives are better. They're taking home more money to spend on their families and that is a very compelling argument for many of these voters across the country who are looking at who they want to keep in the majority, and Republicans are the party that's delivered.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: So you want -- you want voters focused on the economy on Tuesday. The president every single day over the last week has talked about immigration, talking about sending troops, talking about the migrant caravan, talking about birthright citizenship, even tweeting out that ad -- we're not going to play the whole ad, but we're going to show that ad the president put out about illegal immigration, showing that illegal immigrant who committed murder, blaming that on Democrats. That has caused even some Republicans to react.\n\nJohn Kasich, Republican Governor of Ohio, tweeted out, \"the politics of fear, hatred and division should have no place in our country or the Republican Party, let alone the presidency. All Americans should reject this ad and its motives.\" Do you?\n\nMCDANIEL: Well, I think the president is highlighting a failure in our immigration system, that this disgusting person got into our country twice under a Democrat and a Republican president and was able to kill police.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: He blamed it only on Democrats.\n\nMCDANIEL: We don't want that in our immigration system.\n\nObviously, we recognize that we have a broken immigration policy right now in this country with these caravans coming towards our country, with 12,000 kids that have come unaccompanied, that are coming on their own, because their parents so desperately want to get into this country.\n\nI know why they want to get here, our economy is doing great. We have a lot of jobs. And the president has said, let's get merit-based immigration. Let's focus on eliminating the visa lottery system, something that Canada doesn't do, and let's strengthen our border. And Democrats, again, won't come to the table on an important issue, like immigration. They didn't come to the table on these tax cuts. They didn't come to the table with this president on anything, because they have refused to work with him. And he's closing with the argument of we're the party of results and they're the party of resistance.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There's division in the Republican Party, of course, on immigration as well. But you're not concerned about the -- the possibility, as we were talking about just earlier in the program, that the president's focused on immigration, the ads like that are going to cause a backlash in the suburban districts you need to hold, in order to hold the House?\n\nMCDANIELS: I'm with the president at these rallies. The president\u2019s talking about all of the accomplishments. I think the media\u2019s focused on immigration constantly, and I get that. But he's focusing on the economy, he's talking about the jobs. He's talking about the lowest unemployment in history for the African-American and Hispanic communities and that our country is on a great comeback and the fact that Nancy Pelosi has said she's going to raise taxes.\n\nAnd the president recognizes the historical trends with the House and the Senate. Usually the party that holds the White House loses three seats in the Senate and 30 seats in the House, and he's doing everything he can to turn out every vote with his exhaustive schedule, but it is a whole variety of issues that he's talking about and accomplishments that he's made as president that have made our country stronger, more prosperous, safer, and has given the American people more jobs, more money and a comeback that frankly a lot of Democrats didn\u2019t think was possible and they certainly didn\u2019t help with.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Chairman McDaniel, you -- you blame the media but it\u2019s the president himself who said he wants the election to be about the caravan.\n\nMCDANIEL: The president has not said he wants it to be just about the caravan. The president\u2019s saying let\u2019s look at the record. Are you better off than you were two years? He\u2019s talking about the economy. It\u2019s just not getting the same coverage. I mean, the economy should be, first and foremost, on a lot of people\u2019s minds as they\u2019re going to the polls. Because remember, President Obama said we\u2019ll never get above 2 percent GDP. And now we\u2019re at 3.5 percent GDP, over 4 percent in some cases.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen 4 million people go off of food stamps. We\u2019ve seen 4 million new jobs come to this country. There\u2019s a lot of good things to talk about. The president\u2019s talking about it. He\u2019s talking about a lot of other things. You know, he can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Where do the House and Senate stand Wednesday morning?\n\nMCDANIEL: It\u2019s tight, George. It\u2019s tight. It\u2019s going to depend on voter turnout on election day. Democrat enthusiasm is definitely there. We are seeing that in the early voting, in all of these key House and Senate races and Republicans have been matching. So literally election day voting is going to determine the balance of the House. I\u2019d say there\u2019s about 27 seats within the margin of error. Obviously we have had headwinds with 44 retirements and historical trends on the House, but I feel like we can still keep that majority and then the Senate is a better map.\n\nAnd if we keep the Senate, that will be defying history as well, because usually you lose three seats in that first term of a first term president.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Ronna McDaniel, thanks very much.\n\nNow we\u2019re going to bring in the chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator Van Hollen, thank you for joining us this morning. You just heard the predictions there from Ronna McDaniel. It is true that your Democratic senators are up against the wall on Tuesday. Are you -- are you confident that you can take the Senate?\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D), CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE: Well George, it\u2019s great to be with you. Here\u2019s where we are. We have lots of races within the margin of error, so I\u2019m not going to make any predictions. What I can say is that as you discussed earlier on this program, Senate Democrats really face the toughest political map in 60 years, so it\u2019s remarkable that we\u2019re in as strong a position as we are. And that is a testament to our senators and to our Senate Democratic candidates who are running as candidates who are going to stand up for their states, that their job is to put politics aside, stand up for their states.\n\nSometimes that means working with President Trump if it\u2019s good for their state and sometimes it means opposing the president if it\u2019s bad for their state, like the president\u2019s effort and Republican effort to take away protections for people with preexisting health conditions, a big issue in all these races.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: That is a big issue in all these races. You have seen, as you said, your Democratic Senator Brian Donnelly in Indiana is advertising about how much he\u2019s supporting President Trump. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota has done the same thing. But seems to be -- especially Heitkamp in North Dakota -- punished for the Kavanaugh nomination, how Democrats handled the Kavanaugh nomination. Any regrets?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Well first of all, never count Heidi Heitkamp out. In her last election six years ago, she was 10 points down with a week to go. It\u2019s much closer than that in North Dakota. Don\u2019t count her out. The reality is that Heidi Heitkamp did as she always does, what she thought was the best thing for the country. Sometimes that means supporting the president on issues, as she did with the earlier Justice Gorsuch, and sometimes that means opposing the president on these issues.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: How about Bob Menendez in New Jersey? It\u2019s a race we haven\u2019t talked too much about. Of course he was indicted, later acquitted on corruption issues. But he -- he does seem to be in a tighter race in New Jersey than you would expect. Are you confident he\u2019s going to pull it out or are you concerned that he may be holding back Democratic House candidates?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: I\u2019m absolutely confident that Bob Menendez will win that race. The people of New Jersey have been very clear. They do not want a rubber stamp for Donald Trump, and that is what Bob Menendez\u2019s opponent has -- has done and will do. And his opponent has spent $30 million of -- of money that he gained as a CEO of -- of a pharmaceutical company where he really gouged on prices for cancer patients. So that\u2019s why you have a competitive race in New Jersey. Obviously there are other issues Bob Menendez has to litigate, but people in New Jersey do not want a Donald Trump rubber stamp.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Democrats hoping they can pick up seats in Nevada and Arizona. One of the big X factors there is will Latinos turn out to vote. Will they?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Yes, they will. And we\u2019re already seeing the early voting results in those states, and you are seeing a good, healthy turnout among Latino voters, as well as younger voters. And you\u2019re seeing a pattern of good turnout for Democrats and independents who are supporting Democratic candidates around the country, George. And again, that issue that has been front and center for the last two years, the Republican efforts to take away important healthcare protections is one that Senate Republican candidates have been running away from their records on. And we\u2019re making sure that people know exactly what they -- they did, which was vote either in the Congress, the Senate, or through lawsuits to take away those protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll also say that the Republican Senate leader\u2019s comments the other day about the Republican plan to cut Medicare and Social Security gives away their playbook. The debt went way up to $2 trillion as a result of the tax cut for big corporations. Now they want to come back and take it out on people who have Medicare and Social Security.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Are you prepared for a world Wednesday where Republicans pick up seats in the Senate?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: George, we\u2019re prepared for whatever result we have. But let me just say that the fact that we still have a narrow path to a majority is a sea change from where we were 18 months ago. And as I said, it\u2019s because our candidates have always said they\u2019ll stand up for their states, first and foremost; put aside the politics, do what\u2019s right. And we\u2019re seeing the results here. These are some very close races. And of course, they\u2019re in states that Donald Trump won big. And it\u2019s a testament to these candidates that they\u2019re so focused on what matters to people in their state.\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, that is not a top-down issue. It\u2019s not like, you know, President Trump going out there and talking about immigration and trying to divide people. And by the way, we\u2019ve just seen a litany of documented false statements and lies from the president on that issue.\n\nBut on the healthcare issue, this is a bottom-up issue. When Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you found people in rural areas, in rural hospitals say no. You found the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, all these local chapters who have nothing to do with politics, said, \u201cDon\u2019t take away our protections for healthcare.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Republicans continue to try to do that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Chris Van Hollen, thanks very much.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Thank you.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We\u2019ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDEBORAH ROBERTS, JOURNALIST, ABC NEWS: You talked about all the votes, what about voter suppression? People are saying that minority votes \u2013\n\nBRIAN KEMP (R), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, GEORGIA: Well that\u2019s a \u2013 that\u2019s a myth. That is a myth that \u2013 that the Democrats bring out every two years. We have record number of people on our voting rolls.\n\nROBERTS: So what do you say to people who say that you\u2019re trying to suppress the vote? What do you say?\n\nKEMP: I\u2019m not trying to suppress \u2013 the numbers don\u2019t lie about that fact. Minority participation is up 23 percent in Georgia, 23 percent. That\u2019s what you should report, and not believe the B.S. about voter suppression.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Republican candidate for governor in Georgia Brian Kemp there talking to our Deb Roberts.\n\nI want to bring in our Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas for more on this whole issue of voting rights, voter suppression, and access to the ballot. You just heard Brian Kemp call it a myth there, but we're looking at this issue in several key states.\n\nPIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Right, Georgia is one of them.\n\nThere are about 50,000 votes that we have been paying attention to where there's some question as regard to voter registration, how it compares to other government records. There are about 50,000 people, 70 percent of those are African-American, so some people are very concerned about that.\n\nNow, those people should be able to vote on Election Day if they show up with their proper ID. But it will depend on how the polling stations deal with those individual voters, George.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: You have also got a serious issue in the state of North Dakota.\n\nTHOMAS: Exactly, that\u2019s very interesting. In that state, you have to have a-- show a proof of residency when you vote. So, many of the Native Americans who live on reservations, they haven't had that -- those type of addresses. So, they've been scrambling in recent weeks trying to get specific addresses so they can show, again, it will depend on how each polling station deals with them when they come in to vote.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Connected to this issue, the whole issue of ballot security, so many concerns about the possibility of hacking into the election systems this year. Several Senate candidates have said they have been hacked. What's the state of ballot security looking ahead to Tuesday?\n\nTHOMAS: There's good news and bad news. Here's the good news, we're not seeing the level of Russian activity that we saw in 2016. Certainly nothing on the scale of hacking the DNC or the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nBut you still see, according to some sources, the Russians trying to affect the campaign through social media, putting out bad information, trying to sow seeds of division among Americans about issues of race, immigration and things like that.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And the big social media companies, like Facebook, still haven't quite figured out how to deal with it.\n\nTHOMAS: They say they're trying harder. The issue of finding these accounts which are pushing out this information. Facebook, in fact, talked about how they set up a war room. They have got about 20,000 employees that they said are working on this. Twitter said they have identified thousands of people, thousands of accounts in which people were trying to sow disinformation, they have taken down those accounts. We're talking millions of these accounts, so it's an ongoing threat.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And you'll be tracking these issues all through the night Tuesday. Pierre Thomas, thanks very much.\n\nWhat happens the day after election day? Mary Bruce joins us from Capitol Hill and how Democrats plan to take on Trump if they win the House. We'll be right back with that and our roundtable.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Nate Silver, super model right there, for FiveThirtyEight.\n\nI want to talk now about the day after the election. I want to bring in our Chief Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce for more on this. We don't know what is going to happen Tuesday night, Mary, but Democrats hopeful they'll take control of the House.\n\nTalk about their plans if that happens.\n\nMARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, George, if Democrats do take the House, they are going to put the Trump administration under an intense microscope. They are likely to launch investigations into everything from conflicts of interests to the president's tax returns and of course the issue of Russian collusion.\n\nDemocrats feel that this administration has been able to act unchecked, and that is likely to come to a screeching halt.\n\nBut there is a political risk here for Democrats. They're going to have to show that they can legislate, not just investigate. So, first up, expect them to pass something to address the issue of corruption in government. Democrats are well aware that Americans are fed up with Washington. And they're going to want to send a message that there's a new sheriff here in town.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And if Republicans hold the House?\n\nBRUCE: If Republicans hold the House then, George, you're going to see more of the same. Congress will continue to act in the way that they have.\n\nBut there is no big push, no big rush of legislation at the ready; no immigration bill, no big tax plan standing in the wing here. While Republicans are running on these issues, there is no big legislative push right now, here to back all of that up.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And on the Republican side, if the Republicans hold the House, likely to see a pretty serious fight for leader, to be speaker of the House.\n\nBRUCE: Yeah, absolutely. Paul Ryan, of course, has already said that he is out. You are then going to see a huge fight to replace Paul Ryan, lots of names being floated; Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise. And of course some of those on the far-right of the caucus, like Jim Jordan, those from the Freedom Caucus. A lot of names here that are going to be fighting to be Speaker of the House if Republicans do take the House.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And if Democrats take the House, no guarantee that Nancy Pelosi will be the House Speaker.\n\nBRUCE: No, George. Look, whether or not Nancy Pelosi will be Speaker will depend in large part upon the size of any Democratic majority and the makeup of a Democratic caucus. Lots of Democratic candidates have already said that they will not support Pelosi. And you\u2019re going to see, likely, a lot of calls for some new blood in Democratic leadership. That said, Pelosi has a lot of experience, she knows how to pass bills, and she certainly will know how to wrangle a diverse caucus as they launch all of these investigations.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Mary Bruce, thanks very much. Back here with our analysts, I want to get to what we\u2019re watching on Tuesday night. But first, I want to do a couple questions for Donna and Chris. Donna, first, on that question I just posed to Mary Bruce. What \u2013 what \u2013 how big a margin do the Democrats need for Nancy Pelosi to be guaranteed that she\u2019ll be the Speaker?\n\nBRAZILE: First of all, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s probably one of the best whip counters in the Democratic caucus. So I wouldn\u2019t throw her under the bus right now because she knows how to win, she\u2019s raised over $130 million for Democrats across the country. One of the reasons why we have a diverse lineup of candidates is because Nancy Pelosi went out there and encouraged those candidates to run.\n\nSo I see Nancy Pelosi \u2013 I mean, she\u2019s going to fight like hell. There is a call for new blood, more people in the leadership. And just remember, George, 15 percent to 25 percent of those newly elected Democrats, they will look for someone who can carry the mantle for them in 2020 and beyond.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Chris, for the White House, a House with subpoena power is a brand-new ball game.\n\nCHRISTIE: Oh, yes.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Is the White House braced for that, are they ready for it, are they prepared?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, they\u2019re getting a new White House counsel who should be in place in time for January. And if it\u2019s a Democratic House, it\u2019s very well it could be their main job is going to be to be a subpoena processor over at the White House. And I think Mary was right, though, that there is real political risk in that as well. We saw that happen with the Republican House and Bill Clinton in the \u201890s.\n\nYou go too aggressive in that regard, it can be a backlash against those people. So that\u2019s what I think, and by the way, every dollar I have in my pocket, if they win the House, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s going to be Speaker. Sharpest elbows, best counter, she is going to be the Speaker. Everything else is pretend.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: We are all going to be here on Tuesday night, want to get everybody\u2019s take on what they\u2019re going to be watching for. Martha, let me start with you. What\u2019s the big thing you\u2019re going to be watching Tuesday night?\n\nRADDATZ: Well, I think I\u2019m even going beyond Tuesday night. I think one of the things we\u2019ve watched Tuesday night is not whether the Democrats gain control of the House but it\u2019s also how people campaign, and what this has meant about these incendiary ads. That\u2019s a lesson that everybody will learn going forward, not just to 2020, but beyond. Is this the kind of fear-mongering that works? If it does, you\u2019ll see a lot more of it.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Jon Karl?\n\nKARL: I\u2019m going to be watching Pennsylvania. Polls close at 8 o\u2019clock so we\u2019ll see relatively early. Trump won the state by 44,000 votes. It was a key reason that he is president and the Republicans could lose up to eight seats in the state of Pennsylvania. They\u2019re almost certain to lose two because of redistricting. How they do between that margin, I think, will determine largely where we go in the rest of the midterms.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: On the House?\n\nVEGA: I\u2019ve got my eyes on the suburbs all around this country, looking at places like the seventh congressional district in Virginia where you\u2019ve got a female newcomer, Abigail Spanberger running and\u2013 looking to unseat a third-term Republican there. Will there be a so-called \u2018Pink Wave\u2019 with someone like this ushering out a Trump supporter in a \u2013 in a Trump district? We will see.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Matthew Dowd?\n\nDOWD: I\u2019m watching independents. And that\u2019s going to determine who wins this and all of the races across the country. It\u2019s why Donald Trump\u2019s President of the United States. And a specific race that I think people should be aware of is the Beto O\u2019Rourke-Ted Cruz race in Texas. That race is a lot closer than people think and I talked to a number of Republicans over the last 48 hours. They\u2019re very concerned, the first time they\u2019ve been concerned that they could possibly lose a statewide race in Texas in 20 years.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Well, this gives us an opportunity to talk about the early vote. Just saw this come in overnight. Already, more people have voted in the state of Texas \u2013 what, we\u2019re two days out from the vote, than voted in the entire 2014\u2026\n\nDOWD: Entire 2014. And they\u2019re thinking that there\u2019s going to be more than 7 million people vote in this election in Texas, which is almost a presidential year election return. And most of the growth in those \u2013 is new people, young people, and Latinos.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Beto O\u2019Rourke wins in Texas, he\u2019s automatically near the top of the pack for 2020.\n\nDOWD: He\u2019s already a rockstar, he becomes the biggest rockstar in the country.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Donna Brazile?\n\nBRAZILE: Of course, I\u2019m looking at the Oprah effect. I\u2019m watching Georgia, it\u2019s on my mind. As a daughter of the South, I\u2019m very proud of Stacey Abrams, the kind of campaign that she\u2019s run..\n\nShe\u2019s finishing up her campaign on education. I want to see her win, I want to see her win decisively and I\u2019m also watching the other states as well, including Florida.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: There\u2019s another \u2013 there\u2019s another race in Georgia though, if \u2013 if Stacey Abrams does well, first of all we should that if neither she nor Brian Kemp get 50 percent there\u2019s a run off in the state of Georgia.\n\nSecondly, does she have the strength to carry in Lucy McBath, another key Senate race?\n\nBRAZILE: I think so \u2013\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: I mean House race.\n\nBRAZILE: Oh, absolutely, look she has done something that I think Democrats should have done a long time ago. That is she\u2019s expanded the electorate, she has campaigned in rural areas like Doug Wilder who won back in 1989.\n\nStacey Abrams understood that in order to win, you had to bring a new energy in the party, and she\u2019s done that.\n\nCHRISTIE: Florida and Wisconsin, as I said before, are going to be key to watch. And who\u2019s had a good night and a bad night from the parties. If you see the Oklahoma governorship go to the Democrats, it\u2019s going to be a very bad night for Republicans.\n\nIf you see the United States Senate seat in New Jersey go to the Republicans, it\u2019s going to be a very bad night for Senate Democrats.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And Nate Silver, you\u2019re going to be adjusting your forecast all through the evening as we get real results coming in. Give us a sense of what you\u2019re going to be keeping an eye on early in the night.\n\nNATE SILVER, EDITOR IN CHIEF, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: So to me, you have a two part election, you have the north and the south. We expect that Democrats are going to gain a lot of seats here in the Northeast, in Pennsylvania for example we expect they\u2019ll do very well in governorships in the \u2013 in the Midwest.\n\nIf they\u2019re going to have a really good night, where it\u2019ll really put the Senate in play, they\u2019re going to have to win places in the South, they\u2019re going to have to win Tennessee or Texas, at least one of those, probably they\u2019re going to have to hold in Florida.\n\nThey\u2019re going to have to put these suburban Atlanta districts in play in the House. That\u2019s when you get a margin that might win 35 or 40, and where the Senate might actually get interesting, it might be because of a race like Texas.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Rick Klein, you\u2019re going to be behind the scenes on \u2013 on Tuesday night, and we\u2019ve all are trying to learn the lessons of the last couple of elections as we forecast on Tuesday night, as we cover the races on Tuesday.\n\nWe\u2019ve had some bad exit polls, the 2004 election, 2016 as well. Talk about how we\u2019re going to communicate with voters last-- during the night and \u2013 and with our decision desk.\n\nRICK KLEIN, POLITICAL DIRECTOR, ABC NEWS: We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re going to be as transparent as possible about why we\u2019re not comfortable in a particular race.\n\nWe\u2019re going to provide information throughout the night about where vote is still outstanding, where things look, relying on everyone here on this set and beyond to try to convey the true uncertainty of an unprecedented election.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Jon Karl, you\u2019ve said several times we have to be prepared to be surprised on Tuesday.\n\nKARL: Yeah, I will be surprised if I\u2019m not surprised, George. And I could see getting to \u2013 to Nate\u2019s range of events, I could see us being surprised by a much bigger blue wave than \u2013 than we\u2019ve anticipated.\n\nI could \u2013 I would also not be surprised if we see the Republicans do surprisingly well. I mean we just don\u2019t know, it\u2019s so much harder to poll in \u2013 in a midterm election, it\u2019s so much harder to poll in these House races.\n\nWe just don\u2019t know. And intensity is so high, that also adds to the uncertainty.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: And it is also why it is going to be so exciting --\n\nKARL: Yes, it\u2019s going to be a great night.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: -- on \u2013 on Tuesday night. We\u2019re looking forward to having all of you here with us on Tuesday night, looking forward to talking to all of you as well. That is all for us today.\n\nThanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. We\u2019re all going to be back here as I said on Tuesday night, I\u2019ll be anchoring our midterm election special, analysis from our whole political team.\n\nWe are going to have reporters all across the country in the key states all through the night until we have a result. It starts at 8:00 Eastern and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow on \u201cGMA\u201d.\n\nEND", "He is accused of having a hand in dozens of murders, of using his drug cartel to smuggle more than 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, even pulling off running the massive operation from behind bars. That's when he wasn't busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns at his upcoming New York City trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case's sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns for a trial that is starting Monday with jury selection. Opening statements are likely Nov. 13.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWITNESSES IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defense says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn't be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their cooperation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to cooperate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman's asks, \"How much can you get rid of in a month?\"\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFORTIFYING THE COURTHOUSE\n\nAt pretrial hearings leading to the trial, heavily armed federal officers and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled outside. Anyone trying to attend the hearings was put through airport-style metal detectors at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself.\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one's hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they've ever heard of \"El Chapo\" along with, \"Have you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\"\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors' contention that Guzman's cartel \"employs 'sicarios,' or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKEEPING AN EYE ON EL CHAPO\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman's history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a mile-long (1.6 kilometer-long) tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe logistical problem for his keepers: The case is being prosecuted across the East River in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nFor pre-trial hearings, authorities opted to transport him to and from jail by shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge to make way for a police motorcade that included a SWAT team and an ambulance, all tracked by helicopters.\n\nThe judge indicated he thinks the time and expense involved would add up to a logistical nightmare \u2014 and an inconvenience for New Yorkers who rely on the bridge to commute \u2014 for a trial expected to last as long as four months. He said there would be adjustments, but didn't elaborate.\n\nThere's now speculation that a special cell for Guzman has been set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the night after his days in court.\n\nBut no one is saying. For security reasons, of course.", "Fighting has escalated around Yemen's key port city of Hodeida, with more than 150 combatants killed over the weekend from both the rebel and government-backed sides, officials said Sunday.\n\nAirstrikes and naval artillery pounded rebel positions around the Red Sea coastal city, where government backed-troops are launching a major ground assault to try to wrest it from dug-in rebels. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nThe rebels, known as Houthis, said they repelled the latest offensive on Hodeida, killing or wounding 215 troops, but did not provide a breakdown. They said they destroyed 20 armored vehicles over the past 24 hours.\n\nFierce fighting also erupted in the provinces of Bayda, to the south, and Saada, a Houthi stronghold in the north, they added.\n\nThe offensive came despite recent calls by the Trump administration for a cease-fire by late November.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015 when the Houthis occupied northern regions and forced the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition supporting the largely exiled government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign, causing thousands of deaths. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\nThe coalition accuses the Houthis of acting as Iran's proxy.\n\nThe war has led to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Three-quarters of Yemen's people require life-saving assistance, according to the U.N. Population Fund. An estimated 10,000 people have been killed and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation from a looming famine.\n\nThe regional director of the U.N. children's agency, Geert Cappelaere, said the warring sides in Yemen make it difficult to deliver and distribute humanitarian aid to the country.\n\nHe said the situation is a \"living hell\" for all Yemeni children, singling out the death last week of 7-year-old Amal Hussein who had suffered from severe malnutrition.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Amal is not the only Yemeni child suffering that fate,\" he told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. \"Thirty thousand children in Yemen die every single year of malnutrition as one of the most important underlying causes. There is not one Amal \u2014 there are many thousands of Amals.\"\n\nThe Associated Press had photographed Amal \u2014 whose name means \"hope\" in Arabic \u2014 in August. A photograph of the emaciated child with a protruding rib cage and stick-like arms also appeared recently on the front page of The New York Times.\n\nMedics say her death was the result of insufficient medical care as supplies dwindle and many people like Amal live far from treatment centers.\n\nMariam Ali, Amal's mother, told the AP on Sunday that she had been walking on foot under the rain for over an hour to reach a health center when her daughter died in the middle of the road lasts week.\n\n\"I collapsed and only woke up to find myself home surrounded by neighbors who wrapped me in a blanket while my husband took Amal away,\" Mariam said.\n\nShe has six children who have suffered bouts of vomiting and diarrhea but recovered, whereas while Amal was sick for four years before she passed away.", "Police in India said Sunday that they are investigating allegations that a 4-year-old girl was gang-raped while being treated in an intensive care unit at a hospital in the country's north.\n\nLocal police official Mahesh Srivastava said that the girl told her grandmother she was raped by a hospital attendant and four others when she was alone Saturday night.\n\nHe said one man was in custody and police were looking for others. Police also have asked for CCTV footage and are trying to determine why the girl was left alone in the ICU.\n\nHe said the girl had been in the hospital for four days and was being treated for a snake bite.\n\nThe hospital is located 250 kilometers southwest of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIndia has been shaken by a series of sexual assaults in recent years, including the gang-rape and murder of a student on a moving New Delhi bus in 2012. That attack galvanized a country where widespread violence against women had long been quietly accepted.\n\nWhile the government has passed a series of laws increasing punishment for rape of an adult to 20 years in prison, it's rare for more than a few weeks to pass without another brutal sexual assault being reported.\n\nResponding to widespread outrage over the recent rape and killings of young girls and other attacks on children, India's government earlier this year approved the death penalty for people convicted of raping children under age 12.", "As he introduced one of the youngest Democrats running for Congress to a crowd of more than 1,000 Iowans earlier this week, the power of the popular former Vice President Joe Biden's support among his party's base in a vulnerable district was on full display \u2013 a foreshadowing, in some ways of the 2020 speculation that will kick into overdrive on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFolks, my name is Joe Biden and I\u2019m here because my friend Abby Finkenauer asked me to be here. She\u2019s the best,\u201d Biden said to a crowd of more than 1,000 people Tuesday night.\n\nFinkenauer, 29, is a two-term State Representative running against two-term Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum and is hoping that Democratic enthusiasm and the district\u2019s purple past could help her flip Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District.\n\nBiden made a campaign swing through the Midwest. He held rallies in Ohio. Wisconsin, along with his visit to Iowa, with scheduled stops in Illinois, Missouri, North Dakota and Michigan before the week was over.\n\nWith Election Day less than a week away, Democrats are hoping to turn vulnerable districts in the House in their direction, including in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, where Biden appeared on behalf of Finkenauer.\n\n\u2018This is personal\u2019\n\nFinkenauer previously served as coordinator of volunteers for Biden\u2019s 2007 Iowa Caucus campaign. Both talk about their shared background coming from working-class families and both are hoping to convince working-class voters that the Democratic Party can deliver for them.\n\nFinkenauer has campaigned largely on her background, touting an \u2018Iowa tough\u2019 attitude as the daughter of a union pipefitter and welder, and someone who understands what families in the district face from her own upbringing.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE\n\n\u2018She comes from really good stock. But I tell you what, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019s honorable, she\u2019s serious, and she\u2019s thoroughly authentic,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden, now 75, pointed to the fact that Finkenauer--one of the youngest candidates running in 2018 \u2013 is the same age he was when he first won his seat in the Senate.\n\n\u201cI wondered why anyone would vote for me as a 29-year-old kid for the United States Senate to win, and watching Abby, I know why they\u2019re going to vote for her,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAt 29, Finkenauer would be the first congresswoman from Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District and would be one of the youngest women elected to Congress, alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York.\n\nAt the rally Tuesday night, Finkenauer recalled the fight in the Iowa State House to preserve bargaining rights for union members \u2013 an effort that failed in February of 2017 \u2013 as her inspiration for taking on a Congressional run.\n\n\u201cI saw the faces of those Iowans and they had tears in their eyes and so did I. And I vowed to myself in that moment this is not how we treat people in my state or in my country, and I was going to do whatever I could to get it back. So, friends, I decided to run for Congress because this is personal,\u201d Finkenauer said.\n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing that you can\u2019t refinance your student loans the way you can a mortgage. More people who are actually paying off student loans should be at the table making the decisions. #ia01 https://t.co/8urqPTFOnd \u2014 Abby Finkenauer (@Abby4Iowa) November 2, 2018\n\nSandy Hughes, who attended the rally, said that vote is part of the reason she\u2019s voting for Finkenauer in 2018.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s listening to the people, and she\u2019s accessible,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cMy husband works for the school system and they voted down his bargaining rights in the state house. We just think she\u2019s listening to the people in her district and will be more supportive of the issues we\u2019re interested in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that she comes from a family who takes all those issues seriously,\u201d said James Holmes, who lives in the district and plans to vote for Finkenauer. \u201cHer brother [in-law] is a farmer, her dad was a union welder. I mean she\u2019s not just making this stuff up. This is real to her.\u201d\n\nState of the Race\n\nWith less than a week to go in the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats are hopeful that the district could be one that they flip in their favor November 6th.\n\nIowa\u2019s 1st district, comprised of 20 counties in the Northeast corner of the state, has had purple past. Former President Barack Obama won every county in the district in the 2008 presidential election and 17 counties in 2012.\n\nBut that all changed in 2016, with Trump carrying 18 counties -- flipping 15 that had supported Obama in 2012.\n\nThough polling has been limited for the race, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s House Forecast gives Finkenauer a 19 in 20 chances of winning -- a 95% chance.\n\nFinkenauer has also outraised and outspent Blum in the race. According to data from the Federal Election Commission, as of October 17th Finkenauer had raised $3.9 million and spent $3.3 million, while Blum raised $2.5 Million, spending $1.5 Million.\n\nBut Blum has been outspent and out-fundraised before, and the campaign, citing internal and external polls, says they\u2019ve seen a rally in the last weeks before the election that shows the race isn\u2019t over.\n\n\u201cWe are proud that, despite being outspent nearly 6 to 1, Iowa voters are not for sale to the millions of dollars pouring in from Hollywood and San Francisco to run attack ads against Rep. Blum,\u201d said Blum Campaign Spokesperson Alexah Rogue.\n\nAnd some Republicans view Biden\u2019s visit as a sign that the race is not as safe as Democrats would like a week before Election Day, as Iowa Republican Party Spokesperson Jesse Dougherty told ABC News.\n\n\"Joe Biden's visit a week before Election Day isn't a victory lap for Democrats - it's a rescue mission because Fred Hubbell and Abby Finkenauer's message of raising taxes isn\u2019t resonating with Iowans,\u201d Dougherty said. \u201cEven after outspending Republicans in nearly every race, Democrats haven't been able to break away and now they need Joe Biden to step in to save their losing message.\"\n\nFinkenauer\u2019s campaign brushed off the idea, saying the Vice President\u2019s stop to campaign for his friends isn\u2019t a sign of trouble\u2014just the campaign keeping their energy up in the last week of the election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited to have him here. Everyone in the room here indicates the excitement about having him here, and it\u2019s a fun event that\u2019s going to reflect the energy on the ground that we\u2019re seeing every day,\u201d said Kate Waters, a spokesperson for the Finkenauer campaign.\n\nBiden in Iowa\u2014Preview of 2020?\n\nBiden\u2019s visit to Iowa also raises questions about his futures plans\u2014and a possible 2020 run.\n\nMargery Tully came to the rally in her \u201cBiden for President\u201d shirt\u2014a souvenir from Biden\u2019s 2008 presidential bid.\n\nTully said that she would like to see a fourth run by Biden for the presidency.\n\nDarron Cummings/AP\n\n\u201cI think if you just boil it down, he\u2019s just a very good man, and everything else springs from that,\u201d Tully said. \u201cHis values are the old-fashioned values that we all believe in\u2014family, hard work, he just embodies all the spirit of the United State, the spirit of America. And he is just amazing. I count it as one of the highlights of my life that I got to meet him and work with him.\u201d\n\nAides to Biden had previously said that Iowa would likely not be on the Vice President\u2019s midterm travel schedule because of the hype a Biden visit to Iowa would draw.\n\nDespite crowds chanting \u2018Run Joe run!\u2019 while on the trail, Biden hasn\u2019t revealed his plans beyond 2020.\n\nBiden has previously said that he will make his decision on a presidential bid by January, but made no direct reference to the possibility in the state that holds the first presidential contest in the country.\n\nThough not a candidate \u2018at this point,\u2019 Biden has cultivated a campaign message centered on fighting for the middle class, which could be crucial to winning back blue-collar Democrats who voted for President Trump in 2016.\n\nBut while some attendees came out to the rally to see the former Vice President, that doesn\u2019t mean he can definitely count on their vote if he does run.\n\nBobbi Janssen and Chloe Howe\u2014who made t-shirts especially for the event referencing Biden\u2019s appearance on the NBC comedy \u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019 both said that while Biden was a \u2018delight,\u2019 they weren\u2019t prepared to commit to supporting Biden in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re focusing on our midterm elections, and then we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Howe said.", "Turkey's president says he will not permit what he called the seizing of natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nSpeaking at a naval ceremony Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would never accept such attempts \"excluding our country and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\"\n\nTurkey and the Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus\u2014who do not have diplomatic relations\u2014 are both planning hydrocarbon research in the Mediterranean Sea for natural gas reserves.\n\nA Turkish ship began explorations for oil and natural gas this week off the coast of southern Antalya province.

But long before the first plate of shakshouka was served, Shaya and his team focused on how to create an inclusive work environment different than the toxic restaurant workplaces exposed by the #MeToo movement.\n\nJust over a year ago, Shaya was part owner and executive chef of three restaurants in the Besh Restaurant Group, headed by New Orleans chef John Besh, including his James Beard-awarding winning namesake Israeli restaurant.\n\nThen a story in NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune detailed allegations of sexual misconduct in Besh's company, causing Besh to step down. Shaya wasn't personally accused of misconduct but the story detailed allegations of harassment at two of his restaurants. Shaya was quoted in the story about concerns he had over BRG's then-lack of a human resources department. Shaya has said that's what led to his firing \u2014 something Besh's company disputed. A messy legal battle ensued during which Shaya lost all rights to his namesake restaurant.\n\nFast forward to current day: Shaya sits at Saba discussing the policies and procedures Pomegranate has put in place to ensure a safe working environment.\n\nThe interview process includes questions way beyond whether a person has waited tables before ('What was the last gift you bought for somebody?'). Management holds 30- and 90-day chats with new employees and then every six months. The restaurants are closed Monday and Tuesday so everyone has a guaranteed two days in a row off.\n\nWomen populate high-profile roles including executive chef in New Orleans. About 60 percent of each restaurant's staff is women. They've adopted ideas from other restaurants including a system used by Erin Wade at the Oakland, California-based Homeroom to deal with sexual harassment and a code of conduct for guest chefs used by Raleigh, N.C.-based restaurateur Ashley Christiansen.\n\nService is limited during 2:30 to 4 p.m. so the staff can sit together for a meal, often accompanied by staff presentations to their co-workers. Some topics are work-related. But employees are also encouraged to share what interests them. During a recent session, cook Timmy Harris talked to the waiters, managers, and cooks about existentialism, Southern literature and author Walker Percy.\n\n\"It kind of drives home the point that this is a place for people to develop themselves. It's not just a restaurant. We're not just slinging pita,\" Harris said after.\n\nShaya said he can't talk much about what happened while working at BRG for legal reasons but says now that he and his wife own their company they're able to create the structure they want.\n\n\"Even in our restaurants someone will be inappropriate at some point,\" Shaya said. \"And I know that when that happens people are going to jump on it because people have really bought into the values.\"\n\nExperts say many issues have contributed to sexual misconduct in the restaurant industry, including a tipping structure that can inhibit servers \u2014 often women \u2014 from complaining about out-of-line customers, little training for managers and high turnover. Restaurants' small size \u2014 often family-owned or single units \u2014 has historically meant they don't have strong HR policies, said Juan Madera, an associate professor at the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management.\n\nAllegations of sexual misconduct at restaurants and the wider #MeToo discussion have been a \"wakeup call for restaurants,\" Madera said. He's hearing from restaurant associations and others who want to figure out how to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nRaleigh, N.C.-based chef and restaurateur Ashley Christiansen, who talked with Shaya about his new venture, says a restaurant's HR presence is as important as the food or the linen service. She says it's difficult to measure how much progress has been made across the industry since the growth of the #MeToo movement, but she sees cause for optimism.\n\n\"I feel like it's the thing I talk about more than food now, and I think that's a positive thing,\" she said.\n\nShaya says his new venture hasn't been without problems. He's fired one person who was cursing at another employee. But he's also been inspired by staff members calling out someone who makes an off-color joke or not tolerating negativity.\n\n\"We've taken it down to the very basics of kindness, and we stick to it and I feel that we've attracted a lot of people who believe in that,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.", "Pope Francis has decried the attack on pilgrims in Egypt, saying they were killed \"for being Christians.\"\n\nFrancis invited faithful in St. Peter's Square Sunday to pray with him for the seven slain as they were making their way to a remote Orthodox Coptic monastery.\n\nChristians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's population and have long complained about discrimination.\n\nFrancis voiced \"sorrow for the terrorist attack which two days ago struck the Coptic Orthodox church in Egypt.\"\n\nHe said he was praying for the \"pilgrims killed for the sole fact of being Christians,\" asking that those grieving be comforted.\n\nIn 2017, an attack on the same monastery killed 29 persons.\n\nOn Sunday, Egypt said security forces killed 19 militants in a shootout, including the gunmen suspected in Friday's attack.", "Two years after jogger Karina Vetrano was strangled and sexually assaulted along a running path in Queens, New York, the high-profile murder case is headed to trial.\n\nThe slaying was a mystery for six months, until Chanel Lewis, then 20, was arrested on what police described as a lieutenant's hunch.\n\nLewis, facing charges including murder and sexual abuse, has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAs opening statements begin Monday, here's a look back at the shocking crime:\n\nA mysterious murder\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2016, Vetrano, 30, went out for an uneventful jog in Howard Beach, Queens. Her father, Phil Vetrano, usually went with her, but he had an injury at the time, so that day, she ran alone.\n\nWhen she didn't come home that night, her worried father called police.\n\nWhile searching with the authorities that night, Phil Vetrano made a gruesome discovery, finding his own daughter dead.\n\nkarinavetrano/Instagram\n\nVetrano was severely beaten, lying face-down in 8-foot reeds, with her front tooth knocked out, her pants pulled down and her socks wet, said Robert Boyce, who was the NYPD chief of detectives at the time.\n\nBoyce called the brutal killing one of the most notable cases of his career.\n\n\"My thoughts were ... she was dragged through [a puddle of] water and then dragged off the path into the high reeds,\" said Boyce, who has since retired and become an ABC News contributor.\n\nHer phone was found thrown in the reeds about 15 to 20 feet from her body, Boyce said.\n\nCourtesy of Jackie Hartstein\n\nPolice recovered DNA from one unknown person on her cell phone, the back of her neck and her fingernails, he said.\n\nNo evidence was recovered from the sexual assault, he said.\n\nInvestigators put the DNA into the Combined DNA Index System -- or CODIS, which allows federal, state, and local labs to compare DNA profiles electronically -- but there was no hit.\n\nThe killing made headlines across the country as her grieving family pleaded with the public for help to solve the case.\n\nNYPD\n\n\"She lived more in her short 30 years than most people do in 10 lifetimes,\" Phil Vetrano told ABC News last year of his daughter.\n\n\"She had a bucket list at 26 years old and she actually accomplished and did most of those things on the list,\" he said, citing trips to Europe, a camel ride by the Great Pyramids and a trip to the Grand Canyon.\n\n\"She went everywhere ... nothing stopped her,\" he said. \"She was extraordinary.\"\n\nMatthew McDermott/Polaris\n\nA young man arrested\n\nDespite the recovered DNA, months ticked by without an arrest.\n\nThen in Feb. 2017, after police had received more than 250 leads and taken 600 DNA samples, a suspect was identified, after what authorities say was a lieutenant following up a lead.\n\nLewis, then 20, was taken into custody, one week after he was first approached by police about Karina Vetrano's killing.\n\nWABC\n\nLewis lived with his mother in East New York, Brooklyn, which borders Howard Beach, where Karina Vetrano was killed.\n\nNYPD Lt. John Russo first saw Lewis on the Brooklyn-Queens border three months before Vetrano was killed, police sources told ABC News at the time of the arrest.\n\nRusso thought he seemed suspicious and called it in, but Lewis left before a patrol car could respond, police sources said. The next day, a 911 caller mentioned Lewis by name and said he looked as if he was breaking into a Howard Beach property with a crowbar, police sources said.\n\n\u201c \u201d I never really meant to hurt her, it just happened.\n\nWhile working on the Vetrano case, Russo suggested taking a look at Lewis. Police tracked him down and say he gave a voluntary DNA sample, which matched DNA recovered from where Vetrano was found, police said.\n\nLewis had no prior arrests so his DNA wasn't in CODIS, said Boyce.\n\nLewis, who didn't appear to know Karina Vetrano, allegedly told detectives he \u201cjust lost it\u201d and strangled Vetrano after spotting her on the jogging path, according to a statement that prosecutors read aloud during his arraignment.\n\nVetrano \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Lewis allegedly told police. \u201cI was just mad at the time. I beat her to let my emotions out. I never really meant to hurt her. It just happened.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u201d He pleaded not guilty because he believes and knows that he did not commit this crime.\n\nAccording to Lewis' statement to detectives read by prosecutors at his arraignment, Lewis fought with Vetrano for about five minutes. He allegedly said he hit her repeatedly, knocking her out, prosecutors said.\n\nThe case heads to trial\n\nLewis, now 22, is awaiting trial at New York City's Rikers Island jail.\n\n\"Mr. Lewis is very optimistic,\" Rev. Kevin McCall of the National Action Network, a Lewis family spokesman, told ABC News. \"He pleaded not guilty because he believes and knows that he did not commit this crime.\"\n\nThe Legal Aid Society, which is representing Lewis, said in a statement, \"We have serious doubts about the collection of evidence and tactics employed by the NYPD leading to the arrest of our client. We\u2019re confident that the jury will critically examine the evidence and find that the government will not prove their case.\"\n\nChris Banks, Lewis' family spokesman, told ABC News they believe Lewis' confession was coerced.\n\nLewis' mother, Vita, said her son was religious and non-violent.\n\n\"I love my son,\" she told reporters last year. \"My son is friendly, God-fearing and would not hurt anybody.\"\n\nMcCall added that Lewis was quiet and a \"bright young man.\" He vowed to \"fight till the end\" for him.\n\nMeanwhile, Phil Vetrano, who told ABC News last year that he'd attend court each day, said his family \"will never let this go.\"\n\n\"We are there to stand for my daughter, who cannot stand for herself,\" he said.\n\nWhen she was alive, Phil Vetrano said his daughter lived her life to the fullest.\n\n\"She always enjoyed herself,\" he said. \"It should be an example to others to live your life, live every day as if it's your last day,\" he said. \"Because you don't know what 10 minutes from now is going to bring you.

Add Interest\n\nAt the core of a widely varied crush of races, voters are being asked to either ratify or reject President Donald Trump and his agenda. The stakes of the 2018 midterm elections only grew as a tense nation approached Election Day.\n\n\u201cThis is about more than issues. This is about who we are as Americans,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden said recently on the campaign trail.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentiment Trump would likely embrace.\n\nThe midterms are a nationwide referendum on Trump and his governance. They will be by far the most consequential marking point in the Trump presidency after a presidential election that rocked the nation.\n\nSusan Walsh/AP\n\nTrump has done what he can to place himself on the ballot -- sometimes literally saying that a vote for a candidate is a vote for him. But a referendum on Trump is likely to mean vastly different things in different parts of a bitterly divided nation.\n\nThe president\u2019s popularity with his base could keep and even strengthen the Republican Party in rural, blue-collar, and predominantly white swaths of the nation.\n\nThe fierce opposition to Trump could buoy Democrats in diverse, suburban and more highly educated areas that have been trending toward their party anyway.\n\nThat would amount to a socioeconomic and regional reordering of the nation\u2019s politics. The divisions exploited by Trump appear likely to only deepen the splits between red and blue portions of the country.\n\nAmong the dizzying array of potential outcomes is the very possible result of a split decision. It could mean a Democratic-controlled House yet Republican gains in the Senate -- with both outcomes largely because of the president.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nThat would most likely grind lawmaking to a halt in Washington, with subpoenas, investigations, and calls for impeachment replacing bills and laws as the main business of Congress for the next two years.\n\nMeanwhile, at the state level, Democratic governors and state legislatures could begin marching their governance leftward in advance of the 2020 elections.\n\nRaces for Congress and state offices are turning on so many issues that they\u2019re in danger of being defined by none of them.\n\nThis year\u2019s elections have been about health care, immigration, the Supreme Court, guns, treatment of women, voting rights, domestic terrorism, trade, jobs, taxes, foreign threats, climate change, corruption and even the possibility that malicious actors are trying to sway American electoral outcomes.\n\nBut if the midterms are about everything, they\u2019re really about one very big thing: Trump.\n\nTrump has scrambled politics and the norms that have governed it with a chaotic, freewheeling, and hard-right governing style. He has divided where his predecessors have sought to unite, and put himself in the middle of territories where previous presidents have tread lightly.\n\nThe president\u2019s closing message -- warning of threats of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants, mobilizing troops to the border, and musing about changing laws regarding citizenship -- fits with the divisive themes and fact-challenged assertions that have defined his time in office.\n\nYet it almost goes without saying that Trump wouldn\u2019t view even a Republican wipeout as a cause for introspection or a change in direction.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd, if he sees -- as seems likely -- Republican bright spots, after a campaign where his party has mostly lined up behind him, he will surely claim credit and use the results to amplify his message.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a close ally of the president who has been campaigning for GOP candidates, said that the range of hot-button themes means any broad takeaways from the midterms will be limited.\n\n\u201cThere are so many different issues out there that are important to different people,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s \u201cPowerhouse Politics\u201d podcast. \u201cI think the country is going to remain in a certain amount of political turmoil until we get to 2020.\u201d\n\nA president\u2019s party almost always suffers losses in midterm elections, Christie noted, and any results that run counter to that trend would be to the \u201cgreat credit of the president and what Republicans have done.\u201d\n\nThe midterms won\u2019t mark the end of any discussions or debates.

A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\nInsulting Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor of doing so can incite lynchings.\n\nPakistan's top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday of the charges carrying the death penalty, infuriating hard-line Islamists who held three days of nationwide protests demanding her execution. The enraged protesters torched scores of vehicles, blocked highways and attacked government and public property; a radical cleric also threatened to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi. The protests ended after the government agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi and allow her case to be reviewed.

He said that the government cleared blocked cities without any bloodshed.\n\n\"No government can tolerate a rebellion against the state,\" Chaudhry said.\n\nHuman Rights Minister Shireen Mazari tweeted that \"appeasement to 'avoid bloodshed' sends a dangerous message to non-state actors and undermines the concept of democratic peaceful protest.\"\n\n\"The State has to enforce Rule of Law, Constitution and stand by state institutions especially when they are targeted\" Mazari added.\n\nAlso Sunday, some two thousands supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami party held a protest march in southern port city of Karachi against the acquittal of Bibi but they remained peaceful.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad contributed to this report.", "Early voting numbers indicate a lot of new voters have taken to the polls already, but there\u2019s one cohort of Americans who hold particular power \u2014 and perspective \u2014 this year: 18-year-olds who are of voting age for the first time in 2018.\n\nAcross the country and across the issues, it\u2019s been a historic year for youth activism -- much of it geared toward getting constituents to the polls on Nov. 6.\n\nABC News has been following 18-year-old activists as part of a multi-month long series on teen voters and the events and influences that help shape their political identities.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nFor Eliot Flores, the importance of getting out to vote is magnified by his own inability to do so.\n\nThough he just turned 18, Flores can\u2019t vote in his home state of Texas because of his status as a DACA recipient. The heightened rhetoric around immigration -- a top issue for voters across the country -- has pushed him to volunteer on campaigns and educate those who can vote.\n\nAcross America, the 18-year-olds have also upped the conversation on other top-ticket issues.\n\nThe most visible movement was born out of Parkland, Florida, where students launched a nationwide campaign against gun violence after enduring one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. As 18-year-old survivor Delaney Tarr put it, \"I\u2019m voting for my own life and I\u2019m voting for the lives of so many others.\"\n\nArieyanna Williams, 18, is from Chicago. Along with the students from Parkland, Williams has broadened the conversation on school shootings to include daily gun violence in cities like her own.

Artis, who will vote for the first time in November, is focused on an issue that he says young people have particular ownership over because of how its impacts could drastically increase over their lives: climate change.\n\nHere\u2019s how the politics of 2018 have unfolded, from their perspective.\n\nBecause he can't vote, he relies on others\n\nJanet Weinstein/ABC News\n\nIn Texas, where Flores lives, it feels like politics are taking over everything, he said. But in the midst of trying to get his chosen candidate Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke elected, Flores is also on his own campaign of sorts -- one to get into college.\n\n\u201cI feel like they're both races for something important,\u201d Flores said.\n\nFor Flores, his personal campaign to attend college and his campaign efforts on behalf of O\u2019Rourke merge distinctly around the same thing: His status, and the statuses of thousands more, as recipients of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which President Donald Trump has already attempted to end.\n\n\"In my own life, I have to be constantly in competition with other students when it comes to scholarships, which are barely available to us as undocumented immigrants, or for acceptance into college. And when it comes to the Beto [O'Rourke] race, it's a race of who can get more votes,\" Flores said. Undocumented and DACA students are not eligible for federal financial aid, but in some states, like Texas, they're eligible for state aid.\n\n\u201cI feel like local political campaigns affect us more than presidential ones and since I'm here in Texas, and want to continue studying here in Texas, block walking for Beto is more personal because he supports immigration,\u201d Flores said.\n\nHis ties to the race are a constant reminder that he isn't able to show up to the polls and vote on Tuesday.\n\n\"By not being able to vote, we\u2019re really missing out,\" said Flores, who has lived in Texas for 15 years.\n\n\"We all have the incentive or the will to make a change or fight for our own future, but we\u2019re just not given the materials to do so sometimes,\" Flores said.\n\nStemming from Parkland, young people take on gun violence with political might\n\nInside the Florida state Capitol, before a crowd of her classmates and reporters, she first said, \"We know what we want, we want gun reform.\" Then Tarr, a senior at the time when a gunman opened fire inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February, added, \"This is to every lawmaker out there ... we are coming after you.\"\n\nTarr recited those words, and variations of them, at the March For Our Lives last spring, only a month after the shooting that took the lives of 17 students and teachers. During the summer as she made stops on the \"Road to Change\" and then again as the cohort of spirited teens traveled cross-country in the lead up to the midterm elections.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nSpurring marching, organizing and voting throughout 2018, Tarr and the Parkland students spent this election year overcoming the political apathy often attached to young people, and showing the potential force of America's youngest voters.\n\nTarr, now 18, will be voting for the first time this year.\n\nFrom the onset of their movement, she and the young band of change-makers made the point that in order to make a difference on gun violence, the political makeup of this country must shift. History must be made.\n\n\"Soon we will be given the ability to vote, and we will vote them out,\" Tarr affirmed from the Florida state legislature in the immediate days after the shooting.\n\nBetween graduating high school and delaying college for a semester, Tarr and her classmates, like David Hogg, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, Ryan Deitsch, Jaclyn Corin and Alex Wind, traveled to 80 communities in 24 states in 60 days to register young voters as part of their efforts to get out the vote. Younger generations -- Generation X, Millenials and post-Millenials -- now make up the largest share of the electorate, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nGalvanizing a historically lackluster 18- to 29-year-old voting bloc might lead to unprecedented turnout on Nov. 6, and the Parkland students could have reverberating impacts on the political landscape of Florida, a key swing state, and Congress.\n\nBut this year's midterm elections, as Tarr puts it, are \"just the beginning.\"\n\n\"For us, Tuesday is both a culmination of all of our work these past few months, and just the beginning of our future to come,\" she told ABC News. \"We work nonstop because we have to, and this is finally our time to create change where it matters: in the polls. We\u2019re following through on our words, our promises, and taking a stand in the best way we know how.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s pretty powerful,\" she said.\n\nNew wave of young voters push for gun control in midterm elections\n\nCourtesy Arieyanna Williams\n\nIn wake of school massacres, church shootings, and ongoing gun violence in the inner cities of places like Chicago, young voters are channeling their pain at loved ones lost into efforts to get voters to the polls.\n\nFor Williams, 18, the painful memory of her murdered father's bloody handprints on the wall of her aunt's home, is a constant source of pain and inspiration to help change gun laws and serve as a positive role model.\n\nWhen the Chicago-native isn't helping adolescent students at Mount Hope STEAM Elementary as a teacher's assistant or tackling freshman year at Michigan State University, she's busy urging college students on campus to vote on Nov. 6.\n\nWilliams feels close to her newly adopted home state and plans to stay in Michigan to vote due to her classes.\n\n\"I plan to have Detroit in my mind when I vote,\" Williams told ABC News. \"Detroit is like Chicago and Flint still needs clean water. They need people to take action.\"\n\nWilliams said she wants to vote for a candidate who shares similar views on gun reform and admires Congressman Beto O'Rourke.\n\n\"Beto is one of those figures I look up to. He's the ideal candidate,\" Williams said. \"Beto has done what other candidates should be doing.\"\n\nWilliams has been an advocate for gun control since high school having lost her father and other loved ones to gun violence. To continue the legacy she left behind as a Peace Warrior in Chicago, Williams joined the \"March for Our Lives\" chapter on campus to continue her activism for gun control legislation.\n\nShe walked alongside hundreds of thousands of people for the March for Our Lives movement where she met dozens of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivors turned activists.\n\nDespite her continuous efforts, Williams questions if all of the work she and others have put in will suffice in the long run.\n\n\"I wonder if the work we're actually doing is going to be worth it,\" Williams said.\n\nUndeterred by her personal doubts, Williams will continue her advocacy and desires to initiate an organization on campus for minorities to vocalize the daily issues they face.\n\nBut, the first thing on her agenda is to vote in the upcoming midterms and she knows one thing for certain -- who and what she intends to vote for.\n\n\"I will vote for hope,\" Williams said. \"Hope will be the person I vote for.\"\n\nYoung people urge votes for urgency on climate change\n\nThis is Zero Hour\n\nYouth activists have been working to keep climate change on voters' radar this year, arguing that young people should vote for candidates who want to take on environmental issues more aggressively than the current administration.\n\nAfter rallies around the country in July the group \"This is Zero Hour\", led by some activists who aren't even old enough to vote, has been holding get out the vote events and voter registration drives around the country to educate voters on climate issues.\n\nArtis, one of the founders who is now a freshman at Brown University in Rhode Island, said he voted for the first time in the primary and will be voting again on Tuesday. He said climate change is the number one issue for him and he hopes to convince more of his peers that the environment is connected to other big issues like health care and racial injustice.\n\n\"I think that it's super important to try to educate people on the different intersections between the issues and hopefully if people see climate change as the connecting piece they'll definitely weigh it more as a more important issue,\" he told ABC News.\n\nAnother organizer, Sohayla Eldeeb, isn't even old enough to vote in her home state of Florida but said she's been working to raise awareness of climate change issues among voters, especially since the recent UN climate report was released.\n\nArtis said that even the candidates he supports in Rhode Island could improve their climate policies and he hopes to work with them after the election.\n\nFor example, he plans to contact Gov. Gina Raimondo's office to get involved in her work on plastics pollution if she's re-elected but also to encourage her to speak out against fossil fuels. He said that after the election \"This is Zero Hour\" plans to focus on educating the next generation of voters on climate issues.\n\n\"We're hoping that the people that we are targeting will come to see climate, climate change, climate policy, new energy policy, as something that they're looking at more closely and talking to their elected officials right now,\" Artis said. \"Without that participation, especially young people, asking questions about these things candidates aren't going to change the way that they campaign.\"", "Greek geological experts say two new aftershocks have hit the western Greek island of Zakynthos, but no damage has been reported.\n\nThe Athens Institute of Geodynamics reports that the tremors occurred within seven minutes of each other.

At the same time, the ruling party has been solidifying its support in rural areas.\n\nRunoff elections for the mayor's office in 649 cities, towns and municipalities took place between the top two vote-getters from the first round of voting conducted two weeks ago.\n\nDuring the Oct. 21 first round voting, Law and Justice strengthened its position in regional assemblies but lost mayoral races outright in Warsaw, Poznan and Lodz to a centrist pro-European Union coalition led by the Civic Platform party.\n\nWith Sunday's runoffs, the opposition took at least three more of Poland's most biggest cities.\n\nIn the Baltic port city of Gdansk, incumbent Pawel Adamowicz with Civic Platform won re-election to a sixth term. The Ipsos polling agency projected support for Adamowicz at nearly 65 percent and support for the Law and Justice candidate, Kacper Plazynski, at just over 35 percent.\n\nIn Krakow, another long-serving mayor, Jacek Majchrowski, held off a challenge from Law and Justice challenger Malgorzata Wassermann. Majchrowski was also projected to win nearly 65 percent of the vote.\n\nIpsos' projections had the mayor's job in the city of Kielce going to another opposition candidate: Bogdan Wenta, one of the best athletes in the history of Polish handball and a former coach of the national team.\n\nThe results have highlighted deep political differences between residents of Poland's cities, which have been liberal centers of opposition to the Law and Justice-led government, and of the country's rural heartland, which remains largely supportive of the party despite its conflicts with the EU.\n\nOfficial returns were not expected until Monday at the earliest.\n\nThe local elections kicked off a string of votes that will be crucial for Poland's course, including the May election choosing European Parliament representatives, the national parliament vote in fall 2019 and a presidential election in the spring of 2020.\n\nLaw and Justice won 34 percent of the total regional assembly votes two weeks ago, and the opposition coalition nearly 28 percent. One of the primary jobs of the assemblies is choosing how to spend EU subsidies.\n\nIf the ruling party maintains the level of support it received two weeks ago, it would appear to be well-poised to remain in power after the 2019 national elections, but without the parliamentary supermajority it is seeking to pursue constitutional amendments.", "German Chancellor Angela Merkel will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on French soil, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in London for a ceremony in Westminster Abbey with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut while Germany's leaders visit the capitals of its wartime enemies, at home there are no national commemorations planned for the centenary of the Nov. 11 armistice that ended the four-year war that left 17 million dead, including more than 2 million German troops.\n\nNext week, the German parliament is holding a combined commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the first German republic, the 80th anniversary of the brutal Nazi-era pogrom against Jews known as Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Almost as an afterthought, parliament notes there's also art exhibition in the lobby called \"1914/1918 - Not Then, Not Now, Not Ever.\"\n\nMore than just being on the losing side of World War I, it's what came next that is really behind Germany's lack of commemorative events.\n\nFor Germany, the Nov. 11 armistice did not mean peace like it did in France and Britain. The war's end gave rise to revolution and street fighting between far-left and far-right factions. It also brought an end to the monarchy, years of hyperinflation, widespread poverty and hunger, and helped create the conditions that brought the Nazis to power in 1933.\n\nThe horrific legacy of the Holocaust and the mass destruction of World War II simply overshadows everything else in Germany, said Daniel Schoenpflug, a historian at Berlin's Free University's Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute. His new book, \"A World on Edge,\" explores the immediate aftermath of the war through individual perspectives.\n\n\"One can't reduce it to the simple fact that one country won the war and the other lost,\" Schoenpflug said. \"Germany is a country that draws practically its entire national narrative out of the defeat of 1945\" \u2014 and not the defeat of 1918.\n\nBy contrast in Turkey, which was also on the losing side in World War I, the war's end produced a similar collapse of the Ottoman empire and a war of independence, but also gave rise to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic.\n\nIn Germany, even though the end of World War I is now viewed through the prism of Hitler and the Holocaust, in the immediate postwar period there actually was a time of utopianism, with movements promoting idealistic visions of peace and democracy, Schoenpflug said.\n\nYet on the other side of the political spectrum, utopianism on the right also gave birth to fascism, he said.\n\nAnd as initial euphoria over the end of World War I faded, hopes for the future quickly gave way to feelings of resentment at the reparations and conditions imposed on Germany by the victorious powers. The Nazis and right-wing nationalists were able to garner support by pushing the \"stab-in-the-back\" myth, which held that Germany's civilian leaders sold out the army by agreeing to the Nov. 11 surrender.\n\n\"There was a war of dreams, a clash of utopias\" between the right and the left, Schoenpflug said.\n\nAlthough there aren't any national commemorations in Germany marking the war's end, individual events are planned, including an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. A special World War I religious service is also being organized by the German Bishops Conference at the Berliner Dom cathedral.\n\nAnd in addition to German officials taking part in events in London and Paris, the Foreign Ministry said they and their British counterparts have worked together to coordinate the ringing of church and secular bells around the world on Nov. 11 to mark the war's centenary.\n\n\"The bells will ring at midday to commemorate the more than 17 million victims of World War I and as a call for understanding and reconciliation across borders,\" the ministry said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis version corrects the spelling of Westminster Abbey.", "Thousands of Iranians rallied Sunday in commemoration of the 39th anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, just hours before the re-imposition of all American sanctions lifted by the nuclear deal.\n\nThe 444-day crisis after the fall of the U.S.-allied shah transfixed America, as nightly images of blindfolded hostages played on television sets across the nation. Ultimately, it would be President Jimmy Carter leaving office that saw all 52 captive American diplomats freed.\n\nSunday, hard-liners vented their rage at a new American president, Donald Trump, who pulled America out of the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor that the United Nations says Tehran still honors. With crippling sanctions on Iran's vital oil industry set to take effect Monday, Iran's already-anemic economy likely will suffer more, though politicians and protesters struck a defiant tone.\n\n\"Today the Iranian nation will show that Mr. Trump is too small to be able to bring Iran to its knees,\" said Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker.\n\nThe annual commemoration marks when student demonstrators climbed over the fence at the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, angered about Carter allowing the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to receive cancer treatment in the United States. The students soon took over the entire, leafy compound. A few staffers fled and hid in the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran before escaping the country with the help of the CIA, a story recounted in the 2012 film \"Argo.\"\n\nWhile the commemoration annually sees American flags burned and cries of \"Death to America\" rise up, it also has a carnival-like atmosphere for the students and others taking part. Some waved massive inflatable ballistic missiles. Others held signs lampooning Trump, including images of him contorted into a Nazi swastika or as a missile chasing after a dove. Some even showed a smiling silhouette logo of Kentucky Fried Chicken's founder Col. Harland David Sanders crossed-out, equating the chain once in Iran before the Islamic Revolution to decadent Americanism.\n\nGen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander-in-chief of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, gave a speech vowing that Iran \"can overcome this economic war and failure of the sanctions project is imminent.\"\n\n\"Mr. Trump! Never threaten Iran because moans of the frightened U.S. forces in Tabas can still be heard,\" Jafari said, referring to the failed American mission to rescue the hostages known as Operation Eagle Claw.\n\nHe added: \"Still the moans of your terrified sailors and your British friends in Persian Gulf can be heard,\" referring to times the Guard have held sailors captive there.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its rial currency now trades at 145,000 to one U.S. dollar, down from when it traded 40,500 to $1 a year ago. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nThe United States says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles. However, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton, the president's national security adviser, both have made public statements supporting overthrowing Iran's theocratic government.\n\nThe symbolism of the looming sanctions coming wasn't lost on protesters Sunday.\n\n\"Sanctions have always existed and we are used to them,\" said one woman protester who only gave her name as Torabi. \"The tougher they take it out on us, the more resistant we become.\"\n\nTrump himself has embraced the sanctions as he faces a tough mid-term election in the U.S. that could change the balance of power in Congress. He tweeted out an image of him with the caption: \"Sanctions Are Coming,\" a play on the HBO television series \"Game of Thrones.\" Hard-liners in Iran responded with a similar image of Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force reading: \"I Will Stand Against You.\"\n\nAnother demonstrator Sunday, Jamshid Zarei, waved a banner in English quoting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying: \"America can't do a damn thing.\"\n\n\"The Iranian people are feeling the economic pressure at their dinner tables and we complain about this, but it will not make Iranian people give up Islam, their values and the (Islamic) Revolution because of rising prices,\" he said. \"Anyone who thinks that way is really a fool.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

That\u2019s not for us, folks,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have to come in legally.

And then I did it again. And then it was just, I mean, you have kind of got to know me. I'm cool, calm, and that's the only way to be after you do something like that.\"\n\nThe Red Raiders led 31-28 at halftime, but Bowman didn't return and ended up in a Lubbock hospital, just as he did Sept. 29 when he first sustained the lung injury in a loss to West Virginia.\n\nBowman, who the school said would be held overnight for observation, returned two weeks ago against Kansas. Coach Kliff Kingsbury said Bowman re-injured the lung on a run near the goal line late in the first half.\n\nThe Big 12 passing leader's absence changed the flow of a game that was looking a lot like the 65-59 touchdown fest the Sooners won in Lubbock two years ago.\n\nTexas Tech punted three straight times without getting a first down after Jett Duffey replaced Bowman again, just as he did against the Mountaineers.\n\nBut Duffey did get the Red Raiders moving again, and they pulled within two on his 4-yard scoring pass to Zach Austin on fourth down midway through the fourth quarter. But Robert Barnes intercepted the 2-point conversion pass and returned it 98 yards for two points and a 44-40 OU lead.\n\n\"I should have found a way to get him more comfortable at the start of the second half than I did,\" Kingsbury said. \"Once he got in a rhythm and he was competing and doing his deal, he played really well.\"\n\nBoth of Murray's interceptions were by Vaughnte Dorsey, on his first throw of the game and again on OU's second possession.\n\nBowman threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to T.J.

It's hard to gauge the progress of the unit because of Bowman's injury. The Red Raiders finished with 473 total yards.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders will wonder what might have been if Bowman had been able to return in the second half. He was 21 of 26 for 227 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Still, Duffey showed persistence similar to first time Bowman was injured. He threw for two scores and ran for one that gave Texas Tech a shot at an onside kick with 1:05 remaining. It failed.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOU could move up a spot because of No. 4 LSU's shutout loss to top-ranked Alabama. The rest of the teams ahead of the Sooners won impressively and the two teams behind them had closer-than-expected victories.\n\n30-YARD MARCH-OFF\n\nReceiver CeeDee Lamb stopped Oklahoma's momentum when he was called for a personal foul and unsportsmanlike conduct after catching a pass for a first down at the Texas Tech 7. The 30 yards in penalties led to a punt when the Sooners were on the verge of a second straight touchdown drive and their first double-digit lead in the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOklahoma: Bedlam is at home against Oklahoma State next Saturday.\n\nTexas Tech: Another big home game against No. 15 Texas next Saturday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Top25", "Thousands of bone-tired Central Americans set their sights on Mexico City on Sunday after making a grueling journey through a part of Mexico that has been particularly treacherous for migrants seeking to get to the United States.\n\nAn estimated 4,000 migrants are in the Gulf state of Veracruz, where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments. The day's 124-mile (200-kilometer) trek was one of the longest yet, as the exhausted migrants tried to make progress walking and hitching rides toward the U.S. border still hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe migrants now aim to regroup in the Mexican capital, seeking medical care and rest while they await stragglers. The caravan has found strength in numbers as it meanders north, with townspeople pouring out to offer food, water, fresh clothes and replacement footwear.\n\nIn a thundering voice vote Sunday night, about 1,000 migrants at the gymnasium in Cordoba voted to try to make it to Mexico City on Monday, which would be their longest single-day journey yet since the caravan began \u2014 178 miles (286 kilometers) by the shortest route.\n\nEarlier Sunday, the bulk of the caravan streamed into the colonial city of Cordoba, in Veracruz's sugar belt, where they were greeted with Caribbean music and dance. Meanwhile, bleary eyed migrants who had charged ahead to Mexico City expressed gratitude for the support of their fellow travelers, saying they would not have had the strength or courage to get so far on their own.\n\nA few arrived at a large outdoor stadium in the capital, where they lounged on bleachers and watched Mexicans play soccer. City employees piled hot food onto Styrofoam plates for the migrants, some of whom had hopped freight trucks to speed their arrival to the capital. Others rested inside a church in the city of Puebla.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border the caravan will aim for eventually, or how many may splinter off on their own.\n\nMost of the migrants said they remain convinced that traveling as a large mass is their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\"We think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,\" said Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, traveling with his wife, Jessica Fugon. \"Others went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.\"\n\nMynor Chavez, a 19-year-old from Copan, Honduras, was also determined to continue.\n\n\"I have no prospects (in Honduras). I graduated as a computer technician and not even with a degree have I been able to find work,\" he said of his home country.\n\nManuel Calderon, 43, a migrant from El Salvador, lifted his shirt to show scars from two bullets he said pierced his torso in his home country. He dreams of making it back to the U.S., from which he was deported a little more than two years ago.\n\nOn the road, Calderon was received by ordinary Mexicans lending a hand. Catalina Munoz said she bought tortillas on credit to assemble tacos of beans, cheese and rice when she heard the migrant caravan would pass through her tiny town of 3,000 inhabitants. She gathered 15 others to help make the tacos, fill water bottles and carry fruit to weary travelers on the roadside.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing around 1,000 people who want to reach the U.S. border. That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 people, entered Mexico early last week. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, and largest, group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nMexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journey.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated Saturday that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry says 2,793 migrants have pursued refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nUncertainty awaits migrants who reach the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans.

The Democrats\u2019 lead has closed from 14 percentage points in August and 13 points in October to now 8 points.\n\nSee PDF for full results, charts and tables.\n\nThe GOP has seen some shoring in its base, including non-college white men and rural residents, as well as among independent women. At the same time, vote intention remains high in typically low-turnout Democratic groups, including young voters, nonwhites, liberals, Democrats and those who lean toward the party.\n\nWith Trump pushing to turn out his core support groups, the election stands more than ever as a referendum on his presidency. That\u2019s not ideal for the Republicans: Trump\u2019s 40 percent approval rating is the lowest for a president ahead of his first midterm elections besides Harry Truman\u2019s in 1946. Trump\u2019s average approval from inauguration to his first midterm is the lowest on record.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nTrump's approval rating matters because 59 percent of likely voters say it\u2019s highly important to them to vote for a candidate who shares their opinion of Trump -- down from a high of 64 percent in October, but still a solid majority. And Trump\u2019s approval among likely voters is 9 points underwater.\n\nThe Democratic lead in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, in no way makes the election outcome a done deal. One concern for the Democrats is their over-vote in safe districts. In those districts rated solid or likely Democratic by the ABC News Political Unit, Democratic candidates lead by a vast 67-29 percent. In solid or likely Republican districts, it\u2019s a 58-35 percent Republican lead. And in leaning or toss-up districts, it\u2019s close: 49-44 percent for Democratic vs. Republican candidates.\n\nFurther tea leaves come from the 14 percent of registered voters who, as of late last week, said they\u2019d already cast their ballots. They split exactly evenly: 49-49 percent. Notably, 44 percent of them are senior citizens, generally a more pro-Republican group.\n\nTurnout\n\nConventional wisdom holds that to do well the Democrats need at least a 10-point margin among registered voters before a midterm election, because their support drops among those who actually turn out. But anti-Trump motivation may change the equation. Unusually, the Democrats don\u2019t lose ground in the shift from registered voters -- where they are +7 points -- to likely voters, at +8.\n\nVote intention is high across the board: 80 percent of registered voters say they\u2019re certain to vote this year or already have done so, compared with 65 percent at this point in 2014 and 71 percent in 2010. But it\u2019s unusually high, in particular among Democratic groups. Three-quarters of nonwhites say they\u2019re certain to vote, compared with 49 percent at this point in 2014. And 69 percent of registered voters age 18-39 say they\u2019ll certainly vote, up from 44 percent in the last midterms.\n\nSimilarly, intention to vote is up by 24 points among liberals and 18 points among moderates compared with 2014, vs. 6 points among conservatives. It\u2019s up 9 points among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, compared with a 20-point jump among leaned Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are less advantaged here than it might seem, because registration rates are lower in some of their core groups, particularly young adults and nonwhites. Regardless, having inspired these higher vote intentions, the challenge for Democrats, as always, is to actually turn them out.\n\nGroups\n\nGroup-level vote preferences matter as well as turnout, and here, as noted, the GOP has seen some gains. The party\u2019s candidates led by 27 points among non-college white men last month; it\u2019s 39 points now. Surprisingly, they had only 9- and 10-point leads among rural residents in August and October, while it\u2019s 33 points today. And the party\u2019s improved since last month among white Protestants, evangelical and non-evangelical alike.\n\nThere\u2019s also a change among women; they went from 25- and 22-point Democratic margins in the last two ABC/Post polls to 14 points now, while men continue to divide evenly. The shift chiefly is among rural women. Suburban women, for their part, favor Democrats by 11 points, same as October but down from 21 points in August.\n\nAP\n\nAnother notable change comes among independent women, who now divide about evenly among Democratic and Republican House candidates, 43-41 percent, after a 33-point Democratic preference in October. This reflects more conservatives and whites, and fewer liberals and nonwhites, in the ranks of independent women. It\u2019s produced a tighter contest among independents overall, now dividing 48-41 percent between the Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCountervailing changes on the Democratic side have been slighter, leading to the somewhat closer contest overall.\n\nIssues\n\nAs noted above, health care is key to the Democrats\u2019 prospects; they lead in trust to handle the issue by 50-34 percent, a 16-point margin that\u2019s unchanged from last month. Moreover, health care now leads the list in salience --\u2013 78 percent call it highly important in their vote choice, numerically (albeit not significantly) ahead of the economy, 76 percent.\n\nAt the same time, in the face of Trump\u2019s focus on immigration, trust to handle that issue has moved slightly from a clear Democratic advantage last month, 50-39 percent, to a divided 47-42 percent now. Republicans lead, 49-39 percent, in trust to handle the related issue of border security. Sixty-seven percent call immigration highly important in their vote (it was 70 percent last month), while 59 percent say the same about border security, ranking it sixth in a list of seven issues. It\u2019s the first time ABC/Post has asked about trust to handle border security, but Fox News had +14 and +11 Republican results in June and September, and the Post had Trump +10 over the Democrats on the issue in July \u2013 all indicating no change, despite the president\u2019s recent focus on a so-called caravan of migrants from Central America.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAs reported Friday, the Democrats have a 15-point lead in trust to handle reducing divisions between people and groups (rated highly important to 69 percent of respondents). Their biggest advantage, a vast 32 points, is in trust to handle global warming, though comparatively few, 48 percent, call this highly important in their vote.\n\nThere\u2019s a close division, 45-41 percent between Republicans and Democrats, in trust to handle taxes. It\u2019s typically a concern for the Republicans when the Democrats are competitive on this issue -- and a 9-point GOP advantage exists in trust to handle the economy.\n\nFocusing on health care as the top issue, it\u2019s notable that the Democratic advantage is similar among men and women. It disappears among seniors, who split evenly, widens among college-educated adults, and is +16 points for Democrats in the suburbs. But it flips to +24 points for the Republicans in rural areas. Political independents favor the Democrats in trust to handle health care by a 20-point margin.\n\nThere are differences on the virtually as-important issue of the economy. Women divide in trust on this issue while men favor the GOP by 22 points. Young adults, the Democrats\u2019 best age group, only divide evenly, while seniors go +17 points for the Republicans. So do suburban voters and independents, both by 14 points.\n\nAttitudes on the issues also are useful to view in profile, by vote preferences. Among those who say that health care is highly important in their vote, there\u2019s a 57-37 percent Democratic lead in House vote preferences, and it\u2019s identical among those who prioritize reducing divisions among people and groups. The GOP has a 22-point lead, 59-37 percent, by contrast, among those who call border security highly important in their vote. It\u2019s essentially a dead heat among those who focus on the economy, immigration and taxes. And it\u2019s a whopping +56 points Democratic among those who call global warming highly important in their vote for Congress.\n\nThe economy\n\nThe economy is worth another look, as 65 percent of all adults say it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, compared with just 38 percent heading into the 2016 presidential election and 27 percent before the 2014 midterms. One reason it doesn\u2019t accrue all that much to the Republicans\u2019 benefit is that there\u2019s a lot of partisanship in this view. It\u2019s 86 percent among leaned Republicans vs. 52 percent among leaned Democrats.\n\nAnother factor is that folks are a lot less likely to say they are doing better financially now compared with when Trump took office. Just 25 percent say they\u2019re better off; few are worse off, 13 percent, leaving 60 percent saying they\u2019re in about the same shape.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nIt\u2019s reflected in vote preferences. Among \u201cbetter off\u201d voters, 87 percent favor Republican congressional candidates. Among those who are worse off, 86 percent favor Democrats. And the majority who say they\u2019re in the same shape back Democrats as well, by 62-30 percent.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Oct. 29-Nov. 1, 2018, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,255 adults, including 1,041 registered voters. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.0 points for the full sample and 3.5 points for the sample of registered voters, including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 32-25-35 percent among all adults, and 33-27-34 percent among registered voters, Democrats-Republicans-independents.\n\nThe survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, New York, with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt Associates of Rockville, Maryland. See details on the survey\u2019s methodology here.", "Former President Barack Obama praised Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly on Sunday for being willing to break with his party, telling a roaring crowd at a rally in the state that \"you don't want just a yes man.\"\n\nDonnelly has sounded more like President Donald Trump while trying to persuade voters in the conservative Midwestern state to grant him a second term. He's angered some Democrats by tacking to the right in recent weeks and embracing some of Trump's pet priorities, such as building a border wall with Mexico.\n\nBut Obama told voters during the rally in Gary that Donnelly \"tries to do right by people\" \u2014 not just his party \u2014 and noted he supported the Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul passed under Obama.\n\n\"Joe Donnelly and I didn't agree all the time. But Joe always let me know where he stood and I knew what he believed in and that he always was focused on: 'What's the best thing for the Hoosiers that he served?'\" Obama said. \"He was honest and he was direct. So you can count on that. That's what you want. You don't want just a yes man all the time.\"\n\nObama's stop was sandwiched between his successor's trips to the state Friday and Monday on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\nFor Braun, a businessman who has campaigned as a steadfast Trump ally, the current president's appearances in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne are no-brainers in a state he won two years ago by 19 points. But for Donnelly, who frequently touts how often he votes with Trump, the Obama rally was a little more complicated.\n\n\"If he does need to inoculate himself from some of his firmer conservative rhetoric, it's a pretty effective way to do it,\" said Christina Hale, a former state lawmaker and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nObama has proven a polarizing figure with independent and Republican voters and is credited with some of Indiana's rightward political shift, even though he won the state in 2008. To win in Tuesday's election, Donnelly not only needs high turnout from his party's base but also must peel off some moderate Republicans and independents.\n\nThat's why Sunday's rally in Gary, a heavily African-American city that has more in common with the Democratic stronghold of nearby Chicago than deep red parts of the state, could prove strategic. The northwest Indiana region supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, and driving turnout there on Tuesday will be critical for Donnelly.\n\nA spokesman for Braun, Josh Kelley, said Donnelly was \"doubling down on the liberal resistance movement\" by campaigning with Obama.\n\nObama criticized Republicans for passing a tax bill that benefited the wealthy, and for trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions provided through the Affordable Care Act. And without mentioning Trump's name, he told the crowd they could return the country to a kinder, less divisive kind of politics.\n\n\"On Tuesday you can vote for politics that is decent and honest and lawful and tries to do right by people like Joe Donnelly does,\" he said, adding at one point that his voice was growing hoarse from all his campaigning in recent days.\n\nTrump was keenly aware of Obama's visit, which he mentioned Friday during an event at an Indianapolis-area high school.\n\n\"It's no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\" Trump said as the crowd jeered. He later added: \"We don't want to go back to the Obama days.\"\n\nAs a red-state Democrat, Donnelly has had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly defeated Republican Richard Mourdock in 2012, when the former state treasurer said a woman who gets pregnant from her rapist is carrying a \"gift from God.\"\n\nDonnelly has walked a delicate line since then, often frustrating his own party and Republicans alike with the votes he takes.\n\nTrump was having none of it on Friday, tying Donnelly to \"radical left\" figures in the party who are widely reviled by the GOP base.\n\n\"This Tuesday I need the people of Indiana to send a message to Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and the radical Democrats by voting for Mike Braun,\" Trump said as the crowd erupted in boos. \"I'm really speaking more to the television cameras than to you because I don't think we have too many Donnelly voters. Anybody going to vote for Donnelly in this room?\"\n\nThe boos grew even louder.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSlodysko reported from Indianapolis.", "A Florida teenager has been charged with first-degree premeditated murder after he allegedly strangled his mother to death and buried her in a church fire pit after an argument about his D grade, according to police.\n\nThe boy, 15, confessed to killing of his mother, Gail Cleavenger, 46, according to Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood.\n\nThe teenager appeared in juvenile court on Sunday along with two 17-year-old co-defendants who were charged as accessories after the fact to first-degree premeditated murder.\n\nIt is not clear yet whether the teenagers will be charged as adults, and none of the defendants have entered any pleas.\n\nThe attack took place early Friday morning after Cleavenger called her husband -- the boy's stepfather -- who was on a business trip in Washington State, and informed him about her son\u2019s D grade and the subsequent argument, according to police.\n\n\u201c \u201d She was a mom.

Its VIP guest list includes prime ministers and other leaders from Russia, Pakistan and Vietnam.\n\nThe United States, fighting a tariff war with Beijing, has no plans to send a high-level envoy.\n\nXi's government is emphasizing the promise of China's growing consumer market to help defuse complaints Beijing abuses the global trading system by reneging on promises to open its industries.\n\n\"This says, look, we're not a global parasite that is creating massive deficits, we are buying goods,\" said Kerry Brown, a Chinese politics specialist at King's College London.\n\nThe event also is part of efforts to develop a trading network centered on China and increase its influence in a Western-dominated global system.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his \"American first\" trade policies that threaten to raise import barriers to the world's biggest consumer market loom in the background.\n\nExporters, especially developing countries, want closer relations with China to help \"insulate themselves from what is happening with Trump and the U.S.,\" said Gareth Leather of Capital Economics.\n\nChina has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports, which rose 15.9 percent in 2017 to $1.8 trillion. But none address the U.S. complaints about its technology policy that prompted Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American imports.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as \"Made in China 2025,\" which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields, ambitions that some American officials worry will undermine U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nTo keep the economy growing, China needs to nurture its consumer market and that requires more imports.\n\nBut foreign companies say regulators are still trying to squeeze them out of promising industries and that they face pressure to hand over technology.\n\nThe Shanghai expo \"will be of little consequence to U.S. and other companies unless its pageantry is matched by meaningful and measurable changes in China trade practices,\" Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in an email.\n\nSome companies might get a brief sales boost, \"but its long-run impact will be defined by China's willingness to end many of its unfair trade practices,\" said Jarrett.\n\nEurope, Japan and other trading partners have been leery of Trump's tactics but echo U.S. complaints.\n\nThey say Beijing improperly hampers access to finance, logistics and other service industries. European leaders are frustrated that Beijing bars foreign acquisitions of most assets while its own companies are on a global buying spree.\n\nWriting in a Chinese business magazine, the French and German ambassadors to Beijing appealed for changes including an end to requirements that foreign companies operate in joint ventures with state-owned partners. They called for an overhaul of rules they say hinder companies from profiting from and protecting their technology.\n\n\"We encourage China to address these issues through concrete and systematic measures that go beyond tariff adjustments,\" Ambassadors Jean-Maurice Ripert of France and Clemens von Goetze of Germany wrote in the magazine Caixin.\n\nChina already is the No. 1 trading partner for all its Asian neighbors, though a big share of the iron ore, industrial components and other goods it buys are turned into smartphones, TV sets and other goods for export.\n\nTariff cuts announced over the past year were aimed at giving Chinese consumers better access to foreign goods. Chinese leaders emphasize those include anti-cancer drugs and other medical products. But many are specialty goods such as high-end baby strollers, avocados and mineral water that don't compete with Chinese suppliers.\n\nThe Shanghai expo also gives Beijing a chance to repair its image following complaints about its \"Belt and Road\" initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe.\n\nGovernments including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have scrapped or scaled back projects due to high costs or complaints too little work goes to local companies. Sri Lanka, Kenya and other nations have run into trouble repaying Chinese loans.\n\n\"It's become too associated with debt and China getting what it wants,\" said Brown. \"They are trying to get out this more positive message that China is open for business.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nChina International Import Expo: https://www.ciie.org/zbh/en/", "A pickup truck lurched off a road in western Wisconsin Saturday and hit a group of Girl Scouts picking up trash in a ditch, leaving three girls and one adult dead and critically injuring a fourth girl, police said.\n\nSgt.

He identified the driver as Colton Treu, 21, of Chippewa, Falls, Wisconsin.\n\nSokup said Treu will be charged with four counts of homicide through the negligent use of a vehicle. Sokup said the crash happened before a hill and there were no blind spots.\n\n\"The area is not an unsafe area,\" he said.

The pickup was heading north and crossed over a lane and went into the ditch, striking the group.\n\nThe girls were in the fourth grade at Halmstad Elementary School in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune quoted a relative of a girl in the troop who was not injured as saying. The Girl Scouts were all wearing bright safety vests and were accompanied by several adults.\n\nTwo of the girls and the woman were pronounced dead at the scene.

If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" Trump says in the video. \"I told them, consider it a rifle.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Saturday.\n\nThe tweet was posted just days after clashes between Nigerian soldiers and Shia Muslims once again turned deadly.\n\nSince earlier this year, protesters have frequently flooded the streets of Nigeria's capital, Abuja, to demand the release of Ibrahim Zakzaky, the jailed leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN). The movement, which is headquartered in the northern city of Zaria, has become an outspoken advocate for Shiite Muslims in a country dominated by its Sunni counterparts.\n\nZakzaky has been in federal custody since December 2015, when Nigerian security forces killed hundreds of his followers. The Shiite cleric was held without charge until April and now remains detained as he's accused of murder relating to the 2015 violence, sparking an uproar among his followers.\n\nLast weekend and on Monday, security forces sprayed bullets and tear gas at supporters of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria as the group marched on the outskirts of Abuja. Nigeria's defense spokesman, Brigade General John Agim, said in a statement that the demonstrators wounded soldiers with rocks, damaged military vehicles, blocked traffic and tried to overrun a military checkpoint that leads into the federal capital territory.\n\nSix protesters were killed, according to Agim, who said troops came under \"unprovoked attacks\" that were \"planned and premeditated\" by demonstrators.\n\n\"In all these attacks, the IMN was the aggressor while the military only acted in self-defense,\" Agim said in the statement Thursday.\n\nAfolabi Sotunde/Reuters\n\nHowever, an investigation by Amnesty International found the body count to have been much higher.\n\nAt least 45 supporters of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria were killed by security forces on Saturday and Monday, as the group held two days of \"peaceful gatherings\" around Abuja, according to the London-based international human rights watchdog.\n\n\"We have seen a shocking and unconscionable use of deadly force by soldiers and police against IMN members. Video footage and eyewitness testimonies consistently show that the Nigerian military dispersed peaceful gatherings by firing live ammunition without warning, in clear violation of Nigerian and international law,\" Osai Ojigho, executive director of Amnesty International Nigeria, said in a statement Wednesday. \"Those injured were shot in different parts of the body \u2013 head, neck, back, chest, shoulder, legs, arms \u2013 and some of them had multiple gunshot wounds. This pattern clearly shows soldiers and police approached IMN processions not to restore public order, but to kill.\"\n\nAmnesty International lambasted the Nigerian military's \"horrific use of excessive force\" and said researchers have \"strong evidence\" that security forces wielded automatic firearms during Monday's protest.\n\n\"It seems the Nigerian military are deliberately using tactics designed to kill when dealing with IMN gatherings. Many of these shootings clearly amount to extrajudicial executions,\" Osai Ojigho said. \"This violent crackdown on IMN protesters is unjustified and unacceptable. They were perfectly within their rights to hold a religious procession and protest and there was no evidence they posed an imminent threat to life.\"\n\nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria issued a statement Thursday expressing concern about the \"deaths resulting from clashes between Nigerian security forces and members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria.\"\n\n\"We urge Government of Nigeria authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the events and to take appropriate action to hold accountable those responsible for violations of Nigerian law,\" the embassy said. \"We urge restraint on all sides.\"\n\nAfolabi Sotunde/Reuters\n\nOn Friday morning, the Nigerian Army appeared to react to Amnesty International's allegations by tweeting the video of Trump's remarks, along with the caption, \"Please Watch and Make Your Deductions.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Army later deleted the tweet, but not before various news outlets and U.S. officials had seen it.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted an image of the Nigerian Army's tweet with the video of Trump, and called the tweet \"sickening.\"\n\nTrump later walked back his comments, saying troops \"don't have to fire.\"\n\n\"I didn't say shoot,\" the president told reporters on Friday, when pressed on his remarks the previous day. \"But they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time.\"\n\nNicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNigerian Army spokesman Brigadier General Texas Chukwu did not respond to ABC News' requests Friday for comment on the tweet and why it was taken down.\n\nNigeria's defense spokesman, Agim, told ABC News he believes the army was responding to Amnesty International's criticism by \"using Mr. Trump's video to justify the shooting.\"\n\n\"What did the biblical David use to kill Goliath? I believe you know that he uses stone,\" Agim said. \"I don't think you expect soldiers to fold their hands and watch the protesters run over them.\"\n\nIn response to the Nigerian Army's since-deleted tweet, Osai Ojigho of Amnesty International Nigeria said the West African nation's government \"must hold its security forces accountable\" rather than engage in \"preposterous competition over who does a better job of violating human rights.\"\n\n\"Basic human rights are not subject to whims of the world\u2019s leaders,\" Osai Ojigho said in a statement Saturday.\n\nABC News' Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.", "In a speech that alternated between appeals to national and local audiences, President Donald Trump urged Montanans to vote out incumbent Democratic Sen.

We can't even find apprentices right now, or laborers, and there's a huge need for [a] work force, but I think they should be legal. I don't think they should just come across the border.\"\n\nTrump also hailed the deployment of thousands of active-duty U.S. military personnel to the border, praising them and then lauding the addition of barbed wire at parts of the border.\n\n\u201cWe have our military on the border. And I noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today, barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also reiterated phrases from the past to describe the caravans, three of which have mobilized so far and are making their way through Mexico.\n\n\u201cThese are bad people \u2014 as I say bad hombres,\" Trump said. \"There are some bad hombres in that group. So they came out with a list of 300 really bad ones, really bad ones. They\u2019re in there.\u201d\n\nThe \"list\" he referred to was a statement from the Department of Homeland Security stating that over 270 of the thousands of individuals in the various caravans have criminal histories, including gang membership and crimes involving robbery and sexual assault.\n\nHe also warned of additional caravans forming in Central America. \u201cNow they have worse caravans actually being formed. It\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nTrump mocked TV pundits who say he should be talking about the booming economy instead of stoking fears about what he has called an \u201cinvasion\u201d on the southern border.\n\n\u201cCNN is telling me how to run the campaign, but in the meantime, I\u2019m president and they\u2019re not,\u201d he said.\n\nNot everything was about Democrats and the media. The president talked up the strong economy, evident in a record-low unemployment rate, higher year-on-year earnings and steady job growth at the beginning of his remarks.\n\nBut immigration was the issue he kept returning to, despite the fact that Montana has one of the lowest percentages of undocumented immigrants of any state, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey. Yet, despite having such low numbers of illegal immigrants, most Montanans that ABC News spoke to said the issue was at the top of their minds for this election cycle.\n\n\u201cImmigration\u2019s left our country unsafe. It\u2019s taken jobs away from workers,\" Todd Green, who runs a high-end stereo equipment business in Three Forks, about 30 miles from Bozeman. \"I have no problem with legal immigration. Bring in legally as many workers as we need. But as far as people breaking the law, who come here, it\u2019s not right.\"\n\nDuring the speech, Trump riffed on reports that a little-known accuser of Justice Brett Kavanaugh had recanted her allegations of sexual assault. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley referred the woman, Judy Munro-Leighton, to federal investigators.\n\nHe also suggested that other accusers may follow suit. Christine Blasey-Ford, who testified under oath before the Judiciary Committee about her allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her, has maintained her account of events. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cShe lied about the story. About rape. She lied,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then we\u2019re supposed to sit back and take it. And supposing he didn\u2019t get to be [a Justice], he\u2019s a tremendous man. And what about the others... when are they gonna say what happened?\u201d\n\nThe rally marked Trump's fourth trip to Montana this election cycle. He acknowledged that it has much to do with his personal animus toward Tester, who as the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee expressed concerns about alleged inappropriate behavior by Trump\u2019s VA secretary nominee, Admiral Ronny Jackson. The allegations prompted Jackson to withdraw from consideration.\n\n\u201cHe tried to destroy Admiral Ronny Jackson. Who is the most clean-cut, wonderful person you\u2019ve ever met,\" Trump said. \"He tried to destroy him and I\u2019ve never forgotten it, and honestly, it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019ve been here so much.\"\n\nFor Montanans who were there to see Trump, though, there are different reasons to oppose Tester.\n\nJon has not done the job that he's supposed to have been doing for the 12 years he's been there now,\" Tom Buckmaster, a resident of Bozeman, told ABC News. \"It's time; we need a change.\"", "A Florida science teacher was arrested after two students he was having separate sexual relationships with realized what was going on and told his wife, according to documents in the case reviewed by ABC News.\n\nCorey French, 30, was charged with unlawful sexual activity with certain minors and unlawful intercourse with a minor -- at his house, the school and one of the girl\u2019s stepmother\u2019s house, according to a school district investigative report released this week.\n\nOne of the victims was 16 and the other 17 when they were sleeping with French, law enforcement officials said in a statement released in September.\n\nIn a subsequent court appearance, French pleaded not guilty and was released on bail.\n\nThe pair of now former students at Neptune Beach\u2019s Duncan Fletcher High School refused to press charges against French, and he resigned from his position at school in May.

A president who often battles his own party would face a far less forgiving opposition.\n\nOn the flip side, if Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate, that's not only a victory for the GOP but also a validation of Trump's brand of politics and his unconventional presidency. That result, considered less likely even within the White House, would embolden the president as he launches his own re-election bid.\n\nWhite House aides insist the president doesn't spend much time contemplating defeat, but he has begun to try to calibrate expectations. He has focused on the competitive Senate races in the final days of his scorched-earth campaign blitz, and he has distanced himself from blame should Republicans lose the House. If that happens, he intends to claim victory, arguing his efforts on the campaign trail narrowed GOP losses and helped them hold the Senate, according to a person familiar with Trump's thinking who was not authorized to discuss White House conversations by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has been testing out other explanations \u2014 pointing to historical headwinds for the party of an incumbent president and complaining about a rash of GOP retirements this year. He told The Associated Press last month that he won't bear any responsibility should Democrats take over.\n\nAt a rally in West Virginia on Friday, a defiant Trump brushed off the prospect of a Democratic House takeover. \"It could happen,\" he said, adding, \"Don't worry about it. I'll just figure it out.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his staff has begun preparations to deal with a flood of subpoenas that could arrive next year from Democrat-controlled committees, and the White House counsel's office has been trying to attract seasoned lawyers to field oversight inquiries.\n\nShould they take the House, Democrats are already plotting to reopen the House intelligence committee's investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. Other committees are plotting aggressive oversight of Trump's administration and his web of business interests. Some Democrats are looking at using the House Ways and Means Committee to obtain copies of the president's tax returns after he broke with decades of tradition and withheld them from public scrutiny during his campaign for the White House.\n\nA slim Republican majority in the House would also present challenges, likely inflaming simmering intraparty disputes. First among them would be a potentially bitter leadership fight in the House to replace retiring Speaker Paul Ryan. But a narrowed majority would also exacerbate divisions over policy \u2014 and continued unified control could leave the GOP facing the blame for gridlock.\n\n\"Clearly there's an awful lot on the line in terms of the legislative agenda,\" said Republican consultant Josh Holmes. \"The prospect of a Democratic controlled House or Senate puts a serious wrinkle in getting anything through Congress.\"\n\nSome in the White House think losing to the Democrats might actually be preferable. They view Democrats' eagerness to investigate the president as a blessing in disguise in the run-up to 2020. They view House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a potent foil for Trump and believe they can tag the party responsible for Washington dysfunction.\n\nAri Fleischer, George W. Bush's press secretary, said Democratic control of the House \"has both peril and promise for the president.\"\n\n\"The peril is subpoenas, investigations, legal bills and headaches,\" he said. \"The promise is Trump will have an easy foil to run against: Pelosi and Democratic leadership.\"\n\nWhite House aides have discussed floating popular legislative issues, such as infrastructure, to tempt Democrats and test the unity of the Democratic opposition.\n\nWhile keeping the House remains an uphill battle for the GOP, Trump and Republicans have tried to sell voters on the possibility of another two years of GOP control. They promised hard-line immigration policies and more tax cuts, arguing that Democrats would erase two years of progress.\n\nIn the closing weeks of the midterms, Trump has unleashed a no-holds-barred effort to boost Republicans as he dipped into the same undercurrents of unease that defined his 2016 campaign \u2014 from stoking fears about illegal immigration to warning of economic collapse if Democrats are victorious.\n\nBut a House loss will prompt GOP hand-wringing about the divides in the party and the struggles for moderate Republicans to run in the Trump era, as well as raise questions about whether the Democratic gains point to a path for presidential hopefuls in 2020.\n\nDemocratic consultant Jim Manley said Tuesday may reveal if Democrats are having any success recapturing white working-class voters in the Midwest who backed Trump in 2016.\n\n\"Trump is helping. He's becoming more and more radioactive,\" Manley said. \"There's a chance to try and win them back over.\"\n\nBut while the results may reveal weaknesses in the Republican coalition, midterm elections are very different than presidential years. Republicans were quick to point out that the party in power typically suffers defeats in midterms. Former President Barack Obama was, in his words, \"shellacked\" in 2010 and went on to win re-election in 2012.\n\nSaid Fleischer: \"In the aftermath, people will exaggerate its meaning and in two years' time, everything will have changed.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Trumpeter Roy Hargrove, a prolific player who provided his jazz sound to records across a vast range of styles and won two Grammys, has died at age 49, his manager said Saturday.\n\nHargrove died in New York on Friday of cardiac arrest stemming from a longtime fight with kidney disease, longtime manager Larry Clothier said in a statement.\n\nClothier said Hargrove \"was known just as intensely for his brimming fire and fury as he was for his gorgeous, signature balladry. Over and over, his sound attested to and sanctified his deep love for music. His unselfish timbre covered the waterfront of every musical landscape.\"\n\nMany of Hargrove's peers regarded him as the greatest trumpeter of his generation. Through his own bands and as a sideman, Hargrove brewed his jazz with African and Latin sounds, R&B, soul, pop, funk and hip-hop.\n\nHe led the progressive, genre-melding group The RH Factor, played in sessions for Common, Erykah Badu and D'Angelo, and collaborated with jazz giants including Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis.\n\n\"He is literally the one man horn section I hear in my head when I think about music,\" Questlove, drummer and leader of the Roots, said on Instagram Saturday. \"Love to the immortal timeless genius that will forever be Roy Hargrove y'all.\"\n\nA native of Waco, Texas, Hargrove was discovered by his fellow trumpeter Marsalis while Hargrove was playing at a performing-arts high school in Dallas. He went on to the Berklee College of Music in Boston and then transferred to the New School in New York, where he joined in jam sessions at jazz clubs in the evening. One of those clubs, the Blue Note, said on its Twitter account Saturday that Hargrove was a \"young master and friend gone too soon.\"\n\nHargrove released his first solo album, \"Diamond in the Rough,\" in 1990. He won his first Grammy in 1998 with his Afro-Cuban band Crisol for its album \"Habana.\" He then won another in 2002 for \"Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall,\" featuring a band he led with pianist Herbie Hancock and saxophonist Michael Brecker.\n\nQuestlove, who worked with Hargrove on several projects, said his improvisational skills were astonishing.\n\n\"I can't properly document how crucial and spot on Roy was with his craft man,\" he said. \"We NEVER gave him instructions: just played the song and watched him go.\"\n\nOther tributes flowed from the musical community as word spread of Hargrove's death.\n\n\"I have no words over the loss of my dear brother of 31 years,\" bass player Christian McBride said on Twitter. \"We played on a lot of sessions together, traveled a lot of miles together, laughed a lot together, bickered on occasion \u2014 and I wouldn't change our relationship for anything in the world.

But the other, named Bella, bolted and disappeared as the blaze bore down. The couple had no choice but to flee, and their home and much of the neighborhood in Redding, California, soon was reduced to ash.\n\nRhodes and her husband, Stephen Cobb, presumed Bella was dead. Devastated by their losses, they moved 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) to Rhodes' hometown of Anchorage, Alaska, to start over.\n\nNearly six weeks later, they got a call that left them gobsmacked: Bella was alive. Volunteers had put out a feeding station at Rhodes' burned-out property, staked it out after spotting the cat, and then trapped her.\n\n\"I started bawling,\" Rhodes said from Anchorage, where Bella was curled up in a corner sleeping. \"We were shocked. We were just so overjoyed and just hoping she was OK.\"\n\nRhodes and Cobb are among dozens of people who lost their homes in the deadly Carr Fire but had their lives brightened weeks or months later when their pets were found.\n\nA network of about 35 volunteers \u2014 called Carr Fire Pet Rescue and Reunification \u2014 is responsible for many of the happy endings, which continue more than two months after firefighters extinguished the blaze, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes and killed six people.\n\nThe group formed with the help of another volunteer animal group born out of the devastating Tubbs Fire, which killed at least 22 people and destroyed thousands of homes last year in wine country north of San Francisco.\n\nRobin Bray, a field coordinator for the Carr Fire group, said about 80 pets have been reunited with their families using social media and specially made kiosks in Redding where images of found pets are posted. Most are cats that have \"been through hell,\" she said.\n\nBray said each new reunion fuels her and the other volunteers, many of whom use their own money to trap and treat the animals.\n\n\"We've seen amazing things,\" Bray said. \"We're finding cats that were in a house and the owners presumed they had passed. The heat of fire breaks windows in houses and cats jump out and run and hide. They're survivalists.\"\n\nThe volunteers go to elaborate lengths to catch the animals, which often are traumatized and injured. Equipped with night-vision cameras, traps and lots of food for bait, the volunteers stake out an area where a missing pet has been spotted, waiting for the right moment to drop a trap.\n\nThey won a hard-fought rescue of a dog nicknamed Buddy on Oct. 27 after he had eluded capture for weeks. They tried luring him with steak and french fries, another dog and a pickup truck like the one his owner drove before finally nabbing him.\n\nIt was a two-woman, two-hour operation. One woman crawled on the ground and placed food under a trap and the other waited in a truck and pulled a rope to complete the capture.\n\nBray, a private pilot by day, once spent nearly seven hours trapping a cat. The wait was worth it, she said.\n\n\"So many of these people have lost everything,\" Bray said. \"The only thing they care about is finding their pet that they love. They want that hope back in their lives and we're trying to provide that.\"\n\nJessica Pierce, a Lyons, Colorado-based bioethicist who studies end-of-life issues involving humans and their pets, said losing a beloved animal and a home is a double whammy of grief.\n\n\"To then be reunited with a pet you thought was gone, that would be like getting a piece of your home back,\" she said. \"For many people, pets are a sense of home, and they identify home with a sense of comfort and peace.\"\n\nSteve and Susan Cortopassi were reunited with their cat, Big Ernie, on Oct. 3, more than two months after the fire started. Their other cat, Elsa, was found about three weeks after the fire, which destroyed their home of 30 years.\n\nThe Cortopassis had to evacuate in the middle of the night.

On Thursday, he took issue with Trump's characterization of the media as an \"enemy of the people,\" saying that a free press is essential to the \"cause of freedom.\"\n\nThe online essay was published in the final days before an election when Romney is knocking on doors and joining phone banks for local, state and congressional races in his adopted home state.\n\nThe next evening, he read scary stories to children at a corn maze in Lehi, Utah.\n\nHe and his wife, Anne, sat around a small bonfire with over 100 children and adults. Mitt Romney also judged a pumpkin pie-eating contest at Cornbelly's Corn Maze and Pumpkin Fest.\n\nRomney has crossed state lines in recent weeks to stump for Republican candidate Martha McSally in Arizona, where she's locked in a tight race for the Senate seat left open by Jeff Flake's decision not to run again.\n\nRomney has also helped with fundraising for Nevada Sen. Dean Heller's tight re-election campaign and Florida Gov. Rick Scott's run for the Senate.\n\nRomney's opponent, Democrat Jenny Wilson, also is working the phones and canvassing for her party's slate. She has criticized Romney's Arizona appearance as evidence that he's more focused on national politics.\n\nRomney's camp points to his meetings and campaign appearances with dozens of Utah officials. It's part of his effort to get out the vote and promote down-ballot candidates, said spokeswoman MJ Henshaw.\n\nThe two are vying for the Senate seat to replace Orrin Hatch, who is retiring from the Senate after four decades. The outgoing Republican helped convince Romney to run. Romney appears to be a shoo-in for the seat in the conservative state that hasn't sent a Democrat to the Senate since 1977.\n\nWilson is a member of the Salt Lake County Council and has a political pedigree as the daughter of a former mayor there.\n\nRomney is one of the most well-known faces in the state since running as the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party in 2012, as well as his work leading the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n\nHe moved to Utah full-time after his presidential loss to Barack Obama. While criticism of Trump has been a political liability for Republicans elsewhere, Romney is able to speak out because many voters are wary of Trump's bombastic style and comments about women and immigrants.\n\nArguing his high political profile would be a boon to Utah, Romney easily dispatched a rival Republican state lawmaker who forced him into a June primary.

But while most cough and colds are from viruses that might come and go without many complications, others, can be a little scarier. Croup, a cold-like infection that\u2019s common in kids, is one of those.\n\nInterested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nJim Harbaugh, head coach at the University of Michigan, recently spoke about croup on his podcast, \u201cAttack Each Day.\u201d On it, he talked about taking his two young children to the doctor for respiratory problems that turned out to be croup. His father had recommended a family remedy called mustard plaster \u2014 a paste made of dry mustard, flour and warm water \u2014 to help with cough and congestion. The doctor had never heard of this treatment, Harbaugh said.\n\nTreating croup can be a minefield of trial-and-error for people seeking real help. So here are some tips for treating croup.\n\nBut first, what is croup?\n\nCroup is a viral illness, most often brought on by the parainfluenza virus. It causes swelling and narrowing of the vocal box (larynx) and windpipe (trachea), resulting in cough, noisy breathing and congestion. Children with croup often have a loud, low-pitched barking cough, and make noise when they inhale (called stridor).\n\nThese symptoms normally last only a few days but a lingering cough can remain for up to three weeks. In many kids, it also tends to cause a low fever.\n\nCroup is most common in children ages 3 months to 5 years. In children over 8 years old and adults, however, the airways are large enough where the virus doesn\u2019t cause as much swelling, and croup acts more like the common cold.\n\nCroup is contagious, especially during the first three days of the illness \u2014 or until the fever is gone. Kids can generally go back to school once they feel better and the fever is gone. One tip: Remind your children to cover their mouths with the inside of their elbows when they cough, and to wash their hands regularly.\n\nMost children with croup can be cared for at home, but if it\u2019s severe, they may have difficulty breathing and should see a doctor.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nHow do you treat croup?\n\nCroup is a viral illness, so antibiotics are not recommended for treatment, as they only work on bacterial infections. Your child will get better as the virus runs its course, but in the meantime, here are some easy, safe and doctor-approved home remedies for relieving the cough and stridor associated with croup:\n\n1. Run the shower to steam up the bathroom. Allowing them to breathe in the warm, moist air will help relax the vocal cords and reduce the cough symptoms.\n\n2. Breathe in cold air to relieve stridor. Take your child outside (if it\u2019s cold out) or open the fridge or use a cool mist humidifier, and let them breathe in the soothing, cool air for a few minutes.\n\n3. Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Motrin) to treat fever. If their fever is over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, these over-the-counter drugs are your best bet. Use as needed, according to the directions.\n\n4. Use a saline wash to reduce stuffiness. If your child has a stuffy nose, you can try using a bulb syringe to get some of the mucus out. A few drops of nasal saline wash (a half-teaspoon of salt with 8 ounces of water) can be used to help loosen up the mucus, after which you can suction it out.\n\n5. Use honey to soothe the sore throat and cough. A teaspoon of honey can help soothe an irritated throat, thin out mucus and loosen the cough. Important note: Only do this if your child is over a year old.\n\n6. Drink fluids. As with all cold-like illnesses, make sure your child is staying hydrated and drinking enough liquids, such as water or Pedialyte. If they can\u2019t drink or keep anything down due to the coughing or difficulty breathing, they should see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\n7. Stay calm and wait it out. The more anxious or upset your child is, the worse the narrowing of the windpipe can get and the harder it can be for them to breathe.\n\nIf you\u2019ve tried all of this and your child continues to breathe noisily or have difficulty breathing, take them to the closest emergency room. Thy may need a dose of an oral steroid or a nebulizer breathing treatment to help bring down swelling. Some children may even need to be admitted to the hospital for closer observation, to make sure the swelling doesn't come back or get worse.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t I use?\n\nSome home remedies are better than others, but you can definitely skip these ones:\n\n1. Cold medicines. OTC medicines like DayQuil or Sudafed are not recommended for children under the age of 6 because they can actually be harmful. These medicines often contain a mixture of different medications that can cause excessive sleepiness or even suppress breathing.\n\n2. Vitamin C. These supplements have not been shown to reduce symptoms or the length of time of the cough.\n\n3. Zinc. These supplements also have not been shown to help with croup.\n\nSo what about Harbaugh\u2019s mustard plaster?\n\nThere\u2019s no available research to support the effectiveness of mustard plaster on treating cough or cold associated with croup. That said, it\u2019s still a widely used home remedy with lots of anecdotal evidence to back it up.\n\nBefore you go playing doctor at home, though, it\u2019s always recommended you check in with your child\u2019s pediatrician first.\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh is an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "A member of the U.S. armed forces was killed and another was wounded in an apparent insider attack on Saturday in the Afghan capital Kabul, according to Resolute Support, the NATO training mission in the country.\n\nInterested in Afghanistan?

On Oct. 18, an insider attack in Kandahar led to the death of two top Afghan security officials and also wounded Brigadier General Jeffrey Smiley, the top U.S. general in southern Afghanistan. Another attack four days later in western Afghanistan killed a Czech soldier and wounded two other Czech soldiers.\n\nThis latest attack is currently under investigation, NATO said, adding that additional information would be released as appropriate.", "When Paul Davis heard earlier this year that the complete remains of two Civil War soldiers had been uncovered recently at Manassas National Battlefield, mixed among severed limbs in a surgeon's pit, he immediately wondered: Could that be his great-great uncle William, who died at the Second Battle of Bull Run, but whose bones had been lost to history?\n\nFrom what he knew of his ancestor's death, it seemed possible. Davis had read letters that said William \u2014 a color sergeant in the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry Regiment, part of the Union Army's famed Iron Brigade \u2014 died after being taken by ambulance for treatment.\n\nUnfortunately for Davis, he may never find out.\n\nArmy officials rejected requests from several families to conduct DNA testing that might have enabled their identification before reburying the remains as unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery in September.\n\n\"The Army made the decision that the costs associated with obtaining, storing, and testing of the DNA from these two Unknown U.S. Soldiers was not justified due to the significant passage of time as the possibility of identifying comparator DNA is extremely unlikely,\" a statement from Army officials at the cemetery says.\n\nDavis said he finds the Army's stance insulting.\n\n\"Don't put someone in a box for eternity without their name if you have the ability to identify that person,\" said Davis, 64, of Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nDavis noted that the U.S. military has an entire department working to identify remains of service members, but the agency only investigates cases going back to World War II. He said he doesn't understand why the military's commitment comes with an apparent expiration date on older conflicts.\n\n\"There's a covenant that exists between our country and our soldiers: If they're lost, our country will try to find them, and if they're found, our country will try to identify them,\" Davis said. \"When a soldier makes the ultimate sacrifice in battle for his country, when does the commitment to bring him home end?\"\n\nThis discovery was unusual, and accidental. Countless unidentified soldiers were buried where they fell during the Civil War. National Park Service policy is to leave their remains in place, considering battlefields to be hallowed ground.\n\nThese bodies were discovered in 2014 when workers digging to install a pipeline uncovered human bones. Researchers eventually found nearly a dozen severed limbs, along with two full sets of remains. They were able to conclude the soldiers were members of the Union Army, based on uniform buttons found in the pit and a bullet lodged in the one man's femur, fired from a Confederate Enfield rifle.\n\nThe location corresponds with work done by surgeons in the battle's aftermath, as the Union medical corps sent ambulances to collect the wounded and treat those left lying on the battlefield who could be saved, said Douglas Owsley, an anthropologist with the Smithsonian Institution who examined the remains.\n\nOwsley said he does not dispute the Army's contention that DNA testing would be unlikely to identify the two individuals, because there could be many potential candidates with plausible claims like those put forward by Davis, given the large number of casualties at Second Bull Run.\n\nThe Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency already has a $144 million budget and 600 staffers working to identify tens of thousands of remains, and typically identifies about 200 service members a year. Making an exception in Davis' case could open the door to an even larger caseload by violating its firm rule against investigating pre-World War II conflicts.\n\nOwsley said some consideration was given to developing DNA profiles of the remains before they were reburied, but the Army opted against that as well, noting that Arlington was founded as a place to honor the Civil War dead, both known and unidentified.\n\n\"The Army feels strongly that the dignified burial of these two sets of remains is in keeping with the over 2,000 Civil War Unknowns who were killed in action near the national capital region and are buried at Arlington National Cemetery,\" the Army said in its statement.\n\nOwsley said it may be easier to identify the severed limbs. Surgeons were under orders to document amputations so that Army pensions could be issued to these wounded soldiers, and there are fairly extensive records of surgeries from the battle. Owsley said he hopes to preserve samples from the limbs, which are stored at the Smithsonian, but the Army has not yet agreed to such testing.\n\nDavis said every detail he learns about the case seems to jibe with his ancestor's story. He said no one at the Army was willing to look at his documents and other evidence corroborating the possibility that his ancestor has been unearthed.\n\nFor instance, Park Service officials said Davis' ancestor couldn't have been connected because he served in a Wisconsin regiment, and isotope testing \u2014 which can be done less expensively and more easily than DNA testing \u2014 indicated the two soldiers were likely from New England. But Davis said his great-great uncle lived in Maine before moving to the Midwest for work as a lumberjack.\n\nIndeed, a headstone in a Maine cemetery bears William Garcelon Davis' name, marking an empty gravesite. That's why Paul Davis wants his ancestor buried in Maine, even though he recognizes the honor of burial at Arlington.\n\n\"The ones who loved him, that's where they thought he belonged,\" Davis said.", "The Latest on the caravans of migrants making their way through Mexico to the United States (all times local):\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nMembers of the 4,000-strong caravan of Central American migrants winding their way toward the U.S. border lambasted Mexican officials for directing them northward through the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, calling it \"the route of death.\"\n\nThe group said in a statement that some migrants branched off on their own Saturday in the belief that they were near the metropolises of Puebla and Mexico City, where they aimed to rest and receive medical attention after three weeks on the road.\n\nA trek via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz takes the travelers through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments.\n\nAuthorities in Veracruz said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves.

Another contingent is trying to make additional headway by pushing to Tierra Blanca, Veracruz, which lies about 80 extra miles (128 kilometers) to the north.\n\nBut many appear to be growing increasingly angry with caravan organizers after confusion broke out regarding buses that would have taken migrants to Mexico City more quickly.\n\nOn Friday, the state governor of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz reneged on a brief offer to provide transportation.\n\nAlmost immediately afterward, Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes released a second video saying that it would not be correct to send the migrants to Mexico City because the city's water system was undergoing maintenance and 7 million of its people would be without water over the weekend.\n\nIn the lapse between the announcements, organizers told members of the caravan that buses would indeed be available.\n\nHuman rights activist Ernesto Castaneda said there's still a possibility that bulk transportation will be arranged for the group later Saturday.\n\nThe caravan is currently hundreds of miles from the closest U.S. border.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nThousands of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan through southern Mexico resumed their journey Saturday toward the United States by hitchhiking and walking along highways.\n\nA day prior, a state governor reneged on a brief offer to provide dozens of buses to take them to Mexico City more quickly.\n\nGov.

For the rest of you \u2013- enjoy your bonus hour.\n\nWhy do I feel out of whack?\n\nJanet Kennedy, PhD., clinical psychologist and founder of NYC Sleep Doctor, says the best strategy is to switch to the new time right away -- stick to the clock.\n\n\u201cSome people gain an hour of sleep the first night whereas others wake earlier because 6 a.m. feels like 7 a.m. Regardless, stick to your usual schedule and do not go to bed early the following night. Avoid napping and extra caffeine, which can make it harder to fall asleep at the 'right' time,\" Kennedy said. \"It can take up to a week to fully adjust, so don't be alarmed if you feel sluggish in the meantime.\u201d\n\nDaylight Saving Time is just an hour.

The best example of this is \"sleeping in,\" the weekend temptation we all face without the need to rise early for work or school. It comes with the trap to \"catch up\" on sleep.\n\nBut this is a myth, Robbins says.\n\n\u201cIf we delay our bed or rising time by even one hour our body goes into transition mode, trying to transition to a new time zone,\" Robbins said. \"The best way to recover from insufficient sleep is to keep your sleep schedule as consistent as possible. If you wake up at 6 a.m. during the workweek, you can sleep until perhaps 6:45 a.m. on the weekends but not much longer.\n\n\"Then pay back your 'sleep debt' with a power nap or better yet a siesta, which is a nap that is 90 minutes in duration in the afternoon,\" Robbins continued. \"This will allow you to recover from cutting sleep short during the week without negatively impacting your sleep schedule.\u201d\n\nI have little kids. They\u2019re not gonna sleep an extra hour, are they?\n\nChildren are acutely aware of changes to their sleep schedule. They will likely keep you honest and wake you up at their normal time!\n\nWhat this means for parents is that it will be important to resist the urge to stay up a bit later. Keep your regular bedtime, put the kids to bed at the regular time, and wake up at your regular time.\n\nWinter\u2019s coming. It\u2019s going to be darker when we wake up. How do we deal with that?\n\n\u201cDuring winter months we have evidence that we sleep longer. In some ways, this could be viewed as hibernation of sorts,\" Robbins said. \"Without access to sunlight, our bodies have less ability to fully understand when it should be alert and when it should be tired.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\n\"To ensure your circadian rhythm remains intact, go outside when the sun is out as often as you are able, and optimally first thing in the morning. This will trigger the alert phase of your circadian rhythm, then an afternoon walk -- even if it seems to be gray outside -- will help your sleep and wake phases stay intact,\u201d Robbins added.\n\nLook on the bright side, Robbins continued.\n\n\u201cColder temperatures can bring about a cozy atmosphere. Develop winter habits with your family that center around lighting candles or a fire and spending time together off of screens,\" she advised. \"This can offer tremendous health benefits that may counteract the drawbacks of less sunlight.\u201d\n\nWhat other sleep advice do you have about this annual event -- setting our clocks back?\n\n\u201cWith the change of seasons ... consider a bedroom refresh,\" Robbins added. \"Is your bedroom cozy and optimized for rest and relaxation? If not consider refreshing your mattress, pillows, or sheets.\"\n\nEric M.

With the U.S. midterm elections just a few days away, there are signs that they're making some headway, although they're still a very long way from winning the war.\n\nThat's because the effort risks running into political headwinds that , and Google find bad for business. Some even argue that the social networks are easy to flood with disinformation by design \u2014 an unintended consequence of their eagerness to cater to advertisers by categorizing the interests of their users.\n\nCaught embarrassingly off-guard after they were played by Russian agents meddling with the 2016 U.S. elections, the technology giants have thrown millions of dollars, tens of thousands of people and what they say are their best technical efforts into fighting fake news, propaganda and hate that has proliferated on their digital platforms.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has pulled a major reversal since late 2016, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg infamously dismissed the idea that fake news on his service could have swayed the election as \"pretty crazy.\" In July, for instance, the company announced that heavy spending on security and content moderation, coupled with other business shifts, would hold down growth and profitability. Investors immediately panicked and knocked $119 billion off the company's market value.\n\nThe social network has started to see some payoff for its efforts. A research collaboration between New York University and Stanford recently found that user \"interactions\" with fake news stories on Facebook, which rose substantially in 2016 during the presidential campaign, fell significantly between the end of 2016 and July 2018. On Twitter, however, the sharing of such stories continued to rise over the past two years.\n\nA similar measure from the University of Michigan's Center for Social Media Responsibility dubbed the \" Iffy Quotient \" \u2014 which gauges the prevalence of \"iffy\" material on social networks \u2014 also shows that Facebook's \"iffiness\" has fallen from a high of 8.1 percent 1n March 2017 to 3.2 percent on Monday. Twitter iffiness has also fallen slightly, from 5.6% in November 2016, to 4.2 percent on Monday.\n\nEven at these levels, fake news remains huge and may be spreading to new audiences. A team led by Philip Howard, the lead researcher on Oxford's Computational Propaganda effort, looked at stories shared on Twitter during the last 10 days of September 2018 and found that what it called \"junk news\" accounted for a full quarter of all links shared during that time \u2014 greater than the number of professional news stories shared during that time.\n\nThe team defined junk news as sources that published deceptive or incorrect information, often in an ideological or conspiratorial way, while failing to meet criteria such as professionalism, bias, credibility and style.\n\nWhile the Oxford analysis didn't produce similar figures for Facebook, the researchers did map out how junk news circulates on the social network and found that conspiracy theories and other misinformation once confined to a \"hard right\" audience are now shared more freely among mainstream conservatives as well. (Left-leaning users have also developed a taste for junk news, the Oxford team found, but it represents only a small fraction of the material they share on Facebook.)\n\nSuch studies offer imperfect pictures of what's actually happening on social networks, since the services typically don't offer researchers untrammeled access to their data. Twitter, for instance, takes issue with the Oxford study, noting that it used a public feed of tweets that doesn't reflect the filtering Twitter does to remove malicious or spammy material.\n\nTamping down misinformation, of course, is anything but easy. Adversaries are always finding new ways around restrictions. It can also be hard to distinguish misinformation and propaganda from legitimate news, especially when world leaders such as President Donald Trump are regularly disseminating falsehoods on social media.\n\nPolitics also complicates matters, since the social-media companies are anxious to avoid charges of political bias. When Facebook, Google's YouTube and, eventually, Twitter all banned the conspiracymonger Alex Jones for various violations of their terms of service, Jones and his allies immediately claimed he was being censored. President Trump chimed in a few weeks later with a parallel charge, claiming without evidence that Google and other companies were \"suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good.\"\n\nTwitter, in fact, charges that researchers such as the Oxford team define \"junk news\" too broadly. The group, for instance, classes conservative sites such as Breitbart News and the Daily Caller as \"junk\" by its criteria. Twitter argues that banning \"media outlets that reflect views within American society\" would \"severely hinder public debate.\"\n\nSome critics charge that the very advertising-based business model that made Zuckerberg rich is also perfectly suited for propagandists. Services like Facebook and Twitter \"sustain themselves by finding like-minded groups and selling information about their behavior,\" Dipayan Ghosh, a former privacy policy expert at Facebook and Ben Scott, senior adviser at New America, wrote in a Time Magazine op-ed earlier this year. \"Disinformation propagators sustain themselves by manipulating the behavior of like-minded groups.\"\n\n\"They don't self-regulate,\" said Dora Kingsley Vertenten, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California and CEO of research consulting firm Trenton West. \"They just want to make a profit, and what they have done to date is not nearly enough.\"\n\nReally fixing the misinformation problem might require big changes to how these services work. Users started spending less time on Facebook after it made changes to make its service more \"meaningful\" to users, involving less scrolling through posts and more interactions with friends, the company said.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has hinted that he is open to drastic changes , but he hasn't yet said what they might look like.

And to the mounting alarm of others on all parts of the spectrum, they want to bypass the usual process.\n\nThey're pushing for an unprecedented Constitutional convention of the states. While opponents are afraid of what such a convention would do, supporters say it is the only way to deal with the federal government's overreach and ineptitude.\n\n\"They literally see this as the survival of the nation,\" said Karla Jones, director of the federalism task force at the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, which represents state lawmakers and offers guidance and model legislation for states to call a convention under the Constitution's Article V.\n\nAmong the most frequently cited changes being sought: amendments enforcing a balanced federal budget, establishing term limits for members of Congress, and repealing the 17th Amendment, which put the power of electing the Senate in the hands of the public instead of state legislatures.\n\nFor the past 229 years, constitutional amendments have originated in Congress, where they need the support of two-thirds of both houses, and then the approval of at least three-quarters of the states.\n\nBut under a never-used second prong of Article V, amendments can originate in the states. Two-thirds of states \u2014 currently, 34 \u2014 must call for a convention at which three-fourths of states approve of a change.\n\nThe particulars of such a convention, though, are not laid out. Do the states have to call for a convention on the same topic? Must they pass resolutions with similar or identical wording? The U.S. Supreme Court may have to decide whether the threshold of states has been reached and, ultimately, the parameters of a convention and the rules delegates would be governed by.\n\nA bill introduced in the U.S. House last year would direct the National Archives to compile all applications for an Article V convention.\n\nSome believe enough states have already passed Article V resolutions, pointing to votes over the years across the country on a variety of potential amendment topics. Others contend the highest possible current count of states is 28 \u2014 the number of states with existing resolutions on the most common convention topic, a balanced budget amendment. Others point to lower total counts based on states that have passed near-identical resolutions.\n\nRegardless, proponents of a convention believe they have momentum on their side more than any other time in American history.\n\n\"That second clause of Article V was specifically intended for a time like this, when the federal government gets out of control and when the Congress won't deliver to the people what they want,\" said Mark Meckler, a tea party leader who now heads Citizens for Self-Governance, which runs the Convention of States Project calling for an Article V convention. Legislation promoted by the group calls for a convention focused on the federal government's budget and power, and term limits for office holders. It has passed 12 states and one legislative chamber in another 10.\n\nThe Convention of States Project says 18 other states are considering the measure.\n\nMeckler, like other backers of a convention, believes there's no reason why it can't be limited in scope. Others aren't so sure. Four states that previously had passed resolutions calling for a convention have rescinded them in recent years, often citing wariness over a \"runaway\" convention.\n\nKaren Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, has sounded alarms on a possible convention and portrays the coast-to-coast emergence of resolutions on the issue \"a game of Whack-a-Mole.\"\n\n\"This is the most dangerous idea in American politics that most people know nothing about,\" she said.\n\nThere are proponents of an Article V convention on the left who see it as a possible way to overturn the Citizens United campaign finance decision, pass the Equal Rights Amendment and otherwise address what they see as a stacked deck that has helped the GOP get an unfair advantage. But with more red states than blue ones, it seems an unlikely path to abolishing the Electoral College, reengineering apportionment of the Senate or otherwise devising a democracy they believe is more reflective of the American public's views.\n\nIt's not the first time a convention has been proposed.\n\nIn the 1890s, when the Senate refused to take up the issue of direct election of senators, states pursued a convention, falling just short. Eventually, the 17th Amendment passed in the usual way, fulfilling that aim. In the 1960s, states sought a convention over a Supreme Court decision dictating how legislative districts were apportioned.\n\nBut convention opponents have always feared that once one has been launched, it could tear up the Constitutions in all sorts of ways.\n\nWhat's to stop a convention from passing an abhorrent affront to the Founders, like an outright ban on Muslims, asks constitutional law professor Michael Klarman of Harvard University. He points to a 2009 Swiss referendum that resulted in outlawing the construction of minarets, the towers found beside mosques.\n\nJones said such fears are \"misguided\" and that \"so many stopgaps\" would prevent a \"runaway\" convention.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSedensky can be reached at msedensky@ap.org or https://twitter.com/sedensky", "An ethnic minority Tamil party in Sri Lanka said Saturday that it will support a no-confidence motion to be brought against the country's former strongman whose controversial appointment as prime minister has plunged the country into a political crisis.\n\nThe Tamil National Alliance's announcement comes as divergent political parties in Parliament try to thwart Mahinda Rajapaksa from strengthening his position as prime minister. The party said in its statement that Rajapaksa's appointment and President Maithripala Sirisena's suspension of Parliament was undemocratic.\n\nIn the statement, the party accused Rajapaksa's government of offering money and ministerial posts to \"induce\" opposition lawmakers to cross over. A Tamil National Alliance lawmaker, S. Viyalendran, defected on Friday and was appointed as Rajapakasa's deputy minister of regional development.\n\nNo specific bribery allegations against Viyalendran were made, but the party condemned him for \"being a part of this conspiracy.\"\n\nThe United National Party led by ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced plans to propose a no-confidence vote against Rajapaksa as soon as Parliament reconvenes.\n\nThe Tamil party's 15 votes could give Wickremesinghe's camp a decisive edge over Rajapaksa.\n\nSo far, six members from Wickremesinghe's United National Front have defected to Rajapaksa's government.\n\nSome 121 lawmakers were expected Saturday to support the no-confidence vote, according to a count by The Associated Press.\n\nSirisena dismissed Wickremesinghe and his Cabinet last week and later announced that he acted in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him.

Palitha Range Bandara, a United National Party lawmaker, has said that he was offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio if he crossed over.\n\nLawmakers from Rajapaksa's party have denied the allegations.\n\nSirisena is under mounting pressure by his political opponents, rights groups and foreign governments including the United States and European Union to summon Parliament and end the crisis.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.

Or do they back Republicans in hopes that the economy will continue thriving under the majority party?\n\nA healthy economy has at least complicated their decision and blurred the outcome of the midterm elections . On Friday, the government reported that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October. And the unemployment rate stayed at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nAt stake Tuesday is control of the House and Senate, both now led by Republican majorities. Steady economic growth and a vigorous job market haven't been the clincher in prosperous areas that were once seemingly safe Republican turf. Partly as a result, many analysts say Democrats stand a good chance of regaining control of the House even while Republicans maintain the Senate.\n\nThe ambivalence of many voters is evident in the Philadelphia suburbs of Bucks and Chester counties. The landscape of rolling hills is dotted by shopping plazas and luxury car dealerships, by fieldstone and stucco houses that fill cul-de-sacs. Residents are likelier than the country as a whole to have college degrees, and the median family income is about $100,000.\n\nInterviews with about a dozen people elicited a range of sentiments about whether and how the economy might affect their votes. For some, all that matters is the energized pace of job growth, which began under President Barack Obama and has continued under Trump.\n\nOthers, some of them lifelong Republicans, are finding their loyalties tested by a president who embraces tariffs, disparages refugees and attacks political opponents. With Pennsylvania also holding votes for governor and a Senate seat, many said they were willing to split their votes between the parties.\n\n\"I'm not a fan of Donald Trump,\" said 85-year-old Ross Kershey. \"He doesn't respect checks and balances. But he's certainly done well for the economy.\"\n\nA retired high school history teacher, Kershey is teaching a course on the Supreme Court at Immaculata University in Malvern, a suburb of Philadelphia. Those court cases were fresh in his mind as he sipped tea and ate pancakes at an IHOP on a recent afternoon. He objects to Trump's recent threat to unilaterally suspend the constitutional protection of birthright citizenship as a way to control undocumented immigration.\n\nYet for all his antipathy toward the president, the strength of the economy is at least giving Kershey pause: \"I'll probably vote Democratic, but I'm not sure yet.\"\n\nWorkers have been increasingly benefiting from the economy's strength. Average pay growth for over the past 12 months has reached 3.1 percent, its best year-over-year increase since 2009, the government said Friday. Those gains have been concentrated among affluent Americans, though higher minimum wages have also helped raise the pay of many lower-income workers.\n\nAmong people earning at least $100,000, 60 percent approve of how Trump has handled the economy, according to a survey by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That is a relative advantage for a president whose tax cuts for corporations and individuals are credited with helping boost growth this year.\n\nJean Hoffman, a 53-year-old real estate agent in Chester County, is pondering the college costs ahead for her two teenage daughters. She said she thinks voting Republican might help extend the economy's hot streak.\n\n\"I'm going to have two kids in college, and these are my earning years,\" she said. \"So for me, the economy is the No. 1 priority.\"\n\nHoffman said she feels less concerned about Trump's confrontational style or habit of assailing critics.\n\n\"It's like white noise at this point,\" she said.\n\nJudging by the economy, the status of the House appears too close to call, said Ray Fair, a Yale economist. Using inflation and growth data, Fair developed a model to forecast electoral outcomes, which in 2016 correctly showed that that presidential election favored Republicans.\n\nFor 2018, Fair's economy-based model is less favorable than most political surveys for Democratic prospects to win the House. But the gap isn't sufficient to draw a firm conclusion about what will happen Tuesday. Because the party out of power \u2014 Democrats, in this case \u2014 generally enjoys an advantage in midterms, growth would have to be even stronger to decisively help Republicans this year.\n\n\"This time, the real uncertainty is turnout,\" Fair said. \"You can't say anything with much confidence about who is going be on which side of 50 percent.\"\n\nTo drive turnout, Pat Proprik, chair of the Bucks County Republicans, has been speaking to groups of voters nightly and knocking on doors. She said people in wealthier parts of the county tend to highlight the economy in explaining their intention to back Trump. Those in more modest areas tend to stress non-economic issues, at least at first.\n\n\"Economics isn't the first thing out of their mouth,\" Proprik said. \"But when you bring it up, they jump on it.\"\n\nAt 83, Dick Calef is a lifelong Republican. He attributes the economic gains in suburban Philadelphia to longer-term factors beyond Trump's policies, like the growth of internet and health care companies. Calef is still unsure how he'll vote.\n\n\"I find myself voting to keep a balance in the government,\" he said. \"I'm kind of fed up with the political environment.\"\n\nJerry McNeff intends to split his ballot between the parties in Pennsylvania's House, Senate and gubernatorial races.\n\n\"Trump had the right philosophy regarding the economy,\" said McNeff, 72. \"Taxes needed to be overhauled. Regulations had become obstructive to industry.\"\n\nBut as he has aged, McNeff said, the economy has mattered less to him. He thinks more about his five grandchildren. Every report of a mass shooting at a school makes him wonder about what could happen to them. And it stuns him that the federal government has done little to prevent future shootings, like seriously considering a bill to expand background checks.\n\n\"If you say what is the No. 1 thing that keeps you up at night, that is it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "I\u2019ve never felt like I had much family. I\u2019m an only child and my father died when I was small, so it's often felt like it's just been my mum and me.\n\nBut her parents did feature pretty strongly in my early life. They lived with us when I was growing up and I knew a little of their history, although as a teenager I was too young and immature to ask the questions I now know I should have. I didn\u2019t expect an encounter on Meghan and Harry\u2019s royal tour around the South Pacific would answer so many of them.\n\nAbout a year ago, I posted the story of how they met to my Facebook page - and it\u2019s a pretty good one. My grandmother, Gabriella Sawaya, was a Lebanese woman living in Cairo in the early 1940s. At the wedding of the King of Egypt, she met a Kiwi officer - Harold Claridge - who was posted to North Africa to fight with the ANZACS (The Australian and New Zealand Army Corp).\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nThese were apparently the kinds of parties she was invited to (!) and he was there as a courtesy to his Egyptian hosts to represent his regiment. They met and, so the story goes, they sat on a palace balcony staring at each other. As was typical then, she spoke many languages - Arabic, French, Italian and Greek. Unfortunately he could not understand any of them. So after spending the evening giggling at their misunderstandings, overseen by her elder sister as chaperone, she gave him her address in Cairo.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nHe was sent to Alamein in northern Egypt soon after - where some of the most important battles in the war were raging - and while he was away she learned English for him. He would come back to Cairo on leave from the front and over the next few years they courted. They were married at the end of the war and in 1945 had my mother.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nAfter being decommissioned, he returned to his work as an architect and brought his family to Libya, Iraq -- where he was involved in building the palace in Baghdad -- and then finally to Lebanon. But with war or revolution in each place, they kept moving, essentially becoming refugees many times over. With his New Zealand passport and war record, my grandfather was eventually able to relocate the family to England in the 1970s, where they lived until they were 96 years old. They died when I was in my mid-teens within a couple of years of one another.\n\nIn 2017, I was in Egypt and visited Helipolis Basilica in Cairo where they were married.\n\nFast forward a year, to a dark patch of earth in an Indonesian hotel courtyard. I was dozing in the heat in Palu, on assignment to cover the earthquake and tsunami, when my phone buzzed. Someone had commented on my Facebook post with a photograph of Harold and Gabriella on their wedding day and the question: James, are these your grandparents?\n\nStruggling to find enough service to reply, I eventually started exchanging emails with this person, initially thinking he was family. But it turned out even better - the man\u2019s name was Mark Cousins and he was writing from Wellington. His grandfather Clarence had been my grandfather\u2019s military orderly - or batman - during the war. He died fighting but during his service had written letters home in which he\u2019d described in glowing terms a \"Mr. Claridge,\" whom he greatly respected. So Mark began to investigate. He took his search to the New Zealand national library and sure enough, found my grandfather\u2019s details. But more than that, he\u2019d found all his personal photo albums.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nA month later I was in Wellington at the end of Meghan and Harry\u2019s royal tour. I had work to do but I HAD to meet Mark and visit the library with him. So we did and what I found was extraordinary. Photos of my grandfather at training camps in New Zealand before the war; on the SS Strathaird that took them via Sri Lanka and Cape Town to the Egyptian front; out in the desert with his men; my grandparents as a young couple; time spent at the beach in Tripoli; at the races in Egypt; in the mountains of Lebanon; my mum as a baby, as a teen and then as a young adult.\n\nMark told me some of the photos had writing on the back but one photo had a particular impact. I randomly chose one of my grandmother looking very glamorous on the beach in Alexandria. I turned it around and sure enough there was writing. In her impeccable script, one short line in pencil: \"Don\u2019t forget me.\"\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nI dropped the card and started to cry. She gave this photo as a memento to my grandfather as he went to war. It would have sat in his pocket or in his pitched tent, as they were in the sand dunes of northern Egypt. It would have traveled with him through war and revolution and through time: my mother\u2019s birth and then mine. It was a piece of history and the beginning of their love story and here I was, holding it in my hands nearly 80 years after it was written.\n\nMark and I sat and chatted, surrounded by the story of my family with tears in our eyes. What would they have made of it, we wondered? Our two grandfathers had fought alongside each other thousands of miles away and now here we were, a generation later, back in the home which Clarence at least never saw again. Mark is an extraordinary human being: with a sense of duty you rarely see, he has been piecing together the histories of all the men in my grandfather\u2019s company. And one of them still lives - Dennis. He\u2019s 100 now, back in New Zealand, and Mark tells me he\u2019s going to take the photo of us together, in order to show him this history coming full circle. We still have no idea how the albums made it back to New Zealand or who put them in the library.\n\nIn 1994, Mark did manage briefly to track down my grandfather. He wrote to him to ask for any memories he had of Clarence, and sure enough, he responded. Mark photocopied the letter and I\u2019m now sitting on my flight home with my first chance to read it, again moved to tears.\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nHe describes Clarence - or \"Clarry,\" in his typically no nonsense way, as \"an excellent man, well mannered, steady, reliable and quick to learn.\" My mum says the death of perhaps the person closest to him in the war affected my grandfather for the rest of his life. For me, the photos of his time at war have brought into sharp relief the experiences of a whole generation - experiences which are entirely impossible to understand now. The huge personal loss and sacrifice; the danger; the young age of so many of those men.\n\nIn one photo, my grandfather captures a bare-chested soldier crouched in the empty expanse of desert, carefully extracting what looks like a small metal tin from the ground - one of the thousands of German mines his unit was tasked with clearing. A speck behind him in the distance is the next man in the line doing the same thing. So many died doing this. In another, we see lines of troops sitting with their legs dangling over the side of the ship that took them to war, laughing as they catch oranges being thrown up by Sri Lankan farmers on wobbly little wooden rafts. Oblivious, perhaps, to the challenges ahead of them. How many of these men never came back? How many of them did my grandfather have to watch die?\n\nCourtesy James Longman\n\nAt the end of his letter, he tells Mark:\n\n\u201cI did have a hand in the Alamein cemetery construction. And my first visit was to seek out the graves of my friends and comrades. And among several of these together, is Clarry\u2019s.\u201d", "A convoy of 78 trucks carrying life-saving assistance reached a remote camp for the displaced on Syria's border with Jordan on Saturday, where tens of thousands of people are stranded in the desert amid dwindling supplies.\n\nThe United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said their joint convoy reached Rukban camp and would deliver assistance to 50,000 people The convoy was supposed to arrive last week but was delayed due to logistics and security concerns. The U.N. said the operation is expected to take three to four days.\n\nThe camp is home to around 45,000 people, many of them women and children, who are camped out in extremely dire conditions. At least four people have died in the past month due to malnutrition and lack of medical care as regional powers trade blame over who is responsible.\n\n\"We are delivering food, sanitation and hygiene supplies, nutrition and health assistance in addition to other core relief items in cooperation with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, said Ali Al-Za'tari, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator in Syria. He said an emergency vaccination campaign to protect some 10,000 children against deadly diseases would also be conducted.\n\nImad Ghali, a camp resident, told The Associated Press that the aid reached the zone surrounding the camp but has not yet been distributed to residents.\n\nPeople started gathering in Rukban three years ago, fleeing Islamic State militants and airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, Russia and Syria. Jordan sealed its border and stopped regular aid deliveries in 2016 after a cross-border IS attack that killed seven Jordanian soldiers.\n\nThe last aid delivery from Jordan was in January, leaving the camp's residents dependent on goods largely smuggled from government-held areas. The situation sharply deteriorated after the Syrian government blocked supply routes last month following a botched reconciliation deal with rebel groups in the area.\n\nRussia, a close ally of the Syrian government, has blamed the U.S. for the deterioration of the situation in Rukban, which is within a 55-square kilometer (20 sq. mile) \"deconfliction zone\" set up by U.S. forces stationed in the nearby Tanf military base.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has denied such allegations and blamed Russia and the Syrian government instead.\n\nBrett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy for the coalition fighting the Islamic State group, tweeted Saturday: \"Good News,\" adding that the humanitarian convoy reached Rukban after multiple delays from Syrian government authorities.", "The holiday season is already upon us here at Walt Disney World Resort, with our theme parks decorated in lovely seasonal decor once again.

That's up from last year's $2.47 billion, or $1.65 per B share, when insurance losses from several hurricanes hurt results.\n\nBuffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely.\n\nBy that measure, Berkshire reported operating earnings of $6.88 billion, or about $2.79 per Class B share. That's up from $3.44 billion, or about $1.40 per B share.\n\nThe Omaha-based company's revenue grew to $63.45 billion in the quarter, which was up from $59.5 billion last year. Berkshire Hathaway officials do not typically comment on the company's quarterly earnings.\n\n\"Overall, it's a very strong report,\" said Andy Kilpatrick, a retired stockbroker and author who wrote \"Of Permanent Value: The Story of Warren Buffett.\"\n\nBerkshire's insurance unit, which includes Geico and several large reinsurance firms, reported a $441 million underwriting profit in the quarter. That's much better than last year's $1.4 billion underwriting loss when hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria caused devastation and Mexico endured earthquakes.\n\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe railroad added $1.4 billion to Berkshire's quarterly profits, up from $1 billion a year ago. BNSF has hauled 5 percent more freight in the first nine months of the year, signaling that the economy remains strong.\n\nThe biggest swing in Berkshire's quarterly profit came from an $11.5 billion gain in the value of its investments. A year ago, Berkshire reported only a $423 million investment gain. New accounting rules that took effect this year forced Berkshire to change the way it records the value of its investments.\n\nDuring the quarter, Berkshire repurchased some of its own stock for the first time in several years after loosening its restrictions on the practice. Buffett spent $928 million to repurchase 225 Class A shares and 4.1 million Class B shares during the quarter.\n\nEdward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said investors will appreciate that Buffett followed through on the new buyback program and purchased shares.\n\n\"This will send a strong signal in equity markets,\" Shanahan said.\n\nBut the fact that Berkshire is buying its own stock while holding more than $100 billion in cash and short-term investments is a reminder that Buffett hasn't been able to find other large acquisitions and investments at attractive prices recently.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the railroad and clothing, furniture and jewelry businesses.

The Bureau of Immigration ordered her deported in July, put her on a blacklist and then downgraded her missionary visa to a temporary visitor's visa, which expired Saturday.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has bristled at criticism of his leadership, particularly by foreigners like Fox, who he says have no right to meddle in Philippine domestic affairs. Most of the criticism has focused on his bloody anti-drug campaign, which has left thousands dead, alarmed Western governments and rights groups and prompted two complaints of mass murder before the International Criminal Court.\n\n\"At present in the Philippines the human rights abuses are just increasing and it's a reign of terror and tyranny,\" Fox told reporters after arriving at Melbourne airport on Sunday.\n\nDuring a farewell news conference in a Catholic school before leaving for the Manila airport with a convoy of supporters, the 71-year-old Fox called on Filipinos to speak up and help the marginalized fight to gain land, houses and jobs.\n\n\"The big challenge now is not to lose hope, to know that if we all move together, we can bring about change,\" Fox said.\n\n\"Pope Francis said that if you're a Christian and there's massive human rights violations ... you should take action, make noise. Where the oppressed are, the church people should be there, not only always talking but with them and hopefully more vocal,\" she said.\n\nFox told The Associated Press separately by phone that Duterte's anti-drug crackdown was \"horribly barbaric\" and she vowed to return to the country if allowed to resume her 27 years of missionary work for the poor.\n\n\"I know a lot of mothers, wives who have lost someone.

A lawyers group backing Fox, the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, said that by persecuting a frail and low-key missionary, Duterte has turned her into an \"overnight rock star.\"\n\nKnown for being soft-spoken, Fox is a coordinator of a Roman Catholic order of nuns and has worked for the poor in the Philippines. She promotes human rights and the welfare of workers, farmers and ethnic groups and has spoken against Duterte and his government, which has also been criticized for stifling dissent.\n\nShe recalled in Melbourne that after she had spoken publicly in support for Coca-Cola workers seeking benefits in the Philippines, their picket was \"broken up brutally, 10 of them were arrested and were five days in jail and not charged.\"\n\n\"And so they were having a press conference and I did say to them, when they wanted me to speak, that the teachings of the Catholic Church clearly say you have a right to assembly, you have a right to unionize, you have a right to regular work.

Purdon, a lawyer for the Spirit Lake Tribe, who told ABC News that because the tribe\u2019s emergency motion was denied, he doesn\u2019t know whether thousands of Native Americans who recently obtained new IDs will be able to vote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the questions our lawsuit sought to answer and unfortunately we weren\u2019t able to get an answer. I can\u2019t say what will happen on Tuesday,\u201d Purdon said.\n\nTribes in North Dakota have been working frantically to provide new IDs in time for Tuesday.\n\nThe new law, allowed to move forward by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month, now requires voters to provide IDs with a residential street address, which could potentially disenfranchise thousands of Native Americans who live on rural reservations where residential addresses are uncommon.\n\nEstimates from North Dakota\u2019s four largest tribes indicate at least 2,000 voters have been issued new IDs since the high court decision last month \u2014 a pivotal number in a state where the last senate race went to Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp by just under 3,000 votes. But tribal members are concerned that despite the efforts, the new IDs could be denied at the polls.\n\nBlake Nicholson/AP\n\nThat was one reason the Spirit Lake Tribe brought a lawsuit Tuesday against Jaeger, claiming that the implementation of the new law is \u201cunplanned, untested, and broken.\u201d They filed an emergency motion to delay the residential address requirement until after the midterms, but their request was denied when a federal judge determined that a last minute rule-change would \u201ccreate as much confusion as it will alleviate.\u201d\n\nJaeger, however, sought to offer assurances that most voters who show up to the polls with new tribal issued IDs that show a residential address will \"receive a ballot and be able to vote\" either on a regular ballot or a \u201cset-aside,\u201d or provisional ballot.\n\nThose voters would have three days to go to a county auditor\u2019s office and confirm that they have a residential street address, considering weekend and holiday closures.\n\nHe added that those suing the state about the residential address issue should take their concerns to local officials such as their county 911 coordinator.\n\n\u201cI would encourage those people to talk to local officials. They\u2019re asking us to make determinations that we\u2019re not in the position to determine,\u201d Jaeger said.\n\nNevertheless, the systems for assigning and verifying residential addresses, which are at the heart of the lawsuit as potentially faulty, give qualified Native Americans reason for pause, according to tribal lawyers.\n\nDan Koeck/Reuters\n\nSpirit Lake\u2019s lawsuit indicates that a tribal member spoke with a county 911 coordinator, as Jaeger recommended, and got an official residential address.\n\nBut her address was not considered valid in the state\u2019s system.\n\nAnother tribal member was issued a state ID for an address in Oberon, North Dakota, but when a different resident of his same home called 911 coordinators to get an ID, she was given an address a few miles away in Fort Totten, North Dakota.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine how hard it is to live on a reservation, in some of the poorest communities, and then you face these sort of hurdles to exercise your right to vote?\u201d Purdon told ABC News.\n\nDespite the challenges, many in his community have become more motivated to cast their ballots.\n\n\u201cMy friends who live on the reservations say they are undaunted,\" he said.", "Voters in New Caledonia are deciding whether the French territory in the South Pacific should break free from the European country that claimed it in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe polls opened Sunday morning in a referendum that's a milestone in the process of the archipelago's three-decade-long decolonization \u2014 one that will help define New Caledonia's future as an independent country or as a continuing part of France.\n\nMore than 174,000 registered voters are invited to answer the question: \"Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\"\n\nObservers expect a majority to favor remaining a part of France, based on opinion polls and previous election results.\n\nPolling stations opened at 8 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday in mainland France; 9 p.m. GMT) and close 10 hours later.

He said both the internationally-recognized Yemeni government and Houthi rebels \"are not enabling us to do our work as fast as we should.\"\n\nCappelaere said he can't bring the best nutrition experts to the country because of delays in granting visas and that aid agencies face bureaucratic impediments the delay the import of supplies.\n\nHe criticized authorities with \"other interests\" for creating delays in the arrival and distribution of supplies, without elaborating.\n\nMost aid agencies operate in Houthi-held areas where they face movement restrictions. The rebels manipulate aid distribution by providing lists of beneficiaries and sometimes divert aid to their supporters.\n\nCappelaere's visit came shortly after the United States called for the cease-fire within 30 days. He said the situation is deteriorating, with millions unable to meet their basic needs.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015, when Houthis occupied northern Yemen, forcing the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition supporting the government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\n\"An end to the conflict is ... a much-needed step but it needs to be complemented with investment and governance of this country that puts the interest of the people at the center and the interest of the children at the core of politics,\" Cappelaere said.\n\nThree-quarters of Yemen's 29 million people are food insecure, 1.8 million children suffer from malnutrition and 400,000 children under age 5 are at risk of death from starvation. Every 10 minutes a child dies of preventable diseases, according to UNICEF.\n\nAround 40 percent of the 400,000 are located in and around Hodeida, which has been the target of a stalled coalition offensive in recent months. The port is a key entry point for food and humanitarian aid, but the coalition says the Houthis also use it to import weapons.\n\nDuring a visit to Hodeida's main hospital, Cappelaere said he saw children suffering from severe malnutrition and others paralyzed by complications from diphtheria, an epidemic fueled by the breakdown of health services. He says many families in Hodeida cannot make it to hospitals because of airstrikes and shelling, or because they cannot afford transportation.\n\n\"It's high time for authorities from both sides to take responsibility and enable that assistance without any conditions, without any hurdles,\" he said.", "It's Halloween night in Alton, New Hampshire, a quaint town on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee of just over 5,000 people located smack dab in the middle of one of America's quintessential swing congressional districts, and Republican candidate Eddie Edwards is handing out candy to a young girl proudly displaying her light-up princess dress.\n\n\"Happy Halloween, don't forget to vote!\" Edwards says with a nod to the young girl's parents. A child dressed as a \"Pac-Man\" machine, a tall man sporting scarily realistic costume of \"Halloween\" villain Michael Myers, and a young boy donning a policeman's cap all drop by as the candidate diligently drops handfuls of candy into their waiting arms.\n\nIt's New Hampshire, less than a week from a pivotal midterm election, and Edwards, an African-American Navy veteran and former police officer, and his Democratic opponent Chris Pappas, an openly gay member of the New Hampshire Executive Council, are both vying for every last vote in a race that puts the state's political independence and idiosyncrasies on full display.\n\nNo matter who emerges victorious in the race this Tuesday, history will be made by either Edwards or Pappas, who would be the state's first African-American or openly gay Member of Congress respectively.\n\n.@EddieEdwardsNH, a former police officer, handing out Halloween candy to a future cop \u201cWelcome to the force\u201d he says pic.twitter.com/3t8CYDqUEZ \u2014 Johnny Verhovek (@JTHVerhovek) October 31, 2018\n\nAs the crowd of trick or treaters passing by the candidate started to thin, a woman approaches Edwards and leans in close to whisper that she is supporting him, despite the fact that her family members are all Democrats. Edwards gives her a thumbs up and a hearty thank you.\n\nNew Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, which includes the cities like Manchester and Portsmouth and more rural areas alongside the state's border with Maine, has switched back and forth between Democratic and Republican control for each of the past five election cycles, and the retirement of incumbent Democratic Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter immediately put the seat back on the list of battleground races that will play into control of the U.S. House on Tuesday.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to stop that,\" Edwards, who has been joined on the campaign trail by the likes of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, told ABC News of the district's inconsistency in party representation.\n\nHe chalked that flux up to voters' desire to have responsive representation in Washington.\n\nElise Amendola/AP\n\n\"That\u2019s New Hampshire. They\u2019re all about Live Free or Die. We want to make sure we have representation that reflects our values and who we are in this state,\" Edwards told ABC News in an interview at a makeshift campaign office in Alton inside a house owned by a local state representative and fire chief, \"You've got to bring it every election, you\u2019ve got to deliver it when you\u2019re there. And if you\u2019re not, and you don\u2019t deliver, voters will let you know.\"\n\nThe potential historic nature of the race is not lost on Edwards.\n\n\"That\u2019s what America is all about right? New Hampshire proves every single stereotype and statistic about our country wrong every single time,\" Edwards said, \"You\u2019re in a state that is 93 percent white, and they\u2019re electing potentially their first African-American running against an openly gay person in our state \u2013 that\u2019s what New Hampshire is all about. In New Hampshire, it doesn\u2019t matter your race, your ethnicity, the gender...what you give to your family to your community and your country is what makes you special.\"\n\nThe district voted for George W. Bush twice, Barack Obama twice, and narrowly sided with Donald Trump in 2016, but Edwards says support for the President is understated by widespread in the district.\n\n\"People are happy, and people are quiet too. There\u2019s a lot of support for the President in this district. The problem is that Republicans are afraid to be attacked right now,\" Edwards said, \"I met one of our seniors in our state, she whispered to me, she said I\u2019m going to vote for you, I really support our president, I really support Republicans, but I can\u2019t say it too loudly because I get bullied. So I think it\u2019s underplayed just how much support the President has in this district.\"\n\nBut following a week defined by political violence and a President who shows little desire to ratchet down the tension, the depressing effect Trump could have on candidates like Edwards still looms, despite the candidates dismissals.\n\n\"We\u2019re a nation of 330 million people, the tension in this country happened long before the President was elected, and we don\u2019t want to be honest about it,\" Edwards said, \"I know people want to point the finger at the President and say well he\u2019s at the top, that\u2019s where we get our leadership from. I\u2019m running for Congress, I\u2019m part of the leadership for this country. There are 535 people who are in Congress, they have an equal responsibility, not a subservient role, as the president to bring us together.\"\n\nA Democrat asserting independence\n\nDespite Edwards' confident defense of the president and his own self-assurance, he is undoubtedly facing a formidable opponent in Pappas, a Harvard-educated small business owner who was first elected as a state representative in 2002 when he was 22.\n\nNow 38, Pappas has run an aggressive campaign to keep the seat in Democratic hands. ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight currently gives the Democrat a 5 in 6 chance to win the seat on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier that Halloween day, the candidate toured a rubber manufacturing plant in the town of Rochester to highlight the importance of job training and technical skills, telling ABC News \"I run every campaign like I\u2019m five votes behind, and we\u2019re just sprinting through the finish.\"\n\nWhen asked about the district's political indecision, Pappas said it's in New Hampshire's nature to look at candidates not solely through the prism of partisanship.\n\n\"Most voters are Independents. They pick and choose based on the issues and the individuals and not based on party affiliation,\" Pappas said, \"We\u2019ve got an important case to make to the broad section of voters that are in the middle, who are Independents and who tend to focus late on political decisions like this.\"\n\nCJ Gunther/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nThose independent voters include people like Kenny Couch, a 45-year-old veteran and production supervisor at the same manufacturing facility Pappas toured who told ABC News he is still undecided about who is voting for on Tuesday and lamented the current state of political discourse in the country.\n\n\"I could care less about what Trump is doing,\" Couch said amid the whir of machinery around him, \"Yeah there\u2019s a lot of things I\u2019d like for him not to do, but I don\u2019t care about that. This is the issue I want to know about \u2013 why are our children going hungry? Why don\u2019t we have these programs for our kids, statistics and where do we rank in the world in education \u2013 not even in the top 25. And we\u2019re the greatest country in the planet.\"\n\n\"For me personally the best candidate will at least attempt to do what he says he\u2019s going to do and represent the constituents that voted him in and see where the chips lay,\" Couch added, glancing towards Pappas and offering a somewhat positive review, \"I feel that he\u2019s young, ambitious. I think that bringing industry to New Hampshire is awesome, bringing in the right people and things like that, so if he can do that and run on that, absolutely I think that he would be supported very well.\"\n\nPappas has continued to hammer home an economy-centric message in the campaign's final days, telling ABC News \"I think we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have policies that can respond and ensure that we reward hard work and allow people to reach the middle class and stay there.\"\n\nOn the question of whether or not he will support Nancy Pelosi as the next Speaker of the House if Democrats re-take the chamber on Tuesday, Pappas says he's taking a wait and see approach.\n\n\"There\u2019s going to be a leadership fight, we\u2019ll see who runs and what the contours of that would look like,\" Pappas said.\n\nThe Democrat said he can see himself working with the Trump administration on issues like infrastructure, but said there's no doubt that President Trump has contributed to the political strife not just in recent days, but throughout his time in the Oval Office.\n\n\"The tone matters and our leaders help set that tone. And we\u2019ve seen a very divisive couple years in this country in part because of the statements and policies of this President,\" Pappas said, \"I think it\u2019s important that we have checks and balances in Washington, that we look for ways to bring people together and create a conversation about the priorities of the voters and not get into the sort of name-calling and baseless attacks that people are just sick and tired of.\"", "For years, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher has cut a unique figure in Washington\u2019s foreign policy world \u2013 a staunch Reaganite who has taken an unexpected ideological turn in advocating closer ties with Russia, even boasting about a drunken arm-wrestling contest with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the early 1990s.\n\nNow, the Orange County Republican once dubbed \u201cPutin\u2019s favorite congressman\u201d by Politico is one of the scores of House Republicans scrambling to defend his seat in the midterm elections against a Democrat \u2013 Harley Rouda, a former Republican attorney and businessman \u2013 in a district Hillary Clinton carried by 1.7 points in 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how those attacks and Rohrabacher\u2019s record will ultimately factor into the election results.\n\nRohrabacher and fellow Republican, Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, have weathered attacks from Democrats and Republican primary opponents focused on Russia and the investigations into 2016 election interference.\n\nKyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics and managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, said almost any issue in the campaign could prove \u201cdecisive\u201d if the race is decided by a few percentage points.\n\n\u201cThat said, a lot of experts on both sides of the House fight seem to believe Rohrabacher is still holding up OK,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cPart of the reason is that his district is probably a little more Republican than similar districts in Southern California with imperiled GOP incumbents.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s campaign did not make him available for an interview, but in a recent appearance on Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Circus,\u201d the congressman said he believes he\u2019s in a close race because of how long he\u2019s been in office.\n\nBill Clark/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tighter race, obviously, when someone says \u201830 years is enough.\u2019 That\u2019s a good slogan but 30 years also means that you have seniority, you know what to do, you know how to get things done to better Orange County.\u201d\n\nFight for his political life\n\nLocal and national political analysts watching the race say Rohrabacher could still retain his seat on the strength of his conservative and libertarian-leaning record, even as other vulnerable House Republicans come up short on election night.\n\n\u201cHe's been around for almost 30 years in Congress,\u201d Zev Yaroslavsky, a former Los Angeles County supervisor and director of the Los Angeles Initiative at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, who has known Rohrabacher for decades, told ABC News. \u201cDon't underestimate him because he will fight.\u201d\n\nAfter winning re-election two years ago by double digits, Rohrabacher emerged as one of two victors in a jungle primary last June, barely topping 30 percent of the vote in a race with more than a dozen candidates.\n\nOnce a speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, he was an ardent Cold Warrior when he was elected to Congress in 1988. But Rohrabacher\u2019s position evolved as the Cold War wound down. He became increasingly convinced that the United States and Russia could work together to take on shared challenges, such as terrorism in the Middle East \u2013 a view shared by President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher has used his position as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee with jurisdiction over Russia policy to advocate for closer relations and push back against economic sanctions.\n\n\"Everything I do is aimed at what's good for the United States,\" he told ABC News in an interview last year, rejecting being labeled as pro-Russia.\n\nTo Russia, his voice in Congress is seen as so important that FBI agents once warned him that he was considered a target for recruitment by intelligence operatives, according to The New York Times. The senior committee post has also put him in contact with many of the key figures that have emerged in the congressional and federal investigations in Russian election meddling.\n\nA spokesman for Rohrabacher dismissed the encounters, saying it is \u201cliterally his job to meet with Russians and other foreign officials\u201d and that the congressman \u201chas met with far more anti-Russian Ukrainians that he has Russians.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher and the Russia investigation\n\nIn April of 2016, he met in Moscow with Natalia Veselnitskaya \u2013 the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials in Trump Tower that June for a meeting advertised as an opportunity to discuss potential dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nVeselnitskaya told a Crimean news service the meeting was about sanctions, and Rohrabacher\u2019s office told Foreign Policy that she was one of many people he met on a congressional trip to Russia.\n\nThat summer, he met with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, months before the site released hacked Democratic emails received from Russian hackers.\n\nTrump campaign aide Rick Gates pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to federal agents about the topics of conversation in a 2013 meeting with a lobbyist and a congressman - later confirmed by ABC News to be Rohrabacher.\n\nKent Nishimura/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nAs ABC News has previously reported, the congressman also met several times with Maria Butina, who was later charged with acting as a Russian agent by the U.S. government. His office has dismissed those encounters as routine, given his subcommittee chairmanship.\n\nRohrabacher was one of two sitting lawmakers -- along with former Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- to have been interviewed by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as part of the panels\u2019 Russia investigations.\n\nThe committee left Rohrabacher\u2019s transcript, along with Wasserman Schultz\u2019s and a handful of others, off the list of more than 50 they plan to declassify and release. Democrats have said they would release the transcript if they take the House, and with it, control of the committee.\n\nRohrabacher told CNN he was an \u201copen book\u201d with investigators and was questioned about trips to Russia and meetings he had there.\n\nThe California Republican\u2019s advocacy for Russia has put other Republicans in an uncomfortable position \u2013 most notably when the Washington Post obtained a recording of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy privately joking with other top Republicans in 2016 that Putin \u201cpays\u201d Rohrabacher and Trump. (McCarthy later told reporters the comment was a bad joke.)\n\nLast year, Republican leaders started scrutinizing his official travel privileges as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.\n\nSubsequently, Rohrabacher paid his way own way to Europe and a meeting with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August of 2017.\n\nRohrabacher tried to deliver a message from Assange to Trump \u2013 an effort to broker a deal for Assange to turn over what he described as evidence that Russia didn\u2019t hack the Democratic National Committee and pass materials to Wikileaks that the site later published \u2013 but said he was blocked from doing so by White House chief of staff John Kelly, he told ABC News at the time.\n\nDems take aim at Rohrabacher\n\nAll the overlap with the Russia investigation has provided plenty of grist for Rohrabacher\u2019s political opponents.\n\nScott Baugh, a former member of California State Assembly who was considered Rohrabacher's main GOP challenger, swiped at Rohrabacher's focus on Russia ahead of the primary.\n\n\"I think his preoccupation with Russia and marijuana [law reform] to the exclusion of issues the district cares about is a strong indication it's time to retire,\" he told Capitol Weekly, a nonprofit news outlet.\n\nRouda, Rohrabacher's general election opponent, released an ad earlier this year urging voters to \u201cshow Trump and Rohrabacher it\u2019s time for a leader who represents us, not Russia.\u201d The candidates also sparred over Rohrabacher\u2019s relationship with Russia in a recent debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of many issues,\u201d Rouda said in an interview with ABC News when asked to explain why the congressman\u2019s record on Russia is important in the race. \u201cThere are so many issues that show Rohrabacher in an extremist position.\u201d\n\nHe compared Rohrabacher\u2019s views on Russia to some of his comments on other subjects, such as when he told a realtor's conference in May that it is acceptable not to sell homes to gays and lesbians, and skepticism of climate change.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rouda\u2019s campaign also sent out a statement drawing attention to spending from Atlas PAC on Rohrabacher\u2019s behalf. The group has links to George O\u2019Neil, a member of the Rockefeller clan and conservative donor, who was in touch with alleged Russian agent Maria Butina as she sought to network in Washington, according to court papers.\n\nThe two were in contact over email, planning \u201cfriendship and dialogue dinners\u201d between Russians and Americans.\n\nO\u2019Neill\u2019s interactions with Butina, according to the government\u2019s filings, largely focused on email correspondence in which he, Butina and Erickson contemplated and planned \u201cfriendship and dialogue dinners\u201d between Russians and Americans, one of which he hosted before the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast at upscale Washington restaurant Bistro Bis.\n\nO\u2019Neill wrote about the dinner on a conservative website, saying it involved \u201cformer and current and Russian officials with a number of prominent U.S. Republicans and conservatives.\u201d\n\nAfter ABC News published a story on the congressman, Rep. Rohrbacher said he did not remember speaking with Butina at the Bistro Bis dinner.\n\n\"Her job was arranging chairs at a dinner, a gopher, and I sat at the opposite end of the table,\" Rohrabacher said.\n\nRohrabacher defends record\n\nIn the interview with \u201cThe Circus,\u201d Rohrabacher repeated his disbelief that hackers backed by the Kremlin hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, citing evidence he says he was shown by Assange.\n\n\"I know they didn't hack the DNC,\" he said. \"I went to the guy who received the DNC emails, Julian Assange, and talked to him personally, and he assured me that it wasn't and that he had proof.\"\n\nThat claim has put him at odds with the intelligence community and Mueller, after the Justice Department announced indictments against 12 Russian intelligence officers for the hacking last June, ahead of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRohrabacher said he believes his constituents see through the criticism of his record on Russia.\n\n\u201cMy constituents are smart enough to know [bull] when they hear it,\u201d he told \"The Circus.\" \u201cI am advocating for cooperating with Russia where we can and when it\u2019s mutually beneficial.\"", "NATO has held its largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War.\n\nCalled Trident Juncture, the war games are being held over two weeks in Norway and involve 50,000 troops, 10,000 vehicles, 250 aircraft and 65 ships from 31 nations.\n\nNATO officials say that the defensive exercises are not directed at any country in particular, but it is clear the intended audience is Russia.

China has pledged a total of more than $60 billion to Pakistan in the form of loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks to build what is termed the \"China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\"\n\nFollowing Li's meeting with Khan, Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou said the sides had \"made it clear in principal that the Chinese government will provide necessary support and assistance to Pakistan in tiding over the current economic difficulties.\n\n\"As for the specific measures to be taken, the competent authorities of the two sides will have detailed discussions,\" Kong told reporters.\n\nAnd despite Pakistan's looming balance of payments crisis, Kong said there were no plans to scale back the economic corridor, known as CPEC, although he did say it would be altered somewhat to \"tilt in favor of areas relating to people's lives.\"\n\n\"There's been no change in the number of CPEC projects. If there were to be any change, it would be an increase going forward,\" he said.\n\nIn response to the debt crisis, Pakistan is seeking an emergency bailout loan of $8 billion from the International Monetary Fund, which plans to send a team to Islamabad to assess the situation. It is also seeking new loans from Saudi Arabia and China. Discussions of the new funding were expected to dominate Khan's visit.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the United States, which strongly influences the IMF, has said it will not finance the repayment of Pakistan's Chinese loans.\n\nPakistani media earlier reported China was preparing a $6 billion package of aid, including loans and additional investment for CPEC.\n\nThe issue did not come up in opening remarks between Li and Khan. Li said the former cricket star's visit would \"further consolidate and develop the firm, enduring ties between our two countries.\"\n\nKhan responded by saying that CPEC had evolved from the concept stage to showing tangible results \"on the ground\" that have \"caught the imagination of the people of Pakistan.\n\n\"We feel that this is a great opportunity for our country to progress, to attract investment.

The next general election is in 2020.\n\nThe seats became vacant through death or resignation.\n\nThe two seats at stake in Yangon, the country's biggest city, are all but certain to stay in the NLD's hands. Turnout in Yangon appeared to be low, but several voters there said they are keeping the faith in Suu Kyi.\n\n\"We don't see we are going to get immediate change. It's impossible to make things right that have already been wrong for many years,\" said Htun Thein, a Yangon voter. \"We have to give them time and have understanding.\"\n\nBecause of that, he said, voters \"have to encourage and support\" the NLD.\n\nMyo Pa Pa Htun had a simpler explanation for supporting the NLD candidate: \"Because we like and love Mother Su very much, that's the thing.\"\n\nOther contests are taking place in ethnic minority regions where 2015 votes for installing Suu Kyi and slapping down the military's favored candidates may give way to more traditional loyalties to local ethnic parties. That possible political realignment could come at the ruling NLD's disadvantage. Areas involved include Chin, Shan and Rakhine states.\n\nLow voter turnout may be the main hallmark of Saturday's polls, though more so in Yangon than in ethnic minority regions.\n\nIn Yangon's Tamwe township, more than 70,000 voters cast ballots in 2015's general election, according to Toe Win, the NLD's candidate for the constituency. He estimated Saturday's turnout will reach around 20,000.\n\nToe Win is running to fill the seat of President Win Myint, who by law had to step down from his legislative post when he was appointed the country's chief executive earlier this year.\n\nBusinessman Maung Maung said he had to queue with hundreds of voters to vote in 2015. \"This morning I saw about 20 voters. In 2015, more than 200 people were ahead of me. The ruling party should take it as a lesson for 2020,\" he said.\n\n\"Falling voter turnout in the by-elections raises big questions about the NLD's popularity midway through its five-year term,\" said Yan Myo Thein, a political commentator in Yangon. \"People particularly in ethnic areas have been disappointed about the NLD's election promises, the performance of the government and MPs and economic burdens.\"", "The lawyer for a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after spending eight years on death row in Pakistan has fled the country, fearing for his safety, her brother said Saturday.\n\nJames Masih said Asia Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Malook, left Pakistan, without providing further details. Malook's phone was switched off.\n\nPakistan's top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday and ordered her release in a move that infuriated the country's hard-line Islamists, who have held nationwide protests demanding her execution.\n\nThe government reached deal with the Islamists overnight in which it agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi while the case is reviewed. In return, the Islamists halted their protests, which had blocked roads and brought life to a standstill in parts of the country.\n\nMalook told The Associated Press earlier this week that he would have to leave Pakistan because the followers of hard-line cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi had threatened to kill him as well as the judges who acquitted Bibi.\n\nThe Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that Malook passed through Rome en route to Amsterdam. It said he would speak at a conference in Amsterdam next week before permanently relocating to London.\n\nBlasphemy against Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor has caused lynchings. Islamists have made the blasphemy law a central rallying cry.\n\nSalman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, was hanged for the crime, but later was hailed by religious hard-liners as a martyr, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Malook had served as the prosecutor in Qadri's trial.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 on allegations that she insulted Islam's Prophet Muhammad during an altercation with other farmworkers. Her family and lawyers deny she ever insulted Islam.\n\nRights groups have called for Bibi's release and criticized the blasphemy law, saying it has been used to settle scores or abuse religious minorities. The court upheld the blasphemy law, but said there was not enough evidence to convict Bibi.\n\nPakistan's Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions, but court reviews typically take years. Bibi's ordeal looks set to continue until the review is completed.\n\nBibi's family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they could fly out of Pakistan. Though the family has not disclosed her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum.", "Hundreds of Egyptian Christians attended a funeral service Saturday after seven people were killed in an ambush by Islamic State militants of buses carrying pilgrims to a remote desert monastery.\n\nThe service at Prince Tadros church in the central city of Minya was held amid tight security. Minya's top cleric, Anba Makarios, led prayers over a row of six white coffins, all victims from the same family. A separate funeral was held for the seventh victim, a bus driver.\n\nRelatives of the victims cried and held each other for support. Some rested their heads on the coffins and wept. A list of the victims' names released by the church said a 15-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl were among the dead. Nineteen were wounded in the attack, according to the church.\n\nAida Shehata, who was shot in her legs, said masked men opened fire on three buses from different directions. Two of the buses were able to speed away and reach the monastery, but the militants stopped the third one and killed the driver and six of the passengers, including her husband and his brother.\n\n\"The driver tried to go to the monastery but they (the militants) were faster,\" Shehata told a Coptic TV network.\n\nAn Islamic State affiliate based in the restive northern Sinai Peninsula claimed the attack, calling it revenge for the imprisonment of \"our chaste sisters,\" without elaborating.\n\nThe attack cast a shadow on one of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's showpieces \u2014 the World Youth Forum \u2014 which opens Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The forum is drawing thousands of local and foreign youth to discuss a wide range of topics, with Egypt's 63-year-old leader taking center stage.\n\nIn an apparent effort to keep the attack from overshadowing the start of the three-day conference, two state-owned newspapers ran front-page banner headlines about the forum. Akhbar al-Youm ran a large photo of el-Sissi cycling in Sharm el-Sheikh. Its reference to the attack lower down in the page made no mention of casualties.\n\nIS has repeatedly targeted Egypt's Christians as punishment for their support of el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 ouster of an elected but divisive Islamist president.\n\nEl-Sissi, who has made security among his top priorities since taking office in 2014, wrote on his Twitter account that Friday's attack was designed to harm the \"nation's solid fabric\" and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. He later offered his condolences when he spoke by telephone with Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt's Orthodox Christians and a close ally of the president.\n\nBegemy Nassem Nasr, the priest of the church of St. Mary in the central Egyptian city of Minya, near where the attack took place, suggested it was meant to embarrass el-Sissi as he hosted the youth forum. \"I think that this is a terrorist act which is targeting Egypt through playing the card of the Copts,\" he said.\n\nFriday's attack was the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years, indicating that security measures put in place since then are inadequate. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. IS has also targeted Christian churches with a series of suicide bombings since December 2016 that have killed scores of people.\n\nThe attacks led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and Church-linked facilities, where metal detectors and armed police are routinely deployed. They have also underlined the vulnerability of minority Christians in the conservative, Muslim-majority country.\n\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said Friday's attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year's attack.\n\nSome Christians in Minya said police negligence was partly to blame for the latest attack, saying they stopped providing armed escorts for pilgrims' buses.\n\n\"They should have escorted them. They know it is dangerous to leave them alone on that road,\" said Youssef Attya, a 38-year-old health worker from Minya.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene.\n\nEgypt's Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country's 100 million people, have long complained of discrimination. Christian activists say the church's alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection, but sectarian violence still flares from time to time, especially in poorer and more rural areas.\n\nChristians make up some 35 percent of the population in Minya, more than in any other governorate. The area has also seen the most acts of violence against Christians in recent years.\n\nChristians there accuse the local police of going easy on Muslim assailants, saying authorities prefer to resolve disputes through reconciliation rather than arresting and prosecuting those who commit crimes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHendawi reported from Cairo.", "Hundreds of Central American migrants from a 4,000-strong caravan winding its way through southern Mexico and toward the U.S. border splintered off on their own Saturday after broken promises of bus transportation.\n\nPatience appeared to be wearing thin among the exhausted trekkers after Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes reneged on an offer Friday to provide buses to leapfrog the migrants to the Mexican capital. Tempers flared as the migrants struggled with exhaustion, blisters, sickness and swollen feet.\n\nCaravan organizers have pleaded for buses in recent days after three weeks on the road, hitching rides and walking. The group scattered between several towns in Veracruz Saturday, raising questions of whether they would stick together.\n\nSeveral thousand planned to spend the night in Isla, about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) south of the U.S. border, while another large contingent hunkered down in Juan Rodriguez Clara and yet another reached Tierra Blanca, 80 miles (129 kilometers) to the north.\n\nIn a statement, the migrants lambasted Mexican officials for directing them northward through the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, calling it the \"route of death.\" Some migrants branched off in the belief that they were near the metropolises of Puebla and Mexico City, where they aimed to rest and receive medical attention.\n\nA trek via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz takes them through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments.\n\nAuthorities in Veracruz said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves. Some security experts have questioned whether those bodies belonged to migrants.\n\nIbis Villanueva, 32, said he decided to strike out on his own for Puebla because he felt frustrated by the lack of organization in the caravan.\n\n\"We don't believe the coordinators anymore. Yesterday they said we were going on bus, today no,\" said the sunburned welder from Honduras.\n\nGerardo Perez, a 20-year-old migrant, said he was tired. \"They're playing with our dignity. If you could have only seen the people's happiness last night when they told us that we were going by bus and today we're not,\" he said.\n\nThe caravan's 'strength in numbers' strategy has enabled them to mobilize support as they move through Mexico and has inspired subsequent migrants to try their luck via caravan.\n\nMexico now faces the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, with a total of more than 6,000 migrants.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThat caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19. At its peak that caravan swelled to an estimated 7,000 participants.\n\nMexican officials appear conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.\n\nImmigration agents and police have at times detained migrants in the smaller caravans. There has also been pressure on the main caravan, with federal police pulling over freight trucks and forcing migrants off, saying that clinging to the tops or sides of the trucks was dangerous.\n\nBut several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns - arranging for food and camp sites. Mexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.\n\nWith or without the government's help, uncertainty awaits.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "Two people were killed when part of an Amazon distribution warehouse collapsed amid severe weather, a spokeswoman for the retail giant said Saturday.\n\nThe men worked for an outside company and not Amazon, spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said. No one else was injured when severe storms with strong winds tore through Maryland Friday evening, she said.\n\n\"First responders remain onsite assessing the damage. The safety of our employees and contractors is our top priority and at this time the building remains closed,\" Lighty said in an email.\n\nNews reports cite Baltimore fire officials as saying one man was found under debris Friday night and later pronounced dead, while a second man's body was recovered under rubble early Saturday. Officials say a 50-foot wall at the warehouse collapsed. Photos from the scene appear to show the collapsed wall was about two stories tall.\n\nBaltimore fire officials didn't respond to phone or email messages from The Associated Press.\n\nThe National Weather Service had earlier warned of thunderstorms in the area, with some producing gusty winds and heavy rain.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "External links are provided for reference purposes. ABC News is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 ABC News Internet Ventures. Yahoo! - ABC News Network", "President Donald Trump is in the final stretch of a 44-city blitz for the midterm elections, but the America he's glimpsed from the airport arrivals and his armored limousine is hardly a reflection of the nation as a whole.\n\nThe president has mostly traveled to counties that are whiter, less educated and have lower incomes than the rest of the United States, according to Census Bureau data. It's a sign that he is seeking to galvanize the same group of voters that helped carry him to victory in 2016.\n\nTrump has largely eschewed the big metropolises for smaller cities. He has been to Tampa, Nashville, Cleveland and Houston \u2014 where the arenas could accommodate his crowds. But he's primarily been jet-setting to smaller places such as Elko, Nevada (population 20,078). Or, Mosinee, Wisconsin (population 4,023). Or, Belgrade, Montana (population 7,874).\n\nWhen Trump stops at Belgrade on Saturday, historical records suggest he will be the second president to visit the Montana town named after Serbia's capital city. In 2009, Barack Obama held a town hall in Belgrade to promote the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSince March, Trump has crisscrossed the country like a salesman with a set territory. The majority of his trips have been to just nine states. They are Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, West Virginia and Nevada.\n\nTrump won eight of those states in 2016, but not Nevada. And this year, seven of them feature a major Senate race with a Democratic incumbent. The former casino magnate has visited one city twice for the midterms: Las Vegas.\n\nHere is a portrait of the America that the president is seeing:\n\nLOWER INCOMES\n\nTrump has journeyed to counties where it's slightly more of a struggle to reach and stay in the middle class.\n\nOut of his scheduled rallies, 74 percent are in counties with median incomes that fall below the national level. But he's brought tidings of a 49-year low unemployment rate and accelerated economic growth to places that mostly lag the median U.S. household income of $55,032.\n\nIn September, Trump went to Wheeling, West Virginia. The typical household income in the county surrounding Wheeling is $41,986, or about $13,000 below the national level. The metro area has lost 818 jobs in the 12 months that ended in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And for West Virginia, coal mine jobs have declined this year after a hiring bump in 2017.\n\n\"Your state is booming like never before,\" Trump told the crowd in Wheeling. \"And our great coal miners are back to work.\"\n\nTrump has visited a few affluent counties. He stopped by Rochester, Minnesota, where incomes are high because of the presence of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic. And during a special congressional election in August, the president campaigned in Delaware County, Ohio, where the median household income of $94,234 is just shy of being double the national average.\n\nFEWER COLLEGE DEGREES\n\nJust 18.1 percent of the adults in Elko County, Nevada hold a college degree. That's compared to 30.3 percent nationwide. Of the 43 places Trump is visiting, 28 have a below-average share of college graduates.\n\nElko's economy is unique because it relies on mining gold, instead of the office and health care jobs that often require a college diploma. The county has five active gold mines, according to the Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources. This makes it something of an outlier in country where mining metal ore accounts for 0.03 percent of all jobs.\n\nTrump went to Elko in part to help push for the re-election of Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who is in a tight race against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Heller flattered the president \u2014 and provided the lone reference to the local economy \u2014 by telling him, \"I think everything you touch turns to gold.\"\n\nWhen Trump has gone to more educated counties, it's often because they have a major college campus and venues where people can gather. Missoula is home to the University of Montana and 41.8 percent of its adults are college graduates. The University of Missouri is in Columbia, where 46.8 percent of adults hold college degrees.\n\nRACE\n\nOther than his rallies at big cities, Trump has generally been in communities that are overwhelmingly white. The U.S. population is 73.3 percent white, but almost three-fourths of the places where the president has stumped for midterms are above that average.\n\nIn the county surrounding Council Bluffs, Iowa, 88.7 percent of the population is non-Hispanic whites. Trump told the crowd at his rally that Democrats would allow Central American gangs such as MS-13 to immigrate freely into the United States, a claim disputed by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"They want to turn America, these Democrats \u2014 and that's what they want \u2014 into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the area around Council Bluffs, 6.1 percent of the population is of Mexican descent. About 1 percent are from other Hispanic nations. By comparison, 17.3 percent of the U.S. population is Hispanic.\n\nThe biggest outlier in Trump's schedule may be his rally Sunday in Macon, Georgia. Its county is 53.9 percent black, making it the lone place being visited by the president where minorities make up the majority of the population.\n\nTrump is going there to promote the gubernatorial candidacy of Republican Brian Kemp. He is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the first black female governor in U.S. history.", "North Korea has warned it could revive a state policy aimed at strengthening its nuclear arsenal if the United States does not lift economic sanctions against the country.\n\nThe statement released by the Foreign Ministry on Friday evening said North Korea could bring back its \"pyongjin\" policy of simultaneously advancing its nuclear force and economic development if the United States doesn't change its stance. The North sopped short of threatening to abandon ongoing nuclear negotiations with Washington.\n\nStill, it accused Washington of derailing commitments made by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump at their June summit in Singapore to work toward a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. It was the first time the North said it could potentially resume weapons tests and other development activities since Kim signaled a new state policy in April.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he plans to talk next week with his North Korean counterpart, apparently referring to senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol. Pompeo did not provide the location and date for the meeting, which will likely be focused on persuading North Korea to take firmer steps toward denuclearization and setting up a second summit between their leaders.\n\n\"A lot of work remains, but I'm confident that we will keep the economic pressure in place until such time as Chairman Kim fulfills the commitment he made to President Trump back in June in Singapore,\" Pompeo said.\n\nThe North Korean Foreign Ministry statement, released under the name of the director of the ministry's Institute for American Studies, said the \"improvement of relations and sanctions is incompatible.\"\n\n\"The U.S. thinks that its oft-repeated 'sanctions and pressure' leads to 'denuclearization.' We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea,\" it said. The ministry described the lifting of U.S.-led sanctions as corresponding action to the North's \"proactive and good-will measures,\" apparently referring to its unilateral suspension of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and closure of a nuclear testing ground.\n\nFollowing a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year, Kim shifted to diplomacy when he met with Trump between three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy.\n\nHowever, the North has been playing hardball since the summits, insisting that sanctions should be lifted before any progress in nuclear talks, which fueled doubts about whether Kim would ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nAhead of his first summit with Moon in April, Kim said the country should shift its focus to economic development as the \"pyongjin\" policy had achieved a \"great victory.\" He also declared that the North would stop nuclear and long-range missile tests. The North dismantled its nuclear testing ground in May, but didn't invite experts to observe and verify the event.\n\n\"If the U.S. keeps behaving arrogantly without showing any change in its stand, while failing to properly understand our repeated demand, the DPRK may add one thing to the state policy for directing all efforts to the economic construction adopted in April and as a result, the word 'pyongjin' may appear again,\" Friday's statement said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\"Pyongjin\" means \"dual advancement.\"\n\nMoon has described inter-Korean engagement as crucial to resolving the nuclear standoff. A large number of South Korean CEOs accompanied Moon in his September visit to Pyongyang, when he and Kim agreed to normalize operations at a jointly run factory park and resume South Korean visitors' travel to the North when possible, voicing optimism the international sanctions could end and allow such projects.\n\nBut South Korea's enthusiasm for engagement with its rival has also created discomfort in the United States amid growing concerns that the North is dragging its feet with its promise to denuclearize. South Korea last month walked back on a proposal to lift some of its unilateral sanctions against North Korea to create diplomatic space following Trump's blunt retort that Seoul could \"do nothing\" without Washington's approval.", "A man who took on a rampaging gunman who killed two people and wounded four others at a Florida yoga studio says he grabbed the first makeshift weapon he could find and sprang into action when the attacker's gun appeared to jam.\n\nJoshua Quick is being praised by police and survivors of Friday's shooting in Tallahassee, who say his intervention gave them enough time to escape.\n\nQuick said he grabbed a vacuum cleaner that was in the studio and confronted alleged gunman Scott Paul Beierle.\n\n\"The gun stopped firing, I don't know if it jammed or what. So I used that opportunity to hit him over the head with it [the vacuum],\" Quick told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Sunday.\n\nBeierle pistol-whipped Quick, who was left with bruises and scratches over this left eye and nose from the confrontation. Quick said he fell to the floor but got back up and went after the alleged killer again.\n\n\"I jumped up as quickly as I could, ran back over and the next thing I know I'm grabbing a broom, you know, anything I can and I hit him again,\" Quick said.\n\nWTXL\n\nBy the time police arrived, Beierle was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nDaniela Garcia Albalat, who was shot in the thigh during the incident, told \"GMA\" that Quick saved her life and the lives of others.\n\n\"Thanks to him I was able to try to rush out of the door. I was slipping, I was dripping blood everywhere because I got shot through my thigh,\" Albalat said. \"I want to thank that guy from the bottom of my heart because he saved my life.\"\n\nThe shooting broke out about 6 p.m. Friday at the Hot Yoga Tallahassee studio. Tallahassee police said Beierle entered the studio posing as a customer then removed a gun from a duffle bag and started shooting without warning.\n\nKilled were Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 41, a member of the faculty at Florida State University College of Medicine, and Maura Binkley, a 21-year-old Florida State student, police said.\n\n\"Several people fought back and tried not only to save themselves, but other people, which is a testament to the courage of the people who don't just turn and run but the strength of our community and the spirit of those people trying to help and save and protect others,\" Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said at a press conference Friday night.\n\nLeon County Sheriffs Office/AP\n\nPolice are still trying to determine a motive for the shooting. Investigators said Beierle apparently had no prior connection to the yoga class and that he lived in Deltona, Florida, about 250 miles from Tallahassee.\n\nBeierle had been employed as a substitute teacher with the Volusia County, Florida, School District until May 25, when he was accused of misconduct at a middle school, officials said.\n\n\"He was immediately let go,\" Kelly Schultz, a school district spokeswoman, told ABC affiliate station WFTV in Orlando.\n\nSchultz said Beierle had been issued a teaching certificate in July 2015 by the Florida Department of Education and that he passed all federal and criminal background checks. He was hired by the Volusia County School District in January 2017.\n\nBeierle had served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2010, according to military records. Prior to enlisting in the Army, Beierle taught English and social studies at a high school in Fort Meade, Maryland, said Bob Mosier, spokesman for the Anne Arundel Public School District in Maryland.\n\nCourt records show Beierle had several run-ins with police.\n\nHe was charged in 2016 with battery after he allegedly slapped and grabbed a woman's buttocks at an apartment complex swimming pool, according to records. The charges were eventually dismissed after Beierle complied with conditions of a deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nBeierle was also charged with battery in 2012 when he was accused of grabbing another woman's rear in a Florida State University campus dining hall, records show. Beierle denied grabbing the woman, according to an FSU police report.\n\n\u201c \u201d I don't know if [the gun] jammed or what was going on, but...that's when I picked up the only thing nearby to hit him with, which was a vacuum cleaner, and I hit him over the head.\n\nFlorida State University president John Thrasher expressed condolences to the victims' families in a statement.\n\n\"There are no words to express the shock and grief we feel after learning of the deaths of Maura Binkley and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem,\" Thrasher said. \"To lose one of our students and one of our faculty members in this tragic and violent way is just devastating to the FSU family. We feel this loss profoundly and we send our deepest sympathies to Maura's and Nancy's loved ones while we pray for the recovery of those who were injured.\"\n\nVan Vessem was also the chief medical director at Capital Health Plan.\n\n\"Our Capital Health Plan family is deeply shocked and saddened about the tragic loss of our beloved friend and colleague, Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, among the other victims of this terrible incident,\" CHP said in a statement. \"Nancy has been a guiding light, visionary force in our daily work to serve the wellness and health care needs of thousands of families in this community.\n\n\"Her dedication, caring, leadership, humanity, and experience made her one of the most respected, accomplished medical professionals in the state and country,\" the statement continued. \"Our hearts are filled with sorrow and prayers for her family. We all have been so blessed to have Nancy in our lives.\"\n\nBinkley's father, Jeff Binkley, told ABC News that his daughter planned to be a teacher.\n\n\"Maura truly lived a life really devoted to peace, love [and] caring for others,\" Jeff Binkley said.\n\nThe other victims in the shooting suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were treated at hospitals, officials said.\n\nAs our community continues to mourn the tragic loss of Dr. Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley we invite you to join us for a Celebration of Life service tomorrow from 3pm - 5pm at Goodwood Museum to remember those you\u2019ve loved and lost. #TallyStrong https://t.co/aDEsQuAx8k \u2014 Tallahassee Memorial (@TMHFORLIFE) November 3, 2018\n\nTallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is the Democratic candidate for Florida governor, was campaigning in Miami with former President Barack Obama earlier in the day Friday and returned to his home city to visit the two hospitalized victims that night.\n\n\"Both were in surprisingly encouraging spirits,\" Gillum said at a campaign rally in Orlando on Saturday. \"There was one victim in particular that pulled me in close and said, 'I'm expecting you to do something about this gun violence.'\"\n\nGillum has touted his opposition to the National Rifle Association throughout his campaign and favors increased gun control measures.\n\n\"The memories of Pulse nightclub still reside with all of us.

Three smaller ones are following behind it.\n\nTrump's recent statements include that he plans to sign an order that could lead to the detention of migrants crossing the southern border, and barring anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum. Both propositions are legally dubious. Trump also said he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \"rifles.\"\n\n\"It is pure ignorance for him to think like that,\" said Marta Cuellos, a 40-year-old from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. \"A rock is not the same as a rifle.\"\n\nWhile some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home. Those traveling through the southern state of Oaxaca on Friday said they are not looking for trouble.\n\nCuellos said she owned a cantina back home in Honduras but left because she could no longer make rent and was being harassed by police. She persuaded her 35-year-old sister to join her on the trip, and said the only thing they want is work and a better life in the United States. It's her second attempt. She first crossed into the U.S. seven years ago but was deported last year.\n\nSelvin Maldonado, a 25-year-old from Copan, Honduras, said he left his wife and baby daughter at home in search of a better living to support his children. He took his 5-year-old son, Dennys, with him.\n\n\"What Trump said is stupid,\" Maldonado said while walking to the town of Donaji. \"I don't want to attack police, because my concern is my son.\"\n\nThe migrants also were also turned off by the U.S. president's characterization of the slow-moving caravan and the three smaller ones following as \"invasion.\" Trump has proposed detaining migrants in massive tent cities at the border.\n\n\"We are not killers,\" said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the first caravan. \"We just want to work for a few years, and after that he can deport us if he wants.\"\n\nLopez noted that the president's mother, who was born in Scotland, was an immigrant.\n\n\"He should think of us as equals. Immigrants have built that country,\" she said.\n\nIn June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that domestic and gang violence would generally no longer be accepted as reasons for migrants to be granted asylum. Trump has said this week that those in the caravan would not get asylum \u2014 though U.S. law allows them the right to apply \u2014 and warned them to turn around.\n\nThe Trump administration's vehement opposition and tough rhetoric has at least some in the caravan weighing alternatives.\n\nTifany Morandis, 19, was traveling with her husband, 28-year-old Javier Sanchez, and their two sons, 7-year-old Angel and 9-month-old Cesar. Her nose and face sun-scorched after many days on the road, she said she was very tired and is considering stopping in Tijuana, the Mexican border city across from San Diego.\n\n\"Donald Trump has made things very complicated at the border, and better that we stay in Tijuana than fight with him,\" Morandis said.\n\nBut many are hopeful. \"Even stones can soften,\" Cuellos said.", "Now Playing: 'House of Cards' production to resume without Kevin Spacey\n\nNow Playing: Kevin Spacey faces new allegations from 'House of Cards' crew\n\nNow Playing: Oscar-winning writer William Goldman has died at the age of 87\n\nNow Playing: Top 10 STEM toys for the holidays\n\nNow Playing: 'Widows' cast discuss how their characters in the movie empowered them\n\nNow Playing: Viral 'Thank You Being a Friend' star sings for 'GMA Day'\n\nNow Playing: 'Scandal' star Tony Goldwyn is playing another president in his new Broadway show\n\nNow Playing: Sara Haines met Jude Law when she was an intern and it didn't go as planned\n\nNow Playing: Cynthia Erivo on 'Widows' and how fitness training helps balance her life\n\nNow Playing: Amy Schumer hospitalized with hyperemesis during second trimester of pregnancy\n\nNow Playing: Tessa Thompson shares secrets from behind the scenes of the Marvel universe\n\nNow Playing: Maddie Poppe reveals 1st contestant to make it to Hollywood on new season of 'Idol'\n\nNow Playing: Insomniac Theater: 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' and 'Instant Family'\n\nNow Playing: Roy Clark passes away\n\nNow Playing: Viral superstar 'Side-Eye Chloe' is inducted into 'GMA Day' Hall of Fame\n\nNow Playing: 'Sons of Anarchy' star Ron Perlman hilariously shows off his soap opera skills\n\nNow Playing: Brian Tyree Henry discusses his role in new thriller 'Widows'\n\nNow Playing: 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' star Kandi Burruss visits Times Square\n\nNow Playing: Mahershala Ali on how his movie 'Green Book' details a part of civil rights history", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight currently gives the Democrat a 5 in 6 chance to win the seat on Tuesday.\n\nOn Halloween day, Pappas toured a rubber manufacturing plant in the town of Rochester to highlight the importance of job training and technical skills, telling ABC News \"I run every campaign like I\u2019m five votes behind, and we\u2019re just sprinting through the finish.\"\n\nWhen asked about the district's political indecision, Pappas said it's in New Hampshire's nature to look at candidates not solely through the prism of partisanship.\n\n.@GlobeOpinion endorsement in the 'swingiest' district in America: Chris Pappas for New Hampshire\u2019s First District https://t.co/oJIHIqdDqM cc @ChrisPappasNH \u2014 Shirley Leung (@leung) November 3, 2018\n\n\"Most voters are Independents.

And we\u2019ve seen a very divisive couple years in this country in part because of the statements and policies of this President,\" Pappas said, \"I think it\u2019s important that we have checks and balances in Washington, that we look for ways to bring people together and create a conversation about the priorities of the voters and not get into the sort of name-calling and baseless attacks that people are just sick and tired of.\"", "Already have an account? sign in\n\nCreate an ABC Account to get the most of your ABC experience\n\nSign Out\n\nAre you sure you want to sign out?\n\nBy signing out, you will not be able to resume watching content where you left off, enjoy cross-device viewing experience, or save your favorites to your My List.\n\nsign out", "External links are provided for reference purposes.

Polls indicate Abrams and Kemp are virtually tied.\n\n\"Georgia, be unafraid,\" he implored the largely African-American audience.\n\nKemp, Georgia's top election official as current secretary of state, lost his attempt to block a court's order to allow ballots with mismatched signatures just earlier in the day.\n\n\"You win the right to vote, folks are still trying to take it away,\" Obama exclaimed. \"That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing in Georgia right now.\u201d\n\nAP\n\nHe riled up the crowd by citing from a snippet of audio published by Rolling Stone in October which appears to have captured Kemp saying Abrams' voter-turnout efforts \"is something that continues to concern us especially if everybody uses and exercises their right to vote, which they absolutely can.\"\n\nObama claimed Kemp's remark suggested a contempt with voting rights, which the Republican has fervently denied.\n\n\u201c \u201d Georgia, be unafraid.\n\nThe two-term president said Tuesday's midterms \"may be the most important election of our lifetime.\"\n\n\"And that\u2019s saying something because some of those elections were mine,\" he added.\n\nHe called Republican political actions and rhetoric damaging the country and encouraged his audience to vote Democrat up and down the ballot.\n\n\"The character of our country is on the ballot.\"\n\nLaying out a vision for Georgia, Obama endorsed some pillars of Abrams' campaign promises, including increased investment in public education, expanding Obamacare and investing in the state's transportation infrastructure.\n\nHe tore into efforts in Washington, D.C., to repeal the Affordable Care Act and called out Republican flip-flops on pre-existing conditions.\n\nAP\n\nPolicy often takes center stage at Abrams events, but Obama, without naming President Trump or congressional leaders, focused on inflammatory rhetoric and political string-pulling just prior to the midterms.\n\n\"The biggest threat to America? The biggest threat, is some impoverished refuges a thousand miles away?\" he said referencing the \"caravan\" of migrants from Central American making their way through Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cNow they're sending our brave troops. Who by the way, by the wall cannot enforce laws on our natural soil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe men and women of our military deserve better than that.\"\n\nBefore concluding, he moved on to the President's surprising, and false, claim that he can use an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the United States, a constitutional right for Americans.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan strayed from president in an interview earlier this week, saying birthright citizenship cannot be taken away via executive order.\n\nTrump will be in Georgia on Sunday rallying for Brian Kemp.", "External links are provided for reference purposes.

But one champ is back home in Wyoming. And he's our person of the week. This week, the red sox won the world series. We now welcome this year's essay contest winner Jesse quist, a tenth grade student from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Reporter: He was chosen from among 13,000 entries. He wrote about his hero, Jackie Robinson. Respect for him that was he was able to stomach all that he handled, everything that was thrown at him. He stomached it and just went out and played baseball. And showed the world that he deserved to be in the MLB. Reporter: Adopted from Korea by a loving family of ten. He does the chores like everyone else. My job is when I get up in the morning I just let the dog out, I feed her, I feed myself. Do the dishes every day. Reporter: He rides a bike, plays soccer, runs track, builds with legos and uses a laptop. And watch as Jesse plays in his first ever basketball game with his team. He told us about his biggest challenge. Definitely the way people react to seeing me. You don't usually see an armless kid every day. Everywhere I go I'm going to get stared at, pointed at. Reporter: Jesse wrote about it in his essay. It can be very frustrating knowing that everywhere you go there will always be someone whispering about you. There's no doubt in my mind Jackie Robinson experienced the same thing. I have become adept in the last few years to ignoring the stares, but I still know they're there. I have a huge family with seven siblings to help me along. They have my back and I have theirs. Reporter: And Jesse, the other world series champ, left us with this.

Yahoo! - ABC News Network", "Amid a new push to finally end the war in Yemen, the United Kingdom is planning to introduce a United Nations Security Council resolution to support that effort, according to a Security Council diplomat and two sources familiar with discussions.\n\nDays after the Trump administration announced a 30-day deadline to reach a ceasefire, it's another sign that after nearly four years of devastating fighting, food shortages and starvation, and disease, there is a real push underway by Western powers to bring the conflict to an end following years of support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates' fight against Houthi rebels.\n\nOne source familiar with discussions said that the U.K. and the U.S. are serious about working toward this new push for peace, and that the British could introduce the resolution as soon as next week.\n\nIt's unclear what specifically the resolution would require, but one source said it would call for a humanitarian ceasefire and the safe passage of food and other aid, for support for the cratering Yemeni economy, and on both sides to fully engage with the U.N. Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths.\n\nThe war between the Houthis, supported by Iran, and the Yemeni government, boosted by U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, has killed at least 16,200 civilians, sparked a deadly cholera outbreak, and now brought 14 million people to the brink of famine, according to the United Nations.\n\nThere may have been a breakthrough this week, however, when the U.S. called for a ceasefire within 30 days and all parties to come to the next round of U.N. peace talks.\n\nBut there is some concern the new demands could be pushing for too much too quickly.\n\nMohammed Huwais/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTwo sources said Special Envoy Griffiths has expressed doubts about how helpful a new resolution is or whether it could be an obstacle by demanding unrealistic conditions like a complete cessation of hostilities. In an interview Friday, he hinted at that reservation himself, telling CNN, \"I don't want to see us getting stuck on things that are difficult to put together... A nationwide ceasefire is obviously a wonderful and marvelous thing... but I don't want to make that the precondition for consultations and talks, which we hope to hold later this month.\"\n\nThe U.N. does already have a resolution in place from April 2015 that demands \"all parties in the embattled country, in particular the Houthis, immediately and unconditionally end violence.\" Some believe an additional resolution is unnecessary.\n\nIn fact, the U.K. Minister of State for the Middle East Alistair Burt told Parliament on Tuesday, \"Passing a ceasefire resolution risks undercutting the U.N. envoy's efforts to reach a political deal and undermining the credibility of the Council.\"\n\n\"As soon as the right opportunity arises, we will bring forward a resolution,\" he added.\n\nThat opportunity may have come hours later when the Trump administration announced a shift in its policy -- what the president of the International Rescue Committee called \"the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen in four years.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWhile both sides in the nearly four-year-old war have been accused of war crimes, the Saudi-led coalition has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilians and even targeting civilian infrastructure to exacerbate the humanitarian toll. Still, the Obama and now Trump administrations in the U.S. have supported the coalition militarily with mid-air refueling for warplanes, conducting reconnaissance, and providing training.\n\nThat support shifted, at least slightly, on Tuesday, when Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an immediate end to hostilities in back-to-back statements. Mattis said the U.S. wanted to see the parties \"around a peace table based on a ceasefire, based on a pullback from the border and then ceasing dropping of bombs\" within 30 days.\n\nPompeo echoed that in a statement two hours later, calling for the Houthis to first stop threatening Saudi Arabia and the UAE and then those two countries to halt their airstrike campaign.\n\nHouthi leadership hesitantly welcomed the statements on Thursday. But senior rebel leader Mohammed Ali al-Houthi rejected the sequencing the U.S. laid out, saying they should \"translate their desire to bring peace in Yemen into action, stop the bombing of Yemenis immediately, and lift the siege on Yemen,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nThat may be why, instead, Griffiths said \"the urgent need now\" is \"downing the temperature of the war while we move towards talks.\" There is a push behind the scenes now to do that, he added, such as by opening a humanitarian pipeline for relief aid -- a smaller scale step that the British may push for the U.N. Security Council to endorse in their resolution next week.", "Transcript for Trump admits Republicans could lose House\n\nUnder Republican leadership America is booming America is right they.

Tonight, the democratic senators in states where Donald Trump won handily, many of them siding with the president with key issues. But one telling us breaking with him on Brett Kavanaugh may cost her her job. Here's Mary Bruce. Reporter: From West Virginia, to North Dakota, and Missouri, in the states won by Donald Trump, senate Democrats are now fighting to hold on to their jobs. For Joe Manchin, that means walking a fine line. I stand up and support him when it's good for west Virginia. And when it's not, I stand up to him. Reporter: In Missouri, Claire Mccaskill is eager to show she's willing to take on her fellow Democrats. Just listen to her closing ad. Claire is not afraid to stand up against her own party. Yup. And Claire is not one of those crazy Democrats. Reporter: But in north Dakota, a state trump won by a whopping 36 points, Heidi Heitkamp broke with the president on a key issue just one month before the election -- voting against his supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. This isn't a political decision. If this were a political decision for me, I certainly would be deciding this the other way. But, you know, there's an old saying, \"History will judge you, but most importantly, you will judge yourself.\" And that's really what I'm saying. I can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had, and say yes to judge Kavanaugh. Reporter: It's a decision she knows could cost her her job. If it all comes down to that decision for some voters, was it worth it? Yup. Reporter: No regrets? No. I have no regrets. Reporter: Her Republican opponent, Kevin Cramer, is banking on a Kavanaugh bounce. We are fortunate that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed even without one of our senators voting for him. Reporter: But Heitkamp says this race comes down to the issues that most impact the rural voters here, like health care and the economy. But now, in the fight of her political life, she told me this. Millions of people in this country live without being a United States senator. It's not the end all and be all. I hope I'm given a chance to serve my country again.
