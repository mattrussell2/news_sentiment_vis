["Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions in the U.S. today, with almost 30.3 million of people suffering from difficulties in managing their blood sugar.\n\nIt is the seventh leading cause of death, and the No. 1 leading cause of kidney failure, adult-onset blindness, and lower limb amputation.\n\nMost people with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes, which is often associated with lifestyle choices and genetics. It is the type of diabetes that is caused because the body has trouble using insulin properly or can't make enough.\n\nAbout 1.25 million suffer from Type 1 diabetes, which is an autoimmune disorder. It's the type of diabetes that is a result of the pancreases not making any insulin.\n\nLos Angeles Times via Getty Images, FILE\n\nBoth conditions result in difficulty regulating a body\u2019s glucose -- or sugar -- levels, but due to very different reasons.\n\nSince November is Diabetes Awareness Month, it is a good time to answer frequently asked questions about the disease.\n\nWhat is diabetes?\n\nSo let\u2019s start with what happens in a normal person without diabetes. When you eat a meal, your body begins to digest it into protein, sugar and fat.\n\nAn organ called the pancreas senses the absorbed sugar and produces a hormone called insulin, which then pulls the sugar -- or glucose -- from the food you just ate and into different parts of your body so that it can be used for energy.\n\nIn diabetes, your body either doesn\u2019t make enough insulin or can\u2019t use it as well as it should. If you don\u2019t have enough insulin, too much glucose stays in the bloodstream, which can cause serious health problems over time, such as heart disease, kidney disease or vision loss.\n\nWhat is the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes?\n\nType 1 Diabetes\n\nIn patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM), their pancreas is unable to produce insulin at all, due to an autoimmune condition whereby the body attacks itself. People are more frequently diagnosed when they are children or young adults, and symptoms often develop quickly. They may report feeling very thirsty, going to the bathroom very often, losing weight even though they eat normally, and feeling very exhausting.\n\nCDC\n\nPeople with T1DM need to take insulin every day to survive, and currently, there is no known way to prevent or cure T1DM. They need to check their blood glucose levels several times a day and at night, and give themselves insulin multiple times a day based on their body makeup, blood sugar and what they eat.\n\nCan I get T1DM?\n\nT1DM was previously thought to be only in children and was previously referred to as \u201cjuvenile diabetes,\u201d but we now know that young adults and even older adults can develop T1DM. It is not something contagious, or related to your lifestyle. Rather, it is an autoimmune condition, whereby your body develops antibodies against your own pancreas and gradually destroys the pancreas\u2019 ability to produce insulin.\n\nType 2 Diabetes\n\nIn patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), either the body has become resistant and needs more insulin or their pancreas is not making enough insulin. Their body has a hard time keeping the blood glucose at normal levels.\n\nT2DM is not caused by eating sugar itself, but by a variety of lifestyle factors and genetics.\n\nCan I get T2DM?\n\nThis is the more common adult form of diabetes, and unfortunately, the numbers of affected people, including children, in the U.S., continues to rise. This type of diabetes is associated with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or a family history of T2DM.\n\nCDC\n\nIf you have any of those conditions, it is important to see your primary care doctor regularly to be tested for diabetes.\n\nCan I tell if I have diabetes? How is it diagnosed?\n\nMost commonly, it is diagnosed with a blood test - either a high glucose level before you eat or something called a hemoglobin A1c, which is an average of your blood sugar over three months.\n\nIf your glucose level is high, you may feel symptoms like feeling thirsty all the time, urinating more than usual, weight loss, blurry vision or fatigue. Sometimes, people with Type 1 diabetes present very sick, with something called diabetic ketoacidosis, due to not having enough insulin in their body.\n\nThis can be a deadly condition that requires hospitalization to help correct the condition.\n\nIf you are on medications that can make your blood sugar go low, such as insulin, low blood sugar can result in sweating, shaking, uncharacteristic behavior, or disorientation. If it goes very low, it can even result in coma and death if not rapidly treated with glucose or a medication called glucagon.\n\nMario Anzuoni/Reuters, FILE\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, you should notify your doctor.\n\nHow do I treat diabetes? Is there a cure?\n\nUnfortunately, diabetes is a chronic illness with no cure. For people with Type 1 diabetes, the only treatment so far is insulin. For people with Type 2 diabetes, in addition to dietary changes, there are many medication options that vary from pills to injections.\n\nSome types of bariatric surgery may be helpful in decreasing the amount of medications people with T2DM need to take. There are many novel technologies being developed to help improve the daily lives of people with diabetes.\n\nAlthough Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are invisible to people who don\u2019t have it, having a blood sugar that is too high or too low can be very dangerous. But with good control and continual improvement in medication and technology, many people with diabetes are able to lead happy, fulfilling lives.\n\nTiffany Yeh, M.D., is an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "Nov. 11 marks Singles' Day in China, a day when sales have nearly doubled those from Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the U.S. -- combined!\n\nInterested in China?

It called Abrams' refusals to concede \"a disgrace to democracy\" that \"completely ignore the will of the people.\"\n\nBut members of civil rights groups including the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People held a small rally urging Abrams to keep fighting until every vote is counted.\n\n\"That is a promise she made,\" said Ben Williams, president of the Cobb County branch of the SCLC, founded by the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nErick Allen, a black Democrat newly elected to the Georgia House, said allegations of voter suppression and questions about Election Day problems could dog Kemp as governor if he eventually prevails.\n\n\"The erosion in trust is done,\" said Allen.\n\nAbrams is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in the United States, while Kemp is attempting to continue GOP dominance in a diversifying state that could be a battleground in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement Saturday afternoon, she said she had met with voters who experienced difficulties casting ballots. She said her campaign had heard stories of voters turned away from the polls, students and military members who requested absentee ballots that never arrived or were \"lost in the mail\" \u2014 and first-time and longtime voters who found their names were \"no longer on the list.\"\n\nShe vowed to continue to fight.\n\n\"I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,\" Abrams added.\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp with 50.3 percent of almost 4 million total votes, a roughly 63,000-vote lead over Abrams. The margin is enough for an outright Kemp victory if totals remain the same, but it's a tight race considering the large turnout. Abrams has argued that tens of thousands of provisional and military ballots could need to be counted before the race is over.\n\nThe Kemp campaign said a maximum of 17,495 provisional and military ballots remain to be counted. The Abrams campaign contends at least 30,823 votes remain, including nearly 27,000 provisional ballots; that could be enough to prompt a recount.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner. AP will reassess the race Tuesday, the deadline for counties to certify election results to the state.\n\nAbrams' supporters and volunteers made a push to get people who cast provisional ballots on Tuesday to provide information required to count their ballots by a Friday deadline, but it wasn't clear how many did so.\n\nThe Kemp campaign said it didn't matter because there were far too few outstanding ballots for Abrams to erase his lead.\n\nThe Abrams campaign attempted to reserve television advertising time in case she can make it into a runoff with Kemp that would be held Dec. 4, but Atlanta TV station WSB said it wouldn't accept any commercials until votes are certified.\n\nAfter each of Georgia's 157 counties certifies final returns by Tuesday, the state must certify a statewide result by Nov. 20.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Mayor Paul Heroux of Attleboro, Massachusetts held his dog Mura for the first time when she was just 8 weeks old.\n\n\u201cWe looked at each other when she was in a crate.

The groom wore the gray pants and white T-shirt required of inmates at La Tolva, the maximum-security prison where he has been held since January for protesting against repression in Honduras, the country from which the majority of the migrants in the so-called caravan making its way to the U.S. border have fled.\n\nKaren Spring, 34, and Edwin Espinal, 42, had never dreamed of a wedding day like this.\n\nBut on Oct. 18, they tied the knot in front of a few witnesses, including another political prisoner, and armed guards wearing balaclavas over their faces. Instead of being filled with hotel and rehearsal dinner information, the couple's wedding website shows the prison's stark gray buildings.\n\nCourtesy Karen Spring\n\n\"We weren't allowed to have a camera. I wasn't allowed to wear any jewelry,\" Spring told ABC News. \"Behind us, there were masked police officers and military. We got married in a hostile environment, but we tried to make the best of it.\"\n\nIn the months before their wedding, Spring and Espinal's visits had been sporadic. The phone service in the prison went down in April after a prison uprising, she said, and Espinal isn't allowed paper, so the couple communicates through notes he is able to scrawl on toilet paper with a contraband pen.\n\nSometimes, their approved visits last just two hours, sometimes as long as four. Spring said she brings Espinal four meals at a time and he eats them as quickly as he can. He has already lost 40 pounds in prison, she said, and is only allowed two hours of sunlight per month.\n\nThe couple's plans for starting a family have been put on hold as Espinal languishes in pre-trial detention in a facility usually reserved for violent criminals.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\n\"Edwin's conviction is really strong. If you talk to him, he says, 'I know why I'm here. I'm a political prisoner amongst really dangerous people in this jail. We were fighting for change in this country and going to jail was part of that process,'\" Spring said. \"He's really clear about it, and that gives me a lot of strength. It makes it easier, almost, because I know he has that strength.\"\n\nIn January, the Public Prosecutor's Office filed charges of arson and other damage to property, aggravated damage and using explosives and homemade incendiary devices against Espinal and fellow human rights defender Raul Ordonez, according to Amnesty International, and the two men appeared at an initial hearing on January 20 and 22 at a court that's usually reserved for organized crime cases.\n\nA spokesperson for the Public Prosecutor's Office declined to comment on Espinal's case at this time.\n\nMost of the migrants trying to reach the U.S. border are from Honduras, the country with one of the highest homicide rates in the world outside of a war zone. Nearly two thirds of people live in poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nIn 2016, U.N. experts called it \"one of the most hostile and dangerous countries for human rights defenders.\" Human rights defenders routinely \"suffer threats, attacks, and killings,\" a 2018 Human Rights Watch report found.\n\nIn November 2017, the country held a presidential election with widespread fraud and violence.\n\nThousands took to the streets to protest the re-election of Juan Orlando Hernandez, who changed the constitution to allow himself to run again. Espinal, who had previously been targeted for his activism and was granted precautionary measures in 2010 from the Organization of American States, was among them.\n\nThe government's \"response to the post-electoral protests led to serious human rights violations,\" according to the U.N.. Dozens were killed and more than a thousand were arrested, according to the U.N., including Espinal and Ordonez.\n\nAfter being arrested on charges of arson and other damage to property, Espinal and Ordonez appeared at an initial hearing before a court that's usually reserved for organized crime cases, according to Amnesty International. Since then, there has been a lack of transparency about the status of their cases and their lawyers have not been able to review important materials or meet with them regularly, Amnesty International found.\n\nSpring, a human rights defender from Canada who has lived in Honduras for years, said her husband's plight highlights the stark reality at home that has led many Hondurans to turn to their last resort -- fleeing north -- after trying to change their country through the ballot box.\n\n\"People are fleeing in the caravan because they know there is a significant cost here internally to protesting, so that's why they're fleeing to the U.S. border as an alternative to protest,\" Spring said. \"If they stay in Honduras and protest, they face the same conditions that Edwin and the 13 other political prisoners face, which is harsh conditions and basically no due process.\"\n\nSpring spoke with ABC News from the couple's home in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, about her hopes for their future and why she understands the migrants' journey.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\nWhat made you decide to get married now?\n\nSpring: Edwin and I have been together for almost nine years and we had never gotten married because it was never something that was important to me. Not the level of commitment to him but the actual act of signing a paper. Mostly, it was a demonstration of my commitment to him and getting him out and to keep fighting for his freedom and that of Raul Alvarez and the other political prisoners in the country.\n\nFor me, it was a commitment to continue fighting for him and to take care of things that he can't do for himself because he is in prison, and the accompaniment of the other families of political prisoners. So it was a commitment to him as my partner and a commitment to the bonds of how we met, the way that our relationship has grown and developed over time largely because of our compa\u00f1erismo in the struggle in Honduras.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\nHow has your relationship mirrored or coincided with some of the big human rights struggles in the country since the 2009 coup?\n\nSpring: I hope I don't cry. I met Edwin shortly after his partner, Wendy Avila, was killed during a big eviction and repression outside of the Brazilian embassy when overthrown President Manuel Zelaya snuck back into the country shortly after the coup and had to seek refuge inside the embassy. So I met Edwin a couple of months after he buried Wendy. She died of respiratory problems after the gassing and repression outside of the embassy.\n\nThen through the almost nine years that we have been together, we have worked together in the movement. He did a lot of work in an urban neighborhood where he grew up, which is considered one of the most dangerous and gang-controlled neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa. I accompanied him in a lot of his struggles to stop privatization of public spaces for youth in his neighborhood, especially recreational spaces where kids went and played basketball and soccer.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\nEdwin was a very close friend of [murdered environmental activist] Berta Caceres. We both rushed to La Esperanza as a response to her assassination. Edwin was constantly by her side, especially when she was concerned for her security.\n\nThe ups and downs of our relationship and his personal life have really been entwined with the major moments of the struggles of the social movements in Honduras. Him being arrested almost two months after the 2017 elections where there was widespread fraud is just another way that our relationship has become more strengthened through his struggles and our struggles. But it also shows how much political persecution he faces as a result of his longtime activism in Honduras and demand for change here.\n\nWhat were the circumstances surrounding his arrest?\n\nSpring: Edwin has faced nine years of persecution, so he was one of the targets of the government and has been for a really long time. When there were widespread reports of fraud after the elections in November 2017, they were met with widespread protests all around the country, maybe even more than after the 2009 coup. The country was literally shut down and it was the way the people were expressing their deep discontent with the policies of the current government of Juan Orlando Hernandez, but also the policies he implemented, which dramatically changed the practical, everyday lives of Hondurans. Privatization meant higher prices of electricity, there was no medication in hospitals, people associated with the government robbed a lot of money in the healthcare system.\n\nCourtesy Karen Spring\n\nSo thousands and thousands took to the streets and Edwin was one of them to protest allegations of fraud. There was a belief that the votes of Honduran people were not being respected. There was a military curfew imposed, hundreds of people arrested and then released. Edwin was arrested on allegations of being part of a protest on January 12 that was called by the opposition, who were demanding respect for their votes, and that Juan Orlando Hernandez step down because his re-election was illegal.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\nThey planned a big protest in Tegucigalpa. During that protest, there were several incidences of property damage. So Edwin was one of two people who were arrested and thrown in a maximum security prison on charges of property damage. It was very clear how much the government had targeted him throughout the whole process of the elections to arrest him and put him in jail. The disproportionate use of force against protesters and the harsh punishment used on people arrested for protesting was very clear when you look at the fact that there were only 30 people killed in those protests and only one police officer charged with killing.\n\nOksana Szostak\n\nThe caravan has brought some of these longstanding issues in Honduras to the forefront. Why are people fleeing now?\n\nSpring: Hondurans saw protesting during the 2017 electoral crisis as a way to address poverty, corruption, drug trafficking, the mafia state, impunity, and the murders of environmentalists, lawyers and journalists. When the U.S. government and Canada and came out shortly before Christmas recognizing the election and ignoring the protests, ignoring the murders in the street, ignoring the severe crackdown on Hondurans who were demanding real democracy and respect for their votes, Hondurans have basically used the caravan as their potentially last option to raise serious concerns that they cannot live in Honduras anymore.\n\nThere are about 300 people who leave the country quietly per day in Honduras, and it's not something that hits the media, but it's something that's been going on a long time. But they see the caravan as a way of saying, 'Well, if the U.S. wants to keep propping up a government that doesn't work for us, that we don't want, then our only option is to flee to the border, and we'll do it in mass numbers.' So that's what the caravan is doing ... It's another strategy, planned or not, to raise the issue that they can't live in their own country anymore.\n\nCourtesy Karen Spring\n\nDo you hope to have another wedding ceremony when Edwin is released?\n\nSpring: Definitely. That was one of the things we decided: we were going to really wait to celebrate our marriage until he is free and he's out and we want to celebrate it on our own terms, not on the terms imposed on us by the Honduran government and the maximum security prison. We will definitely have a celebration. It's difficult for us to talk about it because we have very little communication -- there are no phones in the prison -- but we want to celebrate with people in the movement and the people who have kept the issue of political prisoners as a relevant national theme. The people who have been next to us since the 2009 coup. We will definitely celebrate. We are hoping that all of the political prisoners will be freed.\n\nCourtesy Karen Spring\n\nWhat will you do when he is released?\n\nSpring: This has been one of the hardest and most difficult experiences of my life. As I have been fighting for his freedom, I have faced persecution from the government as well. They have tried very hard to silence me and the campaign. And it's so hard to imagine what it will be like to have him free. But one of the things we want to do is just spend time together. To have an opportunity to talk and spend time together in a warm environment that isn't cement walls and handcuffs and locked doors. So I think I just look forward to him being able to be outside, for us to spend time together, have him at home, the everyday stuff. Just to have him around, that's what I want.\n\nEditor's note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "Two people were found dead as a pair of wildfires stretched from inland canyons to the Pacific in Southern California on Saturday, leaving people sifting through the remains of both mansions and modest homes for anything they had left.\n\nThe two bodies were found severely burned inside a car on a long residential driveway in Malibu, Los Angeles County sheriff's Chief John Benedict said.

No new growth was reported on the larger of the two fires, which stands at 109 square miles (282 square kilometers), and firefighters now have the blaze 5 percent contained.\n\nProgress also came against the smaller fire, prompting Ventura County officials to allow people in a handful of communities to return to their homes.\n\nHundreds of thousands across the region remain under evacuation orders, and could stay that way for days as winds pick up again.\n\nOsby said losses to homes were significant but did not say how many had burned.

Doctors cheered the results and said they could suggest a new treatment option for hundreds of thousands of patients like these.\n\nUp to 10 percent of U.S. adults take fish oil . Even more take vitamin D , despite no major studies to support the many health claims made for it.\n\n\"Those who peddle it promote it as good for everything,\" but in this definitive test, vitamin D \"showed a big nothing,\" said Dr. James Stein, a heart specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He had no role in the studies or ties to the companies involved.\n\nResults were revealed Saturday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nABOUT FISH OIL\n\nThese oils, also called omega-3 fatty acids, are found in salmon, tuna and certain other fish. They reduce triglycerides and inflammation and may have other effects . There are different types, including EPA and DHA.\n\nOne study tested 4 grams a day of Amarin Corp.'s prescription Vascepa, which is concentrated EPA, in more than 8,000 patients with high triglycerides and a greater risk of heart problems for various reasons. All were already taking a statin such as Lipitor or Zocor to lower cholesterol. Half were given Vascepa and the rest, mineral oil capsules as a comparison.\n\nAfter five years, about 17 percent of those on Vascepa had suffered one of these problems \u2014 a heart attack, stroke, heart-related death or clogged arteries requiring medical care \u2014 versus 22 percent of the others.\n\nThat worked out to a 25 percent reduction in risk. Looked at individually, heart attacks, heart-related deaths and strokes all were lower with Vascepa. Only 21 people would need to take Vascepa for five years to prevent one of the main problems studied \u2014 favorable odds, Stein said.\n\nSide effects may be a concern: More people on Vascepa were hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat \u2014 3 percent versus 2 percent of the comparison group. Doctors say that's puzzling because other research suggests fish oil lowers that risk.\n\nThe concern with the heart rhythm problem is that it can raise the risk of stroke, but there were fewer strokes among those on Vascepa, said study leader Dr. Deepak Bhatt of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nVascepa costs around $280 a month; many insurers cover it. Amarin sponsored the study and some study leaders work or consult for the company.\n\nA BROADER TEST\n\nThe other study tested a lower 1 gram daily dose of a different type of fish oil \u2014 an EPA/DHA combo sold as Lovaza or Omacor and in generic form \u2014 in 26,000 people with no prior heart problems or cancer.\n\nAfter about five years, rates of a combined measure of heart attacks, strokes and other problems were similar for fish oil users and a comparison group. Cancer rates and deaths also were similar.\n\nThere were fewer heart attacks in the fish oil group \u2014 145 versus 200 in the comparison group. The study leader, Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's, called that \"a substantial benefit,\" but several independent experts disagreed because of the way the study was set up to track this and certain other results.\n\n\"These findings are speculative and would need to be confirmed in a separate trial,\" said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen.\n\nFISHY COMPARISONS?\n\nBoth studies share a problem: the oils used for the comparison groups, which may not have been true placebos. The Vascepa study used mineral oil, which interferes with statin drugs, raises cholesterol, and might have made the comparison group fare worse and made Vascepa look better than it truly was.\n\nThe other study used olive oil, which might have helped that comparison group do better, possibly masking any benefit to the others from fish oil.\n\nLeaders of both studies say any effect from the comparison oils isn't enough to alter the main results, and independent experts agreed. But Nissen, who is leading another fish oil study, is using corn oil as a comparison.\n\nTHE 'SUNSHINE' VITAMIN\n\nManson's study also tested vitamin D, which the skin makes from sun exposure. It's tough to get enough from foods like milk, eggs and oily fish, though many foods now are fortified with it. Some studies have found that people with lower levels of D are more likely to develop cancer, but it's not known if supplements alter that risk.\n\nStudy participants took 2,000 international units of D-3 (the most active form of vitamin D, also called cholecalciferol) or fake vitamin pills for five years.\n\nVitamin D did not affect the odds of having a heart attack or stroke or developing cancer. After excluding the first two years of use, researchers saw fewer cancer deaths among those on the vitamin \u2014 112 versus 149 in the placebo group.\n\n\"Cancer can take years to develop\" so a difference may not show up right away, Manson said. \"This looks promising\" and people will be studied longer to see if the trend holds up, she said.\n\nSeveral other experts said these numbers just hint at a possible benefit that needs more study.\n\n\"These 'positive' results need to be interpreted with caution,\" Dr. Clifford Rosen of Maine Medical Center Research Institute and Dr. John Keaney Jr. of the University of Massachusetts wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

But without the leader of the world's only remaining superpower, the forum will lose some of its sense.\n\nEurope feels deeply threatened, meanwhile, by Trump's declared plan to pull the U.S. out a nuclear treaty with Russia that Europeans see as a cornerstone of post-Cold War peace and their own security. The U.S. says Russia is violating it anyway.\n\nThe tension overshadowed the two presidents' latest meeting Saturday at the French presidential palace. A French official present at the meeting said Macron made the point that in making decisions about treaties like the one Trump said he would abandon, the U.S. \"should not forget something under your nose, which is European allies.\"\n\nMost Americans have never heard of the treaty that's being scrapped, but it has a clear meaning for European policymakers. The 1987 Intermediary-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty grew out of years of friction over a Soviet nuclear buildup and a threatened retaliatory U.S. missile deployment in Europe.\n\nMacron has warned that if the treaty is scrapped and Russia resumes building the kind of missiles it banned, the weapons could easily reach European targets \u2014 but not the U.S.\n\nAnother sore point for Macron and Trump: the question of a joint European army, which Macron has championed but which could overlap with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nMacron said in an interview this week with Europe-1 radio that when it comes to the cyber-sphere and the threat to pull out of nuclear treaties, \"We should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States.\"\n\nLater in the interview, the French leader talked about a European army. Trump lumped the two topics together and tweeted as Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night that it was \"insulting\" Macron wanted an army to defend Europe from the U.S.\n\nTrump's tweet was especially wounding to Macron, one of the strongest U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nThe idea that Macron would see the United States as an adversary \"is totally against our alliance and our 250-year history. France and the U.S. have been side by side,\" another French official said, evoking World War I battlefields where U.S. and French soldiers fought on the same side and the nations' joint operation against Syria earlier this year.\n\nWhen Macron first took power, he expressed hope that he might be able to have a restraining influence on Trump, then newly elected like him.\n\nBut by pulling the United States out of a climate-change deal signed in Paris and other international deals that France embraces \u2014 and now, with his undiplomatic tweet before meeting Macron \u2014 Trump has made clear that the French leader is not holding the reins.\n\nMacron and his aides scrambled Saturday to clarify what the president views as the threats Europe faces today. Among them: Russia's political meddling and military buildup, as well as a sense that Trump is abandoning U.S. commitments to European allies.\n\nMacron pointed out that he pledged to boost France's military spending even before Trump upbraided NATO members last year for not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe tense exchange with Trump is just the latest challenge for Macron, who was seen as a bulwark against rising European nationalism when he was elected a year ago.\n\nThe pro-business, pro-EU president is increasingly weakened domestically for unpopular economic policies and isolated in Europe, where nationalist groups have gained ground.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

No rock star has ever tried so hard to un-ring the bell of fame.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the songs,\u201d he told Newsweek in 1997. \u201cIt\u2019s like somebody expecting Shakespeare to be Hamlet, or Goethe to be Faust.\"\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not prepared for fame, there\u2019s really no way you can imagine what a crippling thing it can be,\u201d Dylan said.\n\nYet nowhere in Dylan\u2019s expansive back catalog has he seemed so nakedly honest -- and nowhere have fans felt closer to grasping the true heart of the \u2018real\u2019 Bob Dylan -- than the release of his searing, 1975 masterpiece, \"Blood on the Tracks.\u201d\n\nOne of Rolling Stone magazine's top 20 greatest albums in rock history, \"Blood on the Tracks\" charts the emotional spectrum of a romance on the rocks, elevating the intimacies of a love affair into piercing pop poetry.\n\n\u201c \u201d He said he was dying to find out how Dylan did it.\n\nRaw, intimate and poignant, the album debuted a bounty of durable Dylan classics -- from \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate\" and \"Shelter From the Storm\" to \"Idiot Wind,\" \"You\u2019re a Big Girl Now\" and \"If You See Her, Say Hello.\"\n\nThese are some of the indelible Dylan compositions that the Nobel Prize in Literature committee must have contemplated when they anointed Dylan rock's lone Nobel laureate in 2016.\n\n'More Blood, More Tracks'\n\nSo this month\u2019s release of the entire existing archive of studio outtakes and unreleased versions of songs from \"Blood on the Tracks\" has generated some feverish anticipation among his fans.\n\nThe new, 87-track, six-CD boxed set, \"More Blood, More Tracks\" -- and it\u2019s more affordable, 11-song, best-of CD -- was worth the 43-year wait.\n\nSome of the newly-released tracks are even more bracing than the tracks from the original album. Dylan has never sounded so exquisitely wounded, or so sincere in his vulnerability as he does in some of the best takes from \u201cMore Blood, More Tracks.\u201d\n\nKen Regan\n\n\u201c \u201d I\u2019m not the songs. It\u2019s like somebody expecting Shakespeare to be Hamlet, or Goethe to be Faust. If you\u2019re not prepared for fame, there\u2019s really no way you can imagine what a crippling thing it can be.\n\nWhen \"Blood on the Tracks\" was released, it seemed to distill the fractured spirit of a battered nation.\n\nIn the summer of 1974, the country was in turmoil and Dylan\u2019s marriage was a wreck.\n\nThe Watergate saga was grinding towards the August resignation of President Richard Nixon, and a nasty economic recession was dragging everything down.\n\nThe baby boomer idealism of the 1960s had given way to the rougher realities of adulthood, as many fans who were in their 20s during Dylan's mid-1960s heyday had grown up, married, and often divorced.\n\nConsciously or not, \"Blood on the Tracks\" tapped into a pervasive sense of rootlessness and confusion among a generation lost in space, to quote a phrase.\n\n'When I paint my masterpiece'\n\nWhat makes Dylan\u2019s studio process so compelling is the rigorous factory-testing that he puts his songs through before deciding which one to release.\n\nBy sampling a spectrum of styles, tempos and keys of a given song before deciding which is right, his sessions generate strikingly different takes, and at times whole songs that were never released.\n\nThe studio sessions let you reverse-engineer songs from the album versions backwards to their initial solo acoustic performances, and everything in between.\n\n\u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d was recorded over six days in two states with three different bands, but the box set\u2019s true treasure trove lies in the first two discs, especially the first -- where Dylan plays the songs alone on an acoustic guitar and harmonica in Columbia Records\u2019 legendary \"Studio A\" in New York City, the same room where he had recorded \"Like a Rolling Stone\" a decade earlier.\n\nBarry Feinstein\n\nStripped of a backing band, the New York sessions\u2019 solo tracks capture a startling, visceral humility in Dylan\u2019s voice that is only hinted at in the original album recordings -- and a rage in some of his initial lyrics and deliveries so caustic that he ultimately rewrote some lines, seemingly to soften some of the blows before releasing the album.\n\nThe fragile intimacy with which Dylan delivers some of his most moving takes on \"More Blood, More Tracks\" is owed in part to his decision to record the New York session songs in open tuning, lending the songs a poignancy that was largely lost in subsequent takes in Minnesota.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was common to slightly speed up a track, by just a few seconds in total, to give the song a little more hustle for radio play. The recordings on the new release remove that effect, allowing listeners to hear the songs precisely as they were recorded.\n\nSony Music/Legacy Recordings\n\nThe raw New York session tapes conjure up a spooky sonic ambience that would resurface decades later on \u201cTime Out of Mind,\u201d 1997\u2019s Grammy-winning Album of the Year. The new release, from Columbia Records/Legacy Recordings, also captures some of the most stunning harmonica solos Dylan has ever laid down on tape.\n\n\u201cMore Blood, More Tracks\u201d makes clear that Dylan\u2019s original intent had been to release the acoustic, solo New York session recordings as a finished album.\n\nDylan submitted those acetates to Columbia Records in the fall for a planned Christmas Day 1974 release.\n\nAnd then, on Christmas Eve, the 33-year-old artist phoned his record company to insist that they literally stop the presses and halt plans for the following day\u2019s release.\n\nBarry Feinstein\n\nTwo days of subsequent, late December recording sessions with a full pickup band in Minnesota produced half of the 10 songs on \"Blood on the Tracks.\"\n\nThe other half were culled from the four days of New York sessions and further produced before release.\n\nThe new box set lays out the takes in the order that they were recorded, bringing the listener right into the studio to hear the making of \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d from start to finish.\n\n'Lethal' takes\n\nThe box set is not for everybody. There are nine straight takes of \u201cYou\u2019re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\u201d on the second disc.\n\nBut for the faithful, there are curious new insights throughout. Mick Jagger turns up in the studio one day and can be heard suggesting that Dylan try a slide guitar on \u201cMeet Me in the Morning.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a funky, drum-driven acoustic slow blues take on \"You\u2019re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\" There\u2019s a nice alternate verse on \"Meet Me in the Morning,\" among other songs, and a harmonica solo on \"You\u2019re a Big Girl Now\" that is chilling.\n\n\"There is a sort of delicate filigree that he does on the harmonica that reminds me of the '66 live performances in the UK where he goes on these lengthy but comparably dreamlike solos,\" veteran Dylan scholar Michael Gray, author of the \"Bob Dylan Encyclopedia,\" told ABC News.\n\nGray said he considers some of the original New York recordings to be even more true to their roots than their counterpart album versions.\n\n\u201cWith \u2018Idiot Wind,\u2019 for example, the quiet New York version is sort of more lethal,\" he explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really more embittered and angry \u2013- to the extent that one of the elements, a sense of strong resentment -- is [delivered] much more authentically on the New York tapes,\u201d said Gray, who published the first critical study of Dylan\u2019s work in 1972\u2019s \u201cSong and Dance Man: The Art of Bob Dylan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Minnesota, he basically shies away from the nakedness of it, and substitutes a more declamatory anger, a more superficial and more obvious surface anger, and I think that\u2019s a retreat from the more intimately-delivered tracks,\u201d Gray added.\n\nBarry Feinstein\n\nWhat\u2019s it all about?\n\nFor people obsessed with Bob Dylan, there\u2019s great sport in speculating about the identity of the woman or the event that might have inspired one of his love songs. Fans cull clues from songs, from books, from comments Dylan has made in interviews, even from people he\u2019s been seen with -- or without. More than one woman has come forward over the years to claim she was the inspiration for a Dylan song.\n\nMost serious Dylan scholars abhor the practice of demanding journalistic precision of artistic expression.\n\nThey argue persuasively that the malleable nature of the art that Dylan creates is what matters -- not what the singer meant when he wrote it, but what listeners feel when they hear it, and what it means to them.\n\nIt\u2019s that interplay between the singer and the listener that breathes life into these songs, transforms them from a recorded event that happened once in the distant past to a living thing that springs to life every time a listener internalizes a Dylan song.\n\nIn this school of thought, which counts Dylan himself among its adherents, efforts to puzzle out whom or what the artist was thinking about when he wrote the song\u2019s lyrics shrink the experience.\n\nThey surrender the role that a listener can play as an active participant in the song -- lying in their own beds, wondering whether their own ex's \u201chair is still red,\u201d whether they told themselves that they didn't care, or that they'd \"never gotten used to it, they just learned to turn it off.\"\n\nTo pin Dylan's songs down this way is to give up the chance to live inside them, to make them your own and to imagine for a moment they were written for you -- or that you, somehow, wrote them yourself (nobody admits it, everybody does it).\n\nThe songs on \"Blood on the Tracks\" sound ancient and prophetic, timeless and immediate, and remains as potent 43 years later as they were in 1975.\n\nSony Music/Legacy Recordings\n\nYet that magnetic need to know how he wrote this extraordinary medley of songs remains. It\u2019s less nosy gossip than curiosity, more love than theft.\n\nCodes and clues\n\nThe making of the 1975 album tracks closely to the breakup, separation and eventual divorce between Dylan and his wife of nine years, Sara -- and doubtlessly draws at least some inspiration from that devastating experience.\n\nOne of the couple\u2019s sons, Wallflowers front man Jakob Dylan, once said that \u201cBlood on the Tracks\u201d sounded to him like \u201cmy parents talking.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Sara Dylan remains perhaps the only primary player in Bob Dylan's adult life who has never spoken to the press or in any public forum about her relationship with him.\n\n\u201c \u201d With \u2018Idiot Wind,\u2019 for example, the quiet New York version is sort of more lethal.\n\nThe year it was released, Dylan himself seemed to take some emotional ownership of the material when he suggested in a radio interview with fellow musician Mary Travers that the songs from the album hit very close to home for him.\n\n\u201cA lot of people tell me they enjoy the album,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to relate to that \u2026[to] people enjoying that type of pain, you know?\u201d\n\nYet over the years, Dylan has said a lot of different things about \"Blood on the Tracks.\"\n\nIn his post-modern, magpie memoir \"Chronicles: Vol. 1\" he suggests that the album was inspired by a series of short stories by the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.\n\nOne time at a concert, he introduced the album's opening track, \"Tangled Up in Blue\" as having taken him \"10 years to live and two years to write.\"\n\nElsewhere, he has said that there are \"codes\" embedded in the lyrics on \"Blood on the Tracks\" (in fact, there are) and some of his other work.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder people wonder about the genesis of these songs.\n\nWas \"Simple Twist of Fate\" -- originally titled \"Fourth Street Affair\" \u2013 inspired by Suze Rotolo, the early 1960s girlfriend he lived with at 161 West 4th Street in New York's Greenwich Village?\n\nDid \"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\" draw its youthful exuberance from Dylan's in-full-bloom affair with a record executive girlfriend who was spending time with him in Minnesota while he wrote some of the songs for the album? (She says yes.)\n\nWhat could have sparked such wild rage in \"Idiot Wind,\" whose verses were repeatedly re-calibrated over the course of the recording process?\n\nWas the song title \"Tangled Up in Blue\" a subtle homage to Joni Mitchell's game-changing folk album, \"Blue?\"\n\nDoes any of it even matter? Probably not.\n\nBut it's compelling and well-intentioned and that's why people do it.\n\nThe scholars are right, though: trying to sleuth out one inspiration or another for some Dylan song is a distraction from what can in the best circumstances be a profound experience of internalizing these timeless tracks and making them yours, even just for a few minutes somewhere.", "More than 100 people came to Charlottenburg on Saturday for a free, historical walking tour.\n\nUnder overcast skies, they gathered in the central Berlin neighborhood for a unique visit: to mark the 80th anniversary of anti-Jewish Kristallnacht, or the \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d pogrom -- the first coordinated, nation-wide attack on Jewish citizens under the Nazi regime.\n\nThe damage done on that November night in 1938 went far beyond broken windows. Around the country, thousands of Jewish citizens were attacked, hundreds were murdered, and 7,500 Jewish shops and businesses were looted or destroyed. Also, 1,400 synagogues were burned.\n\nThe state-driven anti-Semitism, which occurred five years after Adolf Hitler took power, set the stage for the Holocaust and marked a gruesome turning point in German history.\n\nSarah Hucal/ABC News\n\n\u201cThis was a game-changer, because up until 1938 you could be a German Jew, seeing that things were becoming worse and worse, but you still held the belief that maybe the Nazi craziness would go away,\" the event\u2019s organizer, Ben Fisher, told the group. \"Or even if the Nazis would eventually deport you, they would do it in a legal fashion because this was Germany, after all.\"\n\n\u201cOn this tour, we are basically following the story of the persecution, the program itself, the damage to stores and the synagogue and the forced immigration that came in the next weeks and months,\u201d he added.\n\nThe tour wound its way through Charlottenburg, where in 1938 10 percent of the population was Jewish and much of the violence in Berlin took place. At the end of the tour, a small informal ceremony was held to commemorate victims of the Holocaust.\n\nFisher is a charismatic Israeli history buff who moved to Berlin three years ago and now runs a private tour agency, \u201cBen in Berlin.\u201d Feeling a personal need to commemorate the anniversary, he and a friend, Tal Grunspan, advertised the free event on Facebook, with the intention of guiding just a handful of friends and colleagues.\n\nHe got more than he bargained for when dozens of people attended.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious there is some demand for this -- and maybe it\u2019s a good way to approach younger people to talk about Jewish history of Berlin,\u201d he told ABC News.\n\nWith the far-right xenophobic riots that broke out in the eastern German town of Chemnitz in September still looming large in Germany\u2019s societal conscience, it seems an apt time to remember Kristallnacht and \u201cthe events which led citizens to play out their long-standing resentments,\u201d as Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in a ceremony at a Berlin synagogue.\n\nOmer Messinger/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nThe chancellor urged citizens to take initiative and set themselves \u201cstrongly against attacks on our open and plural society.\"\n\n\"We are commemorating in the knowledge that watching as lines are crossed and crimes are committed ultimately means going along with them,\" she reminded the public.\n\nOne of the most interesting stops on the tour was the Jewish community center, which stands in the place of the former Fasanenstrasse Synagogue. When it opened its doors in 1912, it was the largest synagogue in Berlin and a symbol of Jewish integration in German. It was so significant that Kaiser Wilhelm II, the former German emperor, made a visit.\n\nAs such, it was a primary target of the November 1938 pogrom, with Joseph Goebbels sending a specific directive to Berlin to ensure that the synagogue be burned, Fisher told the group.\n\nullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nFisher showed a photo depicting firefighters standing next to the burning synagogue, not making any attempt to quell the flames.\n\n\u201cThey had an order coming from above that they should only intervene if the fires went to German, Aryan areas,\u201d he told the group.\n\nThe Nazis had closed the synagogue in 1936; it was destroyed by an allied bomb in the 1940s and then re-opened in the late 1950s as a Jewish community center, which it remains today. Pieces of the original synagogue were incorporated into its facade.\n\nBettmann Archive/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nFisher considers himself well-informed on the history of Nazi Germany, but described the scope of the pogrom, which he discovered while pouring over archival materials in the library, as \u201cmind-blowing.\"\n\nWalking down the busy shopping street Kurfuerstendamm, Fisher pointed out the striking juxtaposition of past and present.\n\n\u201cYou can go now to Kurfuerstendamm and show a picture and say, 'Listen, there was a store here. It was plundered. You can see the merchandise on the sidewalk and people are taking what they want,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strong dissonance when you see today. It\u2019s a UNIQLO,\" he added. \"But this is part of Berlin\u2019s history \u2013- it suffered so much and keeps rebuilding itself.\"", "Somali hospital and police sources say the death toll from Friday's bombings outside a hotel in Mogadishu has risen to 53 with over 100 injured.\n\nCapt.

It's the 10th outbreak the Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen since 1976, the year that scientists first identified the deadly virus near the eponymous Ebola River.\n\n\"No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing,\" the country's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said in a statement late on Friday.\n\nThe outbreak is also the third most severe in the recorded history of the African continent, following 28,652 cases in the 2013-2016 outbreak in multiple West African nations and 425 cases in the 2000 outbreak in Uganda, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAmong the total amount of people who have reported symptoms of hemorrhagic fever since the country's latest outbreak began Aug. 1, at least 291 of them have tested positive for Ebola virus disease. More than 28,000 people have been vaccinated in the outbreak zone since Aug. 8, according to the health ministry's daily bulletin on Saturday.\n\nOlivia Acland/Reuters\n\nThe outbreak has been heavily concentrated in the northeastern province of North Kivu, where about half of all cases have been recorded in the conflict-torn city of Beni, which is home to 800,000 people. People have also been infected in neighboring Ituri province.\n\nNorth Kivu and Ituri are among the most populous provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and share borders with Uganda and Rwanda. They are also awash with violence and insecurity, particularly in the mineral-rich borderlands where militia activity has surged in the past year, all of which complicates the response to the outbreak.\n\nThere is also misinformation and mistrust from the community, partly due to the security situation, and there's a reluctance among some residents to seek care or allow health workers to vaccinate, conduct contact tracing and perform safe burials, according to the health ministry.\n\n\"Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment and kidnapping. Two of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack,\" the health minister said in his statement Friday night.\n\nAl-hadji Kudra Maliro/AP\n\nAlthough the outbreak remains \"dangerous and unpredictable,\" new measures to overcome these challenges are having a \"positive impact,\" the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement Thursday after a joint mission to assess the situation.\n\n\"The fact that we have so far prevented Ebola from spreading into neighboring countries is a testament to the hard work and determination of staff from all partners,\" WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in the statement.\n\nThe United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has recently adopted an \"active approach\" to the armed groups operating in North Kivu, providing a \"period of calm\" in and around Beni, although some attacks have persisted in surrounding villages.\n\n\"We are facing numerous complex challenges, but it\u2019s encouraging and inspiring to see that our efforts to deliver as one UN have been extremely successful in many hotspots and will help to end the outbreak and save lives,\" United Nations under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said in the statement.\n\nAboulaye Cisse/WHO via Reuters\n\nLast month, the WHO heeded the recommendation of an expert advisory committee to not declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern -- a proclamation that would have mobilized more resources and garnered global attention.\n\nThe committee chairman, Robert Steffen, said they came to the decision by looking at three main criteria.\n\n\"Is it extraordinary? Is there a risk of cross-border spread? Is there potential for requiring international response?\" Steffen told reporters in a teleconference Oct. 17.\n\nDespite its conclusion, the committee emphasized in a statement that the Congolese government, WHO and partners \"must intensify the current response\" to the ongoing outbreak and this \"should be supported by the entire international community,\" otherwise \"the situation is likely to deteriorate significantly.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve accepted the recommendation of the committee but this does not mean that we are not taking the outbreak seriously,\" WHO's director-general, Tedros, told reporters. \"We will not rest until this outbreak is finished.\"", "The information minister of Yemen's internationally recognized government says his counterpart in the rebel administration has fled the country and defected to neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n\nMoammer al-Iryani told The Associated Press Saturday that his rebel counterpart, Abdul-Salam Ali Gaber, arrived in Saudi Arabia with his family after they fled Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, which has been under rebel control since 2014.\n\nGaber is the most senior member of the Houthi administration to defect since civil war broke out in 2014, dealing a blow to the rebels' image as they battle an offensive by a Saudi-led coalition to retake the key Red Sea port city of Hodeida.\n\nThe coalition has been fighting the Houthis on the side of the government and its allies since 2015.", "The head of Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah said his group will not be compelled by threats or sanctions to give up its rocket a capability, urging his government in comments Saturday to contend with the diplomatic pressure it faces.\n\nHassan Nasrallah said succumbing to diplomatic pressure would allow Israel to attack Lebanon at will.\n\nNasrallah spoke to supporters in Beirut's southern district via video link on \"Martyrs' Day,\" commemorating the group's fighters in combat.\n\n\"Today, on martyr's day, I want to reaffirm that we are holding on to the strength of Lebanon, which lies in the golden equation: the army, the people and the resistance. We are holding on to the weapons of the resistance and we are holding on to all the rockets of the resistance,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nNeither sanctions nor threats would change this, he said.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah fought a devastating monthlong war in 2006, which ended in a stalemate.\n\nSince then, Hezbollah has amassed an arsenal that is believed to include well over 100,000 missiles and rockets, which Israel considers an existential threat.\n\n\"If we have to sell our homes to protect these rocket capabilities in the hands of the resistance, we will do that,\" Nasrallah said.\n\nNasrallah asked his government \"to put up with this level of diplomatic pressure because giving in, if we assume it happens, means that Lebanon will be open to an Israeli aggression any time, any moment.\"\n\nHis comments come after Israeli media reported that the Jewish state had asked the Lebanese government through a mediator to act against Hezbollah's rocket factories, threatening to take military action.\n\n\"Any attack on Lebanon, any airstrike on Lebanon, or any strikes against Lebanon we will respond definitely, definitely, definitely,\" he added.", "Transcript for Investigators build case against husband in his wife's brutal murder: Part 5\n\nReporter: There is a new color taking center stage in Kelley Clayton's home town. Purple ribbons now dotting the community, a poignant reminder of the young woman's murder. The purple ribbon represents domestic violence awareness. So, the more and more we saw that around town, the more and more we thought that this was a case of domestic violence. They will see purple ribbons, and they'll say, \"Oh, purple for mama, purple for mama.\" Everywhere we go, \"Look, that's for mama.\" Reporter: But no ribbon more prominent than this one, on the arena marquee of Thomas Clayton's former hockey team. Only one man in town seems upset at the outpour- Thomas Clayton, now out on bail. He calls me. He did not mention losing his wife and the situation with his children. What he had mentioned to me was that jail sucks, and how can we put that ribbon up on our building? At no point did he seem like a grieving husband. Reporter: Especially since he continues his now all too familiar trips to area casinos. That's where he spent the entire time he was out on bail, was going from casino to casino. Reporter: And who does he run into -- his poker friends Greg and lucky Miller. He was, like, screaming, \"Lucky!\" And I turned around and he was, like, arms out. I'm, like -- Reporter: What did you do? I'm like, \"Hi.\" And he's, like, \"Hi, lucky. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.\" He goes, \"I didn't do it.\" Reporter: Were you frightened at all? I was terrified. Here, I thought I was getting away, out of town. Reporter: More than a year after Kelley Clayton's murder, her accused killer, Michael beard, is finally on trial. Opening statements began in the murder trial of Michael beard. Reporter: In a shocking about-face, he takes the stand and makes a stunning declaration. Michael beard recants his confession and offers up a bizarre scenario about what he says really happened. That, yes, he was at the scene, but he was there to burn down the house for insurance money, and that the killer, the real killer, was actually there, and he saw him. Reporter: Beard now makes an outlandish claim -- that Kelley is already dead when he walks in the house. And just like 7-year-old Charlie, he sees a man who looks like Thomas Clayton. He then hands you the weapon. You run out the door. You dispose of the weapon. Like, you have got to be kidding me. Even though Michael beard had changed his story, the prosecution still had hard evidence against him. They found Kelley's blood on his clothes. He led them to the murder weapon. And his DNA was found inside the Clayton home. Reporter: After a ten-day trial, beard is found guilty of murder. We got it. With beard's confession, prosecutors are thinking, \"We've got an airtight case here.\" Then he recants, and now they've got a mess. Reporter: Remember, beard would have been the star witness. The only one directly linking Clayton to the murder, says special prosecutor Weeden Wetmore. This case really became all circumstantial. We don't have a smoking gun. We have to build our case piece by piece. The man accused of killing his wife back in September appeared in court. The courtroom was packed every day. The biggest story in our area for a while. Tom was cool, calm and collected every day when he walked into court. You would never realize that he was on trial for his wife's murder. Reporter: That could be because Clayton knows the case against him isn't a slam dunk. But prosecutors believe they have an ace up their sleeve. This man, sy ray of zetx corporation, a former police officer who mapped their cell phone movements. Were able to show that beard and Clayton were together at certain points when they shouldn't have been, unless one looks at the homicide, and then it becomes all clear. Reporter: Most telling, a pair of phone calls made on the day Kelley was killed. The first from a used car lot. There was an incoming call to Michael beard from m&m auto. M&m auto has never called Michael beard before. Reporter: It isn't the dealership calling. It's actually Clayton. We can actually put his device in the parking lot of m&m auto when this call was made. Reporter: And then, hours later, Clayton makes a second call to beard from someone else's phone. Yup, lucky Miller's, at that poker game. That was the go call. And that immediately sets things into motion. Beard shortly after that phone call drove out to Clayton's home and committed the murder. We were able to use the records and show the two parties coming together, separating, conversations between the two of them, and lay out the conspiracy to commit the murder, leading up to it. There was no evidence into the content of those calls and sy ray's testimony was skewed in trying to make much more of those calls. It's a pattern that clearly shows Michael beard and Thomas Clayton did this together.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Former hockey player found guilty in murder of his wife: Part 6\n\ntoday in Thomas Clayton's murder trial. It was a long and in-depth trial. There was more than 75 witnesses, hundreds of pieces of evidence against Thomas Clayton. The question remained, why? Even if there's all this evidence linking Clayton to beard and potentially to the crime, what was the motive? This was a shock for everyone. Testimony from one of the women who claims to have had an affair with Thomas Clayton. The women, the multiple affairs that he was having right under Kelley's nose. My nose. I never heard of an affair, ever. Up until that moment we thought that Tom and Kelley had this loving, almost perfect relationship. And here we find out he was cheating on his wife, even telling some of them that Kelley was a -- He had mentioned to me that divorce was never going to be a possibility because she would take him to the cleaners, his words. The question was, did he do this crime? Reporter: But prosecutors present no evidence of any cash payments made by Clayton to beard in a murder-for-hire scheme. There's no direct proof that Tom Clayton engaged in a plot with beard to kill Kelley. There was no record of any payment. There was no record of any agreement to pay. Reporter: The trial spans over seven weeks, and now the former hockey player's fate is in the hands of the jury. In my mind, it could have gone either way. Reporter: After only six hours of deliberation, a verdict. We broke into programming immediately. Breaking news out of steuben county court. Thomas Clayton, guilty on both first degree and second degree murder charges. There was a tremendous amount of emotion in that courtroom. We obviously were ecstatic with the outcome, because we felt we had accomplished justice. I truly believe that this is one of those rare moments. And I emphasize rare, where the jury got it wrong. We did it! We did it. Reporter: Family members immediately broke out in tears and in cheers, and left the courtroom extremely happy, but still emotional. I told my sister from the night she was murdered that we would not stop fighting for her, we would not stop fighting for justice for her. It's been a long haul and I'm sorry for his family. I'm sorry for all of us. No one won in this. No one did. This case was a puzzle, and they put together the pieces in a way that was convincing beyond a reasonable doubt. Reporter: At his sentencing, Thomas Clayton is given life without parole. He was very angry. He gave a very long, profanity-laced statement saying that Michael beard was the perpetrator and that he was innocent. First and foremost, I'm extremely proud and honored to call Thomas my son. Reporter: Did the children want to say anything to their father? Charlie actually wrote a letter on her own. That she loved her mom. She loved her dad. But that her dad was a coward because he made Michael beard kill mommy. Reporter: Was Michael beard a victim of Thomas Clayton? I believe that Thomas Clayton was a white privileged man. He used Michael beard. Michael beard would do just about anything for money for his family. Reporter: Along with Kelley's family, so many lives in this small community, now forever changed. Do you still play poker here? No, we haven't played poker here since that evening. We don't play here anymore. Reporter: So not the same anymore, huh? Correct. Reporter: So this table is basically closed? Done. As tragic as this was, to hear such a loved member of the community was murdered, at the end of the day, there was two kids without their mother and their father, taken away from them. Kelley spent a lot of time here. And Kelley would also bring her children here. Reporter: Kim and her mom take me to this treasured bench placed in a local park in Kelley's memory. I feel comfort when I come here. Cullen calls it \"My mommy's bench.\" Yeah. \"My mom's bench.\" Reporter: As you raise them, what do you want them to know most about their mother? Her unconditional, unmeasurable love that she had for them. I want them to know that she fought to her last breath to save their life. So powerful, that mother's sacrifice. Thomas Clayton has just filed an appeal, and Michael beard tells us he's going to do so as well.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Man tells police he was hired by husband to kill wife for $10,000: Part 4\n\nReporter: Small town corning, New York, is in disbelief when just 24 hours after Kelley Clayton is found murdered, her husband is arrested, in part because of the statement given by the only eyewitness to the crime, his young daughter. More tonight on the murder in Caton. Tom Clayton is in jail, suspected of killing his wife. When Tom was arrested, I was in shock, definitely, like everybody. Reporter: Had she ever indicated any aggression from him? Never. People always think, we make an arrest, that's the end of the case. But the investigation continued. It was determined shortly after Tom was arrested that there was a lot more to this story. Reporter: Kelley's family can't believe her husband could have done it. They point police to Michael beard, Clayton's longtime employee. If Tom didn't have any work through servpro, he always had him up at the house doing stuff. Cutting down wood or whatever. Reporter: Beard had recently been fired. Could he be holding a grudge? There was an initial check at his residence just as a follow-up. He didn't know anything about anything and indicated that he had nothing to do with any part of this. Reporter: Investigators are stalled until they get a lucky break. Remember lucky Miller, who with her husband Greg hosted that infamous poker game the night Kelley was killed? She now recalls a strange request Tom made that night. Wait a minute, he asked to use my phone. And I look at the phone, I'm looking to see the past when he called and there's nothing. Reporter: No evidence of a phone call? Nothing. She's yelling at me and she's shaking like this. And I go, \"Then he deleted them.\" And she goes, \"You can delete phone numbers?\" Who hides evidence? You only do it if you really have something to hide. Reporter: The Millers pull up their phone bill online. And, sure enough, at 10:53 P.M., a pair of calls to an unfamiliar number. Lo and behold, that phone number comes back to Michael beard. Reporter: They question him again, this time bringing him here, the state police barracks, and put him in this hot seat. Polygraph chair? Polygraph chair. That's the same chair he was sitting in. Reporter: How did he handle the polygraph? He denies all involvement in it. And he was deceitful. Reporter: While Michael beard, the hard-working handyman, is failing the polygraph test miserably, his live-in girlfriend holly Barrett is speaking her truth. Holly tells investigators that Tom had offered Michael $10,000 to basically burn his house down. My boss came into the interrogation with that information. Said, \"Michael, we know about the $10,000.\" Beard looks down and then he looks up, and he finally gives up the whole story as to what had happened, placing himself at the crime scene. He did it at the direction and request of Thomas Clayton. Reporter: It is a surprising twist for investigators. Beard making a full confession to murdering Kelley Clayton as another job for his boss. He didn't even get any money upfront. I mean, he was going to go do this on the promise from Tom Clayton that he'd be paid $10,000. Reporter: In a transcript of his confession, beard reveals details of the plan, saying, \"He wanted me to go to the house, kill Kelly, then light the house on fire. He said the kids would be at her sister's house. There was also gas in the garage. He wanted the cars to burn also so that he could collect insurance money.\" When asked why, beard said, I needed the money. He said in his words that he got scared. Reporter: Stunningly, it appears to police that Clayton had a secret plan he didn't reveal to beard. He was going to set the house on fire with Kelley and the children in the house? That's correct. This is a cold-blooded attempt to remove your own wife and children from this Earth. Reporter: Beard agrees to show police where he got rid of the murder weapon. He's driving 225 south, and throws it out the window. Reporter: When day breaks, search times find this in a wooded area. What appears to be a yellow stick, but it's actually the handle of a sledgehammer. It seems like Michael beard left a lot of bread crumbs around town. Police are also able to locate keys to the Clayton home tossed into this creek. And they recover Michael beard's clothes from the night of the murder, dumped in this swampland. Bloody clothes? Yeah. They had blood on them. Her blood. Beard was then arrested for murder, and now the focus shifted from Thomas Clayton doing the crime himself. Now it became a murder for hire. Beard confesses to the murder, tells them where the murder weapon is, tells them where the bloody clothes are buried, but adds the critical detail, the reason he did it was because Tom Clayton offered him $10,000 to kill his wife. It was shocking to hear that there was another person involved in the murder of Kelly Clayton. We weren't expecting it at all. Reporter: So your sister has been brutally murdered, and now your brother-in-law is being charged. How did you even begin to fathom this? You can't. So, this person who you stood up for to marry your sister, is, now you find out, a monster, a sociopath. The fact that he planned and calculated this entire plot to have my sister killed made it 100 times worse.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "European Council head Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, on Saturday denounced the euroskeptic populists governing Poland as \"contemporary Bolsheviks\" who threaten the nation's independence, but can be defeated.\n\nTusk, seen as a likely contender in Poland's 2020 presidential election, spoke in the city of Lodz on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the country regaining its statehood at the end of World War I after 123 years of foreign rule.\n\nHe honored the statesman who restored Polish independence and as chief of state went on to defeat the Bolsheviks' Red Army in 1920, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski. He also paid homage to Lech Walesa, the Solidarity trade union founder who challenged Poland's Soviet-backed communist rule during the 1980s and went on to become president from 1990 to 1995.\n\n\"Jozef Pilsudski was facing a more difficult situation than we have today when he was conquering the Bolsheviks and in fact, defending the Western community against political barbarians,\" Tusk said during an independent anniversary forum gathering intellectuals and politicians.\n\n\"Walesa had a more difficult situation when he was conquering the Bolsheviks in a symbolic way, when he was bringing out the European, the freedom, the national values in us. But he managed,\" he continued.\n\n\"Why shouldn't you be able to defeat the contemporary Bolsheviks?\" Tusk said to great applause.\n\nHe appealed for Poles to defend their rights, freedom and to \"defend Poland's independence.\"\n\nHe criticized the government led by the conservative Law and Justice party, which has repeatedly clashed with European Union leaders, as a threat to Poland.\n\n\"Whoever today in Poland takes steps against our strong position in a united Europe is really taking steps against Poland's independence,\" Tusk said.\n\nDeputy Senate Speaker Adam Bielan, a member of the ruling team, responded later by saying that Tusk was trying to divide Poles and provoke conflict on the eve of a big national holiday.\n\nTusk's appointment to the EU job in 2014 partly was in recognition of his liberal government's pro-EU policies. He warned Saturday that the government now influenced by Law and Justice head Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Tusk's political foe, is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nIn hopes of preventing anything from marring the centennial commemorations, Polish government officials negotiated a deal to hold a joint march in Warsaw on Sunday with nationalist groups that had planned their own event.\n\nPast independence day marches held by far-right nationalists featured racist slogans, white supremacist symbols and aggressive behavior.", "He aggressively deleted inactive voters from registration rolls, enforced an \"exact match\" policy that could have prevented thousands of Georgians from registering to vote and launched an investigation that disrupted a major voter registration drive.\n\nNow Republican Brian Kemp is declaring himself the victor in Georgia's race for governor, a race so close that even marginal differences in voting and turnout could make the difference in determining whether the race goes to a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race between Kemp, who until this week was Georgia's secretary of state, and Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state lawmaker seeking to become the nation's first black woman to be elected governor.\n\nIn a state dominated by Republicans, Abrams staked her campaign largely on getting new and infrequent voters to participate.\n\nMeanwhile, Kemp and the state's Republican legislature have imposed tighter voting and registration rules that can make it more difficult for just those voters to register and cast ballots. Most of those rules have come since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\n\n\"Georgia uses every tool in the voter-suppression tool kit,\" said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia. \"It's unfriendly the way that voting happens in Georgia. It's more like cashing a check than casting a ballot.\"\n\nKemp defends his tenure, noting increased voter registration on his watch.\n\nLike other Southern states, Georgia after the Civil War had a history of suppressing black voters by disallowing votes from people who owed taxes, imposing literacy tests and implementing white-only primary elections. Those efforts eventually were stopped by the courts and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruling five years ago rolled back a provision of that act that had required Georgia and eight other states to get federal approval before changing voting laws. That gave those states the freedom to impose new restrictions.\n\nThe ACLU's Young said Georgia's recent voting restrictions have been made in the name of preventing fraud. But she believes they're also born out of a desire to keep minorities from voting.\n\n\"It's hard to see good faith in so many of these measures that advocates repeatedly say have disproportionate impact on African-Americans and other minorities,\" she said.\n\nSome of those restrictions predate Kemp.\n\nIn 2005 \u2014 five years before he took office \u2014 Georgia implemented a law requiring voters to show a photo ID at the polls. The Justice Department approved it, but a court struck it down as an unconstitutional poll tax because it required voters to pay for IDs unless they could prove financial hardship. Lawmakers responded in 2006 by revising the law to make it easier to get IDs for free.\n\nIn 2014, Kemp launched an investigation of a voting drive run by a group that Abrams had started. The investigation eventually forwarded to law enforcement just 53 allegedly forged registrations out of a total of 87,000, but critics said the probe disrupted the overall registration drive.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, which tracks voting issues nationally, said Georgia was among the most aggressive states in the country in removing inactive voters from its registration rolls between 2012 through this year. The stated purpose is to clear lists of voters those who have moved or died, but the purges also can mistakenly remove legitimate voters.\n\nData provided by the Georgia Secretary of State's office show the state removed more than 937,000 voters from the rolls from the start of 2015 through Aug. 1 of this year.\n\nKemp also used an \"exact match\" policy for voter registrations. To sign up, voters' names and other information had to match precisely how they appeared on other government databases. Kemp agreed to end the practice amid litigation last year. But within months, legislators put the policy into law.\n\nAs Election Day approached this year, it resulted in 53,000 voters \u2014 most of them minorities \u2014 with their registrations on hold. Civil rights groups sued while Kemp insisted those on the list could vote if they brought to the polls a photo ID substantially matching the information on file. Voters who failed to do so were to cast provisional ballots.\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, chairman of global health at Emory University, said a poll worker at his precinct in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur initially told him he was not registered. The issue: His voter registration has a space between \"del\" and \"Rio\" in his last name, but his driver's license does not.\n\nHe had to explain to the poll worker that the state Department of Driver Services does not allow for spaces in a name, and he was then allowed to vote.\n\n\"It did require a little of me knowing how to defend my rights,\" del Rio said.\n\nBryan Sells, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who now specializes in voting rights, has sued Kemp over the exact match policy and other issues. He said Kemp and Georgia Republicans have been targeted in the rules they have chosen to implement in recent years.\n\n\"The effort has not been to make it hard for everyone to vote,\" Sells said. \"It has been to make it hard for people that some in the Republican party think are going to vote against them.\"\n\nMany voters in and around Atlanta, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods, were incensed by excessively long lines on Election Day, some with waits up to three hours. Some would-be voters couldn't last and left without casting a ballot.\n\nSuspicion in some places fell on the number of polling places that have closed over the years.\n\nAn investigation earlier this year by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that Georgia election officials have closed 213 polling places \u2014 or about 1 in 12 statewide \u2014 since 2012, a year before the Supreme Court allowed officials in the state to change polling places without federal approval. The newspaper revealed that Kemp had sent a memo to local election officials laying out reasons for such actions, including cutting costs and responding to lower numbers of voters. A Kemp spokeswoman said the move was not political.\n\nKemp also has noted that voter registration increased by 1 million people during his nearly eight years as secretary of state. He said his efforts, including the introduction of online registration, are among the reasons for that.\n\nHe told reporters during a campaign stop in Savannah a day before the election that record turnout during the early voting period showed that his office has not been engaged in voter suppression.\n\n\"People are voting at will. That's what we want,\" Kemp said. \"Easy to vote and hard to cheat.\"\n\nTom Mahoney, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Elections, also said it was not fair to blame Kemp for the problems with Tuesday's vote.\n\nHe said he waited 90 minutes to cast his ballot in Savannah. Not having enough voting machines and staff to handle the surge of voters resulted from a lack of foresight by local officials like him, not Kemp, Mahoney said.\n\n\"We prepared for a midterm election,\" he said. \"We did not prepare for a presidential election, and that's what we got.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBynum reported from Savannah.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Cassidy at http://www.twitter.com/AP\u2014Christina and Bynum at http://www.twitter.com/russbynum", "Transcript for 7-year-old daughter becomes key eyewitness in attack on mom: Part 3\n\nReporter: Monday night in corning, New York, is poker night. Greg and lucky Miller host a high stakes game every week. Complete with dinner, drinks, and dead presidents. This is where we play poker on Monday evenings. Every Monday at 7:00. Reporter: Among the regular players, Thomas Clayton, also known as hockey puck. Where did Tom sit? Tom sat here the last night that he played. And I would be the bank over here. Was he good at poker? He was very good at poker. He was very lucky in the beginning at my house, for many, many months. Finally, it kind of evened out after a while. Reporter: Still a good and aggressive player, but not on that night. He was not playing as many hands. He wasn't spunky that night. Usually he jokes around. There was none of that. Reporter: The game shuts down relatively early, about midnight. And the Millers go to bed. At what point did you hear that there had been a tragedy at the Clayton home? The next morning in the 6:00 range, there's someone knocking at the door. Reporter: It's an officer with the sheriff's office. He says, \"You were at a poker game last night?\" I say, \"Yes.\" He says, \"A guy that you know as hockey puck was here? Tom Clayton.\" I go, \"Yes, he was.\" Then he says, \"Tom went home last night and found his wife murdered.\" It was like, \"Whew.\" Reporter: What were you thinking? You hear that Kelley was killed? I was numb. I think he talked to us and I didn't even know what they said. They started asking all kinds of questions about the poker game, and what time it ended, what time it starts, and what his mood was, what was he wearing. Reporter: The Millers corroborate their friend Tom Clayton's alibi, that he was at their home around the time of the murder. I said, \"There's no way. There's no way could Tom could do anything like this.\" I said, \"There's no possible way.\" I said, \"You're looking at the wrong guy.\" Reporter: Did you think the same thing as your husband? \"No way?\" Absolutely. Reporter: But then police hit paydirt when they find an eyewitness. Tom and Kelley Clayton's 7-year-old daughter, Charlie. She told me that \"A man was hurting mommy.\" Then she kept saying, \"He did this and he did that. So finally I said, \"How do you know it's a he?\" And she said, \"Because his eyes look just like daddy's.\" And that was a chilling moment for me. Reporter: A few hours later, sheriff Jim Allard brings Charlie here. You are looking at different kind of interrogation room. Still small, but soft seating. And on the table, toys. Well, Charlie, do you know why brought you here today? Okay. We're gonna have to talk a little bit about last night, okay? Reporter: In this video, obtained from authorities after it was played in court, Charlie describes to investigators what she saw. You know what a truth and a lie is? What's a truth? It means it really happened and a lie is that it didn't happen. Right. Right, very good. So what happens if you tell a lie? You can get in trouble. Establishing that the child knows right from wrong, knows the difference between a truth and a lie, knows that there's consequences to not telling the truth. Reporter: Then, in a matter-of-fact manner, unaware her mom has died, she offers details of the attack. In the middle of the night, this guy came and started hitting my mom with this pipe thingy. Can you tell me more about that? There was blood everywhere. On my door, on the floor. Not on the carpet though. What did you hear? Like, my mom ran to the door screaming, \"Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.\" \"Run, Charlie, run.\" Those were the last words she heard from her mother. One of the most haunting things I've ever heard from a parent to a child. I saw the robber, like, hitting her until she was on the ground. She was sort of suffering. Like, captured with a hockey stick. Then I hugged her leg. Reporter: Charlie says after she saw the robber leave through the garage, she ran to her little brother's room to protect him. But most interesting to investigators is her physical description of the intruder. Can you tell me what he looked like? Like, he was wearing jeans, a black long-sleeved shirt and a mask. Okay. What did the robber look like? He looked like my dad. And why do you say that? How did he look like your dad? The mask and his jeans. She said that he had on a mask like what daddy wears when he's hunting. How about the size of him? Was he a big, big guy or was he a little guy? The size of my dad. I said, \"Well, is he fat like me, or is he thin?\" And she said, \"He's just like daddy.\" Everything was just like daddy. Every question I asked her related back to daddy. And then she looks at me. She goes, \"But it couldn't have been daddy, because then who would take care of us?\" Did the robber say anything? He probably didn't say anything 'cause what if it was my daddy? We could recognize his voice. I observe no deceit in the statements she gave. I believe it was true in her mind when she told it. It was chilling. There was no emotions. I don't know if it was she was still in shock. It was just breaking my heart the entire time. Reporter: The 7-year-old then turns the table on police, asking them a question. It's about my mom, but, like, where is she at? You know, we, you know, we need to find that out for you. That was not the time or place for her to learn that. She needed to be with family. Reporter: It appears to police that Charlie is pointing the finger at her own dad. But how could he be in two places at the same time?\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "One poster in a recently discovered trove vilifies the Nazis with a sword through a Bible and the words \"This Is the Enemy.\" Some encouraged self-sacrifice by promoting recycling, planting gardens and buying potatoes. Still others warned that loose lips can literally sink ships and get American soldiers killed.\n\nThis stash of 190 propaganda posters from World War I and World War II were found last year on top of two sawhorses in the basement of a Rochester, New Hampshire, library. Fragile but mostly in good condition, the posters offer viewers a glimpse of what life was like during war time and the extent that the American government went to maintain support for the conflict by playing on fear, patriotism and civic duty.\n\n\"Some of these are really neat,\" library director Brian Sylvester said as he thumbed through the posters.\n\n\"Most of them were about supporting the military,\" he said. \"I would call that the main theme. Patriotism. Purchasing war bonds, growing a victory garden, being in support of rationing all that stuff. There is a neat one that has all these pictures of bombs and stuff. The way the artist drew it is there is a skillet at the top dumping out waste fat. That was used for munitions.\"\n\nSylvester said it is unclear how the posters ended up in the library's basement, but the themes give some clues that they were likely there for decades. About 50 posters dating back to World War I championed the American Red Cross, which kept its records at the library. Dozens more promoted war bonds, while two dozen highlighted a World War I program in which libraries collected books to be sent to troops overseas.\n\nMany more look like big post cards, promoting tourist destinations in Britain or featuring a portrait of a soldier from an allied country \u2014 China, the Netherlands and even Ethiopia.\n\nThe best posters look like something painted by Norman Rockwell, with one for war bonds featuring children holding an American flag and another with a nurse watching over a soldier with his eyes bandaged and the words \"Carry On.\" On the flip side, a poster has darker images of Nazis burning books and the words \"Books cannot be killed by fire.\" Another plays on the enemy-in-our midst theme and features a soldier floundering at sea with the words \"Someone talked.\"\n\n\"The posters are almost a lost art form,\" Sylvester said. \"People don't do this to try and spread this kind of message anymore. These are such simple messages. It's just really laid on thick.\"\n\nBenjamin Weiss, director of collections at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts who curated its current exhibit on 175 propaganda postcards from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, said certain themes stand out in these kinds of messages.\n\n\"Regardless the type of regime, the type of nation involved, propaganda is designed to rally people toward something and make people hate something,\" he said. \"It's meant to divide the world into the people you want to be part of, the people who are opposed to you.\"\n\nThough he hadn't heard about the New Hampshire posters, Weiss said they also illustrate the power of propaganda with a focus on national themes.\n\n\"That is a key piece of this which is they showed up in Rochester, New Hampshire but they could just as easily of been in Rochester, New York or Rochester, Minnesota,\" he said. \"These were things that were created, in most cases, probably at a central point with the idea they are going to reach the whole country and address the whole country.\"\n\nSylvester said the library has no plans in the near future to display the posters. There are concerns that sunlight would cause the colors to fade. Instead, they have photographed all the posters and are showing them on a computer in the library. They are also planning to host an expert from the Wright Museum of World War II history for a Nov. 29 lecture on the power of war posters.\n\n\"For me personally, it kind of gave me an awareness that libraries played a role in those wars,\" Sylvester said, adding they eventually hope to get the UV-protected glass and acid-free matting needed to display the original posters.", "Transcript for Manhunt begins for brutal killer of mother of two: Part 2\n\nI got a female, mid-30s, early 40s. Her face is completely beaten in. Husband's story right now, kids are home with mom. Husband is claiming he was out playing poker. Came home. Kids said, \"Daddy, there was a robbery.\" Reporter: 35-year-old mom of two Kelley Clayton has been found bludgeoned to death in her own home in the secluded, picturesque community of Caton, New York. It's a grisly scene. Deputy Dean swan is the first to arrive. . Blood on the wall. Looks like a face plant in the wall. Blood everywhere, where the victim was, in the kitchen. I believe it was an extreme struggle. She fought to the end. We're going to need all investigators. Homicide. Reporter: Awaiting backup, he's got a hunch. He's convinced this was no robbery. I just want to make sure there is no forced entry anywhere else. I didn't see any. It was a typical home, nothing was out of place, nothing rummaged through. In the office, a desk with paperwork on it. Nothing on the floor, nothing like that. There was nothing. Reporter: The deputy's gut instinct tells him this is a domestic incident gone bad. I'm wondering if he got domestic with her. She face planted. Boom. Then he puts her out in the kitchen. In her face, you can see how her face is beat in. Is there a suspect? Husband. I thought he was lying to us. I was not buying his story at all. Reporter: He quickly begins questioning the Clayton's neighbor, Derek Almy. Okay, you don't know of any troubles between anybody here, him and her, or somebody else and them or anything? Not really, no. No domestics you know of in the past? No. Was he upset? Oh, my gosh, indescribably. He said it's gruesome in there. Did he have any blood on him when he came over? Did he change his clothes ever? Here? No. No, okay. Reporter: Almy doesn't know it yet, but deputy swan is taking a hard look at his neighbor, Tom Clayton. Fidgety, anxious and muttering after the discovery of his wife's body. I'm gonna Pass out. Well, sit down then. Come over here and sit down. I keep sitting down and getting back up. My daughter saw it. My daughter saw my wife. Okay. Reporter: Clayton has also called Kelley's sister Kim to break the news. My phone rang at 12:49. \"Kim. Kim. Kelly's dead.\" I said, \"What?\" \"Kelly's dead.\" And I just remember pacing back and forth. Pacing, like, \"What?\" I just couldn't make sense of it. And I remember getting clothes on, and I remember it was raining and it was cold. Reporter: Soon, relatives and friends are all alerted to the tragedy. I get up to her street, on her road, and I don't see any -- it's pitch black. Country road, pitch black. No lights. Go over a hill, still black. Go over another hill and it's lit up like Christmas. Just tons of lights. Family coming. You're going to have to stop them. And I just remember hearing Kim screaming. Oh, god! I remember running to the ambulance expecting to find them working on my sister. And I am like, \"Is my sister in there? Where is my sister? Where is my sister?\" Where's my sister? Reporter: Was Tom distraught when you saw him? How did he appear? All I remember is that his head was down in his hands. I couldn't hear him. I also couldn't get near him. Reporter: That's because Thomas Clayton, the once minor league hockey player who was used to instigate fights on the ice, is now headed to a different kind of penalty box. A police interrogation room. Something I'll never forget. I'm backing out of the driveway, trying to avoid all of the emergency vehicles. Clayton just kind of out of the blue says, \"Well, you know where I was, because my truck has a gps on it.\" Which obviously kind of threw a flag. I didn't ask you where you were yet. But he made sure he threw that out there. Reporter: Clayton pens a statement declaring, \"I did not hurt or kill Kelley\" and requests an attorney. Was he wondering who could do this? Why somebody would do this? No, he wasn't. That was another thing that struck me as odd, is that he wasn't really concerned. He could mention not one suspect or possible suspect of who might want to harm his wife or his family. Not one person that he could think of that would want to do harm to them. Reporter: Meanwhile, an all-out investigation is under way. You can see a very heavy police presence was there early in the day. Reporter: Police on the hunt for clues. Tire tracks, footprints, anything that might lead to the killer. We knew that someone had went out the back of the house towards the pond. We had a dog that had tracked something out to the pond. We eventually drained that pond looking for evidence.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Former hockey star's young family shattered by wife's murder at home: Part 1\n\nReporter: The finger Lakes region of New York state, known for its breathtaking scenery, lush wineries and brilliant fall colors. It's just a nice, laid-back community. Very easygoing, a nice place to raise kids. Reporter: 18 years ago, a new game skated into town. The Elmira jackals, a minor league hockey team. Yeah, Hannah! Reporter: Bringing a fury of energy and excitement to the area. When the jackals arrived, it really gave the community, the town, something to really rally around on those winter Friday nights and Saturday nights. Suddenly you had 4,000 people kind of going downtown. A lot of them maybe grab a drink afterwards. Jackals forward Tom Clayton knows how to get under his opponents' skin. Reporter: One of the big stars, number 18, Thomas Clayton. He's looking to take his game to the next level. If you can get one of their top guys off the ice for two minutes, five minutes, you know, it gets that job done. Tom was chippy, aggressive. His job was to go out there and instigate trouble. He would slash other players, he would just try to get them agitated to the point where they would draw a penalty. He was an instigator on the ice. And now we've got a fight behind the play. It looks like -- He would start fights. Reporter: Here he is scrapping it up with a rival player. Clayton coming back at him. What do you want to do? You want to fight someone. Just like when you're a little kid and you just get so mad you want to fight, you know? Reporter: Cocky, animated and intimidating -- Clayton helps to keep things in perspective. Reporter: -- The hockey sensation would soon meet his match in Kelley stage. Kelley was definitely outgoing, spontaneous. She cared about everybody. Fashiona crazy at times. Loyal. Sassy. Definitely sassy. Didn't put up with anything. Reporter: A local girl, she spotted Tom from the stands, says sister Kim bourgeois. At a game is when she first saw Thomas Clayton. And she thought he was cute. She went out that night to a bar after that game with her best friend. He was sitting at the bar, and I asked him, \"Do you have a girlfriend?\" And he said, \"Who are you asking for?\" I said, \"Not me.\" He said, \"The blonde? She's unbelievable.\" Reporter: Were they smitten with each other? Yes. Very. He was known as a bad boy. He would have a harem of girls following him. Reporter: What was it about him that attracted such attention? Tom was very good-looking. He was smooth. He'd try to make you feel like you were the most beautiful girl in the room. Reporter: The relationship grows serious quickly, and they marry in 2006. The following year, Tom's hockey career crashes when he injures his leg. He was looking to really try to put that behind and move on and start a family in the area. Reporter: First with baby girl, Charlie. Hi! You gonna give a smile? Reporter: And three years later, son Cullen follows. Were they happy? She was very happy. And as far as I knew, he was happy, too. She loved him. I know that my sister truly, truly loved him. Reporter: And Kelley, as a mom, was she having a great time as a young mom? She was a great mom. Very involved in both of their lives. Reporter: Tom is a successful businessman, owning rental properties and heading up a local servpro franchise. They do cleanup in homes and businesses after fires and floods. He was a fairly high-ranking operations manager. Reporter: Were they doing well financially as a family? They were doing extremely well. They had purchased a home that Kelley loved. She was so excited. Life appeared to be wonderful for Kelley, Tom, Charlie, and Cullen. Reporter: That is, until one autumn night, after a night of poker, Tom Clayton finds something sinister has happened in his home. 911. Help me, help me. My wife, she's dead. How long has she been down? I don't know. I don't know. I just got home. Sir, you need to calm down so I can help you. Is she beyond cpr? Yes. Sir, why do you think she is beyond cpr? Just trust me. I was on duty, on patrol here in the east corning area at the time when the call came in. Reporter: What do you hear? The call came in as a woman down, a medical situation. Reporter: Steuben county sheriff's deputy Dean swan gets the call that night. He drives me along the route to the family home in Caton, New York. Caton is quiet. It's very rural. It's extremely dark. Lots of back roads, open fields. You really can't see much when you're driving there. Reporter: What were you thinking? En route up there, something was wrong. I just had a gut feeling something was wrong. Reporter: As he approaches the home, deputy swan switches on his new body camera. What you're about to see is realtime footage of the scene that night. Let's turn our red lights off. We're close enough. When I pulled up to the scene, I saw a gentleman at the front door. I just started asking questions about what's going on. How are you doing? I'm okay. What's going on? Tom just came -- I'm the neighbor. Tom just came and got me out of bed. Reporter: He was pretty frantic? Yes. He was visibly shaken, very flustered, and he couldn't get much out. Okay, what happened, though? His wife -- his wife is in there. Okay. Reporter: The deputy, a 20-year veteran, enters the house looking for Tom. Anybody else in the house, Tom? Just you? I got the kids out there at the neighbor's house. Reporter: Completely unprepared for what he is about to see. Okay, where's she at? Over there. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Some sort of blunt force trauma had occurred. I want you to have a seat. You don't need to see that anymore, okay? There was blood splatter on the ceiling, on the walls. Yeah, there's blood all over. She's been dragged. This was a hods -- homicide. That's when I started to interview Tom Clayton. Tom, where were you when this all went down? Playing poker with my buddies. I came home and my daughter said there was a robber in the house and she saw them. Yeah, you got to chill out there, man. Let me see your hands real quick, man. And you ain't hurt or anything? Okay, good. Okay. Reporter: Tom, visibly shaking, is checked for weapons and bloodstains, and directed to the back seat of the squad car. Take it easy. You're not in trouble. Just sit right there. I'm going to leave the door open. Just sit right there. Relax. We've got a crime scene. We have a possible homicide. Nobody's going in right now. We've got to clear this house. Reporter: Deputy swan inspects the rest of the house. The intruder and possible killer could still be inside. I was afraid the robber could possibly be in the house. He said there was a robber in the house. Just cover me. I'm gonna go upstairs. I gotta go up and clear it. That's when I searched the home to make sure in was nobody there. I've gotta clear over here. The kids' rooms are over here. There's blood in the kids' room. Okay, kids' rooms, this one's clear. Reporter: As they search the home, guns drawn -- There's blood all over up here. Reporter: -- The trail of evidence begins to tell a twisted story of its own. I'm trying not to step on anything. Okay, clear. Let's get the hell off this.

Carlson filed a lawsuit, instead of going through the secret process of arbitration.\n\n\"We wouldn't know anything at all\" about Ailes' behavior and subsequent harassment cases at Fox if Carlson had been forced into arbitration, her lawyer Nancy Erika Smith told ABC News. Smith made the risky move of filing suit against Ailes personally, rather than the company.\n\nAstrid Stawiarz/Getty Images, FILE\n\nOn Thursday, one week after a global walkout of 20,000 Google employees, vendors, contractors and temp workers protesting the company's handling of sexual harassment and general equity cases, the tech company became the latest to reverse course and eliminate forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and assault \u2014 fulfilling one of their demands.\n\nIn doing so, Google joins Microsoft, Uber and Lyft in waiving forced arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases, despite a Supreme Court ruling in favor of mandatory arbitration earlier this year. Many employee advocates argue that ending forced arbitration, which usually imposes confidentiality on the parties involved, is the first step toward ending sexual harassment in workplaces.\n\n\"It's literally mindblowing,\" said Smith, who currently represents two women who were paid sexual harassment settlements by former Fox News star Bill O'Reilly. \"It's unbelievably important to ending sexual harassment.\"\n\nArbitration is a process outside of the court system that is common in American corporations. Instead of filing documents in court \u2014 which become part of the public record \u2014 and moving toward a jury trial, the outcome is decided behind closed doors and often included as a term for employment.\n\nEmployers favor arbitration because it often limits bad publicity and the amount of money in awards an employee will receive. Also, because the employer often wins.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot more ways to keep what happens in an arbitration secret,\" University of Michigan law professor Julian Davis Mortenson said. \"Ligitation usually has much wider-ranging discovery, as in, 'Hey give me all the emails that relate to my claims,' 'Give me all the embarrassing stuff.'\"\n\nStephen Lam/Reuters\n\n\"Once you find the embarrassing stuff, it\u2019s not bound by the same confidentiality requirements that arbitration has. As a rule, it's way easier to disclose stuff happening in trial than in arbitration,\" Mortenson said. \"A lot of these trials play out in the court of public opinion.\"\n\nAnother thing that tilts the playing field toward employers is numbers. Arbitrators are staffed by companies, whose clients are corporations. Out of, say, 10 potential arbitrators, each side can nix a few and then rank the remaining to oversee their dispute.\n\n\"Employers are repeat players in the way that individual employees never can be. They get to know lots and lots about arbitrators. If you\u2019re an arbitrator that rules for me this time, probably I\u2019m going to nominate you next time. Employers can structure the agreements to make it likely the pool of arbitrators selected are employer-friendly \u2014 it\u2019s like picking your jury,\" Mortenson said.\n\nIn harassment and discrimination cases, there's another factor: demographics.\n\n\"Arbitrators tend to be white men over 40 who come from a corporate or management background,\" said Doug Wigdor, a labor lawyer and arbitrator. He represented women who were sexually assaulted by their Uber driver.\n\nThough Wigdor and Smith noted the progress made by allowing employees to sue for sexual harassment and assault, they also said it's just the beginning of a longer process.\n\n\"With sexual assault victims \u2014 that they have control of the forum to air their grievances is important,\" Wigdor said, commending the Google decision. \"For an employer to tell an employee they can't work at this company unless they agree to arbitrate matters is cruel in this day and age. But why not the same for racial or disability or age discrimination or harassment?\"", "First the never-ending handshake, then the dandruff brush \u2014 and now the thigh tap?\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron have had an unusual relationship since their first white-knuckle handshake at a NATO meeting last year, as newly elected Macron appeared to be trying to match the American president on the world stage.\n\nWhen Macron went to Washington in April, Trump was unusually affectionate, brushing flecks off the French leader's shoulder that he called dandruff and calling Macron \"perfect.\"\n\nYet tensions between the men have grown in recent months. The globalist, progressive Macron and nationalist, protectionist Trump have clashed on climate change, world trade and how to deal with Iran. Trump shot off an angry tweet about Macron before their latest meeting on Saturday in Paris.\n\nAs they met, Macron stood firm but also seemed eager to keep up a show of camaraderie. He called Trump \"my good friend\" \u2014 and reached out to pat the American president on the thigh after a reporter asked them about the tweet.\n\nTrump was cordial in the meeting. During the thigh tap, however, he sat stone-faced.", "The candidates vying to become the mayor of Taiwan's capital, Taipei, faced off in a televised debate on Saturday, two weeks before a host of local elections seen as a barometer of the ruling party's popularity.\n\nThe Nov. 24 mayoral election is one of hundreds being held in Taiwan for local government posts that are seen as a test of confidence in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which swept to power in 2016 with the election of President Tsai Ing-wen and a solid majority in parliament.\n\nThe DPP's main opposition is the Nationalist Party, which relocated from mainland China amid civil war in 1949 and governed Taiwan for decades, first under martial law, then under full democracy beginning in the 1990s. The presidency has since alternated between the two parties, with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, seen as more pro-China, and the DPP backing formal independence for Taiwan.\n\nIn Saturday's debate, incumbent Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, asked voters to continue supporting him, but the ruling party's candidate, Pasuya Yao, said Ko has failed to make any changes in Taipei in the past four years.\n\nYao further emphasized that Taipei doesn't want to be bound by China's threats.\n\nTing Shou-chung, the Nationalist Party candidate, pledged to lead Taipei out of economic difficulties and to help foster a better relationship with China.\n\nTwo independent candidates \u2014 Li Hsi-kun and Wu E-yang \u2014 also took part in the debate.\n\nSurveys show most Taiwanese favor their island's current de facto independent status, rejecting both formal independence that might spark a military assault by China and political unification with Beijing.\n\nWhile China had in recent years largely eschewed threats that might spark a backlash at the polls, this year's elections come against the background of rising tensions over Beijing's demand that Tsai \u2014 who is up for re-election in 2020 \u2014 acknowledge its \"one-China\" principle that views Taiwan as a part of China under the Communist Party. China has increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Tsai's administration while staging military drills underscoring its determination to conquer the island by force if necessary.\n\nYet, local issues are likely to play a bigger factor among voters. The high-tech economy has struggled to match the growth rates of past years, leading to wage stagnation, particularly among the young, while there have also been pushes for pension reform and government streamlining to keep government spending in check.\n\nTaipei's aging housing stock and delays in projects such as a massive new sports and entertainment venue are also issues for voters in the island's capital.\n\nTaiwan's democracy is known for exuberant campaigning, including massive outdoor rallies, caravans of vehicles promoting the candidates, and visits to markets and parks.\n\nTaipei Mayor Ko, 59, gained added attention this year by starring in a rap video, and online messaging has grown increasingly important in one of the world's most wired societies.\n\nThat's also brought warnings of cyberattacks and disinformation coming from China, similar to how Russian government-backed entities are believed to have spread fake news in the U.S.\n\nKo came under attack for skipping a first debate earlier this month, with critics calling him aloof and the mayor defending himself as a diligent administrator.", "An Afghan official says a district administrator was killed when a bomb exploded inside his office in western Afghanistan.\n\nGelani Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor in Herat province, says Amir Haftbalah, administrative chief for Kohsan district, was killed in the attack Saturday afternoon.\n\nTwo other people who had come to visit Haftbalah in his office were wounded in the attack, he said.\n\nFarhad said the governor's office has begun an investigation.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but Farhad blamed Taliban insurgents who often target Afghan government officials and security forces.", "President Donald Trump woke up in Paris on Saturday in the mood to make threats toward California as it deals with deadly wildfires in Northern California and hundreds of smoldering homes in Southern California.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nTrump was in Paris to take part in a commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. But his mind was still on the disaster unfolding out west in the U.S.\n\nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, California Gov. Jerry Brown's office fired back, calling the president's tweet \"inane and uninformed.\"\n\n\"Our focus is on the Californians impacted by these fires and the first responders and firefighters working around the clock to save lives and property \u2014 not on the president\u2019s inane and uninformed tweets,\" Evan Westrup, the governor's press secretary, told ABC News.\n\nAt least 25 people have been killed this week as flames from the wildfires engulfed their vehicles, homes and neighborhoods in Northern California, authorities said.\n\nThere were more than 100 people missing in the region but by Saturday officials added that at least 70 people who were reported missing were located and are now safe.\n\nBrown requested a presidential major disaster declaration to \"bolster the ongoing emergency response and help residents recover from devastating fires burning in Butte, Los Angeles and Ventura counties,\" his office announced on Sunday.\n\nThe president approved an emergency declaration for the state on Friday \u2014 but warned he may not do the same in the future. Emergency declarations provide municipalities with air support, relief supplies and evacuation transport.\n\nFire officials said Trump's statements, and remedies, were incorrect.\n\nOne leading California fire official on Saturday called Trump's comments \"a shameful attack on California.\"\n\n\"The president\u2019s assertion that California\u2019s forest management policies are to blame for catastrophic wildfire is dangerously wrong,\" California Professional Firefighters President Brian K. Rice said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"Wildfires are sparked and spread not only in forested areas but in populated areas and open fields fueled by parched vegetation, high winds, low humidity and geography,\" he continued in the statement. \"Moreover, nearly 60 percent of California forests are under federal management, and another two-thirds under private control. It is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management, not California.\"\n\n\"Natural disasters are not \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d \u2013 they destroy regardless of party,\" Rice concluded. \"Right now, families are in mourning, thousands have lost homes, and a quarter-million Americans have been forced to flee. At this desperate time, we would encourage the president to offer support in word and deed, instead of recrimination and blame.\"\n\nOn Saturday evening, Trump changed course, tweeting support for the firefighters, the homeowners and the tragic victims of the west coast wildfires.\n\n\"God bless them all,\" the president tweeted.\n\nMore than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2018\n\nTrump has made similar false claims about fire science and government resource allocation in the past, and fire officials have pushed back.\n\nIn August he tweeted, \"California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren\u2019t allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!\"\n\n\"We have plenty of water to fight these fires,\" Deputy Cal Fire Chief Scott McLean said in a statement in August.\n\nNevertheless, the Trump administration announced it would override the Endangered Species Act to provide extra water -- not needed by the fire crews.\n\nHe also criticized California's handling of forest fires at an Oct. 17 Cabinet meeting. During an exchange with Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Trump called California \"a mess\" and \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"I say to the governor, or whoever is going to be the governor, of California: You better get your act together,\" Trump said. \"Because California, we're just not going to continue to pay the kind of money that we're paying because of fires that should never be to the extent [they are].\"\n\nNASA via AP\n\nTrump has long feuded with Brown, a Democrat, who is set to be replaced by fellow Trump antagonist Gavin Newsom. The Democrat was elected to the office last week. Newsom was previously married to former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who now dates Donald Trump Jr.\n\n\"It's costing our country hundreds of billions of dollars because of incompetence in California,\" Trump said in that Cabinet meeting.\n\nIt's unclear where Trump was getting the figure of \"hundreds of billions of dollars.\" Cal Fire's operating budget for 2018-19 is $2.3 billion.\n\nFire Management Assistance Grants, authorized through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), refund as much as 75 percent of firefighting costs for departments. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development also provided $212 million to the state of California in 2017.\n\nTrump's tweet ironically comes while he is in Paris, the namesake of the Paris Climate Agreement, under which nearly 200 countries agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change. The agreement was signed by the U.S. during Barack Obama's administration, but Trump pulled the country out of the agreement in June 2017.\n\nRobyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMichael Mann, an atmospheric science professor at Penn State University, told PBS' \"NewsHour\" in August that he believes climate change is contributing to the increased seriousness of wildfires.\n\n\"We're not saying that climate change is literally causing the events to occur,\" he said. \"What we can conclude with a great deal of confidence now is that climate change is making these events more extreme.\"\n\nABC News' Stephanie Ebbs contributed to this report.", "Airstrikes by Saudi Arabia and its allies in Yemen are on a pace to kill more civilians than last year, according to a database tracking violence in the country, despite the United States' repeated claims that the coalition is taking precautions to prevent such bloodshed.\n\nThe database gives an indication of the scope of the disaster wreaked in Yemen by nearly four years of civil war. At least 57,538 people \u2014 civilians and combatants \u2014 have been killed since the beginning of 2016, according to the data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.\n\nThat doesn't include the first nine months of the war, in 2015, which the group is still analyzing. Those data are likely to raise the figure to 70,000 or 80,000, ACLED's Yemen researcher Andrea Carboni told The Associated Press. The organization's count is considered by many international agencies to be one of the most credible, although all caution it is likely an underestimate because of the difficulties in tracking deaths.\n\nThe numbers don't include those who have died in the humanitarian disaster caused by the war, particularly starvation. Though there are no firm figures, the aid group Save the Children estimated hunger may have killed 50,000 children in 2017. That was based on a calculation that around 30 percent of severely malnourished children who didn't receive proper treatment likely died.\n\nRenewed uproar over the destruction has put Washington in a corner. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, backing the fight to stop Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who Washington and the coalition consider a proxy for Iran.\n\nThat along with tensions over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's consulate in Istanbul may be key factors why Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Oct. 30 made their biggest push yet for an end to the war, calling for a ceasefire within 30 days and resumed negotiations.\n\nOnly a month earlier, Pompeo gave a powerful show of support to the coalition by certifying to Congress that Saudi Arabia and its allies were taking measures to prevent civilian casualties. Certification was a required step in continuing U.S. aid, which includes providing intelligence used in targeting and mid-air refueling for coalition planes.\n\nBut deaths from the coalition campaign show no sign of slowing.\n\nCoalition airstrikes and shelling killed at least 4,489 civilians since the beginning of 2016 \u2014 nearly three-quarters of all known civilian deaths, according to ACLED's figures.\n\nAs of Nov. 3, at least 1,254 civilians were killed by the coalition this year, a rate of four a day. In comparison, 1,386 civilians died in strikes the previous year, or 3.79 a day.\n\nAsked about the finding, the U.S. State Department said in an emailed reply, \"Throughout this conflict, the United States has urged all parties to abide by the Law of Armed Conflict, work to prevent harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and thoroughly investigate and ensure accountability for any violations.\"\n\nBloodshed has surged from fierce fighting at the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, which coalition forces have been trying to retake from the Houthis since June. Civilians have been killed in airstrikes as well as by Houthi shelling and land mines.\n\nSince June, more than 4,500 people \u2014 including 515 confirmed civilians \u2014 have been killed in Hodeida, nearly triple the number from the first five months of the year.\n\nAid agencies fear worse is yet to come. The coalition appears to be accelerating its assault before any cease-fire. Its forces have nearly encircled the city, where tens of thousands of people are trapped along with thousands of Houthi fighters. The port is Yemen's main point of entry for food and humanitarian aid, so any cutoff could push millions into starvation.\n\nThe coalition launched its air campaign in March 2015 after the Houthis took over northern and central Yemen, driving out the internationally recognized government. The rebels were prevented from overrunning the south only by the coalition's bombardment and support for militia forces.\n\nTracking casualties is enormously difficult. The few independent monitors on the ground do not have wide access; officials on both sides have an interest in manipulating figures; deaths often take place in remote areas and even in populated areas, confusion of battle makes confirming numbers hard.\n\nThe most widely used estimate has been 10,000 dead, made in January 2017 by the United Nations.\n\nIn October, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator said at least 65,000 people have been killed or injured since 2016, including 16,000 civilians killed, based on data from health centers. U.N. officials did not reply to queries to elaborate on the figures.\n\nACLED builds its database on news reports from Yemeni and international media and international agencies. It covers everything from airstrikes, shelling and ground battles between the various forces to militant bombings and violence at protests. The group receives funding in part from the U.S. State Department and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBecause of its transparency, its figures are often cited by U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. But they caution that even ACLED's data cannot give the full picture \u2014 only \"the least bad best guess\" as an official at one agency put it.\n\nPinning down how many of the dead are civilians is even tougher.\n\nACLED counted 6,242 civilians killed since 2016 by \"remote violence\" on civilian targets \u2014 meaning airstrikes, artillery or shelling by either side. Of those, shelling by the Houthis or their allies killed 977.\n\nThe full toll is likely much higher. The vast majority of deaths \u2014 more than 34,000 \u2014 are categorized by ACLED as resulting from battles. But it is impossible to determine whether those are combatants or civilians, Carboni said.\n\n\"It's likely an underestimate,\" he said of the civilian toll. \"The numbers caught in the crossfire are not known.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Maggie Michael in Cairo and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.", "The Latest on President Donald Trump in France (all times local):\n\n12:55 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are trying to project unity after Trump lashed out at one of America's strongest allies in Europe.\n\nTrump had claimed Macron insulted the United States when the French president pushed the idea of the continent having its own defense force.\n\nThe American and French leaders have had an up-and-down relationship, but they told reporters that they are good friends as they prepared for talks at the Elysee Palace on Saturday.\n\nThe meeting was Trump's first stop on a weekend trip to Paris where dozens of world leaders are gathering to commemorate Sunday's 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is being criticized for not finding a way to visit a cemetery in France for Americans killed in World War I.\n\nTrump was to visit the cemetery on Saturday, but the White House canceled the trip because of bad weather, which grounded the presidential helicopter that was to fly him to Belleau, about a two-hour drive east of Paris.

The election proved that the GOP attacks on Pelosi simply do not work,\" Drew Hammill, Pelosi spokesman and deputy chief staff, told ABC News.\n\nWhile Pelosi, who officially kicked off her bid in a letter to members and winning candidates Wednesday night, does not currently face a declared challenger, she doesn\u2019t enjoy the unanimous support of Democrats as she did more than a decade ago, which could complicate her bid.\n\nTom Williams/CQ-Roll Call,Inc./Getty Images, FILE\n\nRep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who ran against Pelosi two years ago for Democratic leader and received 63 votes within the caucus, said in an interview that he hasn\u2019t ruled out a challenge, and urged party leaders to \u201clisten to newer members and see what leadership needs to look like and what they need to get re-elected.\u201d\n\nAt least nine sitting Democrats plan to vote against her for speaker, joined by at least five incoming Democrats who have reaffirmed their campaign pledges to support new leadership and not back Pelosi: Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jason Crow of Colorado, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Max Rose of New York, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.\n\n\u201cI declared I will not be voting for Nancy Pelosi, under any circumstances,\u201d Rose, who unseated Staten Island Rep. Dan Donovan, said in an interview with WABC\u2019s \u201cUp Close with Bill Ritter\u201d program. \u201cNothing has changed besides the fact that I got elected. I will not be breaking that promise.\u201d\n\nAnother two sitting House Democrats -- Reps. Ron Kind of Wisconsin and Jim Cooper of Tennessee -- voted against Pelosi for Democratic leader in 2016, but haven\u2019t said if they will vote against her second bid for speaker.\n\nAnd a score of additional incoming House Democrats have either called for new leadership, avoided commenting on the leadership race, or are waiting to see if any other candidates emerge.\n\nWhile she only needs a majority of Democrats\u2019 support in a closed-door caucus vote later this month, Pelosi will need 218 votes -- or a majority of all members present and voting on the House floor -- on Jan. 3.\n\nWith Democrats currently holding 225 seats, according to ABC News projections, Pelosi can afford to lose only seven votes, or as many as 16, if Democrats win the nine outstanding races yet to be called by ABC News.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nStill, lawmakers and aides across the caucus said this week that Tuesday night\u2019s victory -- and Pelosi\u2019s prominent role supporting candidates across the country with the help of her fundraising prowess -- fortified her position as the clear frontrunner for speaker.\n\n\u201cComing off the victory that we just had, that the leadership as it is -- the speaker, the majority leader, and the whip, should remain,\u201d Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, told ABC News.\n\nIn recent days, some former critics -- including Reps. Albio Sires of New Jersey, and Sean Patrick Maloney of New York -- have also announced plans to back Pelosi, shoring up her support.\n\nBeyond Pelosi, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who is 79, and Assistant Minority Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina, who is 78, plan to seek the majority leader and majority whip posts, after holding both the last time Democrats controlled the House.\n\nAll three -- along with their allies -- are making the case to Democrats that their experience best positions them to lead at this moment, and would allow them to corral a diverse caucus and conduct vigorous oversight, all while keeping Democrats in position to protect their gains in two years.\n\n\u201cWhy would we throw out experience?\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier of California, a Pelosi supporter, told ABC News. \u201cThere\u2019s something very appealing about seeing President Trump have to deal with Nancy Pelosi -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nPelosi and other leaders have also indicated that they\u2019re receptive to concerns of their critics, who worry that the three septuagenarians have crowded out the party\u2019s future leaders. They have worked to highlight their work encouraging and elevating younger members, and have suggested they would serve as leaders for a limited period of time.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a transitional figure,\u201d Pelosi told the LA Times last month before the election. \u201cI have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\u201d\n\nNeither Pelosi nor Hoyer face challengers ahead of the caucus leadership elections later this month, though Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, the chief deputy whip, has announced plans to challenge Clyburn.\n\nInstead, the battle over the next generation of Democratic leaders will likely take place in the races for lower-level leadership posts.\n\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, who successfully led House Democrats\u2019 campaign committee in the midterm elections, is running for assistant majority leader, the fourth-ranking position in the Democratic caucus.\n\nHe\u2019ll face Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, a progressive member of the House Judiciary Committee, after Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who represents a district won by President Trump in 2016, left the race to run for Lujan\u2019s old position unopposed.\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who was encouraged by colleagues to seek a leadership and even challenge Pelosi if Democrats lost the House, declared he is running for caucus chair, a prominent position now held by outgoing Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, who lost in his primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nRepublicans will hold their elections next week, while Democrats are expected to gather on Nov. 28 to begin their leadership elections -- giving Pelosi time to count votes, use the tools at her disposal to minimize opposition and win the support of uncommitted Democrats looking for concessions -- like Tom Malinowski, the former Obama administration who defeated GOP Rep. Leonard Lance in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give anybody my vote unless they can promise me that they\u2019ll help me deliver for New Jersey,\u201d Malinowski said in an interview ahead of the election, adding that he wants a vote to restore the state and local tax deductions capped by the tax overhaul signed into law by Trump last year.", "Greek police say that a 4-year-old Iraqi boy has been killed and 27 others injured when a van carrying migrants struck a truck while fleeing police in northern Greece.\n\nPolice said Saturday that the two traffickers, including the 24-year-old Iraqi driver, were among the injured.\n\nThe van, with Bulgarian license plates, failed to stop at a police checkpoint.

They led cavalry charges, carried supplies to the front, comforted wounded soldiers and died by the millions during World War I.\n\nHorses, mules, dogs, pigeons and even a baboon all were a vital \u2014 and for decades overlooked \u2014 part of the Allied war machine.\n\nResearchers have been hard-pressed to find official accounts of the services rendered by animals during the Great War. But if their labors once were taken for granted, four-legged and winged warriors have been acknowledged more recently as unsung heroes.\n\nFrance recently decided to recognize their wartime role. And in 2004, Britain installed a huge memorial on the edge of London's Hyde Park to \"all the animals that served, suffered and died alongside the British, Commonwealth and Allied forces in the wars and conflicts of the 20th century.\"\n\nHere's a look at how they contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHAT THEY DID\n\nAn estimated 10 million horses and mules, 100,000 dogs and 200,000 pigeons were enrolled in the war effort, according to Eric Baratay, a French historian specializing in the response of animals to the chaos, fear and smells of death in the mission that man thrust upon them.\n\nWorld War I marked the start of industrial warfare, with tanks, trucks, aircraft and machine guns in action. But the growing sophistication of the instruments of death couldn't match the dog tasked with finding the wounded, the horses and mules hauling munitions and food or the pigeons serving as telecommunications operators or even eyes, carrying \"pigeongrams\" or tiny cameras to record German positions.\n\n\"They were quasi-combatants,\" said Serge Barcellini, comptroller general of the Armed Forces and head of Le Souvenir Francais \u2014 The French Memory \u2014 in a recent speech devoted to the role played by beasts of war.\n\nIndeed, gas masks were fitted to the muzzles of four-legged warriors braving noxious battlefield fumes.\n\nIn France, as in Britain and elsewhere, horses and mules were requisitioned.\n\nOne typical sign posted in southern Paris ordered citizens to present their steeds and mules to the Requisition Committee by Nov. 14, 1914, or risk \"prosecution by the military authority.\" It was becoming clear there would be no quick end to the war that ground on for four more years.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFEATHERED HEROES\n\nCher Ami, or Dear Friend, the carrier pigeon who wouldn't quit, lived up to her name, saving the lives of 194 American troops of the \"Lost Battalion\" of the 77th Infantry Division, isolated behind enemy lines during the 1918 Meuse-Argonne offensive in eastern France.\n\nAbout 550 men had held their ground against a far larger German force for days before coming under fire from American troops unaware the trapped soldiers weren't the enemy.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Maj. Charles Whittlesey sent Cher Ami into the skies with a final message giving the U.S. battalion's location, followed by a plea: \"For heaven's sake stop it.\"\n\nCher Ami lost an eye and a leg from German gunfire, but kept flying, around 25 miles (40 kilometers) in about a half-hour, according to the United States World War One Centennial Commission. Survivors of the \"Lost Battalion\" returned to American lines four days later.\n\nAnother carrier pigeon named Vaillant, assigned to the French military, also performed extraordinary feats during the war.\n\nOn June 4, 1916, he was released into the sky with the desperate message, \"He's my last pigeon.\"\n\nFrench Commander Sylvain Eugene Raynal, encircled by Germans at the Fort de Vaux near Verdun, was counting on Vaillant to save his men.\n\nThe feisty bird flew through toxic gas and smoke, reaching the Verdun pigeon loft choked by fumes. With no help arriving despite Vaillant's courageous effort, Raynal and his men surrendered three days later.\n\nBoth Cher Ami and Vaillant were awarded France's Croix de Guerre, or War Cross.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nROUND 'EM UP\n\nHorses are ancient warriors, but most of those conscripted during World War I weren't war-ready. They died by the millions, from disease, exhaustion and enemy fire, forcing the French and British armies to turn to America to renew their supply. A veritable industry developed with more than half a million horses and mules shipped by boat to Europe by fall 1917, according to the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n\nSo important was the commerce that the Santa Fe Railroad named a station Drage, after British Lt. Col. F.B. Drage, the commander of the British Remount Commission in Lathrop, Missouri, a major stockyard for the future beasts of war.\n\n\"So the war business in horses and mules is good,\" read an article in the December 1915 issue of The Santa Fe Magazine, for employees of the railway system. Good for the farmer, contractor, supplier and railroads, it said, but \"not good for the animals.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSERVICE BY EXOTICS\n\nAmong the more exotic animals called into service was a baboon named Jackie, who served with the 1st South African Infantry Brigade in then British-occupied Egypt and later in the trenches in France and Belgium. His acute hearing and keen eyesight helped warn soldiers of enemy movement or possible attacks when he would screech and tug on their clothing.\n\nJackie was wounded in Flanders Fields when the South African brigade came under heavy shelling in April 1918 and his leg had to be amputated.\n\nLt. Col. R.N. Woodsend, of Britain's Royal Medical Corps, described that procedure: \"He lapped up the chloroform as if it had been whiskey, and was well under in a remarkably short time. It was a simple matter to amputate the leg with scissors.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDOGS OF WAR\n\nMan's best friend helped soldiers survive. Dogs served, firstly, as spotters of the wounded, learning to identify ally from enemy. They also served as sentinels, messengers, transporters and chasers of rats \u2014 the bane of the trenches along with lice and fleas. The French military created a service devoted to dogs of war in December 1915.\n\nLess official, but crucial to soldiers' morale, was the role of dogs and other creatures in the trenches, and as mascots. Stray dogs running from fighting were adopted as companions along with other animals, including a Royal Air Force fox mascot adopted by British pilots.\n\nThese dogs and other mascots helped soldiers \"think of life ... and the life they hoped to find again,\" said Baratay, the French historian, in a speech last month in Paris.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

That is the greatest homage we can pay\" to the soldiers who fought in the first global war.\n\nMacron will host ceremonies Sunday marking the Nov. 11, 1918 armistice, and then a peace forum where \"we will talk about this peace that our predecessors tried to construct 100 years ago but failed to preserve, because 20 years later a new war broke out.\"\n\nThe dinner was held in Paris' Orsay Museum. Macron thanked the guests, who included President Donald Trump, for taking part.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nThe leaders of France and Germany have held an intimate commemoration at the site north of Paris where the vanquished Germans and victorious but exhausted Allies put an end to World War 1.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel used the occasion Saturday to laud European peace and to demonstrate, in person, how countries that were once bitter enemies need not stay that way.\n\nMerkel even snuggled her head against Macron's head as they stood in front of a somber memorial. The two leaders also climbed aboard a replica of the train wagon where the armistice was signed a century ago Sunday. Macron affectionately took Merkel's hand after they signed a guestbook.\n\nAfterward, talking to young people in the crowd, Macron said he and the German chancellor wanted to mark the centenary because \"We owe it to our soldiers who fell, to those young men who were your age or just a little bit older.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:55 a.m.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is pushing for a strong joint European military as he hosts international events marking the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nMacron is launching a peace forum Sunday to stress the importance of multilateral cooperation to prevent new world wars, but he also stressed the importance of investing in Europe's military forces.\n\nIn a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Macron said that \"it's unfair to have European security today being assured by the U.S.\" He added \"that's why I believe we need more European capacities and more defense.\"\n\nMacron has pushed for a European intervention force but the idea meets resistance in some capitals, which want to keep military capabilities under national sovereignty.\n\nHe hailed a \"superb operation\" against Syria earlier this year \u2014 when U.S., French and British forces bombed targets believed to be part of President Bashar Assad's chemical weapons program.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nWith the words \"Fake Peacemakers\" written on their bare chests, three supporters of the Femen protest movement have demonstrated at the Paris site where world leaders will commemorate the 100th anniversary Sunday of the end of World War I.\n\nPhotos showed the three women holding placards spattered with fake blood and slogans, including 'Welcome War Criminals,\" at the protest early on Saturday at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nFrench news reports said police quickly took the protesters away.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office is objecting to U.S. President Donald Trump's tweet that it's \"insulting\" that Europe wants to build its own military.\n\nAn official in Macron's office said that Trump lumped together two different comments by the French president. The two men are meeting in Paris on Saturday, and Macron's office says this issue will be on the table.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday night that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named, said Macron \"did not say that.\"\n\nMacron said in an interview earlier this week that Europe needs to protect itself against \"China, Russia and even the United States\" in terms of cyberspace. Later, Macron reiterated that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\n--By Angela Charlton\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:50 a.m.\n\nSerbia is holding large military drills to mark 100 years since the end of World War I in an apparent show of force amid rising tensions with Kosovo.\n\nThe live-ammunition maneuvers on Saturday, dubbed \"The Century of Winners,\" include 8,000 soldiers, 100 battle tanks and MiG-29 fighter jets supplied by Russia.\n\nTensions recently have increased in the region, with Serbia and Kosovo accusing each other of undermining efforts at reconciliation following a 1998-99 war which ended after NATO intervention. The former Serbian province declared independence in 2008 which Belgrade doesn't recognize.\n\nSerbia is often wrongly accused of starting World War I after a Serb nationalist assassinated the Austrian archduke in Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1914. Serbia suffered the worst losses proportional to the size of its army during the war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has paid homage to veterans at a World War I centennial commemoration in a cemetery in northern France, thanking soldiers for their service as he stood amid row upon row of silent graves.\n\nWith medal-bedecked veterans in attendance Saturday morning, Trudeau spoke of the \"history for which you bled and fought, a history built on your sacrifice.\"\n\nHe said Canada owes its veterans \"a tremendous debt of gratitude\" and added: \"From the very bottom of our hearts, thank you.\"\n\nClutching a red chrysanthemum, Trudeau also walked among the white gravestones at the Canadian Cemetery No. 2, in Neuville-St.Vaast in northern France. It holds the remains of 820 casualties from the 1914-1918 war.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nA weekend of commemorations involving dozens of world leaders to mark 100 years since the end of World War I is underway, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau kicking off the events in France and elsewhere with a visit to a cemetery.\n\nTrudeau met veterans and laid a wreath Saturday at a Canadian cemetery in northern France containing the remains of 820 casualties from the 1914-1918 conflict, many unidentified and lying under white headstones marked simply: A soldier of the Great War.\n\nMore than 60 heads of state and government are converging on France for the commemorations that will crescendo Sunday with ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, exactly a century after the armistice.", "President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron tried to project unity Saturday after Trump had lashed out at one of America's strongest allies in Europe, claiming Macron insulted the United States when he pushed the idea of the continent having its own defense force.\n\nThe American and French leaders, who have had an up-and-down relationship, told reporters they were good friends before going behind closed doors for talks at the Elysee Palace. It was Trump's first stop on a weekend trip to Paris where dozens of world leaders were gathering to commemorate Sunday's 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nTrump also had been scheduled to visit the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery at Belleau Wood on Saturday, but canceled because of rainy weather that grounded the presidential helicopter. The president was criticized for not finding a way to get to the cemetery, which is about a two-hour drive east of Paris, where Americans killed in World War I are buried. The White House sent a delegation that included chief of staff John Kelly in his place.\n\nThe dustup over European security, which threatened to divert attention from the weekend's somber remembrance ceremonies, was just the latest example of fallout from Trump's unpredictable brand of Twitter-assisted diplomacy.\n\nHis fractious, destabilizing relationship with Europe has driven a wedge between the U.S. and some of its oldest allies on issues including trade, defense spending and his seeming deference to their looming neighbor to the east, Russia's Vladimir Putin. It also underscored the hot-and-cold relationship that Trump has had with Macron, who has increasingly branded himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style nationalism across Europe.\n\nThe brouhaha began Friday night, when Trump unleashed an angry Twitter jab at his host just as Air Force One touched down in Paris. Trump tweeted that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nTrump's tweet was especially wounding to Macron. Macron's office said Trump had misunderstood the French leaders' comments, lumping together two different ideas. Macron had said in an interview that Europe needs to protect itself against cyber threats and the \"interference in our democracies\" from \"China, Russia and even the United States.\" Later, he made the case that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\nThe two men struck a more friendly tone as they opened their meeting at the grand presidential residence.\n\n\"We want to help Europe but it has to be fair. Right now, the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump has long complained about uncompensated U.S. defense spending that benefits allies, and earlier this year threatened to turn his back on NATO if members didn't boost their defense spending. Trump said Macron \"understands that and he understands the United States can only do so much.\"\n\nMacron defended his viewpoint, saying he shares Trump's insistence that there be more burden sharing. He said it's \"unfair to have the European security today being assured just by the United States,\" but did not respond to a question about why he felt France needed protection from the U.S.\n\nThe episode was the latest example of a frequent Trump pattern: introducing tension before meeting with a world leader, then playing nice when they're face-to-face.\n\nBefore Trump traveled to Britain earlier this year, he gave an interview to a British tabloid in which he insulted British Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Trump said her political nemesis would make a great prime minister.\n\nThe interview was published as Trump was attending a grand welcome dinner hosted by May only hours after he arrived in London. Trump was far more cordial to May in person, complimenting her leadership and expressing his great respect for her.\n\nIt was the same with Macron, who welcomed Trump in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace with a handshake and pats on the arm. Inside a gilded meeting room, Macron referred to Trump as \"my good friend\" and, at one point, tapped him on the thigh. Trump said they had become \"very good friends over the last couple of years\" and were \"similar in our views\" on many issues.\n\nMacron early on had tried to position himself as Europe's \"Trump whisperer.\" But their personal relationship has failed to make much difference when it comes to stopping Trump from pursuing policies Macron strongly opposes.\n\nDespite his insistent urging, Trump failed to heed Macron and other European leaders' advice not to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. He also refused to spare France from the tariffs he's slapped on steel and aluminum imports, citing national security risks. Trump has also been chipping away at a rules-based, multilateral system the U.S. helped build and Macron has worked to defend.\n\nWeaker at home for unpopular economic policies and increasingly isolated in Europe, Macron has been positioning himself as a sort of anti-Trump, speaking out against the rising tide of Trump-style populist nationalism across Europe and the dangers of isolationist retreat. At the U.N. General Assembly this year, Macron said: \"Nationalism always leads to defeat,\"\n\n\"He's starting to become the antithesis of President Trump's public messaging,\" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies \"He believes he is one voice that can champion this.\"\n\nCentral to those efforts is the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, a gathering of heads of state, government officials, heads of international organizations, corporations, academics, philanthropists and others beginning Sunday. The forum aims to revive collective governance and international cooperation to tackle global challenges.\n\nTrump, however, will not be attending. The White House cited a scheduling conflict, saying the president instead would attend a Veterans Day ceremony to pay respects to U.S. soldiers who died on French soil.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton in Paris and Jonathan Lemire and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jill Colvin and Darlene Superville on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj and https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "The North and South Korean militaries completed withdrawing troops and firearms from 22 front-line guard posts on Saturday as they continue to implement a wide-ranging agreement reached in September to reduce tensions across the world's most fortified border, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said.\n\nSouth Korea says the military agreement is an important trust-building step that would help stabilize peace and advance reconciliation between the rivals. But critics say the South risks conceding some of its conventional military strength before North Korea takes any meaningful steps on denuclearization \u2014 an anxiety that's growing as the larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang seemingly drift into a stalemate.\n\nSouth Korea reportedly has about 60 guard posts \u2014 bunker-like concrete structures surrounded with layers of barbed-wire fences and manned by soldiers equipped with machine guns \u2014 stretched across the ironically named Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe 248-kilometer (155-mile) border buffer peppered with millions of land mines has been the site of occasional skirmishes between the two forces since the 1950-53 Korean War. The North is believed to have about 160 guard posts within the DMZ.\n\nIn the September military agreement, reached on the sidelines of a summit in Pyongyang between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, the Koreas pledged to eventually withdraw all guard posts within the DMZ, but to start by removing 11 from each side as a \"preliminary\" measure.\n\nThe South Korean Defense Ministry official said soldiers on Saturday completed disarming 11 guard posts on the southern side of the DMZ. He said the ministry believes the North has also finished withdrawing personnel and weapons from 11 guard posts on the northern side of the DMZ. He didn't want to be named, citing office rules.\n\nThe Koreas plan to destroy 20 of the structures by the end of November, while symbolically leaving one demilitarized guard post on each side. They plan to jointly verify the results in December.\n\nThe Koreas also in the September deal agreed to create buffer zones along their land and sea boundaries and a no-fly zone above the border, which took effect on Nov. 1.\n\nThe Koreas and the U.S.-led U.N. Command recently finished removing firearms and troops from a jointly controlled area at the border village of Panmunjom and eventually plan to allow tourists to freely move around there. The Koreas have also been clearing mines from front-line areas and plan to start in April their first-ever joint search for remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.\n\nWhile the Korean militaries move ahead with tension-reducing steps, Moon is otherwise running out of goodwill gestures toward North Korea, which is under heavy U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons program. Unless the sanctions are lifted, it would be impossible for Moon to push ahead with his more ambitious plans for engagement, such as reconnecting railways and roads across the border and normalizing operations at a jointly run factory park.\n\nPyongyang insists that sanctions should be removed before there is any progress in nuclear negotiations, while Washington says they will remain until the North takes concrete steps toward irreversibly and verifiably relinquishing its weapons.\n\nAnalysts say the discord may have caused the last-minute cancellation of a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, that had been scheduled for this past Thursday to discuss denuclearization issues and setting up a second summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump.", "The U.S. military will no longer provide midair refueling for the Saudi-led coalition's warplanes fighting in Yemen, Saudi state media and the Pentagon confirmed Friday.\n\nThe change came after growing pressure from Congress to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen's government in their battle with rebels, known as the Houthis, that has stretched for nearly four years, killing at least 16,200 civilians and bringing 14 million people to the brink of famine.\n\nWhile the U.S. is still aligned with the Saudis and Emiratis and providing support in other ways, the end of midair refueling removes a controversial and tangible measure of support for the coalition, especially in light of international criticism of its targeting civilians.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nIt also comes as the U.S. has joined a push for a cessation of hostilities in Yemen and diplomatic efforts by the United Nations Special Envoy Martin Griffiths to bring the warring parties to the table for talks by the month's end.\n\nThe decision was made because the coalition \"has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling,\" according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency, which said the U.S. was consulted first.\n\nDefense Secretary James Mattis welcomed the decision in a statement Friday, adding that the U.S. will turn to working with the coalition \"on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country's borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region.\"\n\nThe U.S. has been conducting a counter-terror campaign against both terror groups, one of the reasons it has long supported the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition. The other primary factor is that the Houthis are aligned with Iran, which the Trump administration has targeted as the source of unrest in the region.\n\n\"It's the Iranian leadership that continues to fuel the Houthis in a way that has engendered this civil war that has wreaked so much death and destruction inside of Yemen,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told BBC Persian Wednesday.\n\nThe administration will still provide intelligence and reconnaissance to assist the Saudis and Emiratis, in addition to several arms deals with both countries.\n\nAP\n\nBut the decision to end midair refueling was widely welcomed by Congress, which has long called for this move.\n\nRepublican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire released a statement earlier on Friday calling on the administration to do just that, threatening further congressional action if the administration had not done so on its own.\n\nTo some members, the decision was belated and inadequate. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., called for Congress to pass legislation he has introduced to codify an end to U.S. involvement in the conflict, which he sees as unlawful because it was never authorized by Congress.\n\n\"By finally ending refueling missions for Saudi bombers, the Trump administration is admitting our joint operation in Yemen has been a disaster. ... Now that it's no longer a secret that the war in Yemen is a national security and humanitarian nightmare, we need to get all the way out,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in a similar statement.\n\nThe question is whether the U.S. ending support will be joined by increased diplomatic pressure on the Saudis and Emiratis to end the conflict.\n\nThere was growing doubt this week that will be the case after fighting throughout Yemen intensified just days after Mattis and Pompeo issued joint statements to support a new push for a ceasefire and negotiations. While the U.S. backs the coalition, it seemed to ignore the U.S. calls for peace, beginning an offensive to retake the key port of Hodeida, through which around 80 percent of Yemen's food and humanitarian goods enter the country.\n\nHani Mohammed/AP\n\nThis week, Yemeni government-aligned forces, backed by Saudi and Emirati air power, moved in on the city, even as Houthi rebels seized a hospital as a military outpost to fire on coalition forces -- a sign of how both sides have behaved in this brutal war, conducted what the U.N. says amount to war crimes and put civilians in their crosshairs.\n\nDespite the violence, the U.N. is still pushing to bring all sides around a negotiating table by the end of November. That goalpost seemed to fade out of sight, with the U.N. Secretary-General's deputy spokesperson saying Griffiths hoped to do so by year's end.\n\nBut a source told ABC News that things are still on track for an end-of-November meeting, with Griffiths and his team making progress to that end.\n\nGriffiths's team denied any delays, telling ABC News in a statement, \"There hasn't been a 'postponement.' Our work to re-launch the political process is proceeding as planned. ... We are committed to convening the talks as soon as [logistical] arrangements are finalized.\"\n\nA U.S. official declined to comment on any timeline, but told ABC News, \"Our principal objective remains a resolution to the conflict, and we are focusing our energies in support of the U.N. Envoy's efforts to that end. We reiterate our calls for a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to come to the table to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.\"\n\nOne potential snag , aid groups warned, were reports that the U.S. is considering designating the Houthi rebels as a terrorist organization. The Washington Post reported Friday that the idea was under consideration by the Trump administration.\n\nWhile the idea has been under discussion multiple times within the U.S. government since the Obama administration, a separate source told ABC News this is not expected to happen now. It's unclear how far along in that lengthy process, if at all, the idea currently is.\n\nExperts warn that doing so would alienate the Houthis and sabotage the peace process -- which the administration says it does not want to do. It could also complicate or endanger the work of aid groups who have to negotiate and work with the Houthis to administer services in territory that they control.", "Federal and airport authorities said Friday they are investigating why an air traffic controller became incapacitated and went silent while working a night shift alone in the tower at busy McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.\n\n\"No safety events occurred during this incident,\" the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement about what officials said amounted to a 40-minute span during which the female controller slurred words and then apparently lost consciousness shortly before midnight Wednesday.\n\n\"An air traffic controller at the Las Vegas tower became incapacitated while on duty,\" the agency said. It did not identify the controller or the cause of her incapacitation.\n\nAirport director Rosemary Vassiliadis issued a statement saying that initial findings echoed the FAA assessment.\n\nFive inbound aircraft remained airborne during the incident, and aircraft on the ground held positions or communicated between themselves to maintain safety while moving, the FAA said.\n\nAir traffic recordings available on the internet show commercial airline pilots having trouble understanding the controller during radio communications about approaches to land, clearances to take off and directions for taxiing. Some begin talking between themselves about something being amiss.\n\nAt one point, the controller sounds sleepy and apologizes over the radio, saying she is \"choking a little bit.\" Minutes later, she misstates an aircraft's call numbers. Finally, her microphone opens to the sound of coughing and grunting.\n\nShe does not respond to a pilot's inquiry before the sound of a male voice is heard in the room asking if the woman is all right.\n\nOfficials said a male controller who had been on break was summoned to return to the tower. Paramedics responded.\n\nThe FAA said the woman was put on administrative leave, and the agency ordered two controllers to be in the tower during busy hours.\n\n\"The FAA is deeply concerned by the incident, is thoroughly investigating what occurred, and is taking immediate steps to modify its overnight shift staffing policies,\" the agency statement said.\n\nMcCarran is among the 10 busiest airports in the U.S. in passenger volume. The unidentified controller worked for a little more than an hour before trouble began and communicated with pilots of 29 aircraft before she was replaced, the FAA said.\n\nNational Air Traffic Controllers Association chief Paul Rinaldi issued a statement praising the work of thousands of union members around the country and promising cooperation in the FAA investigation \"so that all of the facts are known.\"", "Authorities in New Hampshire are hopeful a smart speaker will be smart enough to convict a double murderer.\n\nAmazon was ordered by a judge on Friday to hand over recordings taken by an Echo device in the Farmington, New Hampshire, home where Christine Sullivan lived with her boyfriend. Sullivan was found murdered in the backyard of the home on Jan. 29, 2017, along with Jenna Pellegrini, who was staying at the home.\n\nThe bodies were left in the backyard, under a tarp, and a knife was buried nearby, police said.\n\nPellegrini, 32, had been stabbed 43 times and Sullivan, 48, was stabbed eight times and had her skull fractured, according to authorities.\n\nTimothy Verrill, 34, was charged with first-degree murder for both women's deaths. He pleaded not guilty in February 2017.\n\nWMUR\n\nPolice testified at a bail hearing in August 2017 that Verrill knew Sullivan's boyfriend, Dean Smoronk, who owned the house, and that Verrill had access to the home's security code. Verrill was also seen on home surveillance video with both women before their deaths, according to Manchester ABC affiliate WMUR.\n\nThe ruling was handed down by Strafford County Superior Court Presiding Justice Steven M. Houran on Friday.\n\n\"Accordingly, the State's motion to search in lieu of a search warrant is granted,\" the ruling by Houran states. \"The court directs Amazon.com to produce forthwith to the court any recordings made by an Echo smart speaker with Alexa voice command capability, FCC ID number ZWJ-0823, from the period of January 27, 2017 to January 29, 2017, as well as any information identifying cellular devices that were paired to that smart speaker during that time period.\"\n\nWMUR\n\nThe Amazon Echo device was seized by police from the home, according to court documents.\n\nIt's unclear whether there is any audio evidence on the device, but the court found probable cause that the speaker could have recorded \"evidence of crimes committed against Ms. Sullivan, including the attack and possible removal of the body from the kitchen.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told The Associated Press it would not release the recordings \"without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us.\"", "Transcript for Amazon ordered to hand over Echo recordings in murder case\n\nMillions of Americans have them in state prosecutors hope one of them contains crucial evidence and a double murder case lecture comes with a price.

On Nov. 11 there will be a great communal march to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Independence!\"\n\nThe deal was also announced by the top march organizer, Robert Bakiewicz. He is a leader of the National Radical Camp, which traces its roots to an anti-Semitic movement of the 1930s.\n\nThe development underscored how the ruling Law and Justice party has at times sought to embrace the same base that supports far-right groups. It's a source of controversy in Poland, where many are furious at how radical nationalists came to dominate the Independence Day holiday.\n\nDuda said he wants the participants to walk \"under white-and-red flags, under our national colors, under the motto of a free and independent Poland.\"\n\nThe president told Poland's Nasz Dziennik newspaper he wants all the participating groups to leave their individual emblems and banners expressing their particular point of view behind.\n\nLast year's march in the capital was cited in a recent European Parliament resolution that called for member states to act decisively against far-right extremism. It noted the presence at that march of xenophobic banners with slogans such as \"white Europe of brotherly nations,\" and flags depicting the \"falanga,\" a far-right symbol dating to the 1930s.\n\nThe announcement of the joint march comes after chaotic days of preparations and negotiations with the nationalist group before the centennial of Poland's independence, which was regained at the end of World War I in 1918 when the three empires \u2014 Russia, Austria and Germany \u2014 that had ruled Poland for more than a century collapsed in defeat.\n\nDuda's office held talks with march organizers over several months in hopes of reaching an agreement on a joint march. But the talks broke down when the nationalists refused a demand to have no banners.\n\nNew talks between state officials and the nationalists took place Friday leading to the announcement of an agreement.\n\nWladyslaw Frasyniuk, a hero of the anti-communist Solidarity movement of the 1980s, strongly criticized the authorities for what he described as pandering to \"bandits\" and \"fascists.\"\n\nLaw and Justice party spokeswoman Beata Mazurek appealed to all participants to be a \"guardian\" of order at the march and to report any \"provocative behavior\" to the police.\n\nOn the eve of the anniversary, Duda, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and Law and Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski attended the unveiling of a monument to former Polish President Lech Kaczynski, The twin brother of the ruling party leader was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia.\n\nThe memorial and its location in a large central square with statues and other installations representing significant moments from Poland's glorious and tragic past has been another source of national discord leading up to the independence centennial.", "Sri Lanka's president has dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional.\n\nAn official notification signed by President Maithripala Sirisena announced the dissolution of Parliament effective midnight Friday. It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26 and the new Parliament is to convene Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both say they command a majority in Parliament and had been expected to face the 225-member body on Wednesday after it was suspended for about 19 days.\n\nForeign Minister Sarath Amunugama told The Associated Press on Saturday that the president dissolved Parliament due to the need to go to the people to find a resolution to the crisis.\n\nHe said that on Wednesday \"there was to be a lot of commotion and unparliamentary activities sponsored by the speaker.\"\n\n\"The speaker was not planning to act according to the constitution and standing orders of Parliament,\" Amunugama said.\n\nSirisena's supporters had been irked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya's announcement that he was going to call for a vote for either party to prove their support.\n\n\"The dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council's South Asia Center. \"At the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\"\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted that his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nJayampathy Wickramaratne, one of Sri Lanka's foremost constitutional law experts and a member of Parliament representing Wickremesinghe's United National Front coalition, said he and other coalition delegates met with the chairman of Sri Lanka's Election Commission on Saturday and urged him not to take action toward the snap elections decreed by the president on Friday.\n\nWickramaratne said that President Sirisena has cited a general clause in Sri Lanka's constitution stating that the president has the power to summon or suspend Parliament. But Wickramaratne said a specific clause in the 19th amendment, added in 2015, stipulates that the president can only dissolve Parliament after 4 1/2 years, or earlier if requested by two-thirds of Parliament.\n\n\"You cannot read the constitution in one provision in isolation \u2014 you have to read it as a whole, especially when amendments have been brought,\" he said, adding that \"before the 19th amendment, the president could dissolve Parliament at will after one year. The amendment will have been negated if this absurd argument is allowed to succeed.\"\n\nHowever, Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, another constitutional expert and Wickremesinghe's justice minister who alongside Wickramaratne spearheaded the introduction of the 19th amendment, said the president was empowered to dissolve Parliament to avoid stalemate situations.\n\n\"When it comes to a stalemate situation or a constitutional deadlock, the president is obliged to take measures to avoid a conflict situation and political instability. Therefore, he has been compelled to take this decision and dissolve Parliament and he has the authority to do that,\" said Rajapaksa, who is not related to the newly named prime minister.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nWickremesinghe's camp is likely to contest Sirisena's move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 1/2 years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\"It's totally unconstitutional,\" said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe's United National Party and a former government minister. \"Sirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\"\n\nThe party said in a Twitter message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena's move.\n\nThe U.S. State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news that the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \"further deepening the political crisis.\"\n\n\"As a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\" the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other lawmakers wrote to Sirisena warning that actions circumventing the democratic process could impact U.S. assistance \u2014 including a planned five-year aid package from the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"We fear that recent actions, if not corrected, will threaten your country's democratic development and derail the progress made in recent years,\" the three lawmakers said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Emily Schmall in New Delhi and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.", "The death toll from flash floods in Jordan rose to 12 on Saturday and the kingdom's main tourist attraction, the ancient city of Petra, was closed for cleanup after what local officials said was the biggest deluge in the area in decades.\n\nFriday's floods struck several areas of Jordan. Rescuers continued the search for missing people around the Wala reservoir in central Jordan on Saturday. In the southern town of Maan, authorities opened a shelter for dozens of people whose homes were surrounded by water.\n\nIn all, 12 people were killed, including two children and a diver who had been involved in rescue efforts, according to state media and Jordanian government spokeswoman Jumana Ghuneimat. Two of the bodies were found Saturday.\n\nSeparately, Israel's public radio said contact has been restored with six Israeli tourists who could not immediately be accounted for after the flooding. The Arabic-language Makan Radio said some of the tourists had been touring the Wadi Rum area, another major tourist attraction.\n\nThe torrents came two weeks after 21 people, most of them children, were killed in flash floods near the Dead Sea. The tourism and education ministers resigned over the Dead Sea flooding.\n\nIn Petra, the ancient trade hub carved into rose-hued rocks, heavy rains began at around 1 p.m. Friday and last for about 40 minutes, said Rafael Dorado, 41, a tourist from Spain.\n\nAt about 3 p.m., a torrent of water came gushing through the site's steep and narrow access canyon, flooding the area within minutes, he said. Delgado said he was observing from a hilltop temple in the area, but saw other visitors scrambling to higher ground. He said some visitors were later evacuated by trucks and others made their way out on foot.\n\nSuleiman Farajat, the chief administrator in Petra, said the site would remain closed Saturday, but would likely reopen Sunday. He said he's never seen flooding of such intensity in the area.\n\n\"It's really, I wouldn't say scary, but surprising how huge the flood was,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, contributed to this report.", "The few residents of the burned-out Northern California city of Paradise who were able to inspect their property on Saturday saw nothing but disappointment.\n\nNearly the entire city of 27,000 residents lay in ruins and most were still barred from returning to the still hazardous town where small fires continued to flare.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea said Saturday 14 additional bodies were found, bringing the death toll to 23. The victims have not been identified. Two people were found dead in a wildfire in Southern California, bringing the total number of fatalities for the state to 25.\n\nThe fire became California's third deadliest since record-keeping began, with the death toll surpassing that from a blaze last year that ravaged the city of Santa Rosa.\n\nAn additional search and recovery team on top of the four already on the ground was being brought in to search for remains, Honea said. An anthropology team from California State University, Chico was helping with that effort, he said. The state Department of Justice was sending a mobile DNA lab to the area to collect genetic material from the surviving relatives of the missing to speed the identification process.\n\nThe sheriff's office still has 110 outstanding reports of missing people, Honea said.\n\nIn some cases, investigators have only been able to recover bones and bone fragments, he said. He encouraged family members of the missing to submit DNA samples that could be compared with remains that are recovered.\n\n\"This weighs heavy on all of us,\" he said. \"Myself and especially those staff members who are out there doing what is important work but certainly difficult work.\"\n\nHonea added that he's hopeful that more of those missing people will be found. The department initially had more than 500 calls about citizens who were unable to reach loved ones.\n\nBut they have been able to help find many, he said.\n\nThe flames burned down more than 6,700 buildings, almost all of them homes, making it California's most destructive wildfire since record-keeping began.\n\nMore firefighters headed to the area Saturday, with wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour expected, raising the risk of conditions similar to those when the fire started Thursday, said Alex Hoon with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe blaze grew to 164 square miles (425 square kilometers), but crews made gains and it was partially contained, officials said. It has cost $8.1 million to fight so far, said Steve Kaufmann, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nPeople sidestepped metal that melted off cars and Jet-Skis and donned masks as they surveyed ravaged neighborhoods despite an evacuation order for all of Paradise, a town of 27,000 founded in the 1800s. Some cried when they saw nothing was left.\n\nJan McGregor, 81, got back to his small two-bedroom home in Paradise with the help of his firefighter grandson. He found his home leveled \u2014 a large metal safe and some pipe work from his septic system the only recognizable traces. The safe was punctured with bullet holes from guns inside that went off in the scorching heat.\n\nHe has lived in Paradise for nearly 80 years, moving there in 1939 when he said the town had just 3,000 people and was nicknamed Poverty Ridge. The fire was not a complete surprise, he said.\n\n\"We knew Paradise was a prime target for forest fire over the years,\" he said. \"We've had 'em come right up to the city limits \u2014 oh yeah \u2014 but nothing like this,\" he said.\n\nMcGregor said he probably would not rebuild: \"I have nothing here to go back to.\"\n\nHomes and other buildings in Paradise were still burning, and fire crews were trying to extinguish those blazes, said Scott McLean, a captain with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Officials warned firefighters to wear their helmets and be careful of falling trees.\n\nAbandoned, charred vehicles cluttered the main thoroughfare, evidence of the panicked evacuation as the wildfire tore through Thursday. The dead were found mostly inside their cars or and outside vehicles and homes.\n\nFive of the dead panicked when they couldn't escape by car because their route was cut off by a wall of fire, said Gabriel Fallon, who rode out the blaze with his parents to care for the horses, cows and livestock on their 10-acre farm in Paradise.\n\nThe group turned the other way and dashed down the paved street until it turned into dirt and passed the Fallons' farm, he said. One of the drivers stopped and asked Fallon if the direction they were going would lead them to safety. Fallon said he shook his head as the fire roared closer.\n\nThe motorists parked at the end of the road. On Saturday, the charred shells of the five cars remained where they had been parked.\n\nFallon went back to his property, where he, and his parents and their animals weathered the fire with a garden hose. The fire consumed their home, but left the barn intact.\n\n\"I was scared as hell,\" said Fallon, 42. \"I didn't know if I was going to die.\"\n\nHis mother, Cathy Fallon, said she tries not to think of what she lost when her house burned to the ground. Two of her dogs and nine cats died. She also lost her great-grandmother's mandolin and end table.\n\n\"I just can't think about it,\" she said, beginning to cry. \"The thing that hurts the most is that I lost my cats.\"\n\nElinor \"Jeannie\" Williams, 86, was not among the nine victims of the blaze but died as she waited to be airlifted from an evacuated hospital where she was being treated for a head injury.\n\nShe was dying, and the family expected to lose her in a few days, said her stepdaughter, Lisa. Still, her death has been hard on her 84-year-old father, Robert, who also may have lost his home, she said.\n\n\"He's lost, he's confused, he's trying to hang in there,\" she said. \"It's hitting him hard. Everything is gone, including his wife.\"\n\nTwo destructive wildfires also burned in Southern California , tearing through Malibu mansions and working-class suburban homes and killing two people.\n\nState officials put the total number of people forced from their homes by California's fires at more than 200,000. Evacuation orders included the entire city of Malibu that is home to some of Hollywood's biggest stars .\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an emergency declaration providing federal funding for fires on both ends of the state.

Nor must it lead to conflict,\" Mattis said.\n\nAlthough the rescheduling of the dialogue signaled an effort by the two sides to contain the slide in the relationship, it did not address the core dispute on trade. Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products, in a push to narrow the U.S. trade deficit and push back against what the U.S. views as predatory Chinese tactics on the high technology industry. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 million worth of U.S. goods.\n\nYun Sun, a China expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said Beijing is uncertain about what exactly Trump wants out of a trade deal, but hopes that with U.S. midterm elections out of the way, the mercurial American president may be more inclined to reach a compromise. \"Their top priority is to stabilize relations,\" she said.\n\nOn human rights, Pompeo voiced concern over China's treatment of religious minorities, including the mass detention of minority Uighur Muslims. But overall, the tone of the U.S. officials' public comments was milder than that of the Chinese. Yang insisted that Chinese people have freedom of religion, and that \"foreign countries have no right to interfere.\"", "The Latest on California's wildfires (all times local):\n\n1:30 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is threatening to withhold federal payments to California, claiming its forest management is \"so poor.\"\n\nTrump says Saturday via Twiitter that \"there is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly fires in California.\" Trump says \"billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests.

Her son Rafaat and his 13-year-old cousin Qusay ran and the militants fired at them.\n\n\"We were in the open air at the bottom of a valley as the clashes raged between the army and gunmen,\" she said. \"When my son tried to run away, they (IS militants) shot him. He was in my lap when he died.\"\n\nHis cousin Qusay bled to death after nearly five hours, Abu Ammar said.\n\n\"''I am very very sad,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview through a crackling line from her remote village of Shbiki. \"I am tired.\"\n\nA large funeral procession for the two children set out Saturday from the national hospital in Sweida to their village, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the east.\n\n\"What is the sin of those innocent children, who should now be in their classrooms,\" Monzer al-Shoufi, a resident of Sweida who took part in the procession, told AP by telephone.\n\nThe family of Abu Ammar suffered another loss in the kidnapping \u2014 Rafaat's grandmother was killed on the day of the abductions.\n\nNashaat Abu Ammar, Rafaat's father, said his mother was among those kidnapped by the militants, who forced the elderly, sick woman to walk about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). When she failed to continue, they shot her dead.\n\nThe militants kept their own injured who fell fighting with government troops in the hideouts with the hostages, another freed woman, Mashaal Saeed told reporters.\n\n\"Two days ago there were airstrikes and they suffered a lot. Many were injured and killed. They buried their dead while some lost their limbs. They put them right there with us,\" Saeed told reporters in a video posted online. \"This really scared the kids.\"\n\nSaeed said they were also held in a cave, and in a desert area, finally using a vehicle for the hostages to sleep in it, \"under it and next to it,\" creating a second level as sleeping quarters.\n\nThe rare attacks in the province populated mainly by minority Druze included several suicide bombings. The violence on July 25 devastated the community and shattered the region's calm. At least 216 people were killed and the militants walked away with the captives.\n\nNashaat Abu Ammar said about 20 of those killed were close relatives and 60 others were related.\n\nNajwa Abu Ammar said the captors held the group in different hideouts, including a camp and a cave, and once kept them in a moving car for over 12 hours, the captives not knowing where they were headed.\n\nThe militants fed them sporadically and beat and insulted the children. They didn't torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed.\n\nAt least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives' release.\n\nAbu Ammar's husband said she looked frail.\n\n\"Sometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,\" Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam.\n\n\"They held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,\" she said.\n\nAbu Ammar said she didn't know about the killed hostages until they were liberated.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nSeparately, a war monitoring group and Syrian state media accused the U.S.-led coalition of killing over two dozen civilians in airstrikes in Hajin, a town in southeastern Syria near the border with Iraq, IS's last stronghold.\n\nSpokesman Col. Sean Ryan told the AP in an email that the U.S.-led coalition \"successfully struck (and) destroyed\" an IS observation post and staging area in Hajin \"void of civilians at the time.\"\n\nRyan said the coalition team in charge of tracking civilians reviews claims of civilian casualties they see in media reports.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 26 persons, believed to be members of IS families, were killed in Hajin and another seven were killed in Shafaa in airstrikes Friday. The Observatory said the dead were mostly Iraqi women and children.\n\nSyria's state news agency reported 26 killed, quoting locals.\n\nThe Islamic State group posted a rare video from inside Hajin showing badly destroyed homes, bodies protruding from under rubble and dust still rising from some buildings.\n\nThe U.S-led coalition and local allies have been battling IS militants on the eastern banks of the Euphrates River in a small sliver of territory around Hajin.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report from Beirut.", "Thousands of Central American migrants set up tents and strung tarps at a stadium in the central Mexican city of Queretaro, where they arrived Saturday afternoon after departing the country's capital at dawn on their long trek to the U.S. border.\n\nTheir day began with dedicated Mexico City metro trains whisking them to the outskirts of the capital. At the end of the metro line, migrants began making their way to a main highway to resume walking and hitching rides with the tacit approval of Mexican officials.\n\nNear a major toll plaza about 19 miles (30 kilometers) north of the city, Mexico state police and human rights officials helped load men, women and children onto eighteen-wheelers and asked passing buses and trucks if they would carry migrants.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, a 41-year-old who left La Ceiba, Honduras nearly a month ago with her 8-year-old daughter, said she was prepared to wait to gain entry at the U.S. border.\n\n\"I decided to come (with the caravan) to help my family,\" she said, before she and her daughter were hoisted onto the back of a semitrailer.\n\nPerez is now one of roughly 4,000 migrants who proceeded to Queretaro \u2014 a state capital 124 miles (200 kilometers) to northwest of Mexico City\u2014 and then possibly to Guadalajara, Culiacan, Hermosillo and eventually Tijuana on the U.S. border.\n\nWhereas migrants like her carried tiny knapsacks with bare essentials in Mexico's tropical south, however, their belongings swelled noticeably after a multiday stop in Mexico City.\n\nMany are now hauling bundles of blankets, sleeping bags and heavy clothing to protect against colder temperatures in the northern part of the country. Some left the capital with bottles of water and clear plastic bags of bananas and oranges for the long trek. Others were given juice and ham sandwiches from volunteers as they set out.\n\nAstrid Daniela Aguilar, who was traveling with two cousins aged 3 and 4, lined up alongside the highway to await a chance at hitching a ride.\n\n\"You can't find work there,\" she said of her home country of Honduras.\n\nWhen they arrived in the stadium that Queretaro officials had prepared for them, they began getting ready for the night. Some set up tents, others found shelter beneath its concourse.\n\nVolunteers offered sandwiches, tortillas and rice to the travelers.\n\nThe caravan planned to leave Queretaro for Irapuato about 62 miles (100 kilometers) to the west at 5 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThe caravan became a campaign issue in U.S. midterm elections and U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of over 5,000 military troops to the border to fend off the migrants. Trump has also insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nMany migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, and they have now been on the road for weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.N. rejected a demand by caravan representatives for buses to the border, saying its agencies were \"unable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\"\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is rife with drug gangs and the migrants consider it too risky.\n\nMigrants are now taking a still perilous, but somewhat safer and longer route to Tijuana in Mexico's far northwest, across from San Diego.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most vowed to continue to the United States.\n\nGiselle Owen, a 15-year-old from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, belted out romantic ballads as the day's journey got underway.\n\n\"It relaxes me and I feel like I don't get tired,\" she said. \"I can walk hours singing.\"\n\nOthers got ahead by taking rides from friendly Mexicans.\n\nAngelica Martinez saw David Rodriguez pushing his friend Rafael Peralta of San Pedro Sula, Honduras down the side of the highway in a wheelchair.\n\nShe stopped in a lane of the highway to load the two migrants and the wheelchair into her small Volkswagen hatchback and said she would take them as far as she was going up the road.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Maria Verza contributed to this report.", "Actor Viggo Mortensen has apologized for using a racial slur during a panel discussion about his new film \"Green Book.\"\n\nMortensen, who is white, appeared Wednesday at the event with his co-star, Mahershala Ali, and director Peter Farrelly.\n\nMortensen told The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday he was making the point that many people casually used the slur in 1962, when the movie takes place.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who launched the Yemen war as the kingdom's defense minister in March 2015, faces widespread international criticism for the war and after members of his entourage allegedly took part in Khashoggi's slaying.\n\n\"We support the decision by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after consultations with the U.S. government, to use the coalition's own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a statement. \"The U.S. will also continue working with the coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country.\"\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what impact the U.S. withdrawal from air refueling operations would have. American officials earlier said Saudi forces now handled some 80 percent of their refueling operations, which crucially allow aircraft to fly longer sorties over possible targets and can ease the pressure for quick strikes.\n\nYet even with that refueling support, Saudi Arabia has faced widespread international criticism over its campaign of airstrikes in the coalition's war in Yemen, targeting Shiite rebels known as Houthis who hold the capital, Sanaa.\n\nSaudi strikes have hit public markets, hospitals and other nonmilitary targets, killing scores of civilians. One such Saudi-led airstrike in August in Yemen's Saada province hit a bus and killed dozens of people, including schoolchildren wearing backpacks. Human rights groups have found fragments of American-made munitions after several of these strikes.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity Friday to discuss the decision before its announcement, said the end to refueling wouldn't stop American training and military assistance. The Post first reported the Trump administration's desire to end the refueling.\n\nThe Saudi statement, carried early Saturday on the state-run Saudi Press Agency, did not acknowledge the Trump administration's discussions and pressure for its withdrawal.\n\n\"Recently the kingdom and the coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen,\" the statement read. \"As a result, in consultation with the United States, the coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for its operations in Yemen.\"\n\nIt also said it hoped upcoming United Nations sponsored talks \"in a third country\" would help end the war. U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths has said he is consulting with Yemen's warring parties to finalize details for a new round of peace talks. However, Griffiths' effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend, arguing they didn't have guarantees for their safe return.\n\nNews of the halt to U.S. refueling operations was swiftly dismissed by the Houthis as a media ploy that came in response to international pressure on Washington and Riyadh over the Yemen war.\n\n\"We have one clear demand and that is a complete halt to Saudi airstrikes,\" said one Houthi official who spoke to The Associated Press on Saturday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. \"If there is a halt to the airstrikes, then we can proceed to political negotiations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, intense fighting near the Red Sea port city of Hodeida continued over the weekend, with stepped up airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition pounding Houthi positions. On Saturday, the sound of large explosions east and north of Hodeida rocked the city as coalition forces tried to take the town of al-Saleh northeast of the city where they are meeting stiff resistance.\n\nThe Houthis maintain that their forces are holding their ground and deny losing territory to the coalition-led ground forces.\n\nThe pullout from refueling comes amid new American efforts to force an end to a conflict described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has stood on the brink of famine and faced disease outbreaks in a conflict that has killed at least 10,000 people.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE view the war as a means to limit Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula. While Iran directly denies arming the rebels, the United Nations and Western powers have documented arms transfers to the Houthis by Tehran of everything from Kalashnikov assault rifles to the ballistic missile technology used to periodically target cities as far away as the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh. The Houthis also have imprisoned opponents and indiscriminately laid land mines.\n\nBoth Mattis and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have pushed for a cease-fire in recent days. Saudi and Emirati forces, as well as their allies on the ground, have made a renewed push for the Houthi-held Red Sea port city of Hodeida, through which most food and aid enters Yemen. International aid agencies warn any disruption to the port could sever that crucial lifeline.\n\n\"Hodeida is at risk of being obliterated,\" said Mohamed Abdi of the Norwegian Refugee Council. \"We are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Lolita Baldor and Matthew Lee in Washington and Ahmed al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen contributed to this report.", "Saudi-led coalition in Yemen war says it has 'requested cessation of inflight refueling' by US for its fighter jets.", "Facebook is dropping a requirement for mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct allegations, acceding to a demand recently pressed by other Silicon Valley tech workers.\n\nGoogle made a similar change on Thursday, a week after thousands of employees briefly walked off their jobs to protest how the company handled sexual-misconduct allegations against prominent executives.\n\nThe move at , first reported by The Wall Street Journal, means that employees no longer have to submit to private arbitration, which kept misconduct allegations secret and sometimes allowed abusers to continue their behavior.

I can't tell you what's good and what's bad. I just show up and drive the cars,\" Harvick said Friday.\n\nBut his crew chief, Rodney Childers, said Stewart-Haas Racing modified the spoiler on Harvick's car because other teams were already doing similar alterations. Childers is suspended for the final two races of the season and working at the race shop in North Carolina as Harvick tries to overcome a devastating penalty issued this week for what NASCAR determined was a blatant case of cheating.\n\nHarvick won last weekend at Texas. When the spoiler was removed from his No. 4 Ford during an extensive inspection in North Carolina, NASCAR discovered the part had been altered.\n\nIt is NASCAR's belief that SHR built its own spoiler and tried to pass it off as one distributed by the vendor. The spoiler was offset to the right and NASCAR says it gave Harvick an aerodynamic advantage.\n\nSHR did not appeal the penalty and acknowledged \"NASCAR determined we ventured into an area not accommodated by its rule book.\"\n\nChilders elaborated in a series of tweets early Friday morning in which he said SHR made the decision to move the spoiler after other teams shifted their decklids and spoilers to the right in the previous 1.5-mile race at Kansas Speedway. Childers said it was too late for the team to move the decklid for the Texas race.\n\n\"This year there isn't a number or officiating on the offset of the decklid and spoiler together on the car. And at Kansas we noticed people we were racing had the spoilers and decklids further to the right than ours. And it was too late to move the decklid over more,\" Childers posted on .\n\nAdditional posts claimed the downforce advantage was \"4 counts. That's 0.04% of the total downforce of the car. If you think 4 counts is the reason we won you're way wrong.\"\n\nHe also said there were no hard feelings between NASCAR and SHR, which has all four of its drivers still eligible for the playoffs and has been the most dominant organization in NASCAR all season.\n\nHarvick leads the series with eight victories, but two were with illegal cars. His Las Vegas victory from earlier this year was disqualified, as was last week's Texas win. That disqualification cost Harvick his automatic berth into next weekend's championship race and Childers and car chief Robert Smith are suspended.\n\nHarvick is still mathematically in contention to advance into the final four and he's a nine-time winner at Phoenix, site of Sunday's final championship-qualifying event. He won at Phoenix earlier this year.\n\nHarvick, the 2014 champion, had no scheduled media availability at ISM Raceway but was required to attend a news conference after winning the pole. He was contentious as he declined to delve into the scandal surrounding his team, but praised the organization for its strong effort Friday.\n\n\"It's more about people than it is about cars and we've got a lot of good people,\" Harvick said. \"You can't drive a slow car fast and you can't beat good people.\"\n\nJoey Logano, the only driver already locked into next week's title race, was not bothered by the accusations against Harvick's team. He also said he's not wondering if SHR, or others, have been cheating all year.\n\n\"Everyone pushes hard and it's nothing new,\" Logano said. \"We like making a big deal out of it, a big stink out of it, but honestly it is part of our sport. There are a lot more items on our cars than there is in . As competitors we push to that edge and sometimes we go a little over the edge and sometimes it's all about the way you interpret the rulebook.\"\n\nLogano missed the playoffs last year because his only victory of the season was disqualified when his car failed inspection. That infraction at Richmond in the ninth race of the season haunted Logano's team the entire season.\n\nHe's not expecting the fallout from the SHR penalty to slow Harvick, who typically elevates his game during times of crisis.\n\nHarvick's 2014 championship season had brief drama because he shoved Brad Keselowski into a scrum to trigger a melee between Keselowski, Jeff Gordon and their crews. The next week, facing elimination if he didn't win at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race and advanced into the championship finale.\n\nHe won at Homestead to claim his first Cup title the next week.\n\nHarvick was runner-up the next season \u2014 a year in which he deliberately caused a wreck at Talladega to prevent a bad day hurting his title chances \u2014 and is trying to requalify for the finale for the fourth time in five years.\n\nLogano thinks Harvick will be steady this weekend and the biggest deficit the team is facing is not having Childers at the track to lead the team. Childers is banned from the garage but can be in communication with his crew. He said on Twitter he plans on putting in 14-hour work days at the North Carolina shop this weekend. It is possible he could be on property at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the finale.\n\n\"I think if there is going to be a hiccup, it's not gonna be on Kevin's part,\" Logano said. \"I think Kevin is the type of driver that rises to the occasion. There can be a hiccup in communication. Obviously, they'll be in communication with Rodney ... but it's not going to be very quick. You know the way things get lost in translation sometimes on the phone compared to being face-to-face.\n\n\"You are going to have those situations, and it's for the next two races. I'd say it's a big hit for them, but I'd also feel like that car is going to make it through (to Homestead) as fast as they are and going to their best race track.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reportedly plans to sharply restrict the sale of most flavored electronic-cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in retail stores and gas stations in an effort to decrease the prevalence of vaping.\n\nThe agency's plans, expected to be announced next week, are part of an effort to reduce the use of flavored e-cigarettes among teenagers. There are also plans to require age-verification measures for online sales to make sure minors are not able to buy them, according to reports this week in the New York Times and the Washington Post, which cite an unnamed senior FDA official describing the plans.\n\nThe agency has been raising red flags about e-cigarette use among teens for years.\n\n\u201cAll Americans need to know that e-cigarettes are dangerous to youth and young adults,\u201d then-U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said in 2016.\n\n\u201cAny tobacco use, including e-cigarettes, is a health threat, particularly to young people.\u201d\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nTobacco companies have fought efforts to cut e-cigarette flavors, stating they are not aimed at youth, but at adults, as an option to help transition from tobacco cigarettes. However, health advocates have pointed out that the advertising appeals to youth, featuring flavors including \u201cunicorn milk\u201d and \u201crocket popsicle.\u201d\n\nPublic officials are trying to strike a balance between the use of e-cigarettes to help adult tobacco cigarette smokers quit, while also not hooking a new generation on nicotine through e-cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA has also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling the devices to minors and has issued fines to some of them that have continued to sell them. Because the overwhelming majority of e-cigarette sales are through retail shops, the FDA\u2019s planned restrictions would have a huge negative impact on business.\n\nWhat are e-cigarettes?\n\nE-cigarettes are noncombustible tobacco products. They fall under the category or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Other terms used to describe ENDS are vapes, vape pens, vaporizers, hookah pens, and e-pipes. These products use an \u201ce-liquid\u201d that may contain nicotine and may have different flavorings, vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol and other ingredients. This liquid is then heated, creating an aerosol that is inhaled by the user.\n\nHow prevalent is the use of e-cigarettes?\n\nAccording to the FDA, in 2017 more than two million middle and high school students were users of e-cigarettes, which is the most commonly-used tobacco product in this population. This represents 11.7 percent of high school students and 3.3 percent of middle school students. Usage among these students is on the rise \u2013- in 2011, only 1.5 percent of all high school and middle school students used e-cigarettes.\n\nAre e-cigarettes safer than tobacco cigarettes?\n\nMore research is needed to answer this question. Researchers from Duke and Yale found that the flavoring compounds used in e-cigarettes combined with the e-liquid solvent can form a new compound that is often not reported as an ingredient in e-cigarettes but may lead to lung irritation.\n\nWhat restrictions are already in place?\n\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), signed into law in June, 2009 by Congress and the president, gives the FDA authority to regulate manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products in an effort to protect public health. This Act originally regulated tobacco cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.\n\nThen in Aug. 2016, the FDA finalized a rule that extends its regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars, and hookah and pipe tobacco.\n\nWhat are the planned restrictions?\n\nThe planned restrictions would ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes in retail stores and gas stations. However, the FDA does not plan to include the menthol and mint flavors in the restrictions, because there is concern that some users would switch to traditional menthol-tobacco cigarettes. The FDA plans to require age-verification for online sales, which would prohibit minors from buying them online.\n\nAre the planned restrictions likely to take effect right away?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when these restrictions will take place. The planned restrictions are likely to draw legal action. The Tobacco Control Act, as described above, gives the FDA authority to regulate manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products including e-cigarettes, but it \u201ccannot ban face-to-face sales in a particular category of retail outlets.\u201d\n\nJohanna Kreafle, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "Transcript for ISIS claims responsibility for deadly knife attack in Melbourne\n\nWe should know tomorrow.

Mr. President, what do you say to all the criticism of Matt Whitaker, and the calls for him to recuse himself given what he's said about the Russia investigation? Well, Matt Whitaker, I don't know Matt Whitaker. Matt Whitaker worked for Jeff sessions. And he was always extremely highly thought of, and he still is, but I didn't know Matt Whitaker. Reporter: But listen to what the president said just last month. I can tell you, Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker. Reporter: But again, today, the opposite.

Reporter: There are Republicans who want to join Democrats, but Mitch Mcconnell has made it clear those efforts are going nowhere in the senate.

The attack horrified hundreds of onlookers during the afternoon rush hour in Australia's second-biggest city.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said Shire Ali, who was shot by police and died in a hospital, had also made an \"unsophisticated\" plan for his vehicle to explode to cause many more fatalities. He had placed several barbecue gas canisters in the back of his pickup, with the outlet valves open, but they had failed to ignite.\n\n\"It looks like he's attempted to ignite a fire in the car, we believe at this stage with a view to igniting those canisters with some sort of explosion, but that didn't eventuate,\" Ashton told reporters.\n\nShire Ali, who moved to Australia with his family from Somalia in the 1990s, was known to police and the federal intelligence authority ASIO. He had a criminal history for cannabis use, theft and driving offences, Ashton said.\n\nAustralian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney told a media briefing on Saturday it was believed the attack was inspired by IS, though it was thought Shire Ali had no direct links to the organization.\n\n\"It's fair to say he was inspired. He was radicalized, with the rise of the caliphate and the propaganda that was put out on the internet. We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspirational perspective,\" McCartney said.\n\nMcCartney said the incident was a \"reality check\" for security agencies that \"even with the fall of the (IS) caliphate ... the threat continues to be real.\"\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said \"radical, violent, extremist Islam\" poses the greatest threat to Australia's national security.\n\n\"Here in Australia, we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,\" he said.\n\nMorrison said he had long-standing relationships with the Muslim community and it was them who had raised with him concerns about radicalism in recent years.\n\nShire Ali had family and associates who were also known to police. His brother Ali Khalif Shire Ali is currently on remand awaiting trial next year for allegedly planning an attack, Ashton said.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Friday's attack but provided no evidence. It said the man was an Islamic State fighter and had responded to IS calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nPolice and civilians had tried unsuccessfully to subdue Shire Ali before he was shot in the chest by a police officer, who Ashton said only graduated from the police academy three months ago.\n\nA man aged 74, who had been stabbed in the face, died at the scene. Two other men, aged 26 and 58, are in a hospital with what police describe as non-life threatening injuries.\n\nAshton also said police had searched two Melbourne properties on Saturday in relation to the attack, but that police did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the public.\n\nIt's the second time in four years Australia has witnessed militant violence.\n\nIn December 2014, a 17-hour siege in which a gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe ended with two hostages dead and the assailant killed by police. Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group. However, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman's actions fell \"within the accepted definition of terrorism.\"\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\nAshton says there is no suggestion Shire Ali was inspired by James \"Dimitrious\" Gargasoulas, who faced court this week on six charges of murder over the first ramming attack, in January 2017.", "Starting today, the Holidays begin here at the Disneyland Resort!

It's also a statement that stands in absolute contradiction to what he told Fox News less than a month ago, responding to a report in the Washington Post that he was considering appointing Whitaker to the job.\n\nOn Oct. 11, he told Fox and Friends: \"I can tell you Matt Whitaker's a great guy. I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\n\"Finding new votes out of nowhere\"\n\nThe Florida Senate race still hasn't been called and Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson is edging closer to GOP Gov. Rick Scott. On Friday morning, the president suggested, citing no evidence, that Democrats are engaged in a voter fraud.\n\n\"All of a sudden, they're finding votes out of nowhere,\" the president said. \"I say this: [Gov. Scott] easily won, but every hour, it seems to be going down. I think that people have to look at it very, very cautiously.\" On Thursday, he tweeted that he was sending lawyers to \"expose the FRAUD!\"\n\nIn reality, it appears Broward County simply hasn't finished counties its ballots.\n\nIt's fair to say that the county election officials are slow, and there could even be incompetence, but to suggest there is fraud without providing evidence is irresponsible. It's important to note that, by law, the officials have until Saturday at noon to submit the county's vote totals.\n\nFurther, coming from the president, the claim is hard to believe.\n\nShortly after the 2016 election, Trump claimed there were more than three million illegal votes cast, but his own voter fraud commission disbanded over the summer after many governors refused to cooperate and the group was unable to provide any evidence to back up that claim.\n\nAnd in Arizona, where votes are still being counted and Democrat Krysten Sinema on Friday held the lead by a tenth of a percent, Trump claimed they are \"all of a sudden\" finding votes \"out of the wilderness.\" In fact, as of Thursday evening, Maricopa County said it still had over half a million votes to count.\n\nStick with me\n\nThe day after the election, the president falsely claimed that all those who campaigned with him and supported him did well, adding those who did not, lost.\n\nThis was the president's tweet the morning after the election: \"Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye!\"\n\n\"Too bad, Mike...Sorry about that, Mia.\" President Trump calls out GOP candidates who distanced themselves from him and \"did very poorly.\" https://t.co/VNzjgOMoJc pic.twitter.com/OYZb5JxYpD \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 7, 2018\n\nHe claimed later Wednesday morning in a press conference that of the 11 candidates he campaigned with, nine won. In fact, he campaigned with 13 candidates, three lost, and two races are still too close to call. It's likely they'll go Republican, though.\n\nMore significant, in the end, 33 out of the 61 candidates Trump endorsed ended up winning their races. That's just over half. Twenty-two out of 61 were losers.

The measure will be revised, though, under a compromise that won the approval of influential Mormon church leaders.\n\nThe faith had opposed the ballot proposal over fears it could lead to broader use, but after months of fierce debate agreed to the deal. It will change the law by blocking marijuana edibles like cookies that might appeal to children and won't allow people to grow their own marijuana if they live too far from a dispensary.\n\nThe state Legislature is expected to meet in early December to hammer out the details of revising the newly passed law.\n\nMissouri also passed a medical marijuana initiative in this midterm election. Michigan became the first Midwestern state to legalize recreational marijuana while North Dakota voted against it.\n\nUtah's approval of medical marijuana shows the state's residents can think for themselves despite opposition from powerful groups such as the Utah Chiefs of Police Association, Utah Medical Association and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Utah's population, said DJ Schanz, director of the group that put the proposition on the ballot.\n\n\"We're excited that these sick and ailing patients will finally be able to find relief without being criminalized in Utah,\" said Schanz, director of the Utah Patients Coalition. \"This a big message that Utahns are compassionate people ... that people can think and vote autonomously.\"\n\nWith the Medicaid vote, Utah joins two other Republican-leaning states, Idaho and Nebraska, where voters also approved expanding the program under President Barack Obama's health care law.\n\n\"We've got a mandate from the public,\" said Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project.

Add Jamal Khashoggi as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jamal Khashoggi news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPrince Turki Al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's former spy chief, said Friday the country is proud of its judicial system and will never accept an international investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, human rights groups, and some government leaders have called for an independent probe into the Oct. 2 killing of the Washington Post columnist at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul where he had gone to get papers so he could marry his Turkish fiance. The United States called Monday for a \"thorough, conclusive and transparent\" investigation at the Geneva-based Human Rights Council.\n\nTurki said in a speech and question-and-answer session at the International Peace Institute think tank that he expects the kingdom to live up to its promise to investigate and \"put all of the facts on the table\" and answer all outstanding questions, including what happened to Khashoggi's body.\n\n\"The kingdom is not going to accept an international tribunal to look into something that is Saudi, and the Saudi judicial system is sound, it is up, it is running, and it will take its course,\" he said. \"The kingdom ... will never accept foreign interference in that system.\"\n\nIn doing this, Turki said, Saudi Arabia is following other countries that have refused to allow international tribunals to investigate acts that happened on their soil or elsewhere by their citizens. He cited the abuse of prisoners by American troops and CIA staff at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion which the United States investigated.\n\nTurki said Khashoggi was the Saudi embassy spokesman when he was ambassador to the United States and Britain, and they had been \"very friendly over the years.\" He described Khashoggi's death, citing a verse from the Quran. \"It says that the killing of an innocent man is like the killing of all of humanity. His death falls into that category,\" Turki said.\n\nSaudi Arabia had insisted for weeks after Khashoggi disappeared that he had walked out of the consulate, before changing its account to say he died in a brawl. Last month, Saudi Arabia acknowledged that Turkish evidence indicates that Khashoggi's killing was premeditated, shifting its explanation in an apparent effort to ease international outrage over the death.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who was critical of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was strangled and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 by a 15-member assassination squad. Media reports have suggested that his body could have been chemically dissolved.\n\nSaudi officials characterize the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority. Yet some of those implicated in the killing are close to the crown prince, including a member of the prince's entourage on foreign trips who was seen at the consulate before Khashoggi's slaying. And crown prince Mohammed's condemnation of the killing has failed to ease suspicions that he was involved.\n\nTurkey is seeking the extradition of 18 suspects who have been detained in Saudi Arabia, so they can be put on trial in Turkey. They include the 15 members of the alleged \"hit squad.\"\n\nPrince Turki, who is chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, said his view is that there was no attempted cover up.\n\nRather, he said, what was reported to Saudi authorities was \"misleading\" because \"those who perpetrated the crime wanted to hide what had happened and to justify what they had told the authorities.\"\n\nHe accused the media of seeking \"sensation\" and of \"laying accusations\" about the crown prince \"without a fact,\" and based on \"pure speculation.\"\n\n\"The truth is you can never hide the truth \u2014 and the kingdom will never attempt to hide the truth, not just on this situation but on other situations,\" he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the final report \"will lay out exactly what happened and answer all of these questions that have been speculated about and made into tremendous issues.\"", "Transcript for Reporter's Notebook: Robin Roberts on exclusive Michelle Obama interview\n\nHi there I'm Linda Davis for ABC news live with the reporter's notebook and V one of the only Robin Roberts thank you so much we really haven't reported. Those of my life. Wanted to. The thing is so much for talking my pleasures you sent down with Michelle Obama her new book becoming. Lots of stuff I loved to get to. Starting off with her self doubt I think a lot of people are going to be not only surprised but able to relate. To the idea that but it's like well Michelle Obama's struggles owes her own. Two Ivy League degrees not one not 21 being a lot lately but it's not just herself out if the level of her self doubt. And even now wondering is she being heard at times. And I think it is something that women we hear that. We weave not along and going yes we we do that we say are we good enough and she said that repeatedly throughout her journey. Am I good enough and my good enough from when she was in high school. And was told by the counselor. You're not Princeton material alone OK and so she said I'll show you and so she goes on to Princeton and then goes on the Harvard. Law school but she you haven't so incredibly. Her candor. And and and and everything that she. Discusses and Michelle Obama feels like if you going to write a book. Then write a book until Carl read it's it's all without. Being nasty vicious or mean yes that's you talk about the current administration as he does she mentioned. Donald Trump yes she does we've seen the quotes that have been out it is such a small portion. Of the book in such a small portion of hurl her life. It is not a political book. This is a chapter it's a chapter to chapter life story politics is not her life story but it is a very important chapter in. And she feels that she wool which will speak her mind and and feels that she parents. What's so obviously the book she gets very personal talks about and I like to take a clip and take a listen to that the fact that he Obama's lead to marriage counseling with sickle listen. You write about at one point in your marriage and that you have Barack what's in marriage counseling and why did you think it was important decisions that. For those young people out there who think that. Marriage is supposed to be easy. And marriage counseling for us was one of those ways will we learned had a top batter differences what I learned about myself was that. My happiness was up to me and I started working out more I started asking for help. Not just from him but from other people I stopped feeling guilty. It's important for me to take care of myself that's not on Iraq I know too many young couples who struggle. And I think that somehow it's this there's something wrong with then I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama who had eight phenomenal marriage and who love each other. We would we work on our marriage that we get help with our marriage when we needed. I think that was so praying for everybody right it is in a relationship in marriage and all why did she say that she was going so deep so personal gosh. She should well first I look bush took ownership right and and not trying to place the blame saying we're not on hammer or anything like that. And again because shoes and should be put up on all. And if she does it sometimes people do that with. Barack and Michelle Obama and she wants everyone to realize. That. The story that she is telling. I remember onassis' so why are you writing this book and and why are you doing it now and and and what I what do you hope. And usually would you say that someone ozone hole I hope people like and I hope I shouldn't say that she's I hope people get something out of a balloon. I hope people get something out that's how she approaches everything so. Knowing that of course is that a talk about. Marriage counseling and talk and talk about the difficulty in in getting pregnant and other things because. She truly wants to be of service to other. It's not about getting ready for 20/20 not be you know I'm target group we are going to have nothing about that you're great on the campaign trail that intimate terms were great out Indiana. But that's not what she is instance or not and killing actress you know since you can find another way to be a public service that. Dozen of all politics. And speaking of politics is this is going to be a big head my church and she references president trump and and she wrote. What does someone with an unstable mine loaded gun and drove to Washington what if that person went looking for our girls Donald Trump with his loud and reckless innuendoes was putting my family's safety at risk and for this I'd never forgive him. Yeah she went there and she says. That personal. Who she is there. Larson so she really felt that the rhetoric was. Putting her family at risk and that it was. It was not intentional to put her family at risk but what he was saying was intentional. That it was proven that was up about the birther controversy that it did was debunked. And he brings it back so that was intentional and trying to hurt them in that regard not trying to say that he was intentionally trying to cause harm to them but as she's had. We live in today. And get words do matter and so it's very difficult for her to say that she can forgive him because. She loves her family she loves her children and if anybody. Is thinking about doing harm to them. Yeah she's not gonna forget that. I'd be curious to get near taken in you've known Michelle Obama from. Mrs. Obama to now Michelle and reading her book things that surprise do things that the typical American wouldn't know that you have insight also in on T into who she was. Very surprised by I had the miscarriage about talking so pulling about that and also about the the marriage counseling. But I can't go back to I was really. Her level of self doubt when you read the book how many times and in many different. Times and her life that she dealt with that and you you look at her. And all that she has accomplished an you realize oh my gosh. We all feel that way at some point especially women and there are many times. There is a part that really. Resonated with me. When she said she is playing with a cousin and she about ten years old cousin so why do you talk like a white girl whom. Didn't just because of my gosh you know when she is saying how do you. How how. How do you square who you are or where you come from we're where you wanna go. And not seen a pretty and not having so she was really. It up and all those discussions. Like that. The very relatable and in many ways and it's very important to her because she really wanted to be for the broader good she really wants it to spark a conversation. Her life story and that it will generate a conversation that for the broader good is she's always looking. That's as a great sacrifice anybody who goes into the political world and she and her family have have done that as she's gonna find a different way. To now be of service. This thing use of the word relayed along want to just take one look at surprise. When she went and visited some kids at a school in Chicago. Are you guys in the evening news. Yeah. Okay. Have to ask what yeah. Action. Sit right there that's Michelle Obama that's ball you know you should take all the hits from people saying what they wanna say about iron and and she has done that. Bushel do that for the greater good and many pernicious when she was First Lady is all about children and helping them. I'm girls and education it's always you locked at her alma mater like that and and they responded and it was supposed to be like a photo op let's is going they earn and there won't.

Andrew Cuomo, said in an email.\n\nThe state Department of Health published its proposals for banning e-cigarettes in the New York State Registry on Wednesday. The agency later withdrew them to allow more time for legal review. The regulations will be republished soon, the agency said. They could then be adopted after a 60-day period of public comment.\n\nThe Cuomo administration's plans come as the federal government plans to require strict limits on the retail sale of most flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nCiting recent data regarding young people using e-cigarettes, Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September that there's an \"epidemic of addiction\" among youth, mainly driven by flavored products.\n\nNew York state health officials began tracking e-cigarette use in New York in 2014. Since then, use by high school youths increased from 10.5 percent to 27.4 percent in 2018, the health department said.\n\n\"Swift interventions are needed to protect our youth from a lifetime addiction to nicotine,\" the agency said in its proposed rules for banning the sale of flavored vaping products.\n\nTony Abboud, executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, a vaping trade group, called New York's proposal short-sighted and said it would be \"devastating\" to adult smokers trying to quit traditional cigarettes through use of flavored vapor products.\n\nAlthough vaping is generally considered a less dangerous alternative to smoking traditional tobacco products, health officials have warned nicotine in e-cigarettes is harmful to developing brains.\n\nHealth advocates have worried about the popularity of vaping products among kids, especially e-cigarettes with mint, fruit, chocolate or any number of other flavorings sold online and at convenience stores, gas stations and vape shops. The minimum age to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes in New York state is 18.\n\nThe state health department said banning flavored e-cigarettes would mostly impact retail businesses whose main focus is selling vaping products. According to the New York State Vapor Association, there are at least 700 vape shops employing a total of 2,700 people across the state.", "Transcript for Mail bombing suspect Cesar Sayoc indicted on 30 counts, faces life in prison\n\nAnd the man accused of sending pipe bombs are critics of president trump has been indicted on charges that could send him and sentence him to life in prison.

Or, more precisely, did you hear all 3,128 jokes?\n\nA think tank that has studied the content of late-night comedy for the past 26 years said Donald Trump was the butt of more jokes in 2017 than any other public figure has for a single year. By a lot.\n\nHe beat the previous record of 1,816, set by Trump as a presidential candidate in 2016, said the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University in a study released Friday. Prior to that, the record was 1,717 by former President Bill Clinton in 1998, the year of Monica Lewinsky.\n\n\"Trump makes Bill Clinton look like a piker when it comes to political humor,\" said Robert Lichter, head of the center. The study looked at opening monologue jokes on shows hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Trevor Noah last year.\n\nThere were a total of 6,337 political jokes in the show's monologues last year, and Trump was the subject of nearly half of them.\n\nPresidential humor has always been a staple of late-night comedy, but hosts would often make a couple of jokes about the president and quickly move on to other news stories, said Bill Carter, author of \"The Late Shift\" about the television comedy shows. That's not the case anymore, he said.\n\n\"Rarely is there another news story that provides fodder enough for the writers,\" Carter said. \"The writers seem to be consumed, as the nation is consumed, as the news media is consumed. There's an endless and bottomless supply.\"\n\nColbert has vaulted to the top of the late-night ratings with a Trump-centric approach, and his rivals have taken notice.\n\nTrump's presidency has left many in the country in a state of high anxiety, and comedy provides an outlet, Carter said.\n\nCarter used to think that viewers would get tired of all the Trump jokes, but now he's not so sure.\n\n\"If Colbert came out and didn't do a monologue about Trump, you'd say, 'What happened?'\" he said.\n\nThe constant firehose of news coming from the president exhausts reporters along with providing material for the comic writers, he said. That has its downside, however, since late-night writers frequently complain about having to throw jokes out and write new ones late in the afternoon, he said.", "Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Friday:\n\nYelp Inc., down $11.57 to $31.93\n\nThe online reviews company's revenue and forecasts fell far short of Wall Street forecasts.\n\nWalt Disney Co., up $2 to $118\n\nThe entertainment company disclosed a larger-than-expected profit as its movies performed well at the box office.\n\nHess Corp., down 8 cents to $59.15\n\nEnergy companies fell as oil prices continued to plunge.\n\nActivision Blizzard Inc., down $7.78 to $55.01\n\nThe video game maker forecast disappointing sales over the holidays.\n\nRevlon Inc., up $6.81 to $28.61\n\nThe beauty products company's profit was stronger than analysts expected.\n\nFinisar Corp., up $2.91 to $21.79\n\nThe fiber optic component supplier agreed to be bought by II-VI for $3.2 billion in cash and stock.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Co., up $2.90 to $63.80\n\nHousehold goods makers and other high-dividend stocks fared better than the rest of the market Friday as high-growth companies fell.\n\nPG&E Corp., down $7.88 to $39.92\n\nCalifornia utility companies fell as fast-moving wildfires in the southern part of the state spread.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the wildfires are in southern, not northern, California.", "In a story Nov. 8 about Ford buying electric scooter company Spin, The Associated Press reported erroneously the owner of Ford Go Bike.

Gomez is now an ABC News contributor.\n\n\"If they think that somebody is experiencing mental health issues \u2026 they have to report it to the police,\" said Gomez. \"Even if the police might not be able to do anything, at least it would be on record and if there are multiple reports, then that could be the basis for some type of intervention.\"\n\nThere are known examples of where such alerts have helped raise red flags about individuals and, potentially, stopped attacks.\n\nRobyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne recent example came in Montgomery County, Maryland, where high school students told their school resource officer that a former student was posting photos of himself holding an AR-15 rifle and loaded magazines, writing: \"Ha, ha, I\u2019m going to shoot up the school,\" according to the Montgomery County Police.\n\nThe individual, 18-year-old Luis Cabrera, was arrested and charged with one count of threat of mass violence, and he is being held without bond, police said.\n\nCohen said that situation was an example of\"\u201cexactly what we hope will happen across the country\" with members of the public informing officials and then officials taking action.\n\n\"It\u2019s a whole-of-community approach. People, whether they be students, parents family members \u2026 when they observe the warning signs, they have to report it to law enforcement,\" he said.\n\nStay alert and take responsibility for your own safety\n\nThere are also precautions that people can take to protect themselves in public.\n\nJoe Bucchignano, a police officer paramedic who is a certified emergency preparedness and response instructor, said that being in the right mindset is crucial.\n\n\"It starts with kind of having some level of acceptance that any time you\u2019re out in public, you're at risk. We can try to ignore it, we can try to pretend that that threat is not there, but if that\u2019s your mindset ... you're already putting yourself behind the curve in terms of survivability,\" Bucchignano said.\n\n\"Some people will say it's paranoia. It\u2019s not paranoia. Its preparedness and taking your own personal safety and survivability into your own hands,\" he added.\n\nKnowing where the exits and entrances of a venue are located is important, Bucchignano said, but it's not enough.\n\nIt\u2019s also about \"having that sense of being responsible for your own safety and not relying initially on professionals -- law enforcement or emergency medical services -- because realistically, with these types of situations, law enforcement's priority initially is not to treat or evacuate injured people but to locate the shooter and to stop them,\" he explained.\n\nDavid McNew/Getty Images\n\nCohen said that \"if they can do so safely,\" witnesses and survivors can help law enforcement by getting information to them about the unfolding situation. Letting police know how many shooters there are, for instance, is helpful.\n\n\"This is really dangerous for law enforcement as well because of the way they\u2019re responding, so the more information they have, they can be more efficient and also safer,\" Cohen explained.\n\n'Run, hide, fight'\n\nGomez echoed the federal guidance for active shooter situations, which is to \"run, hide, fight.\"\n\n\"If they [civilians] are faced in a situation where they can\u2019t escape, they have to conceal themselves but also look for opportunities when the attacker is distracted to then stop the attacker, such as when the attacker is reloading,\" Gomez said.\n\nGomez acknowledged that intervening to try to stop the shooter \"is very difficult, given the fear and stress that they're under.\u201d\n\nAs for the third step, Gomez said that people can look for tools around them to help either escape or fight.\n\nIn the case of the recent shooting in Thousand Oaks, California, Gomez pointed out how patrons used barstools to break the windows and escape.\n\nHe added that objects like furniture can also be used \"as a weapon against an attacker.\"\n\nEducate yourself\n\nWhile some companies require employees to go through hazardous environment training, Bucchignano said that there are other training programs that are offered to members of the public that include simulated active shooter scenarios.\n\nSuch exposure to potential scenarios, Bucchignano said, helps because \"the first time you\u2019re experiencing that isn\u2019t real life, when it\u2019s actually happening.\" These courses let people learn how to respond in \"a controlled environment.\"\n\nAs for medical training, Bucchignano said that the three types of potentially treatable injuries that are most common in mass shooting incidents are instances of massive external bleeding, penetrating trauma to the chest cavity, and airway obstruction or people with uncontrolled airways.\n\nWhile many first aid programs focus on CPR, Bucchignano said that such training is certainly helpful for some situations, but not typically in the middle of a mass shooting incident.\n\n\"CPR will completely destroy your ability to be aware of what\u2019s going on around you, so in that care-under-fire stage \u2026 it\u2019s about moving yourself and the victim to an area of hard cover where it\u2019s going to afford you some level of safety and bleeding control. Those are the two things that are important in that situation,\" he said.", "Broward County election officials will have to disclose how many ballots are outstanding and yet to be counted, a federal judge ruled in Florida.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nJudge Carol-Lisa Phillips of the 17th Judicial Circuit of Florida ruled in favor of Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who filed an emergency complaint late Thursday night against Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n\nThe ruling allows for an immediate inspection of the most current information on the number of ballots both already cast and still uncounted. Scott and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson are in the midst of a razor-thin race for Florida's Senate seat.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nPhilips ordered the information be made available by 7 p.m., but even after midnight, Scott\u2019s campaign told ABC News Broward County has not disclosed how many votes are still outstanding.\n\n\u201cIt should be there, it should not slow down the proceedings, it should be a matter of record at this point,\u201d Phillips said in her ruling. \u201cThis is information that should have already been compiled.\"\n\nScott\u2019s campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will also have access to those ballots, per the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe county faces a noon deadline Saturday to send unofficial preliminary results to the state.\n\nScott spoke to Sean Hannity on Fox News Friday night and said Nelson was trying to \"steal\" this election.\n\n\"Bill Nelson's lawyers, who is trying to steal this election, they went to federal court today trying to get the certification postponed,\" Scott told Hannity. \"They were not able to do that, so basically tomorrow, my win will be certified by the court subject to a recount.\n\n\"It looks like they are going to do everything they can to steal this election,\" he continued. \"I'm so disappointed in Bill Nelson.\"\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSnipes\u2019 attorney Eugene Pettis argued in court that the lawsuits were an attempt by Scott and the NRSC to slow things down.\n\n\u201cWhether they\u2019re saying it or not, they\u2019re interfering with the counting process, which should be Dr. Snipes\u2019s primary responsibility,\u201d Pettis said, arguing that Snipes is not denying the information should be made public but that she had only 26 hours to get her job done.\n\nPettis disputed Scott's earlier comments about the fundamental importance of protecting the vote.\n\n\"I think there's something equally fundamental, which is to count the vote,\" Pettis said.\n\nScott\u2019s attorney Jason Zimmerman noted that his clients were not requesting Broward County stop counting votes.\n\n\u201cThis is a simple request that the supervisor of elections should have provided,\u201d Zimmerman said.\n\nScott has filed another lawsuit in Palm Beach County, which has also not finished counting its votes.\n\nA narrow margin in the votes cast in the divided state has Florida gearing up for recounts in both the gubernatorial and senate races. Nelson has not yet conceded to Scott, who currently leads by less than 0.2 percent with ballots across the state still uncounted.\n\nState rules mandate a recount if the margin is less than 0.5 percent, which looks entirely possible as Broward County and Palm Beach County, both Democratic-leaning counties, haven\u2019t completed counting mail-in ballots \u2014 and one of them hasn\u2019t finished counting early ballots, either. Many more counties continue to count provisional ballots. Counties face a noon Saturday deadline to report preliminary results to the state and thin margins could trigger a recount could come as early as then.\n\nIan Witlen/REX/Shutterstock\n\nScott carried a larger lead Tuesday night, but continues to see it dissipate as more votes come in. Scott has responded by accusing county election supervisors of corruption.\n\nScott is backed by support from the president, the GOP and Florida\u2019s current Republican Sen.

But in Florida, where Nelson is awaiting results against Scott, Trump won the state by less than 1.5 percentage points.", "In many ways, two Americas voted Tuesday: One that is large, white, and shrinking; another that\u2019s far smaller, more racially, ethnically and culturally diverse -\u2013 and growing inexorably.\n\nLook back a generation: 91 percent of voters in 1990 were white. Tuesday, 72 percent were white, the fewest on record for midterms in exit polls dating to 1982. Twenty-eight percent were nonwhite -\u2013 triple the level 28 years ago.\n\nelection MORE: Midterm s 2018: Democrats take House, Trump claims \u2018big win,\u2019 but many races too close to call\n\nABC NEWS\n\nWithin-group results, notably by age, widen the picture. Among this week\u2019s voters age 65 and older, 82 percent were white. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, that fell to 56 percent. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and those of other or mixed racial or ethnic backgrounds accounted for 44 percent of the youngest voters.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t chiefly represent higher turnout among nonwhites; it reflects the fact that there simply are more of them in the nation\u2019s younger population. Demographics rule: As time progresses and the older cohort moves on to the big polling station in the sky, diversity will rise.\n\nPolitically, it matters. More-diverse young voters backed Democrats for the House by 67-32 percent this week, their largest Democratic margin on record in any exit poll, midterm or presidential, since 1976. Seniors, by contrast, split 48-50 percent, Democratic-Republican.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nWhat\u2019s often missed in discussions of the age gap is that it\u2019s largely racial and ethnic in nature. Young whites voted 55-44 percent (Democrat-Republican); young nonwhites, 81-17 percent. Among seniors, whites voted 43-56 percent; nonwhites, 76-23 percent. The bigger difference by far is not age, but the racial/ethnic composition of the age groups.\n\nThe large size of the exit poll lets us look at nonwhites beyond blacks \u2013- who voted Democratic by 90-9 percent \u2013- and Hispanics, 69-29 percent (with their turnout a record midterm high). Asians, 3 percent of voters, voted Democratic by 77-23 percent, their widest Democratic margin in available exit poll data dating to 1990. American Indians voted Democratic by 10 points; those of other races, by 19.\n\nLook, too, at the distribution of these groups by age. Among whites, 24 percent on Tuesday were under age 40. This rose to three in 10 blacks, American Indians and people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds; 41 percent of Hispanics; and 44 percent of Asians -\u2013 further clear evidence that future is a more diverse one.\n\nThe level of diversity varies by age groups (higher among younger voters, lower among older), but it also varies by the urban/suburban/rural split. Eighty-five percent of rural voters Tuesday were white. So were 75 percent in the suburbs and seven in 10 in small- and mid-sized cities. In the nation\u2019s large cities (of 500,000 or more), by contrast, 48 percent were white. A majority of big-city voters, 52 percent, were nonwhite.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nBig-city dwellers voted 76-22 percent for Democratic over Republican House candidates, the widest Democratic margin by far in these groups. Indeed it\u2019s a challenge to the Democrats that their vote is so urban-based, rather than well\u2013distributed across metro and geographic areas.\n\nThere does look to be an independent metro-status effect: Big-city residents are a strong Democratic group regardless of race, even if more so among nonwhites than whites. And it\u2019s notable that 37 percent of rural nonwhites voted Republican.\n\nBut the critical suburbs, home to half of all voters, show a striking difference: White suburban voters favored GOP candidates by 16 points; nonwhites in the suburbs voted Democratic by 45 points. It\u2019s not suburban voters in general that made it a close contest there. It\u2019s the differential population sizes and vote preferences between white and nonwhite suburban voters.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nOne last slice is by region. Eighty-three percent of voters in the Midwest on Tuesday were white, compared with a low of 63 percent in the West. Suburban, mid-size city and rural Midwesterners all were overwhelmingly white; yet voters in Midwestern big cities were majority nonwhite. It\u2019s a similar story, if not quite as pronounced, in the East. Big cities in the South and West, instead, are more racially and ethnically mixed \u2013 indeed, closely divided between whites and nonwhites.\n\nLooking at region by vote, we see some differences among whites \u2013 compare Southern whites and Midwestern whites, +31 and +13 points Republican, respectively, with Eastern and Western whites +10 and +5 Democratic. But the vast gaps are between whites and nonwhites -\u2013 and as the age-by-race results by show, more nonwhites is where the population is heading.\n\nABC NEWS\n\nThese results provide both a roadmap to the present -\u2013 and a portent of the future. Nonwhite voters overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates and have done so for decades. The exit poll makes clear that their numbers are on the rise. To avoid more and bigger blue waves, now more than ever, the Republican Party needs to break out of its own white bubble.", "Transcript for 5 dead after Northern California wildfire engulfs vehicles, officials say\n\nOvernight a fast moving wildfire and we're.

He was responsible for the safety of 28 coalition and Afghan National Army (ANA) personnel, including several principals: two brigade commanders, two battalion commanders, the brigade command sergeant major, a battalion command sergeant major and an ANA battalion commander.\n\nThe group was targeted on its way to a meeting that Groberg, who is now 35 years old, said had been happening every week for years in Asadabad, Afghanistan.\n\nArmy Handout\n\n\u201cThey came at us with two suicide bombers,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see a weapon so I could not personally engage him [with] my personal weapon, but I was the closest to him. So at that point I started screaming at him and I sprinted toward him. I hit him across the chest real hard, realized he was wearing a suicide vest... and I grabbed him, yelled \u2018bomb!\u2019 and threw him as far away as possible as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nGroberg said he made that split-second decision \u201cbecause I had one mission that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople ask why you do such an act, why do you run toward danger. It\u2019s because it\u2019s our job. I took an oath,\u201d Groberg said. \u201cI had a responsibility and I told [a high-ranking officer\u2019s] wife I\u2019d take him home. On that specific day, if that meant that I didn\u2019t come home and he did... that\u2019s a good day at work.\u201d\n\nArmy Handout\n\nGroberg lost 50 percent of his lower calf and is now officially deaf in his left ear. He also suffered a severe concussion from the blast.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the scariest part. When you can\u2019t count,\u201d Groberg said. \u201cAbout week three, they brought in pictures of a giraffe. And I just couldn\u2019t tell. I mean, I knew what it was, but I couldn\u2019t tell the lady this was a giraffe. ... Look, I\u2019ve never been great at math, but she asked me how many quarters are in a dollar, and I couldn\u2019t put that together.\u201d\n\nStill, the hero said his \u201cinjuries are very minimal compared to thousands\u201d of other veterans.\n\n\u201cMy brain and my mind wasn\u2019t right, but it healed,\u201d Groberg said. He was treated for nearly two years at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nGroberg said he stands by his decision but still struggles with regret for his fallen friends: \u201cI would do it again, and I would try to be better,\" he said, mentioning that four other soldiers didn't come home from that fateful day.\n\nU.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin J. Griffin, 45, U.S. Army Maj. Thomas E. Kennedy, 35, U.S. Air Force Maj. Walter D. Gray, 38, and Mr. Ragaei Abdelfattah, 43, died in the attack.\n\n\u201cSo when I was in the hospital ... When they close the doors at night, all I could think of was what could I have done better to bring them home?\u201d\n\nArmy Handout\n\nGroberg was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Obama in November 2015. At the ceremony, the president said, \"On his very worst day, he managed to summon his very best. That's the nature of courage.\"\n\nGroberg, an immigrant from France, became a naturalized citizen at 17 and decided to join the Army only a couple of years later.\n\nHe said his decision to serve in the military was \u201cpersonal, obviously for many reasons.\u201d One them them: When he was 13 years old, his family in Algeria was targeted by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria.\n\n\u201cThey killed my uncle,\u201d Groberg said. \u201cThey shot him, they beheaded him, and dismembered him and sent him back to my family. So I was probably 13 years old at the time and that really had an impact on my life.\u201d\n\nHe was a freshman in college when the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 rocked the country. Because of that, he said, \u201cI really realized my duty as an American, and to earn a right to call myself an American, was to go fight for my country when we\u2019re attacked.\u201d", "Before hopping on a plane to Paris on Friday, President Trump insulted some more reporters, threatened that others may have their White House credentials pulled like CNN's Jim Acosta and disputed reports that his press secretary spread a doctored video of Acosta's encounter with a White House intern.\n\nDuring a brief media availability outside the White House, the president gave more fodder to fans who enjoy watching him scrap with journalists.\n\nTrump said \"nobody manipulated\" a video distributed by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders that showed Acosta resisting an intern's attempt to take a microphone from him during a news conference on Friday. A video expert had told The Associated Press that the video appeared doctored to speed up Acosta's arm movement and make his gesture more threatening; the White House used that encounter to justify pulling Acosta's credentials.\n\n\"It wasn't doctored,\" the president said. \"They gave a close-up view. That's not doctoring.\"\n\nAbba Shapiro, an independent video producer hired by The Associated Press to compare the footage tweeted by Shapiro with the AP's coverage of the news conference, said the alteration made was \"too precise to be an accident.\"\n\nTwo late-night comics, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, both said on their shows Thursday that Sanders should be fired for her action.\n\n\"The fact that the White House press secretary is promoting this doctored video is reprehensible, and grounds for dismissal,\" Colbert said.\n\nWhile Trump called the reporter who asked about the video \"dishonest,\" that was mild compared to his treatment of April Ryan, a White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, and CNN's Abby Phillip.\n\nPhillip asked Trump whether he wanted Matt Whitaker, the newly-appointed acting attorney general, to rein in Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n\"What a stupid question you asked,\" Trump replied. \"What a stupid question and I watch you a lot and you ask a lot of stupid questions.\"\n\nIn response, CNN said through its Twitter feed that Phillip's question wasn't stupid. \"In fact, she asked the most pertinent question of the day,\" CNN said. Trump's insults \"are nothing new. And never surprising,\" CNN said.\n\nThe attack on Ryan was unprovoked, although the president had appeared upset at Wednesday's news conference when Ryan stood up and asked him, without a microphone, about voter suppression in the midterm elections. Ryan wasn't among Trump's questioners Friday.\n\n\"I watch her get up,\" he said Friday. \"I mean, you talk about somebody that's a loser, she doesn't know what the hell she's doing. She gets publicity, and then she gets a pay raise, or she gets a contract with, I think CNN. But she's very nasty, and she shouldn't be.\"\n\nRyan became a CNN contributor last year. She said on the network that the three presidents she covered prior to Trump may not have liked every question she asked, but understood why she did so.\n\n\"At the end of the day it was part of the American process, it was part of what our Founding Fathers put in place for the accountability of the president of the United States,\" she said. \"This president seems not to like it, so therefore I'm a loser.\"\n\nBetween Ryan, Phillip and Yamiche Alcindor of PBS' \"NewsHour,\" that makes three black, female reporters that the president dealt with harshly in the past three days. Trump on Wednesday accused Alcindor of asking a racist question when she inquired about the president receiving support from some white nationalists.\n\nTrump said he hadn't made a decision when asked by a reporter how long Acosta would remain in the \"penalty box.\" But he said there could be others.\n\n\"When you're in the White House, this is a very sacred place to be,\" he said. \"This is a very special place. You have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect.\"\n\nOlivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents Association, said his organization's board met Thursday with Sanders and White House communications director Bill Shine for what it expected to be a series of conversations about Acosta's status.\n\nDespite losing his White House pass, and the ability to travel with Trump and the rest of the press corps on Air Force One, Acosta went to Paris to cover Trump's meeting with world leaders this weekend.\n\nHe tweeted a photo of himself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower early Friday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.", "The United Nations, the United States, and 42 humanitarian and civil society groups are warning about a plan to begin repatriating Rohingya refugees that may be without their consent and send them back into dangerous conditions.\n\nMyanmar and Bangladesh signed a deal last week to start returning some of the more than 723,000 Rohingya who fled state-sponsored violence against their communities in August 2017. That campaign, which the U.N. has said should be investigated as a genocide, targeted the Muslim-majority ethnic group in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state, as well as other ethnic minorities in the area, killing thousands and sending hundreds of thousands fleeing into neighboring Bangladesh.\n\nThe U.S. has stopped short of declaring the violence a genocide, instead using the non-legal term \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nWhen ABC News first asked about the joint repatriation plan on November 1, the State Department said it \"would look closely at any plans to ensure that it is, in fact, voluntary,\" but had no comment on the plan itself.\n\nKazi Salahuddin Razu/Getty Images\n\nNow, it is joining the U.N. and others in condemning it and urging both Myanmar and Bangladesh to allow \"for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of refugees from Bangladesh,\" according to a spokesperson. The U.S. statement follows a joint letter Thursday by 42 humanitarian and civil society organizations that work in Myanmar and Bangladesh, warning of the dangers of premature return.\n\n\"They are terrified about what will happen to them if they are returned to Myanmar now and distressed by the lack of information they have received,\" the groups, including the International Rescue Committee, Oxfam, and Save the Children, wrote in their letter. While many Rohingya want to return home, they said, they fear doing so without protections like citizenship and those responsible for the slaughter being held accountable.\n\nTo help address the situation, the U.S. has engaged both governments \"at the highest levels,\" the spokesperson said. A source told ABC News that Secretary Pompeo has not made any calls on this, but the U.S. embassies in both countries have been the lead so far.\n\nMyanmar has refused access to Rakhine to aid groups and the U.N.'s refugee agency, who want to ensure that conditions are safe for the Rohingya's return. Instead, the government has denied any wrongdoing at all, saying they conducted a legitimate counter-terrorism operation against Rohingya militants.\n\nSam Jahan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThose that have been able to access Rakhine have reported detention facilities where Rohingyas' freedom of movement is limited or their access to services and jobs is cut off. In central Rakhine state, 128,000 Rohingya and other Muslims have been confined to camps with no freedom of movement for six years, according to the NGOs' letter.\n\n\"I have not seen any evidence of the government of Myanmar taking concrete and visible measures to create an environment where the Rohingya can return to their place of origin and live there safely with their fundamental rights guaranteed,\" Yanghee Lee, the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, said in Geneva this week.\n\nLee warned that any returns under current conditions \"may violate obligations under customary international law to uphold the principle of non-refoulement,\" an understood practice of not forcing asylum seekers and refugees who have been persecuted to return the countries where the abuse took place.\n\nBut it's unclear what the U.N. or even the U.S. can or will do about it. Over 2,000 Rohingya are expected to be repatriated on November 15, and neither government seems to be backing down from the plan.\n\nEPA via Shutterstock\n\nThe Trump administration should issue a high-level statement with Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to Asia next week and work with allies in the region like Indonesia and Malaysia to issue joint condemnations, Amnesty International's Francisco Bencosme told ABC News: \"Now that the midterms are behind us, hopefully everyone can focus on one of the largest humanitarian crisis in the world where the governments might be complicit in sending refugees back to their deaths.\"\n\nIn the meantime, many of the refugees fear for their lives: \"We really want to go back, but not without citizenship. They must give us citizenship and a normal life, like the other people are living in Myanmar. They need to keep us in peace and not hurt us,\" said one unnamed refugee woman, according to the aid groups' letter.\n\nRather than face repatriation, some Rohingya are now trying to flee Bangladesh into Malaysia -- hundreds of miles away. Dozens of refugees rescued in boats by Bangladeshi police said they paid money to human traffickers who promised they could take them to Malaysia amid fears they would soon be sent back to Myanmar, an officer-in-charge told the Associated Press Thursday.", "Authorities say the Seattle airport ground crew worker who stole an empty commercial airplane had apparently searched online for flight instruction videos before he took off on a dizzying ride that soon crashed into a small island.\n\nThe FBI announced Friday that it's concluding the investigation into the unauthorized flight from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on August 10, after determining that 28-year-old Richard Russell of Sumner, Washington, acted alone. An FBI spokeswoman previously noted an incorrect age for him.\n\nRussell had worked for more than three years for Horizon Air, which is part of Alaska Air Group and flies shorter routes throughout the U.S. West.\n\n\"The FBI found this was an isolated, unanticipated incident by one individual,\" the airline said in a statement. It also noted that the Transportation Security Administration's separate investigation also determined Horizon Air didn't violate security regulations.\n\nThe airline called it \"a very difficult moment for us and many others\" and said it is working with experts and the government to consider security \"enhancements\" going forward.\n\nThe Port of Seattle said it expects its own independent review to be finished by the end of the year and that it has taken immediate action to \"improve security and fully support the aviation employees who we depend upon every day.\"\n\nThe FBI's probe indicates that Russell arrived for work that afternoon at the airport without any issues.\n\nBy that evening, Russell was on and off the Horizon Air Q400, a turboprop plane that seats 76 people, to position it for flight. The plane then moved away from its parked location around 7:30 p.m. and was seen performing acrobatic stunts before the fatal plunge into a thick forest on Ketron Island. It was trailed by two military F-15C jets that scrambled from Portland, Oregon, to chase the plane.\n\n\"I think I'm going to try to do a barrel roll, and if that goes good I'll go nose down and call it a night,\" Russell said from the cockpit, according to a recording of his conversation with the controller.\n\nThe FBI said it doesn't appear that Russell violated any other security measures or protocols before the plane took off.\n\nRussell was properly credentialed with access to the interior and exterior of the aircraft. As part of his duties, he also knew about the aircraft's auxiliary power unit, tow equipment and maneuvering operations, though he didn't appear to have any formal flight training.\n\nInvestigators determined that he knew how to start up the airplane and had searched the internet for flight instructional videos.\n\nThe investigation also showed that the plane had a significant sideslip in the final minute of the flight but the crash appears intentional because Russell would have had time to pull the plane back into a climb. Instead, the plane column moved further forward for six seconds before the crash.\n\nInvestigators didn't find any signs of any co-conspirators or Russell addressing a motive for the incident, based on its review of his text messages, including those sent that night, and through interviews with his co-workers, friends and family.\n\nRussell was last heard cracking jokes, complimenting the professional demeanor of an air traffic controller and apologizing for making a fuss in his last moments. He also told the controller he \"wasn't really planning on landing\" the aircraft, and he described himself as \"just a broken guy.\"\n\nThe medical examiner's office in its review ruled the death a suicide caused by multiple traumatic injuries, and noted that \"there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the death was intentional.\"", "A federal advisory panel is urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to temporarily stop Arkansas from enforcing the state's Medicaid work requirement, amid concerns that some recipients may not have access to the internet that they need to report their work hours to the state.\n\nArkansas in June became the first state to implement a Medicaid work requirement after President Donald Trump's administration said it would allow states to require people on its Medicaid expansion programs to work or volunteer. More than 8,400 Arkansas residents lost their coverage in September and October because they failed to comply with the requirement.\n\nThe Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Payment and Access Commission sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday expressing concern about how many people have lost health coverage, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nThe requirement applies to people enrolled in Arkansas Works, a program that covers residents who became eligible for Medicaid when the state extended eligibility to residents with incomes of up to 138 percent of the poverty level. Enrollees must spend 80 hours a month on work or approved activities \u2014 and they must report it online to the state. Those who fail to comply for three months during a year lose their coverage and are barred from re-enrolling for the rest of the year.\n\nThe commission, which was created by Congress to make policy recommendations for low-income health care programs, is calling for a pause in disenrollment to modify the program.\n\nPenny Thompson, chairman of the commission, wrote in her letter that the requirement to report through a website \"may be challenging for beneficiaries given limited internet access in the state and the multi-stage process for establishing an account and entering information.\" She also said enrollees may need help finding and keeping a job.\n\nOnly about 1,530 enrollees met the requirement in September by reporting their hours, while about 16,535 failed to report any activities.\n\nArkansas Medicaid Director Dawn Stehle said last month that the commission's \"attempt to establish itself as a monitor over individual state Medicaid programs is a new and slippery path that should be reconsidered.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the agency and the Health and Human Services department had no comment on the commission's letter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, http://www.arkansasonline.com", "Mexican stocks experienced a second day of losses Friday after the party of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador floated a proposal to prohibit some commissions charged by private banks.\n\nMexico's benchmark IPC index finished the day down slightly at .03 percent Friday, after dropping 5.8 percent in the previous session.\n\nThe Mexican peso has dropped about 2.3 percent against the U.S. dollar since Wednesday's close.\n\nMexico's Banco Base attributed the setbacks in financial markets to the Senate proposal, which would prohibit charging minimum-balance, electronic transfer and other fees.\n\nSenators from Lopez Obrador's Morena party said the measure was necessary because Mexican banks get one-third of their income from fees, a higher amount than in other Latin American markets.\n\nBut in an apparent damage-control effort, Lopez Obrador's financial governance team said Thursday that the bill would be subject to further study so its impact could be determined.\n\nLopez Obrador takes office on Dec. 1 after winning a crushing victory in presidential elections by pledging to put the poor first and respect private business.\n\nIn a news conference Friday, Lopez Obrador said the executive branch wasn't planning any changes to banking rules, but the legislature had the right to decide for itself.\n\n\"There is nervousness and mistrust,\" Lopez Obrador said of financial markets. \"This is part of what democracy and freedom means.\"\n\nCarlos Urzua, Lopez Obrador's pick to head the treasury department, said in a statement that senators were well-intentioned but needed to pay attention to potential effects on financial markets.\n\n\"Even though we recognize that their intention is to improve the lives of Mexicans,\" Urzua said, \"that goal is not necessarily going to be achieved if they don't take into account the impact on public finances, and the stability of the financial sector.\"", "Transcript for Rick Scott files lawsuit against 2 Florida counties for slow vote count\n\nIrate so now as you know they're still. A lot of confusion about those mid terms that happened just a couple of days ago but there is no better person help us sort these out then ABC news political director Rick Klein and Rick thanks for being here. I just need to ask you you know we're gonna start off with the state that everyone's talking about what is half. I mean in Florida. Kimberly Florida is a mess even nastier than usual because you have not one but 20 statewide races the race for senate. And governor that apple could be headed for a recount and the governor of Florida just last night filing a lawsuit against a couple of the counties what a particular Broward County. That is a very familiar to anyone who remembers the 2000 presidential recount this could actually be just as messy if not mess you're depending on where it heads from here. We're have conflicting lawsuits in different directions tomorrow is the deadline. For all the counties report their totals to the secretary of state. And if the final margin in either or both of these races is within half a percentage point. And it is headed for a recount it's actually even closer than that right now is in its is inside a quarter. Of a percentage point which under for a lot means a hand recount so bring up those ballots in and start examine the all over. And of course of course we also have to ask you about George and Arizona also making the news in an on everyone's minds. Yet George over here more from plaintiffs in a potential lawsuit people talking about this being disenfranchised. I think concern there is that in voter suppression on the front end by. Republican officials and it on the back and making sure those votes are counted George has an unusual long were you actually. You can't just beat the other candidate yet to crack 50%. And it's still a possibility although not a likelihood that the Republican didn't crack fifty was released a run off as of now that is going to be uphill climb though for Stacey Abrams. Arizona is a bright spot for Democrats a whole batch of votes were counted from liberal areas of the state just yesterday into overnight and now for the first time since election night. Person cinema the Democrat is actually numerically ahead of the Republican we understand there's still be hot off the possibility of hundreds of thousands. Of uncounted votes so we're not done there either but as I said that one is a little bit different in that you have the democratic name first and not the Republicans. OK so the the mid terms were a couple days ago and you know at that point. People were saying when the election when the results came in that it wasn't so much of a blue wave because the Democrats didn't pick up as many seats as he said they were but now we see that some more seats have actually flips are we calling this a wave now. This story line is definitely changing Kimberly in one big thing is you see races like wanting in outside Atlanta that just stuff fell four. Four for the Democrats another one of Washington State that just got called we are seeing more of those suburban seats let the final number. Is likely to be in the high thirties for Democrats again they only needed 23 to pick up the house they always knew it was a tough map. This is going to be in all likelihood the largest number of democratic pick ups since right after Watergate when there was a real reaction against the Republican Party more than forty years ago so. That makes it a big win for the Democrats and and I think between that and the Arizona results of felt if those Stan I think we start to talk a battle tonight a little bit of a different way yes it was a mixed bag but. ID Democrats are happier with how this is going to land and they would have been just a couple of days ago.

Incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson, the Democrat has refused to concede to Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican challenger, who currently leads by less than 0.2 percent with ballots across the state still uncounted.\n\nState rules mandate a recount if the margin is less than 0.5 percent, which looks entirely possible, especially because two Democratic-leaning counties haven\u2019t completed counting mail-in ballots \u2014 and one of them hasn\u2019t finished counting early ballots, either. Many more counties continue to count provisional ballots. A recount could come as early as Saturday.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nScott carried a larger lead Tuesday night, but continues to see it dissipate as more votes come in.

Kemp says there aren\u2019t enough ballots left uncounted to close his narrow lead. As of Friday morning, Abrams had 48.72 percent of the vote compared to Kemp\u2019s 50.33 percent.\n\nBut Abrams\u2019 campaign has vowed to staunchly moderate the incoming vote tallies and make sure every vote is counted \u2014 an unsurprising move in a race where her opponent has been shrouded in allegations of voter suppression, beginning with reports that millions of voters were unknowingly purged from registration systems under his tenure, many of whom were African American voters.\n\nHouse races to watch\n\nNew Jersey's 3rd\n\nThe tight race in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District has yet to be called by ABC News, despite a declared victory from Democrat Andy Kim Wednesday night.

It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26, and the election held on Jan. 5. The new Parliament is to be convened on Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a political crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.\n\nSirisena had suspended Parliament for two weeks in a move Wickremesinghe's backers said was designed to buy time to shore up support. There were calls both locally and internationally to convene Parliament to end the impasse.\n\nAmid the pressure, Sirisena announced the legislature would be summoned Nov. 14. He maintained his choice for prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, had a majority in Parliament. However, the decision to dissolve the house shows otherwise, observers say.\n\n\"The dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council's South Asia Center.\n\n\"At the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\"\n\nWickremesinghe's camp is likely to contest Sirisena's move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 \u00bd years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\"It's totally unconstitutional,\" said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe's United National Party and a former minister. \"Sirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\"\n\nThe party said in a message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena's move.\n\nThe U.S State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \"further deepening the political crisis.\"\n\n\"As a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\" the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep.

But it's now banned anywhere else along the border.\n\nFor example, tens of thousands of immigrants in recent years have been showing up in the Arizona desert or crossing the Rio Grande in Texas and then turning themselves in to border agents and seeking asylum. Under the new rules, those immigrants will now face steep barriers to getting in the country \u2014 and deportation in many cases.\n\nThe government says about 70,000 people who went around official crossings in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 sought asylum. Another 24,000 presented themselves to U.S. inspectors.\n\nWHY DOES THE ADMINISTRATION SAY THE ASYLUM SYSTEM IS IN CRISIS?\n\nThe United States fielded 331,700 asylum claims last year, nearly double from two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world, according to the UN Refugee Agency. Many are families and young children fleeing gangs and poverty in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nThe surge has contributed to an enormous backlog in immigration courts, which is where asylum cases must be decided if the applicant passes an initial screening. The backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week.\n\nAsylum seekers are often released, many with ankle monitors, while their cases wind through court for years. The Trump administration calls it \"catch and release\" and notes that, while about 8 of 10 asylum seekers pass the initial screening, known as a \"credible fear\" interview, most are ultimately unsuccessful in court.\n\nThere are many reasons why the courts are broken. Immigrant advocates point to a shortage of judges.\n\nWILL IT WORK?\n\nAlmost immediately, the American Civil Liberties Union sued over the president's order in federal court in San Francisco, seeking to declare it invalid and stop it from going into effect while litigation is pending.\n\nTrump is invoking the same extraordinary powers he used to ban travel to the U.S. from several predominantly Muslim countries, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in June. Under a section of federal immigration law, the president may deny entry to \"any class of aliens\" whose presence is deemed \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"\n\nBut under the Immigration and Nationality Act, anyone can apply for asylum no matter how or where they enter the country. And the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, of which the U.S. is a signatory, says people may apply for asylum even if they enter a country illegally.\n\nAdministration officials argue that U.S. law already has some bars on asylum \u2014 being part of a terrorist organization or having committed a serious crime, for example \u2014 and that \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe administration also emphasizes that people can still seek asylum at official crossings instead of entering the country illegally by going around them, but that poses logistical challenges. Asylum seekers currently wait in Mexican border cities \u2014 up to five weeks in Tijuana \u2014 because inspectors at U.S. crossings say they don't have the capacity to process their claims.\n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE IMMIGRANTS?\n\nUnder the new rule, immigrants caught crossing the border and seeking asylum will be transported to a nearby port of entry and denied asylum if they seek it.\n\nThey will be allowed to seek other, more limited forms of protection but the initial screening, known as a \"reasonable fear\" interview, is much harder to pass. And these variations of asylum \u2014 \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the U.N. Convention Against Torture \u2014 don't offer a path to a green card or allow for family members to come.\n\nIf they don't clear this step, immigrants will be detained and put into deportation proceedings.\n\nBut this creates other issues. There is limited jail space to detain immigrants, along with several hurdles to deport immigrants back to Central America.

But for the first time in decades, it's looking much less red.\n\nThe midterm elections in Texas ousted a Republican who carried a \"bathroom bill\" targeting transgender people, drove out a GOP lawmaker who called federal immigration agents on Hispanic protesters and gave Democrats in Houston run of the nation's third most populous county.\n\nFor a generation, Texas has been a laboratory of conservatism that tested legal boundaries and churned out Republican presidential candidates. But cracks in the GOP's supremacy emerged this week in unexpected ways and races. As with many things Texas, the results could reverberate nationally.\n\nPredictions that Texas will come into play in 2020 may still be a stretch, but the signs of a subtle shift are more than mere talk.\n\n\"This is the most optimistic I've felt since high school,\" said Dallas state Rep. Eric Johnson, a 43-year-old Democrat who is running to become the first black speaker of the Texas House. \"I know for a fact that Texas is a purple state. It hasn't been voting that way because Democrats have forgotten how to win, to a certain degree. But Beto has reminded us.\"\n\nHe was unequivocal about why Democrats broke through this year.\n\n\"Beto was the reason,\" he said.\n\nIt remains to be seen what's next for O'Rourke, who came within 3 percentage points of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in the closest Senate race in Texas in 40 years. The El Paso congressman, who shattered fundraising records in a Senate campaign, raising more than $70 million, has insisted he's not interested in another office for now. But that has done little to dampen speculation that he could run again in 2020.\n\nTexas' other Senate seat, held by Republican John Cornyn, is up for re-election that year. He called the midterms a \"wake-up call\" for his party in Texas.\n\n\"I don't know whether this is a once-in-a- lifetime confluence of events or whether this represents something of the new normal,\" said Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate.\n\nOn the surface, Texas didn't change much after Tuesday. Republicans continued a 24-year streak of sweeping statewide races and lost only two seats in Congress, both of which had already been trending toward Democrats. The GOP also still comfortably controls the Texas Legislature, even after losing a dozen seats in what was the biggest single-year pickup by Democrats in decades.\n\nBut Republicans' big margins shrank in a number of places.\n\nTypically easy wins in five congressional districts around Austin, Dallas and Houston were sliced to within 5 percentage points this time. The driving social conservative force in the Legislature, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, won just over 51 percent of the vote in his first election since pushing a failed North Carolina-style \"bathroom bill\" that would have required transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate. Not surviving, however, was a Republican who carried the bill in the House.\n\nTexas' last big Republican county, around Fort Worth, also crumbled at the top of the ticket. Fort Worth is \"Cowtown,\" with stockyards and a cowboy image that stands in contrast to Texas' other big and increasingly liberal cities. Of Texas' five largest counties \u2014 the others around Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin \u2014 Tarrant County was the only one President Donald Trump carried in 2016, doing so by 57,000 votes.\n\nTwo years later, O'Rourke won the county over Cruz by 3,900 votes.\n\n\"We flipped this state from blue to red. We may be shifting back a little toward the blue,\" Tarrant County Republican Party Chairman Darl Easton said. \"But political shifts happen. I'm not overly concerned about the current trend.\"\n\nFast-growing suburbs that for years have served as a GOP firewall to Texas' liberal big cities also either flipped to Democrats or were winnowed down to single-digit races. It was an abrupt turnaround from just four years ago, when Republicans coasted into every statewide office with 20-point victories.\n\nThe gap drastically shrunk on the coattails of a Democrat whose support for universal health care, marijuana legalization and immigration reform was mocked by Republicans as anathema to voters who've kept the GOP in control of Texas since 1994.\n\nAfter his loss, O'Rourke urged others to pick up where he left off.\n\n\"This team, of which we are all members, in some way is going to stay together, is going to continue to aspire to do great things,\" O'Rourke said. \"There are so many great candidates who are going to come out of this campaign.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Paul J.

Stephen Tusa said six of GE's eight divisions might be unprofitable in 2020.\n\nBond prices rose.

The company said part of the problem is an advertising model that is intended to encourage advertisers to try the site without signing a long-term contract.

She also credited law enforcement and state and local officials for strengthening their security posture and communication about threats.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re in a better place now than we were in 2016,\u201d Doss said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll hopefully be in a better place in 2020, but it\u2019s definitely not something we\u2019ll want to take our eyes off of.\u201d\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOren Falkowitz, a former NSA hacker, told ABC News in October that the U.S. had a long way to go, from patching remaining vulnerabilities in the election infrastructure to understanding that candidates will have to invest in cybersecurity to protect themselves.\n\nFalkowitz, who now runs a private cybersecurity firm that specializes in anti-phishing measures, predicted that cyber activity related to 2020 would pick up the day after the midterms were over. \u201cI think that people still haven\u2019t learned,\u201d he said.\n\nThe one area where the Russians have continued operating, officials and experts said, was on the online influence front, despite efforts by social media giants Facebook and Twitter to combat fake accounts and disinformation.\n\n\u201cI think we need to give credit where credit is due and recognize that everyone \u2013 the platforms, election officials, law enforcement, and the media \u2013 was far better prepared to handle disinformation threats [on election night] than they were in 2016,\u201d said Bret Schafer, the social media analyst at the German Marshal Fund\u2019s Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cThat said, the narrative that Russia \u2018sat out\u2019 this election is not accurate.\u201d\n\nSchafer said an online dashboard called Hamilton 68 that the Alliance for Securing Democracy had set up to track Russia-aligned propaganda saw approximately 15,000 tweets a day ahead of the midterm election, many of which \u201cfocused on issues that directly or indirectly influence voters\u2019 perceptions of candidates or political parties.\u201d\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday Facebook said it took down over 100 Facebook and Instagram pages or accounts that were suspected to be linked to a Russian troll factory, just the latest in a series of take-downs by social media companies targeting inauthentic accounts since the 2016 election.\n\nBen Nimmo, an information defense fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, said that if Russia\u2019s online influence campaign looked smaller than in 2016, it was likely for two reasons: new security measures have made it more difficult for Russian trolls to operate, and the social media company crackdowns got rid of thousands of their accounts, along with the large audiences that took months to build.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago the trolls were playing on a wide open field,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s very constrained.\u201d\n\nNimmo said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised, however, if Russian accounts still lurked online in the \u201caudience building\u201d phase and could be unleashed during the next presidential election in 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room at all for complacency,\u201d he said.", "Hundreds of thousands of Yemenis from the Hodeida area have been forced to flee amid a Saudi-led coalition offensive to take the key Red Sea port city from Shiite rebels, the United Nations' refugee agency said Friday, as fierce battles continue to rage in the area.\n\nSome 445,000 of the Hodeida governorate's residents have fled since June, a figure that underscores the dire situation in and around the city that serves as the main entry point for food and aid, the UNHCR said. The governorate's population is around 3 million, according to figures from the Norwegian Refugee Council.\n\nThe UNHCR also expressed concern over the safety of those trapped in Hodeida as the intensified military operations \"are increasingly confining populations and cutting off exit routes.\" Figures on those still in Hodeida are difficult to gauge, the agency added.\n\nYemeni government forces supported by the coalition's air and naval forces continue to engage in heavy fighting with the rebels, known as Houthis. The fighting has killed dozens of combatants from both sides, with dozens of military vehicles destroyed or burning along the front lines.\n\nIn a Friday statement, Yemen's internationally recognized government based in the southern city of Aden said its forces are advancing toward the north and west of Hodeida and across all fronts with cover from the coalition.\n\nAlso on Friday, the World Health Organization said the violence in Hodeida is in close proximity to the city's health facilities, impeding their ability to function and restricting the movement of health staff, patients and ambulances.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition's latest push toward Hodeida comes as Yemen's civil war is a few months away from entering its fourth year. The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of defeating the Iran-aligned rebels and to restore the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But the coalition has recently come under mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe fighting around the city, a vital lifeline for most of Yemen's population, threatens to worsen Yemen's already-dire humanitarian situation and risks the obstruction of crucial assistance to the country endangering the lives of millions of Yemenis.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council warned of the repercussions the continued fighting may have on millions of Yemenis. The council estimates the humanitarian cost of the war to have reached almost $3 billion in 2018 alone, it said in a statement.\n\n\"We are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people,\" Mohamed Abdi, the council's director in Yemen, said in a statement. \"Senseless attacks on civilians, evidence of a starving population and desperate pleas from humanitarian witnesses have done little more than elicit condolences from an international community that could have stepped on the brakes long ago.\"\n\nThe U.S. and U.K., major arms suppliers to the Saudi coalition, have recently called for a cease-fire in Yemen and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war. On Friday, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths said on his official account that consultations with Yemen's warring parties to finalize logistical arrangements for a new round of peace talks are underway. Griffiths' latest effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend.", "This a Kaiser Health News story.\n\nAfter steadily declining for more than two decades, deadly shootings are rising across the country, according to a new government report.\n\nThe researchers also said that the number of suicides involving a firearm grew 21 percent between 2006 and 2016.\n\nThe report, published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at gun deaths around the country and in 50 major metropolitan areas. The researchers found a rise in gun homicides in 2015 and 2016, reversing a downward trend and bringing them to a level comparable to a decade ago.\n\nIt also reported that deadly shootings were up across all age groups nationwide.\n\n\u201cIt is too soon to know whether recent increases in firearm homicide rates represent a short-term fluctuation or the beginning of a longer-term trend,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe findings were released shortly after a gunman in Thousand Oaks, Calif., killed 12 people, including a county sheriff\u2019s deputy, at a bar popular with college students, and less than two weeks after a gunman walked into a Pittsburgh synagogue and killed 11 people.\n\nDespite the high publicity garnered by mass shootings in recent years, the Pew Research Center previously reported that the rate of firearm homicides began declining in the 1990s and then remained fairly flat from 2001 to 2014.\n\nThe federal researchers analyzed mortality and population data from the nation\u2019s 50 most populous metropolitan areas to calculate both firearm homicides and suicides during two time periods, 2015-2016 and 2012-2013. The group also highlighted the rate of these incidents among 10- to 19-year-olds.\n\nAccording to the report, more than 27,000 people were killed in gun homicides in 2015-2016, for a death rate of 4.4 per 100,000 people. The rate is higher for the 50 cities, where more than 17,000 people were killed, or 4.9 per 100,000 people.\n\nBy comparison, nearly 23,000 people died across the country and more than 14,000 died in those cities from firearm homicide in 2012-2013.\n\nAndrew Papachristos, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University who was not involved in the study, said changes in the level of gun violence can come from a variety of factors, including different police protocols, gang violence and general mistrust.\n\nEfforts by the federal government to research gun violence have been governed by the Dickey Amendment, a legislative rider for funding that groups seeking tighter control of guns felt limited the CDC\u2019s efforts to examine the issue. But federal health officials, including Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, say it does not impede federal research.\n\nNearly 45,000 people killed themselves with a gun in 2015-2016, more than 3,000 more than in 2012-2013, according to the report. The increase extended to city dwellers, too, although the rate of deaths among city dwellers was significantly lower than for the country as a whole.\n\nSlightly more than 2,100 young people, including 851 in the major cities, died from firearm suicide in 2015-2016, according to the report.\n\nThe researchers noted that the sharp decade-long rise in gun suicides coincided partly with the Great Recession that began in 2007. But the increases have continued despite the economic recovery, they said.\n\nThe ease of access to a gun has been shown to be a key link to these acts. The time between deciding to commit suicide and attempting it can be as brief as 10 minutes, the report said, so finding a gun quickly can make the attempt much easier. Often, people do not try an alternative method when the highly lethal route is unavailable.\n\nThe report stressed proper storage of firearms to reduce the risk of suicide.\n\nJonathan Metzl, director of the Center for Medicine, Health, and Society at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study, said mental health professionals struggle with trying to predict who is at risk.\n\n\u201cPeople act impulsively in moments of despair,\u201d Metzl said. \u201cAnd it may or may not be linked to psychiatric illness.\u201d\n\nMales also run a higher risk of dying by firearm suicide. According to the report, men and boys made up 85 percent of the deaths both in the 50 major cities and nationally.\n\nApproximately the same share of men died by firearm homicide. However, it is important to note these issues affect different populations, Papachristos said. Minorities represent a disproportionate share of homicides, while suicide claims a disproportionate number of white men.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Col. Anne McClain said spaceflight is never 100 percent safe and it's coincidental that the last two Soyuz missions to the International Space Station encountered trouble.\n\nLast month, astronauts had to make an emergency landing in Kazakhstan following a failed launch. A month earlier, a space station air leak was traced to a hole mysteriously drilled into a docked Soyuz capsule. Russian investigators are still working to understand how a rocket sensor ended up bent during manufacturing and how the hole wound up in the Soyuz.\n\nMcClain is set to blast off Dec. 3 on her first spaceflight, with a Russian and Canadian. They will spend six months aboard the orbiting lab.\n\nThe 39-year-old helicopter pilot, who has a young son, said her family is used to her risky work \u2014 she flew combat missions in the military.\n\nHer crewmates, both men, also have children, she noted from training quarters in Star City, Russia.\n\n\"The hardest part about this business is being away from the kids,\" she said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"But what I hope to teach him \u2014 and what I hope to teach all kids that are kind of looking at this \u2014 is that to achieve anything, it takes a lot of sacrifice.\"\n\nHer own dream of becoming an astronaut goes back to her preschool days in Spokane, Washington. NASA chose her in 2013.\n\nMcClain said she views the Oct. 11 launch accident as \"a success story,\" given that the abort system saved her friends' lives. She was back home in Houston, watching the flight and listening to the astronauts' radio communications.\n\n\"The crew was lucky. But every crew that makes it to orbit is lucky. Spaceflight's not easy,\" she said.\n\nThe American on the aborted flight, Nick Hague, gave her \"the inside scoop\" when he got back to Houston.\n\nHague and Russian Alexei Ovchinin have been promised another shot at space, possibly next year. But McClain said she's uncertain whether they will arrive before her own mission ends in June.\n\nSince the accident, three Soyuz rockets have launched successfully with satellites. One more Soyuz flight is planned before McClain's launch, this one carrying supplies for the space station.\n\nHer own rocket has been inspected for any deformities. She's so confident in the rocket and its decades-long history of successes that she said she would have climbed aboard the Soyuz to fly the day after the accident.\n\nThe launch abort was the first in 35 years for Russia's human spaceflight program and only the third one ever.\n\nRussian officials have moved up McClain's flight by a few weeks so she, Canadian David Saint-Jacques and Russian Oleg Kononenko can spend enough time with the current three station residents, an American, German and Russian due to return to Earth on Dec. 20.

The only alternative on the table, he said, is a no-deal Brexit that would \"inflict untold damage\" on Britain.\n\n\"It has become increasingly clear to me that the withdrawal agreement, which is being finalized in Brussels and Whitehall even as I write, will be a terrible mistake,\" said Jo Johnson, who was a transport minister in the government.\n\nTo give the public a choice between these two disastrous versions of Brexit would be a \"failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis,\" he said, referencing the 1956 conflict against Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser that is widely seen as marking the moment at which Britain formally lost its imperial role in the world.\n\nInstead, Johnson said it would be proper to give the British public a chance to vote again because of the way the Brexit negotiations have evolved.\n\n\"Given that the reality of Brexit has turned out to be so far from what was once promised, the democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say,\" Jo Johnson said.\n\nHis older brother Boris resigned in July to protest May's Brexit plan \u2014 but Boris did so as a staunch support of a hard-line Brexit, while Jo Johnson backed the \"remain\" side during the June, 2016 referendum.\n\nIn a tweet, Boris Johnson said he had \"boundless admiration\" for his brother and that they are \"united in dismay\" at the indefensibility of May's position even though they disagree over Brexit.\n\nJo Johnson's resignation, and his call for a fresh referendum to test voter sentiment, further complicates matters for May as she tries to strike a deal with EU leaders that would pass muster with her own cabinet and win backing in Parliament.\n\nShe has consistently rejected the idea of another nationwide vote on Brexit, insisting her obligation is to make good on the will of the people as expressed in 2016.\n\nHer Conservative Party remains deeply divided on her approach, and it is not clear if she will win wide backing from opposition Labour Party lawmakers when any proposed deal is put to Parliament.\n\nMay is also facing more opposition from the Democratic Unionist Party, a party in Northern Ireland whose lawmakers have propped up May's minority government. Its leaders say May's government is breaking promises related to the Irish border.", "The White House is bracing for the probe of Donald Trump's presidential campaign to fire up again. Trump's advisers are privately expressing worries that the special counsel, who's been out of the news for the past month, has been stealthily compiling information and could soon issue new indictments or a damning final report.\n\nTrump abruptly altered the chain of command above Mueller on Wednesday, putting his work under the supervision of a Republican loyalist who has been openly skeptical of the special counsel's authority and has mused about ways to curtail his power. But Trump and his aides are concerned about Mueller's next move with the work that is complete, according to a White House official and a Republican with close ties to the administration.\n\nThey insisted on anonymity to comment on conversations they were not authorized to describe.\n\nMueller kept a low profile for the past month as voters were mulling their choices for this week's elections.\n\nBut a flurry of activity during his quiet period, including weeks of grand jury testimony about Trump confidant Roger Stone and negotiations over an interview with the president, hinted at public developments ahead as investigators move closer to addressing key questions underpinning the special counsel inquiry: Did Trump illegally obstruct the investigation? And did his campaign have advance knowledge of illegally hacked Democratic emails?\n\nTrump has told confidants he remains deeply annoyed by the 18-month-old Mueller probe, believing it is not just a \"witch hunt\" but an expensive and lengthy negative distraction. The latest indication of the fury came Wednesday when he forced out his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whose recusal opened the door to Mueller's appointment.\n\nTo this point, Trump has heeded advice not to directly interfere, though a new chapter in the relationship with the probe may have begun with the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as new acting attorney general. Even if Whitaker, Sessions' former chief of staff, does not curtail the investigation, Trump could direct him to take a more aggressive stance in declassifying documents that could further undermine or muddle the probe, the White House aide and Republican official said.\n\nThe investigation until now has been overseen by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller last year and granted him fairly broad authority.\n\n\"It's very significant because Whitaker's position on indictments or future indictments may be different than Rosenstein's, and Rosenstein had given Mueller a broad mandate to pursue various crimes,\" said Washington criminal defense lawyer Jeffrey Jacobovitz.\n\nOn Friday, Trump moved to distance himself from Whitaker, saying, \"I don't know Matt Whitaker.\" But he also called him \"smart\" and \"respected.\"\n\nThe Mueller investigation has so far produced 32 criminal charges and four guilty pleas from Trump associates. But the work is not done.\n\nA clear focus concerns Stone, a longtime political dirty trickster. The special counsel's team has been investigating Stone's connection to WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign and whether he had advance knowledge of the group's plans to release hacked material damaging to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nStone has said he did not, but emails, Twitter messages and his own public statements show he portrayed himself as plugged into the WikiLeaks orbit. That includes implying he had inside knowledge in separate email exchanges with a Breitbart editor and Steve Bannon, the former Trump campaign chief executive, just days before WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nBannon and other Stone associates have been questioned, and multiple witnesses have appeared before the grand jury. One associate, Jerome Corsi, said in a video recording Monday that he's \"been involved in a really constant basis\" for two months with Mueller's investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal appeals court heard a challenge to Mueller's authority brought by Stone aide Andrew Miller, who defied a grand jury subpoena last summer and was held in contempt by a judge.\n\nIn the president's orbit, there remains some concern about his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., though there are no outward indications that charges are imminent, according to a Republican close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nBeyond Mueller, but also within the Justice Department's oversight, is a federal investigation into Trump's longtime legal fixer, Michael Cohen, who admitted as part of a guilty plea in August to coordinating with Trump on a hush-money scheme to silence a porn actress and an ex-Playboy model who say they had affairs with Trump.\n\nThe president hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, but federal prosecutors have said that a grand jury investigation is ongoing and it targets unspecified \"others.\" Court papers show Trump's conduct and that of top executives at the Trump Organization, some of whom have received immunity, have been scrutinized.\n\nIt's unclear what additional charges prosecutors are pursuing and how much of it pertains to the president personally. Federal prosecutors have said in court papers that the case involves numerous \"uncharged\" third parties and have argued against disclosing search warrants and other documents that would \"certainly result in a very public guessing game\" about their identities.\n\nOverseeing it all is Whitaker, a former college football player and U.S. attorney from Iowa who was brought into the Justice Department last year to serve as Sessions' chief of staff. In the months before, Whitaker was a familiar presence on CNN, where he questioned Mueller's scope and reach.\n\nIn one appearance, he defended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer, saying, \"You would always take that meeting.\"\n\nHe also once tweeted an ex-prosecutor's opinion piece that described the Mueller team as a \"lynch mob,\" and wrote his own op-ed saying Mueller would be outside his authority if he investigated Trump's family finances.\n\nTrump had enjoyed Whitaker's cable TV appearances \u2014 including one on CNN in which he suggested that the Mueller probe be starved of resources \u2014 and the two men soon struck a bond. Trump told associates that he felt that Whitaker would be \"loyal\" and would not have recused himself from the Russia probe as Sessions had done, according to two Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nDespite demands from Democrats that he recuse because of his past comments, Whitaker showed no signs Thursday that he intended to do so. And not everyone is convinced he needs to.\n\n\"Based on my experience with Matt,\" said John Richter, a former U.S. Attorney in Oklahoma and high-ranking Bush administration Justice Department official, \"I think he will act consistently with the best traditions of the department and call things as he sees them.\"\n\nTrump, speaking to reporters Friday, stressed that Whitaker was serving as attorney general in an acting capacity. He said he has not discussed the position with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the subject of some speculation.", "Opponents of Big Tobacco say a decision by the International Labor Organization to stop accepting funds from the industry is a step in the right direction, but are urging the U.N.-backed agency to go further and \"completely shut the door.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the ILO agreed not to renew a contract with Japan Tobacco International next month \u2014 a decision that ended, for now, the influence of the tobacco industry in the last U.N. institution to which it had links.\n\nMafoya Dossoumon, spokesman for the Framework Convention Alliance, which unites some 500 anti-tobacco industry groups, says the ILO move was a \"good thing.\"\n\nHowever, he said Friday his group wanted more clarity about ILO plans to enact \"appropriate safeguards\" about its funding sources, and cautioned it's possible Big Tobacco could return.", "Police in the German city of Hamburg say they have seized over a ton of cocaine and arrested eight suspects following an investigation that lasted several months.\n\nOn Thursday, officers followed a truck they suspected was being used to transport drugs to a Hamburg haulage company.

Instead of being almost exclusively people from Latin America, the stream of migrants crossing the Mexican border these days includes many who come from the other side of the world.\n\nAlmost 3,000 citizens of India were apprehended entering the U.S. from Mexico last year. In 2007, only 76 were. The number of Nepalese rose from just four in 2007 to 647 last year. More people from Africa are also seeking to get into the United States, with hundreds having reached Mexican towns across the border from Texas in recent weeks, according to local news reports from both sides of the border.\n\nCamara's journey began more than a year ago in the small town of Toulel, in southern Mauritania. He left Mauritania, where slavery is illegal but still practiced, \"because it's a country that doesn't know human rights,\" he said.\n\nCamara was one of 124 migrants who ended up in a federal prison in Oregon after being detained in the U.S. near the border with Mexico in May, the result of the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy.\n\nHe was released Oct. 3, after he had passed his \"credible fear\" exam, the first step on obtaining asylum, and members of the community near the prison donated money for his bond. He was assisted by lawyers working pro bono.\n\n\"My heart is so gracious, and I am so happy. I really thank my lawyers who got me out of that detention,\" Camara said in French as he rode in a car away from the prison.\n\nCamara's journey was epic, yet more people are making similar treks to reach the United States. It took him from his village on the edge of the Sahara desert to Morocco by plane and then a flight to Brazil. He stayed there 15 months, picking apples in orchards and saving his earnings as best he could. Finally he felt he had enough to make it to the United States.\n\nAll that lay between him and the U.S. border was 6,000 miles (9,700 kilometers).\n\n\"It was very, very difficult,\" said Camara, 30. \"I climbed mountains, I crossed rivers. I crossed many rivers, the sea.\"\n\nCamara learned Portuguese in Brazil and could understand a lot of Spanish, which is similar, but not speak it very well. He rode buses through Brazil, Peru and Colombia. Then he and others on the migrant trail faced the most serious obstacle: the Darien Gap, a 60-mile (97-kilometer) stretch of roadless jungle straddling the border of Colombia and Panama.\n\nBut first, he and other travelers who gathered in the town of Turbo, Colombia, had to cross the Gulf of Uraba, a long and wide inlet from the Caribbean Sea. Turbo, on its southeast shore, has become a major point on the migrant trail, where travelers can resupply and where human smugglers offer boat rides.\n\nCamara and about 75 other people boarded a launch for Capurgana, a village next to the Panamanian border on the other end of the gulf.\n\nWhile the slow-moving boat was far from shore, the seas got very rough.\n\n\"There was a wave that came and tipped over the canoe,\" Camara said. \"Five people fell into the water, and they couldn't swim.\"\n\nThey all drowned, he said. The survivors pushed on.\n\nFinally arriving in Capurgana after spending two nights on the boat, the migrants split into smaller groups to cross the infamous Darien Gap, a wild place that has tested the most seasoned of travelers. The thick jungle hides swamps that can swallow a man. Lost travelers have died, and been devoured, boots and all, by packs of wild boars, or have been found, half out of their minds.\n\nCamara's group consisted of 37 people, including women \u2014 two of them pregnant, one from Cameroon and one from Congo \u2014 and children.\n\n\"We walked seven days and climbed up into the mountains, into the forest,\" Camara said. \"When it was night, we slept on the ground. We just kept walking and sleeping, walking and sleeping. It was hard.\"\n\nOne man, who was around 26 and from the African nation of Guinea, died, perhaps from exhaustion combined with thirst, Camara said.\n\nBy the sixth day, all the drinks the group had brought with them were gone. They drank water from a river. They came across a Panamanian man and his wife, who sold them some bananas for $5, Camara said.\n\nOnce he got out of the jungle, Camara went to Panamanian immigration officials who gave him travel documents enabling him to go on to Costa Rica, which he reached by bus. In Costa Rica, he repeated that process in hopes of going on to Nicaragua. But he heard authorities there were not so accommodating, so he and about 100 other migrants took a boat around Nicaragua, traveling at night along its Pacific coast.\n\n\"All we could see were the lights of Nicaragua,\" he said. Then it was over land again, in cars, buses and sometimes on foot, across Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, all the way to the U.S. border at Tijuana. He was just about out of money and spent the night in a migrant shelter.\n\nOn May 20, he crossed into San Ysidro, south of San Diego.\n\n\"I said, 'I came, I came. I'm from Africa. I want help,'\" he said.\n\nHe is going to stay with a brother in Philadelphia while he pursues his asylum request.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAndrew Selsky on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andrewselsky", "Transcript for North Carolina man survives surprise bear attack\n\nHe was election day afternoon and sunny Humphrey just had a car lift installed in his driveway and I just kept the look around and their three rare record flood me.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed on Friday that a White House-released video depicting contact between a staffer and a CNN reporter wasn't altered, and he seemingly threatened to revoke the White House press credentials of more reporters.\n\nTrump insisted that the video distributed by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was simply a \"close-up\" and \"was not doctored.\"\n\n\"Nobody manipulated it. All that is is a close-up,\" said the president, who then attacked the reporter for asking the question and called him \"dishonest.\"\n\nA frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident from Trump's postelection news conference Wednesday shows that the video tweeted by Sanders appears to speed up CNN reporter Jim Acosta's arm movement when he makes contact with a White House intern who was trying to take away Acosta's microphone. The speedup appears to make the gesture more threatening.\n\nTrump, in remarks Friday, also did not back off his administration's decision to suspend Acosta's press credential, which allows the CNN correspondent access to the White House grounds.\n\n\"He's a very unprofessional guy. I don't think he's a smart person but he has a loud voice,\" Trump told reporters in a testy 20-plus-minute exchange before he left for Paris and a World War I commemoration ceremony. \"You have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect.\"\n\nThe president said he had not decided if Acosta's pass would be reinstated and he suggested there \"could be others\" who lose their credentials. He belittled several of the reporters gathered around him. He said one had asked \"a stupid question,\" and he singled out April Ryan, a correspondent for Urban Radio Networks, calling her \"very nasty\" and \"a loser.\"\n\nRyan, who is also a CNN contributor, tweeted in response: \"I love this country and have the most respect for the Office of the President. I will continue to ask the questions that affect America, all of America.\"\n\nTrump's latest attacks on the media came in the wake of his free-wheeling and contentious news conference two days earlier, and followed demands by several journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the White House Correspondents Association \u2014 that Acosta's press pass be reinstated.\n\n\"It is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,\" said Julie Pace, AP's Washington bureau chief. \"We strongly reject the idea that any administration would block a journalist's access to the White House.\"\n\nThe New York Times editorialized in favor of restoring Acosta's pass, saying it signaled Trump's view that asking hard questions disqualifies reporters from attending briefings. The newspaper said that if Sanders was so offended by physical contact, \"what did she have to say when her boss praised as 'my kind of guy' Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, who was sentenced to anger management classes and community service for body-slamming a Guardian reporter last spring?\"\n\nIt's rare for the White House to pull the media credentials.\n\nDuring Lyndon Johnson's presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials. During the George W. Bush presidency, Trude Feldman, who worked for various news outlets, was suspended for 90 days after security cameras recorded her looking through a press aide's desk late one night. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon tried to get Washington Post reporters banned from the White House.\n\nDespite losing his White House pass, Acosta traveled to Paris this weekend to cover Trump's trip to meet with world leaders. He tweeted a photo of himself standing in front of the Eiffel Tower early Friday.\n\nAbba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the Wednesday footage at AP's request, noticed that frames in the tweeted video of the exchange at the news conference were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one.\n\nSanders, who hasn't said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern. In her statement announcing Acosta's suspension, she said the White House won't tolerate \"a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job.\"\n\nWhile the origin of the manipulated video is unclear, its distribution marked a new low for an administration that has been criticized for its willingness to mislead.\n\nCNN has labeled Sanders' characterization of Acosta's exchange with the intern as a lie.

Homosexual acts are illegal in Tanzania and can bring a sentence of up 30 years.\n\nThe examinations are taking place Friday to see if there are any signs of same-sex relations among the men, who were arrested last week on suspicion of celebrating a gay marriage at a resort hotel, police chief of the south region of Zanzibar, Suleiman Hassan, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"We acted on a tip-off from a good citizen leading them to abort their party during the weekend and then police made a quick arrest,\" said Hassan. After being held for several days, the men have been released pending the investigations, he said.\n\nLast week Paul Makonda, the administrative chief of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city, urged citizens to report any suspected homosexuals. He said a task force would be established to seek out and punish homosexuals and prostitutes.\n\nDays later Tanzania's foreign ministry said Makonda's statement did not represent government policy but many gays in this East African country say they are frightened.\n\nAmnesty International warned against the examinations of the men who were arrested.\n\n\"We now fear these men may be subjected to forced anal examination, the government's method of choice for 'proving' same-sex sexual activity among men,\" said Seif Magango, Amnesty International's East Africa Deputy Director.\n\n\"This appalling attack on Tanzanian people simply exercising their human rights shows the danger of inflammatory and discriminatory rhetoric at senior levels of government,\" said Magango. \"This is a shocking blow following the Tanzanian government's assurance that no-one would be targeted and arrested because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.\"\n\nThere's also been a significant diplomatic reaction.\n\nThe US State Department on Friday said it is \"deeply concerned over escalating attacks and legislative actions by the government of Tanzania that violate civil liberties and human rights, creating an atmosphere of violence, intimidation, and discrimination. We are troubled by the continued arrests and harassment of marginalized persons, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and others who seek to exercise their rights to freedom of speech, association and assembly. Legislation is being used to restrict civil liberties for all.\"\n\nThe European Union has recalled its ambassador to Tanzania, citing \"the deterioration of the human rights and rule of law situation\" in Tanzania. The EU will be conducting a broad review of its relations with Tanzania, said the statement emailed to AP.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Tanzania warned American citizens in the country and those planning travel to Tanzania about the possible crackdown against LGBT people. The embassy also urged its citizens to check their social media profiles and \"remove or protect images and language that may run afoul of Tanzanian laws regarding homosexual practices and explicit sexual activity.\"\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, President John Magufuli has made several statements against the rights of sexual minorities.\n\nAnother development this week highlighted repressive measures in Tanzania. Two journalists working for the Committee to Protect Journalists were detained for five hours after they began investigating the case of a Tanzanian journalist who is missing. The two journalists were released, but their detention attracted considerable international attention.\n\n\"It is now abundantly clear to anyone who followed the latest developments that Tanzanian journalists work in a climate of fear and intimidation,\" said CPJ executive director Joel Simon, on the organization's website .

Add Interest\n\nThe Moscow talks also abruptly highlighted Russia\u2019s increased role in Afghanistan, 30 years after Soviet troops left the country following a disastrous war there.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov opened the meeting in a gilded conference room at Moscow\u2019s President-Hotel, where the two delegations sat around a circular table along with deputy foreign ministers from other regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nThe meeting was billed by Russia as an attempt to bring the Taliban and the U.S.-backed Afghan government closer to direct peace talks.\n\n\"Russia, as the organiser of this conference, see its role as, together with the regional partners and friends of Afghanistan gathered at this table, to offer all possible assistance to launch a constructive inter-Afghan dialogue,\" Lavrov told the meeting.\n\nBut little was expected to come out of the event, which both sides have emphasized is not a formal negotiation.\n\nSergei Chirkov/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nEmerging following two hours of talks, Taliban spokesman Muhammad Sohail Shaheen reiterated the group\u2019s position that no direct negotiations are possible until U.S. troops leave Afghanistan. Shaheen said the five-man delegation from the Taliban's diplomatic office had not spoken directly with the government-backed envoys from the Afghan High Peace Council.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a negotiation,\" Shaheen told reporters. \"They came here to express their views, and we came here to express our views. That\u2019s it.\"\n\nHabiba Sarabi, a High Peace Council delegate and a former Afghan minister for women's rights, told ABC News that the two delegations had spoken, but just exchanged pleasantries.\n\n\"Just friendly talk. Nice talk,\" Sarabi said, noting it was her first time meeting the Taliban delegation.\n\n\"Like, 'How are you? Maybe you bring another woman representative next time,'\" she added, referencing the Taliban's ultra-conservative attitudes toward women's rights.\n\nThe United States and the Afghan government turned down invitations to formally participate in the meeting on grounds that they support only direct talks between the government and the Taliban. Instead, the Afghan government sent the four members of the High Peace Council, a body set up to try to get peace negotiations started. The U.S. embassy in Moscow sent its first political secretary, Jacob Choi, to observe the event.\n\nThough it was expected to produce little, Friday's meeting nonetheless marked a significant diplomatic victory for Moscow, which has been seeking a more prominent role in Afghanistan.\n\nBeyond the political outreach, U.S. military officials have recently accused Russia of supplying the Taliban with weapons. Russia denies that claim, but experts believe such deliveries could be about building a relationship with the group and helping them fight Islamic State militants who have been seeking a foothold in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Russian effort comes as the Trump administration is seeing its own renewed push for peace talks contrast with an intensified war in Afghanistan. This week, the White House\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, is touring the region, tasked with pressing the Taliban and the government to form negotiating teams. The U.S. backs a call by Afghanistan's president Ashraf Ghani for the government to hold talks with the Taliban without pre-conditions.\n\nThe Taliban have so far rejected Ghani\u2019s offer, insisting on direct talks with the U.S.\n\nThe bleak reality of the war, though, provided an unchanged background on Friday. Even as the talks began, officials in Afghanistan said a Taliban attack had killed 10 soldiers. The attack on an army outpost in Takhar province happened as the U.S. envoy, Khalilzad arrived in Afghanistan to kick off his peace tour.\n\nSarabi said the Kabul delegation had come to Moscow \"to talk with all members of the meeting\" and that they wanted it to lead to direct negotiations.\n\nRussia\u2019s re-emergence in Afghan affairs, in part, reflects a broader strategy to bolster its appearance as a power-broker on the world stage.\n\nIn addition to its intervention in Syria, the Kremlin has become more involved in Libya recently and has even proposed itself, so far unsuccessfully, as a possible new venue for Israel-Palestine talks.\n\nBut Russia is also concerned a U.S. failure in Afghanistan will see it become a renewed source of terrorism, and is already seeking to block the flow of narcotics from the country. Opening the talks, Lavrov warned the Islamic State wants to make Afghanistan a \u201cbridgehead\u201d to expand into Central Asia.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman, Shaheen, called Russia\u2019s role \"positive.\" He also denied it had supplied any weapons to the group.\n\nThe smiles and warm handshakes among the Russian and Afghan delegations in some ways put into relief the difficult history that the event carried with it. The Soviet Union\u2019s nine-year war in Afghanistan devastated the country and killed at least 14,500 Soviet troops and 90,000 of the Mujahedeen fighters who fought them. The UN estimates 700,000 to 1.3 million people were killed in the fighting.\n\nThat history was on display in person in the Moscow hotel, where the High Peace Council delegation was led by Haji Deen Mohammad, a former Mujahedeen commander, now sitting in traditional dress amid the lobby\u2019s heavy Soviet-style d\u00e9cor.\n\n\"He\u2019s happy to be here. They are all happy to be here,\" said Afghanistan\u2019s ambassador to Russia, Dr. Abdul Qayyum Kochai.\n\nHowever, Kochai expressed reservations about how substantial Russia\u2019s peace effort could be. He said Afghanistan would be grateful if Russia was \u201chonestly\u201d trying to bring peace, but acknowledged he wasn't sure.\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. I wish.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a proclamation Friday to deny asylum to migrants who enter the country illegally, tightening the border as caravans of Central Americans slowly approach the United States. The plan was immediately challenged in court.\n\nTrump invoked the same powers he used last year to impose a travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court. The new regulations are intended to circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country. About 70,000 people per year who enter the country illegally claim asylum, officials said.\n\n\"We need people in our country, but they have to come in legally,\" Trump said Friday as he departed for Paris.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups swiftly sued in federal court in Northern California to block the regulations, arguing the measures were illegal.\n\n\"The president is simply trying to run roughshod over Congress's decision to provide asylum to those in danger regardless of the manner of one's entry,\" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.\n\nThe litigation also seeks to put the new rules on hold while the case progresses.\n\nThe regulations go into effect Saturday. They would be in place for at least three months but could be extended, and don't affect people already in the country. The Justice Department said in a statement the regulations were lawful.\n\nTrump's announcement was the latest push to enforce a hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress, which has not passed any immigration law reform. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to retreat.\n\nOfficials said the asylum law changes are meant to funnel migrants through official border crossings for speedy rulings instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200-kilometer) border. The U.S. Border Patrol says it apprehended more than 50,000 people crossing illegally in October, setting a new high this year, though illegal crossings are well below historical highs from previous decades.\n\nBut the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing.\n\n\"The arrival of large numbers ... will contribute to the overloading of our immigration and asylum system and to the release of thousands ... into the interior of the United States,\" Trump said in the proclamation, calling it a crisis.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \"withholding of removal\" \u2014 which is similar to asylum, but doesn't allow for green cards or bringing families \u2014 or protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nHomeland Security officials said they were adding staffing at the border crossings to manage the expected crush, but it's not clear how migrants, specifically families, would be held as their cases are adjudicated. Family detention centers are largely at capacity. Trump has said he wanted to erect \"tent cities,\" but nothing has been funded.\n\nThe U.S. is also working with Mexico in an effort to send some migrants back across the border. Right now, laws allow only Mexican nationals to be swiftly returned and increasingly those claiming asylum are from Central America.\n\nTrump pushed immigration issues hard in the days leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections, railing against the caravans that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nHe has made little mention of the issue since the election, but has sent troops to the border in response. As of Thursday, there were more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas.\n\nTrump also suggested he'd revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \"tent cities\" to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations. But Trump insisted the citizenship issue would be pushed through.\n\n\"We're signing it. We're doing it,\" he said.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years and the immigration court backlog has more than doubled to 1.1 million cases in about two years, Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse reported this week. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nIt's unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. Roughly 5,000 migrants \u2014 more than 1,700 under the age of 18 \u2014 sheltered in a Mexico City sports complex decided to depart Friday for the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border, particularly to Tijuana. Most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Nomaan Merchant in Houston and Jill Colvin and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.", "Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party is back and I am EXCITED and FESTIVE and HUNGRY!

Yet excluding items that tend to fluctuate sharply from month to month, inflation pressures remain tame.\n\nThe jump in the producer price index, which measures prices before they reach consumers, followed a smaller 0.2 percent increase in September. Compared with 12 months earlier, producer prices rose a sharp 2.9 percent in October.\n\nBut when food, energy and other volatile categories are excluded, so-called core wholesale prices rose only a modest 0.2 percent in October and 2.8 percent from a year earlier.\n\nHigher prices for services such as transportation and warehousing drove most of October's overall increase in wholesale prices. Many trucking companies have had to pay bonuses and raise pay to hire enough truck drivers, for example.\n\nAnd the year-over-year increase in wholesale prices is still lower than it was in the summer, when it topped 3 percent. In addition, oil prices declined in October, which will likely lower gasoline costs in the coming months.\n\n\"There is little sign that a more marked acceleration (in inflation) lies around the corner,\" Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm, said in a research note.\n\nEconomists say the Trump administration's trade war with China, which has led it to impose tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports, has so far had only a limited impact. Hunter suggested that the dollar's rise in value this year, which makes imports less expensive for Americans, might be offsetting much of the impact of the tariffs.\n\nWholesale prices for pork rose by the most in more than two years last month. But Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said that likely marked a snapback after China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. pork earlier this year. Those tariffs initially depressed China's purchases and forced pork farmers to lower their prices. That trend now appears to be reversing itself, Stanley said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is keeping a close eye on price changes as it monitors the economy for signs of overheating. The unemployment rate is at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent, and companies are raising wages and salaries to attract and keep workers. Average hourly pay rose in October from a year earlier at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.\n\nCompanies may have to raise prices to offset the costs of higher pay, which could spur higher inflation. But businesses could also invest in more machinery and software to make their employees more efficient, which would enable them to pay more without raising prices.\n\nFed policymakers finished a two-day meeting Thursday without changing the short-term interest rate they control. But most economists expect the Fed will hike short-term rates for a fourth time this year when it next meets in December. The Fed has signaled it expects to raise rates three more times next year.\n\nAfter its meeting Thursday, the Fed issued a statement that suggested it saw little sign that inflation would accelerate beyond its 2 percent target. Consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in September from a year earlier.\n\nFriday's report showed that wholesale gas prices rose 7.6 in October and food costs increased 1 percent. The price of new cars fell 0.7 percent, as automakers introduced their new car models last month. Newer cars typically include additional features and the government reflects that by lowering its measure of auto prices.", "Interested in Airlines? Add Airlines as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Airlines news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nStorms, strikes, computer failures \u2014 you can now add \"your plane has been seized by the government\" to the list of things that can delay your flight.\n\nIn France, 149 passengers were preparing to take off for London late Thursday when French authorities ordered their Ryanair Boeing 737 impounded.\n\nThe budget carrier owed money and it was \"regrettable that the state was forced\" to evacuate the plane, the civil aviation authority said.\n\nThe passengers had gone through passport control and security and were about to walk on the tarmac to board the plane when airport authorities told them to turn around, passenger Boris Hejblum said.\n\n\"The airport staff told us there was an issue with the plane,\" he told The Associated Press in an email.\n\nNo Ryanair staff members were available, and the only communication from the airline was two text messages saying simply that the departure was delayed, and a 5-euro ($5.75) voucher for food \u2014 \"less than what a sandwich cost at the airport caf\u00e9,\" the 30-year-old Frenchman said.\n\n\"I found it strange that the police were the only ones giving us information,\" he said.\n\nThe passengers were put on another flight that finally brought them to London's Stansted airport \u2014 five hours late.\n\nThe multi-million dollar jet, meanwhile, was released only Friday after Ryanair paid a bill of 525,000 euros ($610,000).\n\nThe scene unfolded at the Bordeaux-Merignac airport in western France, where authorities say the airline was ordered to pay back funds that the European Union had declared to be illegal subsidies. Ryanair did not publicly comment on the seizure.\n\nFrench aviation agency spokesman Eric Heraud said regional authorities who originally gave the subsidies had been trying since 2014 to recover the money, and sent its final legal warning in May. After six months without a response from Ryanair, it decided to act Friday.\n\nThe standoff with French authorities will not help Ryanair, which more than most carriers, has come to symbolize budget airlines' relentless focus on the bottom line at the cost of customer service.\n\nRyanair has become Europe's largest airline by number of passengers by persistently offering some of the cheapest fares available. That ensures its planes are packed.\n\nIt then makes extra money with add-on fares. Besides charging for seating choice and food \u2014 now standard practice on budget flights the world over \u2014 it also has travelers pay for any carry-on bag that's larger than a purse.\n\nIt manages to keep its costs down by flying to out of the way airports at odd hours to get cheaper airport slots.\n\nIts CEO, Michael O'Leary, personifies the airline's brash approach, sparring with unions and EU authorities. And despite conceding in 2013 that \"we should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily piss people off,\" the airline retains its reputation as something to be endured for the sake of flying cheaply around Europe.\n\n\"I would say we just took it as another Ryanair problem, having no information from them,\" Hejblum said of Thursday's incident. \"When we found out about the seizure, I would say the general sentiment was to blame Ryanair for not complying with the law.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPiovano reported from London.", "A prosecutor in Virginia says a woman charged in a fatal crash may have fled the country.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch reports Rob Cerullo said Thursday that authorities believe 48-year-old Osmaira E. Mendez-Urdaneta, of Henrico, fled the county and possibly the U.S. to avoid prosecution. Mendez-Urdaneta, who is from El Salvador, is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the August death of 59-year-old Beverly Page Bourgeois, who was struck by a car while doing yard work.\n\nCerullo says Mendez-Urdaneta missed a court date in October on a charge of reckless driving. He says authorities have been unable to find her to serve a warrant for the upgraded charge. He says U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security are involved.\n\nCerullo says the commonwealth's attorney's office appointed him to the case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Richmond Times-Dispatch, http://www.richmond.com", "A former Macedonian prime minister on Friday lost his final appeal against serving a two-year prison sentence over corruption-related charges.\n\nA panel of judges at the Skopje criminal court said in a statement that they rejected Nikola Gruevski's appeal after \"reviewing all the facts and evidence\" in the case.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Gruevski intended to hand himself in to authorities to serve the sentence.\n\nThe former leader of the conservative main opposition VMRO-DPMNE party was sentenced in May to two years in prison for unlawfully influencing Interior Ministry officials over the purchase of a luxury vehicle at an estimated cost of 600,000 euros ($680,000).\n\nHe was ordered to present himself at the capital Skopje's \"Shuto Orizari\" prison Thursday, but submitted a last-minute appeal.\n\nThe 48-year-old politician, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2016 and is still a VMRO lawmaker, had requested that the prison sentence be deferred, citing parliamentary duties.\n\nVMRO leader Hristijan Mickoski condemned the court decision, claiming that Macedonia's judiciary is \"absolutely\" under government control.\n\n\"Gruevski is a victim of political persecution,\" Mickoski said in an interview with private TV Alfa channel.\n\nEarlier Friday, Macedonian lawmakers fell short of votes needed to expel Gruevski as a member of parliament. Parliament voted 58-29 to revoke Gruevski's mandate, but failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in the 120-seat assembly.", "The main suspect in a huge fraud involving public money was arrested on her return to Copenhagen after she voluntarily left South Africa, a Danish prosecution authority said.\n\nThe Serious Economic and International Crime unit wrote on that Britta Nielsen had landed in Denmark Friday, a day after a South African court freed her after she was arrested on an international extradition request.\n\nNielsen was arrested Nov. 5 in Johannesburg and had 648,700 rand ($46,000) in cash in her possession which was confiscated. Denmark sought her extradition, but the process was abandoned after she said she would voluntarily return to Denmark and face any charges.\n\nFour days earlier, a man suspected in the same case also was arrested in South Africa as he was about to leave the country with two diamonds in his luggage.\n\nThe Serious Economic and International Crime unit said he, too, had returned to Denmark and was arrested. South African authorities have identified him as Nielsen's adult son, Jimmy Hayat. A Danish court has barred media in Denmark from naming him.\n\nNielsen, a 64-year-old civil servant, is wanted in a fraud case that caused a Danish government welfare agency to lose at least 111 million kroner ($17 million).\n\nIt was not clear how the money was stolen, but it appears Nielsen had privileged access to the agency's computer system. A preliminary probe says that at least 274 money transfers were made during 2002-2018.\n\nOn Oct. 10. Denmark's minister for children and social affairs, Mai Mercado, said Nielsen, who she said was \"a trusted employee,\" had abused her position to commit systematic fraud during the period.", "Interested in Keystone XL Pipeline? Add Keystone XL Pipeline as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Keystone XL Pipeline news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nEnvironmentalists cheered a federal court order that blocks a Trump administration permit for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, pending an environmental review.\n\nThe pipeline would begin in Alberta and shuttle as much as 830,000 barrels a day of crude through a half dozen states to terminals on the Gulf Coast.\n\nU.S. District Judge Brian Morris put on hold the $8 billion project, ruling that the potential impact had not been considered as required by federal law. Environmentalists and Native American groups sued to stop the project, citing property rights and potential oil spills.\n\nMorris was appointed by President Barack Obama.\n\nBecky Mitchell, chairwoman of the Northern Plains Resource Council, a plaintiff in the case, said that the organization is thrilled with the ruling.\n\nTransCanada, which is pushing the project, did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.\n\nThe company and opponents of the project have been in a decade-long dispute that has spanned several presidencies and involved standoffs between protesters and law enforcement.\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. State Department issued a presidential permit for the pipeline and TransCanada filed paperwork to expand the project. After years of legal wrangling, Barack Obama rejected the permit in 2015.\n\nThe company responded by seeking $15 billion in damages. President Donald Trump signed executive actions to again advance construction of the project in 2017.", "Interest Successfully Added\n\nWe'll notify you here with news about AlertTag\n\nTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?", "Gaza's Hamas rulers lauded on Friday what they described as a gain of their weekly protests along Gaza-Israel perimeter fence, which have often turned deadly, after receiving $15 million from Qatar to help pay the salaries of the territory's civil servants.\n\n\"Today, we see some fruits of the protests \u2014 the partial breaking of the siege on Gaza,\" Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, told reporters at a protest in east Gaza City, referring to the grant. \"We are still waiting for the implementation of all other understandings.\"\n\nSince March, the Islamic militant group has orchestrated weekly demonstrations along the fence, in large part against a blockade Israel and Egypt imposed when it seized Gaza in 2007.\n\nQatar, Egypt and the United Nations, acting as go-betweens for Hamas and Israel, intensified their shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks after a full-blown war between Hamas and Israel appeared imminent.\n\nThe Qatari grant is part of indirect Hamas-Israel understandings to improve living conditions for Gaza's 2 million people and subsequently scale down the border protests, in which 170 Palestinians and an Israeli soldier have been killed since they began in March.\n\nThe closure squeezed Hamas financially. Recent budget cuts by the West Bank-based administration of President Mahmoud Abbas have worsened the situation for Gaza's rulers, preventing them from paying complete salaries to their 40,000 employees.\n\nBut on Thursday, a Qatari envoy brought the money through Israel in three suitcases. They were the first installment of $90 million that Qatar has pledged to cover salaries and other humanitarian operations for six months.\n\nEmployees reporting to the group lined up outside Hamas-affiliated banks and post offices \u2014 typically shut for the weekend on Fridays \u2014 to receive 60 percent of their long-overdue salaries. In recent months, they had instead received smaller stipends every 40 days. Hamas says the monthly disbursements will gradually increase.\n\nAlongside the cash deliveries, Hamas demands an expansion of the permissible fishing zone off Gaza beach, uninterrupted flow of fuel to mitigate chronic power shortages and the lifting of Israeli restrictions on exports and imports, a Hamas official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Palestinians kept Friday's protests carefully restrained, burning fewer tires and refraining from breaching the fence to avoid drawing a lethal response from the Israeli military.\n\nHowever, a 28-year-old who was seriously injured by Israeli fire during the marches later died at a hospital, according to the health ministry. It added that 37 Palestinians were wounded from live gunfire.\n\nThe Qatari mediator, Mohammed Al-Emadi, visited a protest camp in east Gaza City, where he was welcomed by Hamas officials.", "Dutch officials said Friday they will prosecute a nursing home doctor for euthanizing an elderly woman with dementia, the first time a doctor has been charged since the Netherlands legalized euthanasia in 2002.\n\nDutch prosecutors said in a statement the doctor \"had not acted carefully\" and \"overstepped a line\" when she performed euthanasia. Officials first began probing the case in September, when they found the doctor had drugged the patient's coffee and then had family members hold her down while delivering the fatal injection.\n\nThe doctor said she was fulfilling the patient's earlier euthanasia request and that since the patient was not competent, nothing the woman said during her euthanasia procedure was relevant.\n\nBut Dutch prosecutors argued that the patient's written euthanasia request was \"unclear and contradictory.\"\n\n\"In her living will, the woman wrote that she wanted to be euthanized 'whenever I think the time is right.' But after being asked several times in the nursing home whether she wanted to die, she said, 'Not just now, it's not so bad yet,'\" according to an earlier report by one of the Netherlands' euthanasia review committees.\n\n\"Even if the patient had said at that moment: 'I don't want to die,' the physician would have continued,\" the committee wrote, citing the doctor's own testimony.\n\nProsecutors said on Friday that the doctor should have verified with the patient whether or not she still wanted to die and that \"the fact that she had become demented does not alter this.\"\n\nJohan Legemaate, a professor of health law at the University of Amsterdam, said: \"The patient's declaration has to be clear enough to the situation so doctors know when euthanasia can be applied.\"\n\n\"But should this include a situation where doctors are drugging patients secretly? It's now for the court to decide whether this doctor acted within the required limits,\" he added.\n\nLegemaate said that there were very few cases of euthanasia in patients with advanced dementia, but that the decision to prosecute the doctor in this case might provoke more caution among health professionals.\n\nRene Heman, chairman of the Dutch Doctors Federation, said he respected how open the doctor had been about the case.\n\n\"Criminal law is always the last possible resort after a report of euthanasia,\" he said, noting that euthanizing people with advanced dementia continued to be very controversial.\n\nThe Netherlands is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with Belgium, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. For those with late-stage dementia, euthanasia is still possible if the person made a written demand specifying the conditions under which they want to be killed and if other criteria are met, namely if the doctor agrees the patient is suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement.\n\n\"If the Dutch had decided not to prosecute this case, that would send a message that if a patient is incompetent, doctors can essentially do whatever they want,\" said Scott Kim, an ethicist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"A case like this should serve as a warning for other countries,\" he said. \"The Dutch seem to be recognizing that certain practices are out of bounds.\"\n\nEarlier this month, friends of Audrey Parker, a euthanasia advocate in Canada, which legalized the procedure in 2016, said she was forced to end her life \"prematurely\" because the law only allows patients who are mentally competent to be killed.\n\nA pro-euthanasia organization said it would soon be launching a campaign to challenge the Canadian law so that people can be euthanized even when they lack capacity.\n\nDutch prosecutors are also examining two other criminal investigations into doctors who performed euthanasia in questionable circumstances; two other cases were recently dropped.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCheng reported from London.", "The uproar surrounding Aasia Bibi \u2014 a Pakistani Christian woman who was acquitted of blasphemy charges and released from death row but remains at a secret location for her protection \u2014 has drawn attention to the plight of the country's Christians.\n\nThe minority, among Pakistan's poorest, has faced an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in this Muslim-majority nation where radical religious and sectarian groups have become more prominent in recent years.\n\nHere is a look at some of the issues involved.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHY HER RELEASE IGNITED AN UPROAR\n\nBibi's Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan's supreme court triggered large-scale protests, with religious extremists demanding the 54-year-old mother of five be publicly executed \u2014 and that the three judges who set her free also be put to death.\n\nHer ordeal started in 2009 after two fellow women farmworkers refused to drink from the same container as a Christian, and later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad. The claim led to her arrest and 2010 death sentence on blasphemy charges. In Pakistan, a mere accusation of blasphemy has caused riots, even lynching.\n\nRights groups have said Pakistan's blasphemy law is often used as an excuse to settle scores, or as a weapon against religious minorities, including Shiite Muslims who are at times targeted by Sunni Muslim militants as heretics.\n\nBibi has been in hiding in Islamabad since her release earlier this week. Her family says she will leave Pakistan as soon as possible because of death threats against her.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWHO THE PAKISTANI CHRISTIANS ARE\n\nThere are about 1.3 million Christians in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country of 204 million people. The Christians are the second-largest minority, after Hindus, and are almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Christian population grew at the time of Pakistan's creation in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into two nations. At the time, many lower caste Hindus, living in what would become Pakistan, converted to Christianity. They were among the region's poorest and held jobs many others didn't want.\n\nAlthough some Christians have risen to senior positions, including A.R. Cornelius who served as Pakistan's chief justice, many live in impoverished communities commonly referred to as \"sweeper colonies\" because residents are employed as domestic and sanitation workers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHOW PAKISTAN'S GOVERNMENTS HAVE TREATED CHRISTIANS\n\nThe rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan has left the country's minority religions vulnerable. The blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty for anyone convicted of insulting Islam, has been used at times as a tool against minorities. Christian churches and homes have been attacked by crowds invoking the law.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, elected in July, in part on an Islamic agenda, has vacillated between criticizing religious parties for using religion to enhance their influence, and bowing to their demands, including firing minorities from government-appointed positions.\n\nIn Bibi's case, Khan seemingly caved to the Islamists' demand to have her acquittal reviewed in an appeal \u2014 though some suspected he was trying to buy time to disperse the protesters.\n\nAnalysts say mixed signals from the government only embolden extremists. Minority religious leaders also say the poverty of the Christian minority sharply reduces their political clout.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHOW CHRISTIANS ARE FARING IN OTHER MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES\n\nEgypt's Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country's 100 million Muslim-majority population, have long complained of discrimination and under-representation in government. Sectarian violence occasionally erupts in rural communities where Christian churches have been torched. Overwhelmingly, attacks on Egyptian Copts have been carried out by Islamist extremists, mainly the Islamic State group, which has killed scores of Christians in recent years.\n\nLebanon's Christian community is the second-largest in the Middle East, after Egypt's, but has gone from being a majority to ranging between 30 and 35 percent of the population. Despite their dwindling numbers, Lebanese Christians still retain relative political power with multiple political parties and a president, who must be a Christian Maronite, according to an unwritten national pact.\n\nAcross the Holy Land, Christians now make up an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population, a marked decline over the decades. Reasons include a relatively low birth rate and increased emigration by Palestinian Christians, driven by the fallout from the long-running conflict with Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the number of Christians has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000 over the past decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a period that has been marked by armed conflict with Israel, border closures and soaring unemployment.\n\nIraq has been seeing a dramatic exodus of its Christians since dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003. Muslim extremists, mostly from the al-Qaida terror network and later the Islamic State group, have bombed churches and shrines in Baghdad and the city of Mosul, and assassinated high-level bishops and priests. There were thought to be over 1 million Christians living in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003; today only a fraction remains.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Menna Zaki in Cairo, Philip Issa in Baghdad, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "This is a Kaiser Health News story.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Add Interest\n\nMedicaid \u2014 which has been a political football between Washington and state capitols during the past decade \u2014 scored big in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nFollowing the vote, nearly 500,000 uninsured adults in five states are poised to gain Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, advocates estimate. Three deep-red states passed ballot measures expanding their programs and two other states elected governors who have said they will accept expansion bills from their legislatures.\n\nSupporters were so excited by the victories they said they will start planning for more voter referendums in 2020.\n\nMedicaid proponents also were celebrating the Democrats\u2019 takeover of the House, which would impede any Republican efforts to repeal the ACA and make major cuts to the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.\n\n\u201cTuesday was huge for the Medicaid program,\u201d said Katherine Howitt, associate director of policy at Community Catalyst, a Boston-based advocacy group. \u201cThe overall message is that the electorate does not see this as a Democrat or GOP issue but as an issue of basic fairness, access to care and pocketbook issue. Medicaid is working and is something Americans want to protect.\u201d\n\nBut health experts caution that GOP opposition won\u2019t fade away.\n\nDavid Jones, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Law, Policy and Management at Boston University, said ballot organizers now have a blueprint on how to expand Medicaid in states that have resisted. \u201cI see this as a turning point in ACA politics,\u201d he said. Still, he added\u201a \u201cit\u2019s not inevitable.\u201d\n\nMedicaid is the largest government health program, insuring at least 73 million low-income Americans. Half of them are children. To date, 32 states and the District of Columbia have expanded it under the ACA. Before that law, Medicaid was generally limited to children, sometimes their parents, pregnant women and people with disabilities.\n\nThe ACA encouraged states to open the program to all Americans earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level ($16,753 for an individual in 2018). The federal government is paying the bulk of the cost: 94 percent this year, but gradually dropping to 90 percent in 2020. States pay the rest.\n\nGOP opposition has left about 4.2 million low-income Americans without coverage in various states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over is the story of Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act as the politics never ends and the opportunity for obstruction never ends,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut the trend overall has been to increasing implementation and increasing coverage.\u201d\n\nMontana Fails To Endorse Funding\n\nTwo years after President Donald Trump carried Idaho, Nebraska and Utah by double-digit margins with a message that included repeal of the ACA, voters in those states approved the ballot referendums Tuesday. Together, the states have about 300,000 uninsured adults who would be eligible for the program.\n\nIn addition, Democrats secured the governor\u2019s offices in Kansas and Maine, which will increase the likelihood those states pursue expansion. Legislatures in both states have previously voted to expand, only to have GOP governors block the bills. Maine voters also passed a referendum in 2017 endorsing expansion, but Republican Gov. Paul LePage again refused to accept it.\n\nCurrent and incoming Republican governors in Utah and Idaho said they wouldn\u2019t block implementation of the effort if voters approved it. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday he would follow the will of the voters but would not support paying for it with a tax increase.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a clean sweep, however, for Medicaid on Tuesday.\n\nIn preliminary results, a ballot issue to fund Montana\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2014 which is already in place and slated to expire next July \u2014 was failing. Tobacco companies had mounted a campaign to stop the measure, which would have partially financed the expansion with taxes on tobacco products.\n\nThe Montana legislature and the Democratic governor are expected to address the issue in the session that starts in January. No state has reversed its Medicaid expansion, even though GOP governors in Kansas and Arkansas have threatened to do so.\n\nNearly 100,000 Montana residents have received Medicaid since its expansion, twice as many as expected.\n\nNancy Ballance, the Republican chairwoman of the Montana House Appropriations Committee who opposed the bill that expanded Medicaid in 2015, said she is confident the state legislature will extend the program past July. But she expects the legislature to put some limits on the program, such as adding an asset test and work requirements.\n\n\u201cThere are some people in the state who may not have disabilities but need some help to access coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we can pass something without people having a gap in coverage. \u2026 That will be a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was never our intent to simply sunset the expansion and have it go away,\u201d she said. Rather, the legislature put the sunset provision in to revisit the provision to make any changes.\n\nChris Jacobs, a conservative health policy analyst in Washington, D.C., said the Montana results showed that when voters are given a choice of having to pay for Medicaid expansion through a new tax they were not willing to go along.\n\nBut in Utah, voters did agree to fund their state plan by adding 0.15 percent to the state\u2019s sales tax, just over a penny for a $10 purchase.\n\nFernando Wilson, acting director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said the vote on the state\u2019s ballot question indicated many people wanted to help 80,000 uninsured Nebraskans gain coverage.\n\n\u201cI think it showed there was a clear need for it,\u201d he said. The legislature likely won\u2019t block the expansion, Wilson said, though it may try to add a conservative twist such as adding premiums or other steps.\n\nSheila Burke, a lecturer in health policy at Harvard Kennedy School, said voters approved Medicaid expansion not just because it would help improve health coverage for their residents but to help stabilize their hospitals, particularly those in rural areas. Hospitals have said this step helps their bottom lines because it cuts down on uninsured patients and uncompensated care.\n\n\u201cThe broad population does see the value of Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cThey saw it as a loss by their states not to accept the federal funds,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the victories, Burke said, advocates should not assume other states such as Florida, Texas and Tennessee will follow suit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a radical shift, but it moves us closer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2018Fertile Ground\u2019 For More Referendums\n\nIf advocates press for more referendums, Florida might be a tempting target. More than 700,000 adults there could become eligible, but the campaign would likely also be very costly.\n\nJonathan Schleifer, executive director of The Fairness Project, which financed the ballot initiatives in Maine in 2017 and the four states this year, refused to say which states would be targeted next.\n\nThe group is funded by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, a California health care workers union.\n\n\u201cThe GOP has been bashing the ACA for nearly a decade, and voters in the reddest states in the country just rejected that message,\u201d Schleifer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a repudiation and a tectonic shift in health care in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is fertile ground\u201d for more such ballot votes, said Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \u201cIt is clear that public opinion is on the side of Medicaid expansion and the election results merely confirm that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will build momentum for expansion in other states,\u201d he added.\n\nThe election results also could have consequences on efforts by states to implement work requirements for Medicaid enrollees.\n\nNew Hampshire and Michigan \u2014 which expanded the program but recently won federal approval to add controversial work requirements \u2014 could revisit that additional mandate as a result of Democrats winning control over both houses of the legislature in New Hampshire and the governor\u2019s office in Michigan.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

At least 91 people were killed, hundreds of synagogues burned down, some 7,500 Jewish businesses vandalized, and up to 30,000 Jewish men arrested, many of whom were taken away to concentration camps.\n\nTwenty years after Germany's defeat in World War I and 5\u00bd years after Adolf Hitler took power, state-driven anti-Semitism \"made it possible for many Germans to live out long-held resentments, to live out hatred and violence,\" Merkel said. \"With the November pogrom, the road to the Holocaust was mapped out.\"\n\nMerkel spoke in a ceremony at a Berlin synagogue. The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the building was set alight in 1938 and the blaze extinguished relatively quickly only so as not to endanger neighboring houses.\n\nSchuster said that, while the Nazis' SA and SS organizations were responsible for the pogrom, that already meant thousands of Germans took part \u2014 and the population's reaction \"gave the Nazis valuable information: barely anyone protested.\"\n\nHe added that, while modern-day attacks on Jews, migrants and Muslims can't be equated with the crimes of the Nazi era, \"I see it as a disgrace for our country that such things happen in Germany in 2018.\"\n\nHe assailed the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which he said has \"respect for nothing\" and which his organization didn't invite to Friday's event. The party entered Germany's parliament last year.\n\n\"Today, we are living once again in a time of far-reaching change,\" Merkel said. \"In such times, there is always a particularly great danger of those who react with supposedly simple answers gaining support.\"\n\nThose answers, she said, are too often accompanied by a \"brutalization of language.\"\n\n\"We are commemorating today with the promise that we will set ourselves strongly against attacks on our open and plural society,\" she said. \"We are commemorating in the knowledge that watching as lines are crossed and crimes are committed ultimately means going along with them.\"\n\nIn a separate speech to parliament on a day that also marked the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of a German republic after World War I and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged his compatriots to embrace an enlightened, \"democratic patriotism\" and reject aggressive nationalism that romanticizes the country's history.\n\nEvidence from post-war trials of perpetrators, such as one involving the Bavarian town of Treuchtlingen, shows that many ordinary Germans joined in the 1938 pogrom, some out of anti-Semitism, others using the riots as opportunities to settle personal grudges or to enrich themselves.\n\nThe Treuchtlingen case was one of the first and among the largest of more than 1,000 post-war Kristallnacht trials in West German courts. A report by the U.S. military's Counter Intelligence Corps, which sent an observer to the 1946 proceedings, provides details about the nearly 60 defendants.\n\nThe report from CIC special agent Erich Bendfeldt was declassified this year by the U.S. National Archives in response to an Associated Press Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nIt shows that the Treuchtlingen synagogue was burned that night to the foundation walls. The fire department hosed down neighboring \"Aryan-owned\" buildings to protect them, while people rampaged through the town, mobbing Jewish homes, destroying property and looting.\n\nOne middle-aged woman swung by the home of a Jewish family she owed money to and destroyed the ledgers, and also had enough time to bring gasoline to help torch the synagogue.\n\nThe town's mayor took personal command of much of the destruction, while himself beating a respected Jewish doctor nearly to death. A 29-year-old engine driver also beat the doctor, poured a chamber pot over the head of a Jewish girl and forced her father at dagger-point to say \"Heil Hitler.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHerschaft contributed reporting from New York.

It costs thousands of dollars for every \"cycle,\" and many couples require more than one attempt.\n\nMrs. Obama writes of being alone to administer herself shots to help hasten the process.

He expressed particular concern because overall, anti-Semitic acts had been on the decline in recent years.\n\nThe government won't release specific figures until the end of the year. Over all of 2017, the government reported 311 anti-Semitic acts, from threats to swastikas on Jewish gravesites to physical attacks on people wearing kippas. That was down from 335 the year before, but the number of violent anti-Semitic acts rose, along with anti-Muslim and other violent hate crimes.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said part of the recent rise could be attributed to a government push over the past year to encourage people to report hate crimes, including a new online portal to file police reports.\n\nThe prime minister promised new measures to better handle victims and punish perpetrators, to take down potentially violent hate speech online more quickly and to help teachers who report anti-Semitic behavior.\n\n\"Each attack against one of our compatriots because he or she is Jewish resonates like new broken glass,\" the prime minister said, in reference to the mass crackdown on Jews throughout Germany and Austria on Nov. 9, 1938 known as the Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht. \"It is up to each French person to mobilize 'for' something: for life together, for France's identity, for the values of the Republic.\"\n\nIslamic extremists targeted a Jewish school and kosher supermarket in two of France's most deadly terrorist attacks in recent years, and some blame Islamic radicalism for resurgent anti-Semitism in France.

But the political warfare is set to get worse.\n\nA direct consequence of the split-decision election is a deepening of the political divide. Democrats are set to take control of the House, powered by a triumphant left, while the remaining House Republicans and the larger Republican majority in the Senate will be Trumpier than ever.\n\nThen comes an indirect consequence: the behavior of President Donald Trump. Between his threats of using intelligence leak inquiries as political retribution, the firing of the attorney general, and his White House\u2019s actions against members of the media, Trump is signaling aggression and acrimony.\n\nIt\u2019s Trump unbound. Yet, Trump is about to have more binding his actions than ever before: Democrats will soon have the power to compel testimony and force documents into the public realm, and Robert Mueller is finishing up his work.\n\nThe president is acting as if he\u2019s never had more confidence in his own powers.

During the campaign, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said it was too early to talk the possibility of impeachment; passing new bills was the goal instead.\n\nBut within hours of Democrats flipping majority control of the House, the president seemed to dare them.\n\nThe news that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been forced to step down triggered fast and furious statements from some Democratic leaders saying that if the president were to also fire special counsel Robert Mueller, it would be considered obstruction of justice and an impeachable offense.\n\nPlus, while several House Democrats won by championing a bump to the minimum wage and universal health care, Democratic candidates for Senate lost even after trying to distance themselves from a party that has been tracking to the left.\n\nIn states around the country, where Democrats flipped more 300 local legislature seats and netted five additional local legislative chambers, the path may be more straightforward. Expect work on health care, renewable energy and maybe more gun control.

According to current projections, Democrats have won 17 of those 25, while five -- all in California -- remain too close to call.\n\nAnother factoid: Of the 31 seats Democrats have flipped thus far, none gave Donald Trump more than 55 percent of the vote in 2016. Their quest to retake the House was fueled by a strong backlash to the president, and Democrats won in the places where the GOP was holding onto power, but not tight enough.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

Yet, even then it could not be stopped.\n\nWith both sides in the war already knowing for hours a cease-fire would start at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, hundreds of good men kept falling that morning.\n\nFear the other side would not abide by the conditions of the armistice, a sheer hatred produced by four years of unprecedented slaughter, blind ambition of commanders who craved that last victory, the inane joy of killing, reason enough not to let humanity shine through a few minutes, hours early. Put together they trumped the lives of soldiers, many of whom were convinced they were on the brink of peace and survival.\n\nWith two minutes to go, Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper close to Mons in southern Belgium. Another life shattered in its prime at 25.\n\nSome 250 kilometers (150 miles) away on the Western Front in France, an American soldier Henry Gunther, for reasons still hard to explain a century later, stormed a German post with only one minute left before the armistice and was mowed down by machine gun fire. He was 23.\n\n\"Gunther's act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war,\" said U.S. historian Alec Bennett. \"He was the last American. I believe he may have been the last soldier on any side to die in World War I.\"\n\nAny soldier who died that morning might well be an equal symbol of futility, and the mark of \"Nov. 11, 1918\" on any headstone at a World War I cemetery makes it especially poignant.\n\n\"It was a matter of minutes,\" said Corentin Rousman, a Belgian historian working in Mons, where British empire soldiers had their first battle with the Germans in August 1914, and also their last over four years later, when Price perished.\n\nFor Commonwealth commanders it must have been especially sweet to retake the city, bringing the war to a full circle right where they lost their first soldier, English Private John Parr who had stumbled onto the Germans on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nIn between, World War I had claimed some 14 million lives, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Early on, Germany came close to a quick victory before the conflict settled into hellish trench warfare. One battle, like the Somme in France could have up to a million casualties. Poison gas came to epitomize the cruel ruthlessness of a war the likes of which history had never seen.\n\nWhen the old European powers were close to exhaustion in the war of attrition it came to fewer nations like Gunther's United States and Price's Canada to make the difference.\n\nPrice had been a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history picked him off the land in 1917 as the allies sought ever more manpower to keep the Germans at bay on the Western Front.\n\nThe following summer he was part of the allied surge, and despite being gassed, he took city upon village upon city \u2014 right up to the morning of Nov. 11.\n\nNews of the impending cease-fire was already known, still he decided to go check out some homes along the historic network of industrial canals while in the center of Mons citizens already broke out the wine and whisky they had hidden for years to celebrate the liberation of their ancient medieval city.\n\n\"Then it is unclear what happens,\" said Rousman. Either Price runs out of a home to help someone or he thinks the war is over. What happened instead was that a shot rang out across a canal and Price dropped.\n\n\"There no longer was any massive artillery around. It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\" Rousman said.\n\nAnd minutes not only counted for the dead but also for the killers.\n\n\"There are rules in war,\" Rousman said. \"There is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That's the difference.\"\n\nThe soldier who shot Price was never identified, swallowed up in a German retreat.\n\nIn senseless death, Price made the war come full circle at the level of soldiers.\n\nWith leaves falling on Saint Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth victim killed in the war, lies within a stone's throw from Parr, the first one.\n\n\"He is not forgotten,\" said Rousman. \"It's a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers, notes and Canadian flags.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nExcerpt from \"World War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition,\" available at Amazon https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U", "The mother of a teen who was kidnapped in front of her home earlier this week said she is \"suffering for her\" and is pleading for the girl's safe return.\n\nElsa Hernandez, the mother of 13-year-old Hania Noelia Aguilar, said she has faith her daughter is OK, and just wants to see her back at their home in Lumberton, North Carolina.\n\n\"Return her to me because I miss her,\" Hernandez told Durham ABC affiliate WTVD, in Spanish. \"She's a good, sweet girl.\"\n\nmissingkids.org\n\nHania had gone outside Monday morning so she could warm up the family's Ford Expedition before school when a witness saw a man -- dressed in all black with a yellow bandanna over his face -- approach the girl and force her into the SUV, police said.\n\nThe vehicle was recovered Thursday morning, police said, but there was no trace of Noelia Aguilar or her captor. Authorities said someone called 911 after seeing the vehicle, still in Lumberton, parked in the woods.\n\n\"I need her,\" Hernandez told WTVD. \"I am suffering for her. Her sisters are too.\"\n\nWTVD\n\nThe FBI, which is investigating the case, released surveillance video on Thursday showing a man wearing light-colored shoes, a light-colored shirt and hoodie walking toward the trailer park where the family lives. He was the only man seen in the area on Monday morning, but he is not considered a suspect at this time.\n\n\"This is the only person that, at this time, we are actually able to identify via CCTV footage, and he may have information for us,\" FBI Supervisor Andy de la Rocha said.\n\nThe family plans to hold a vigil for Hania's safe return on Friday night at 7 p.m. at St. Andrew Catholic Church in Red Springs.\n\nRev. Giovanni Romero, of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Red Springs, said they\u2019re having a vigil there Friday at 7pm to pray for Hania\u2019s safe return. Hania and her family are parishioners there. Here\u2019s what he said in Spanish. #ABC11 pic.twitter.com/t7xwnT3tZH \u2014 Gloria Rodriguez (@GloriaABC11) November 8, 2018\n\nInvestigators are also going \"door-to-door\" to talk to anyone who lives nearby, Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeill said in Thursday's press conference.\n\n\"We urgently need the public's help,\" McNeill said. \"We need them more now than ever to find Hania and bring her back.\"\n\nEmily Shapiro and Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.", "Interest Successfully Added\n\nWe'll notify you here with news about AlertTag\n\nTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?", "A spike in consumer spending driven by warm weather and England's surprise run to the semifinals of the soccer World Cup helped the British economy post its best growth in nearly two years during the third quarter, official figures showed Friday.\n\nHowever, the 0.6 percent quarterly rate may not be sustainable. It was mostly reliant on a sharp pick-up in consumption, particularly of food and drink, during July, when temperatures regularly surpassed 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2014 a rarity for the country \u2014 and Harry Kane almost led his England team to World Cup glory.\n\nThe economy then stagnated during August and September, suggesting it remains hobbled by concerns surrounding the Brexit process, with businesses in particular reluctant to invest.\n\nThe third-quarter performance was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2016, just after the country voted to leave the European Union. It also means that Britain's growth outpaced the 0.2 percent tick recorded by the 19-country eurozone during the same period.\n\n\"The economy saw a strong summer, although longer term economic growth remained subdued,\" said Rob Kent-Smith from the Office for National Statistics.\n\nThat was evident in the year-on-year figures: U.K. growth of 1.5 percent lags the eurozone's 1.7 percent and is dwarfed by the U.S.'s 3.5 percent.\n\nBritain's economy minister, Philip Hammond, said the improvement in the quarterly figures show the \"underlying strength\" of the economy.\n\n\"We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens next, as Hammond has conceded, depends largely on the outcome of the Brexit discussions between the British government and the EU.\n\nThere are reports that a deal may be struck as soon as next week but there remain questions as to whether British Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to get enough lawmakers in Parliament to approve it. If lawmakers reject it, concerns would swell that Britain could crash out of the EU in March with no deal on future relations and no transition period to those new arrangements. In that scenario, tariffs would be placed on trade with the 27 other EU countries, border checks would be reinstalled, and restrictions could hit travelers and workers.\n\nSince the Brexit vote of June 2016, British consumers have largely become more cautious about spending, partly as a result of a rise in prices generated by the pound's fall. A recent pick-up in wages should shore up spending in coming months \u2014 in the absence of any Brexit shock.\n\nBusinesses have also been wary of investing in light of the uncertainty. Friday's figures showed a 1.2 percent quarterly decline in business investment, the third straight quarterly fall.\n\n\"The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn,\" said Samuel Tombs, chief U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nMany economists think it won't become clear before next year what Brexit means for the economy and that many firms will enact contingency plans in coming months, hurting investment and hiring.\n\nThe third-quarter performance could be the best outcome for some time yet.\n\n\"We think the economy has a challenging few months ahead of it,\" said James Smith, an economist at ING.", "Paris, the City of Light, always was the grandest prize of World War I, either to conquer or defend.\n\nSo it is only fitting that when victors and vanquished meet to mark the centennial of the armistice this weekend, the biggest ceremony should be on the famed Champs-Elysees at the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nOn Friday, some leaders began remembrance events in a wide crescent of cemeteries and trench-rutted battlefields north of the capital.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May laid wreaths for the first and last British soldier killed in the fighting \u2014 the two were buried across one another near Mons in southern Belgium. One grave holds the remains of Pvt. John Parr, killed Aug. 21, 1914. The other grave is of Pvt. George Ellison, who survived some of the war's worst battles but was shot on Nov. 11, 1918 \u2014 the war's last day.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron continued his pilgrimage of WWI sites and caught up with May, as the two present day leaders of the Allied forces that defeated Germany walked past graves at the Thiepval memorial.\n\n\"Each cemetery and memorial across the world is a unique and poignant reminder of the cost of the First World War,\" said May.\n\nSixty-nine heads of state and government will underscore that message at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month on Sunday, exactly a century after the armistice.\n\nSuch was the symbolic importance of the French capital that victorious U.S. Gen. John J. Pershing said it was his \"desire that every man in the American Expeditionary Forces should be given the opportunity to visit Paris before returning to the United States.\"\n\nFar from every surviving U.S. soldier from the 1914-1918 war made it to the French capital, but on Sunday, President Donald Trump will join his French counterpart and host, Emmanuel Macron, and others to remember the millions who died during the first global conflict.\n\nAlan Seeger, the American poet that Macron lauded in his speech to the U.S. Congress last year, already captured the seeds of reconciliation in 1916 when he wrote, as a soldier in the French Foreign Legion, that \"I never took arms out of any hatred against Germany or the Germans, but purely out of love for France.\"\n\nFrance, Britain and its empire, Russia and the United States had the main armies opposing a German-led coalition that also included the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. Nearly 10 million soldiers died, often in brutal trench warfare where poison gas added a cruelty in warfare that the world had never seen.\n\nHundreds of thousands from all corners of the world died in Europe, many of them on the Western Front reaching from Belgium's Flanders Fields almost up to the Swiss border.\n\nCarrying the heritage of defeated Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel will be visiting the site in the woods north of Paris where military leaders agreed in a train carriage to the armistice at 5 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, six hours before it took effect.\n\nOn Sunday, in another show of reconciliation, Merkel will open an international peace forum in Paris with Macron and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nLike other leaders visiting national cemeteries dotted around northern France, Trump will visit two burial sites that highlight how the United States came of age as a military power after it joined the war in 1917 and set it up to become a dominating force for the next century.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

The ministry will review the amendments before forwarding them to the Cabinet, which will return it to the legislature for a version that will then be voted on. The process may be completed before the end of the year.\n\nThe proposed changes would not allow recreational use of the drugs. The action was taken because of growing interest in the use of marijuana and its components to treat some medical conditions. Public hearings showed overwhelming support for the measures.\n\n\"If we let it be used recreationally, our society is not ready yet, so I want to do this first step first \u2014 the issue of making medicine,\" said Somchai Sawangkarn, a lawmaker who proposed the amendments. \"From allowing the making of medicine, maybe in six months or a year's time, if society is ready, it could become a food supplement. ... And eventually that could lead us to its recreational use.\"\n\nSomchai said the legislature would consider introducing further amendments to address concerns such as fears that marijuana would be too accessible to children or reservations that only some large private companies would potentially be granted licenses to produce medicine derived from the plant.\n\nThe legislature says recent studies have shown that marijuana extract has medicinal benefits, which has prompted \"many countries around the world to ease their laws by enacting legal amendments to allow their citizens to legally use kratom and marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes.\" It adds that despite being classified as an illegal drug, many patients have used marijuana to treat their diseases.\n\nSomchai told The Associated Press that pushing through the amendments was difficult because they affected the interests of big pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\"I've been working on legislation in parliament for the past 12 years, and I have to admit that this has been one of the toughest ones to pass because it affects the benefits of large transnational pharmaceutical companies as they sell chemotherapy, morphine, and so on, and we want to introduce something really cheap as an alternative,\" he said.", "Interested in Jamal Khashoggi?

The tremor was centered some 120 kilometers (74 miles) off Jan Mayen at a depth of approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), NORSAR said.\n\nNorway's news agency NTB said there were 18 people on the island \u2014 military and meteorological institute staff \u2014 who were woken by the quake.

Such acts have grown increasingly rare in recent years amid a smothering security crackdown by the Chinese authorities.\n\nMany Tibetans use just one name.\n\nChina insists Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were essentially independent for most of that time. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 amid an abortive uprising against China's heavy-handed rule imposed after the People's Liberation Army's battled its way into the Himalayan region nine years earlier.\n\nThe self-immolations by Tibetans monks, nuns and laypeople aim to highlight harsh government regulations and the oppression of Tibet's Buddhist culture, as well as appeal for the return of the Dalai Lama.\n\nThe region is closed to foreign media, making it virtually impossible to confirm reported self-immolations.

But the slump is sharper than expected, prompting expectations regulators might try to prop up sales with tax cuts or other incentives.\n\nThe downturn comes at an awkward time for global and Chinese automakers that are spending heavily to meet government targets to develop and sell electric models.\n\nIt adds to challenges for communist leaders as they try to shore up cooling economic growth and fight a tariff war with President Donald Trump over Beijing's campaign for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other technology industries.\n\nSales for the 10 months through October fell 1 percent from a year earlier to 19.3 million vehicles. That was well below forecasts of growth in mid-single digits after last year's anemic 1.4 percent expansion.\n\nThe slowdown is a \"normal correction\" following years of rising auto ownership levels, said Zhang Xin, an independent industry analyst.\n\n\"The bad overall environment has played the biggest role,\" including a cooling economy and restrictions imposed by Chinese cities on car ownership to curb congestions and smog, said Zhang.\n\nIf economic conditions sour, \"people will cut expenses by not buying a car,\" he said.\n\nChina is a top market for General Motors Co., Volkswagen AG and other industry majors that look to increasingly prosperous Chinese customers to drive revenue growth. They are spending billions of dollars to develop models to appeal to local tastes.\n\nThey face rising competition from young but ambitious Chinese rivals including electric brand BYD Auto, Geely Auto and SUV maker Great Wall Motor.\n\nTotal vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, shrank 11.7 percent in October to 2.4 million. For the year to date, they were off 0.1 percent at 22.9 million.\n\nOctober's decline was worse than September's 12 percent contraction.\n\nVW, which vies with GM for the status of China's most popular brand, said sales declined 9.8 percent to 274,000. Sales for the first 10 months of the year were up 0.4 percent at 2.5 million.\n\nNissan Motor Co. said October sales shrank 5.5 percent to 142,078 vehicles.\n\nCAAM gave no details of October purchases of SUVs, the industry's profit engine, but said year-to-date sales growth slowed to 1.6 percent from September's 3.9 percent.\n\nSales of gasoline-electric hybrid and pure-electric vehicles rose 51 percent to 138,000. For the first 10 months of the year, purchases rose 75.6 percent to 860,000.\n\nAutomakers are rolling out dozens of electrics but depend on gasoline-powered models for their profits.\n\nChinese domestic brands that had been expanding their market share with lower-cost SUVs and sedans suffered an even bigger decline in October.\n\nSales contracted by 18 percent from a year earlier to 852,000 vehicles. Sales of Chinese-brand SUVs sank 21.8 percent to 498,000.\n\nYear-to-date sales were off 3.6 percent at just under 8.1 million.

He had sought to enter as a visitor.\n\nMallet's visa rejection in October came shortly after he hosted a talk at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club by the head of a now-banned political party advocating the financial hub's independence from China.\n\nThat brought heated criticism from the territory's pro-China elites, some of whom called for the journalists' organization to be kicked out of its clubhouse in the central financial district.\n\nHong Kong's immigration authority has given no explanation for his expulsion and on Friday responded with a statement saying it would \"act in accordance with the laws and policies and decide whether the entry will be allowed or refused after careful consideration of the circumstances of each case.\"\n\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Hong Kong had the right to decide who could enter the territory.\n\n\"As you know, when people travel around the world, it is normal for every country to permit or reject a visitor's entry according to its law governing the administration of entry and exit,\" Hua said at a daily news briefing.\n\nDespite Mallet's rejection, Hong Kong on Friday permitted dissident writer Ma Jian to enter to attend a literary festival, even after an arts venue in the city had canceled his appearance.\n\nSoon after his arrival, festival organizers tweeted that the venue had reversed its position and would allow him to speak.\n\nMa, whose novels frequently satirize China's Communist leaders, told reporters at the Hong Kong airport that he had experienced nothing unusual while passing through passport control.\n\n\"The lecture will definitely happen. If there is a single Hong Kong person who is willing to listen, or a single reader who contacts me, I will be there,\" Ma said.\n\nMa speculated there was a \"black hand\" behind the authorities controlling the conditions under which he could appear, but vowed to \"communicate with readers over these days in Hong Kong however possible.\"\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said that in barring Mallet's entry, the government was \"severely violating the freedoms of press and speech, and further damaging the reputation and status of Hong Kong as an international city,\" according to the newspaper South China Morning Post.\n\nPro-democracy legislators on the city council also expressed worries over the incident, saying the erosion of basic legal rights could harm Hong Kong's ability to attract foreign investment.\n\nThe denial of a visa to Mallet had been widely condemned by journalists, human rights and civic society groups in Hong Kong, who saw it as a sign of China's growing encroachment on freedom of speech in the Asian financial hub.\n\nConcerns have also been raised by the apparent kidnappings and prosecutions in China of independent booksellers and legal cases brought against pro-democracy legislators and organizers of large-scale anti-government protests in 2014.\n\nHong Kong was promised semi-autonomy for 50 years as part of its 1997 handover from British rule, allowing it to retain its limited democracy and rights to assembly and free speech that are denied on the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents' Club dates back more than 75 years to when Hong Kong was a British colony.\n\nAt the Aug. 14 talk at the FCC, Mallet introduced Hong Kong National Party leader Andy Chan by acknowledging official criticism while citing the territory's tolerance for dissent.", "The outspoken governor of Japan's Okinawa island said Friday he will meet with American officials next week to convey the frustration of residents from hosting U.S. military bases on the southern island.\n\nDenny Tamaki said he will meet with officials in Washington and speak at New York University during his Nov. 11-16 trip.\n\n\"I hope to speak directly to American citizens and convey my views representing Okinawa and have a discussion about democracy,\" Tamaki told a packed news conference in Tokyo.\n\nTamaki took office Oct. 4 after campaigning for the closure of a disputed U.S. base on Okinawa and a reduction of the American military presence there. He said he wanted to visit the U.S. soon after his election so that the voices of voters would be heard.\n\nTamaki, the first person with an American parent to lead Okinawa, said his roots make him a perfect figure to relay the message to the U.S. public.\n\nAt the center of contention is a decades-old plan to move a Marine Corps air station from densely populated Futenma in the southern part of the island to less-crowded Henoko on the east coast.\n\nMany Okinawans say the presence of so many U.S. troops on the island is burdensome and they want the Futenma base moved off the island entirely.\n\nTamaki, during an earlier visit to Tokyo in mid-October, urged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other top officials to stop the Henoko plan and reduce Okinawa's burden. Despite his request and Okinawans' opposition, Abe's government last week resumed construction work at the disputed site at Henoko.\n\nThe construction reignited anger on the island, and Tamaki said he is determined to block its completion.\n\n\"Okinawa is working hard toward peace building, and based on that perspective we call on the Japanese government and the United States government to look at ways to reduce the burden of the bases and build peace. We call for deepening of their relationship and effort to achieve those goals,\" Tamaki said.\n\nHe said Japan's central government should negotiate with the U.S. in Okinawa's interest. \"As the central government is not delivering Okinawans' voice to the U.S. side, it is now my responsibility to convey that directly to the Americans and they have a responsibility to listen to us,\" Tamaki said.\n\nHe has said he supports the Japan-U.S. security alliance, but that Okinawa should not be the only place forced to sacrifice.\n\nTamaki has also called for a review of the Status of Forces Agreement that gives privileges to the U.S. military, including some immunity from Japanese criminal investigation. Some experts say inequality under the agreement is greater in Japan than in nations that host U.S. forces in Europe.\n\nThe relocation of Futenma air station was planned after the 1995 rape of a schoolgirl in which three U.S. servicemen were convicted. The case ignited simmering Okinawan opposition to the U.S. bases.\n\nAbout half of the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan under the security pact and most of their key facilities are on Okinawa. Residents have long complained about base-related noise, pollution and crime.\n\nTamaki, the son of an American serviceman whom he has never seen, said he was bullied as a child because of his lighter skin color and reddish hair. That experience later gave him respect for diversity and his identity, he said.\n\nComing from a single-parent family that struggled to make ends meet, he is now a governor and is seen as a symbol of \"Okinawan dream,\" he said, holding up the guestbook at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan which he signed with the message \"Dreams come true!\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "Interested in Australia?

Hundreds of people watched from behind barricades as police tried to apprehend the attacker.\n\nPolice said the man got out of a pickup truck, which then caught fire, and attacked three bystanders with a knife. He also attempted to attack police who arrived on the scene before being shot in the chest by an officer.\n\nThe suspect died later at a hospital. One of the victims also died, while the two others were hospitalized.\n\nPolice said the attacker's vehicle contained several barbecue gas cylinders in the back. A bomb squad rendered them safe without any exploding.\n\nVictoria state police Commissioner Graham Ashton said the suspect, who was originally from Somalia, was known to police and the incident was being treated as terrorism.\n\n\"From what we know of that individual we are treating this as a terrorism incident,\" Ashton told reporters, adding that the police counterterrorism command was working on the case, as well as homicide detectives.\n\n\"He's known to police mainly in respect to relatives that he has which certainly are persons of interest to us, and he's someone that accordingly is known to both Victorian police and the Federal intelligence authorities,\" he said. He did not elaborate.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released through its Aamaq media arm, but provided no evidence. It said the man was an Islamic State fighter and had responded to IS calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIS, which has suffered heavy battlefield setbacks in the past year, often claims attacks without any clear connection.\n\nFriday's attack occurred on the eve of a busy weekend in Melbourne, with a major horse race scheduled for Saturday and a national league soccer match the following day.

Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group.\n\nHowever, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman's actions fell \"within the accepted definition of terrorism.\"\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Samy Magdy in Cairo contributed to this report.", "A chemical leak that sickened 52 people this week has nearly been cleaned up at a wharf in eastern China, authorities said Friday.\n\nInvestigators said around 7 tons of the common additive C9 leaked while workers were loading barrels onto a ship last Sunday in Fujian province.\n\nThe province's Department of Environmental Protection said the victims displayed symptoms including dizziness, nausea, vomiting and throat discomfort.

It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\"Out here, nobody knows where I am, and I'm believed to be away on a trip,\" he wrote in August 1922. \"Here are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I'm happy to be able to get away from everything.\"\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein's life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world's largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany's future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\"This letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein's mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\" said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \"The relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\"\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\"I'm doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I'm very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I'm really a free man,\" he wrote. \"You see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\"\n\nAddressing his sister's concerns, Einstein writes: \"Don't worry about me, I myself don't worry either, even if it's not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\"\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe'ev Rosenkranz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn't the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau's killing and the \"internal exile\" he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\"Einstein's initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\" he said. \"The letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister's concerns. Another is that he didn't like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\"\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein's groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \"Jewish Physics.\"\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "The leaders of Vietnam and Cuba on Friday pledged to deepen relations between two of the world's few remaining communist countries.\n\nPresident Nguyen Phu Trong and his Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel witnessed the signing of trade and finance agreements after an hourlong talk behind closed doors in Hanoi.\n\nSpeaking at a joint news conference, Trong, who is also the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party, said \"Vietnam and Cuba will continue close and comprehensive cooperation ... and deepen exemplary fraternal relations.\"\n\nTrong said he and the Cuban president discussed measures to deepen ties in defense, security and diplomacy and enhance cooperation in agriculture, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical sector, medicine, education, science and people-to-people exchanges.\n\nDiaz-Canel said all the Cubans had great admiration for Vietnam's struggles for independence and that his and Trong's visit to Cuba in March will contribute to strengthening the countries' relations.\n\n\"We also expressed our desire to continue to share experiences of building socialism in each country,\" Diaz-Canel said.\n\nHe thanked Vietnam for its support in efforts to lift the U.S economic embargo on the island country.

He says the Taliban suffered \"heavy casualties\" but didn't elaborate.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for that attack.\n\nIn western Farah province, the Taliban targeted police forces in the provincial capital, Farah city, late on Thursday.

Starting next year, seniors in many states will be able to get additional services such as help with chores and respite for caregivers through private Medicare Advantage insurance plans.\n\nThere's a growing recognition that such practical help can have a meaningful impact on patients' well-being \u2014 and reduce some costs for taxpayers. A couple of hundred dollars to install grab bars in the shower can prevent a fall leading to a broken hip, a life-changing injury.\n\nThat may also help elderly people stay in their homes longer.\n\nThe newly covered services are similar to what people might need if they required long-term care, said Howard Gleckman, a senior researcher at the nonpartisan Urban Institute think tank.\n\n\"It begins to break down the wall between long-term care and Medicare, which, with very few exceptions, has never paid for long-term care,\" Gleckman said.\n\nChange is starting slowly. Policymakers have yet to figure out how to bring similar benefits to traditional Medicare, still the choice of 2 out of 3 seniors.\n\nThe new services will be offered by some Medicare Advantage plans in more than 20 states next year, and that's expected to grow over time.\n\nThere has to be a health-related reason to qualify, and costs will vary among plans. In some plans, there's no added cost. But limits do apply. For example, a plan may cover one day per week at an adult day care center.\n\nNearly 23 million Medicare beneficiaries, or more than 1 in 3, are expected to be covered by a Medicare Advantage plan next year. The private plans generally offer lower out-of-pocket costs in exchange for limits on choice of doctors and hospitals and other restrictions such as prior authorization for services. It's a growing business for insurers.\n\nMedicare Advantage open enrollment for 2019 ends Dec. 7. But it's not easy to use Medicare's online plan finder to search for plans with expanded benefits, so beneficiaries and their families will have to rely on promotional materials that insurers mail during open enrollment.\n\nFor years, Medicare has permitted private plans to offer supplemental benefits not covered by the traditional program. Think free gym memberships, transportation to medical appointments or home-delivered meals following a hospitalization.\n\nThe new benefits take that to a higher level, with Medicare's blessing.\n\n\"It is a big concept, in the sense that it is officially encouraging plans to get across the line into the many, many things that affect the health and well-being of beneficiaries,\" said Marc Russo, president of insurer Anthem's Medicare business. \"I, for one, who have been in and around Medicare for decades, believe it pays.\"\n\nInsurers under Anthem's corporate umbrella are offering different packages in 12 of 21 states where they operate Medicare plans. They can include alternative medicine, like acupuncture, or adult day care center visits or a personal helper at home.\n\nOther major insurers like UnitedHealthcare and Humana are participating. It's a calculated gamble for insurers, who still have to make a profit.\n\nAnd the limited new benefits are no substitute for full long-term care coverage, which many people need for at least part of their lives and remains prohibitively expensive. Seniors trying to get long-term care through Medicaid, the program for low-income people, must spend down their life savings.\n\n\"Medicare policy has not kept up with the times,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the authors of bipartisan legislation seen as a catalyst for expanded services through Medicare Advantage.\n\nWyden said he's working to bring similar options to traditional Medicare.\n\n\"Clearly this is going to have to be an effort that is going to have to be built out,\" he added.\n\nThe changes represent a rare consensus at a time when health care issues are among the most politically divisive. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as Seema Verma, the Trump administration's Medicare chief, are pulling in the same direction.\n\nThe idea of broader services through Medicare Advantage was embodied in a bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill to improve care for chronically ill seniors. The Trump administration issued regulations in the spring trying to accelerate the changes.\n\nAccording to Medicare, 12 insurers will be offering expanded supplemental benefits next year through 160 plans in 20 states. In four other states and Puerto Rico, such benefits may be available to seniors with certain health conditions.\n\n\"The guidance came out fairly late in the annual planning process, and that's one reason why some of these benefits may start out small,\" said Steve Warner, head of Medicare Advantage program development for UnitedHealthcare.\n\nMedicare estimates that some 780,000 beneficiaries will have access to the new benefits next year. In-home helpers and support for caregivers are the most popular.\n\nConsumer advocates recommend that seniors carefully weigh whether Medicare Advantage is best for them. If they don't like it, they can go back to traditional Medicare, but those with a pre-existing condition may not be able to buy a Medigap policy to help cover out-of-pocket costs. They can also switch to another Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nMedicare doesn't pay the insurers more for offering added benefits. Under a complex formula, they're primarily financed out of the difference between bids submitted by insurers and Medicare's maximum payment to plans. If the companies bid below Medicare's rate, they can return some of that to beneficiaries in the form of added benefits.", "Getting President Donald Trump's tax returns is high on the list of Democratic priorities now that they have won the House.\n\nBy law, the leaders of tax-writing committees in the House and Senate can obtain tax returns and related information from the Internal Revenue Service. Democrats will control the House panel next year.\n\nYet there's no guarantee that the Trump administration will provide the president's returns. That sets up the possibility of a legal battle over the request that could take years to resolve.\n\nTrump broke with political tradition in 2016 by refusing to release his income tax filings. He says he won't release them because he's under audit, and he claimed at a press conference this week that the filings are too complex for people to understand.\n\nThe Democrats tried and failed several times to obtain Trump's returns as the minority party in Congress. Now, having gained some control, they see them within their grasp.\n\nEyes are on Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, who is now the senior Democrat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee and will become its chairman in January.\n\nWhen asked Wednesday whether the committee under his control would ask for the documents, Neal said, \"Yes, I think we will.\"\n\nIf the Trump administration refuses and mounts a legal challenge, Neal said, \"Then I assume that there would be a court case that would go on for a period of time.\"\n\nA legal fight could potentially even stretch beyond the 2020 presidential election, suggested Andy Grewal, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law.\n\nGrewal has maintained that a request for Trump's returns, if made for \"purely political purposes,\" may exceed the limits of Congress' authority.\n\nStarting with the 2016 campaign, Trump broke with political tradition by repeatedly refusing to release his income tax filings. Those filings are deemed sacredly secret for citizens, but traditionally not for presidents. Trump has said he hasn't released them because his taxes are under audit by the IRS \u2014 even though experts and IRS officials say such audits don't bar taxpayers from releasing their returns.\n\nAsked about releasing his filings, Trump reaffirmed that justification during a post-election news conference Wednesday. \"They're under audit. They have been for a long time,\" the president said. \"They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them.\"\n\nGiving a slight opening, Trump said that if the audit was completed, \"I would have an open mind to it. I would say that.\" But, he added, \"Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit.\"\n\nIn 2017, more than a million people signed a petition to the White House urging Trump to make the returns public.\n\nQuestions loom: Was the swaggering longtime businessman and real estate mogul really worth $10 billion when he entered the White House, as he has claimed? Are there conflicts of interest lurking? How has his global panoply of properties and other assets been valued for taxation purposes? What are the sources of his income and to whom might he be beholden as a result? Does Trump stand to gain personally from the sweeping Republican tax law enacted late last year, which he championed, and, if so, how specifically?\n\nAmong the sought-after details: Trump's charitable giving, the type of deductions he claimed, how much he earned from his assets and what strategies he deployed to reduce his tax bill.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi declined during a press conference Wednesday to specifically address the question of Trump's returns, saying only that Congress has \"a constitutional responsibility to have oversight\" and citing examples such as the government's environmental policy that would be ripe for Congress to investigate.\n\nThe high interest \u2014 Democrats would say the urgency \u2014 in lifting the veil on Trump's taxes ramped up last month when The New York Times published an extensive report suggesting that the Trump family cheated the IRS for decades, undervaluing reported assets and using dubious tax maneuvers and outright fraud in some cases.\n\nA lawyer for Trump disputed the Times' findings of possible tax fraud or evasion and said that parts of the report were \"extremely inaccurate.\" The newspaper said its report was based on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents, including confidential tax returns from Trump's father and his companies.\n\nThat could spur the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee to ask for Trump's returns going back many years.\n\nBy law, the chairmen of the House panel, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation can make a written request for any tax returns to the Treasury Secretary, who oversees the IRS. The law says the Treasury chief \"shall furnish\" the requested information to the members of the committee for them to examine behind closed doors.\n\nThe IRS, with custody of Trump's returns, has been headed since Oct. 1 by a commissioner who worked as a private tax attorney for nearly four decades representing individuals and companies in cases before the agency. During the 2016 campaign, the commissioner, Charles Rettig, defended Trump's refusal to release his filings. He promised at his Senate confirmation hearing to uphold the IRS' political independence from the White House.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \"will review any request with the Treasury general counsel for legality,\" the department said in a statement Thursday.\n\nTrump's attorney Rudy Giuliani has said the Democrats could have a hard time proving their demand was intended for pursuing legitimate congressional oversight, not a political scavenger hunt.\n\nIf the administration refuses to hand over the returns, the Democrat-led committee might punch back with subpoenas, move to hold officials in contempt of Congress or sue the administration. There's no roadmap or historical precedent for the situation.\n\nSome observers anticipate that the Trump Justice Department would file a lawsuit against the House to block release of the returns. In that case, the administration might try to prove that the Democrats' demand was politically motivated, as Giuliani indicated.\n\nThe University of Iowa's Grewal is among the experts who believe the administration may seek to make that case.\n\nBut Joe Thorndike, director of the tax history project at publisher Tax Analysts, says he doubts that argument could succeed. \"It's not unreasonable for a member of Congress to be concerned about the president's tax returns,\" he said.\n\nGeorge Yin, a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia who formerly was chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, asserts that Congress has the clear right to obtain and release a president's tax returns to the public without his or her consent \u2014 provided the disclosure would be in the public interest.\n\nNot so fast, says Ken Kies, another former chief of staff for the joint tax panel, who's now a tax lobbyist. \"I'd be really uncomfortable about that,\" he said.\n\nThe federal tax code authorizes the lawmakers who obtain tax returns to file a detailed report on them to the full U.S. House, which essentially would put the information into the public domain. But lawmakers and committee staff could be subject to criminal penalties, including prison sentences, for unauthorized disclosure of tax material.\n\n\"I would never take possession of those tax returns if I were (Neal),\" said Janice Mays, a former chief counsel and staff director for the Ways and Means Committee who is managing director of tax policy services at consulting firm PwC. \"I would visit the IRS and inspect them there.\"", "About 900 Central American migrants headed out of Mexico City on Friday to embark on the longest and most dangerous leg of their journey to the U.S. border, while thousands more were waiting one more day at a massive improvised shelter.\n\nThe group that got a head start bundled their few possessions and started off, taking a subway to the north part of the city and then hiking down an expressway with a police escort.\n\nFor many, it was the first time they had ever been in a metro system, and they had little knowledge of the city or the 1,740 mile (2,800 kilometer) route to Tijuana that lay ahead of them.\n\nCarlos Castanaza, a 29-year-old plumber from Guatemala City, wrapped himself from head to toe in a blanket against the cold and asked bystanders where the first toll booth was. When told it was in a town about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away, he carefully wrote the name of the town on his hand with a pen to remember where he was going.\n\nDeported for driving without a license after a decade working in Connecticut, Castanaza was desperate to get back to his two U.S.-born children. \"I've been wanting to get back for more than a year, but I couldn't until the caravan came through,\" said Castanaza. \"That's why I joined the caravan.\"\n\nThe advanced group hoped to reach the north-central city of Queretaro, about 105 miles (170 kilometers) to the northwest, by nightfall.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 4,000 migrants milled around the massive shelter improvised at a Mexico City sports complex, impatient to leave.\n\nNinety percent of the remaining migrants will depart the stadium early Saturday on their long trek to Tijuana, first taking the subway to the northern exit from Mexico's capital, according to Nashieli Ramirez, director of Mexico's Human Rights Commission.\n\nFrom there, they will pass through the Mexican cities of Queretaro, Guadalajara, Culiacan and Hermosillo on their way to the U.S. border, Ramirez said, adding that 400 Mexicans had chosen to stay in Mexico City.\n\nThe governor of Queretaro state, Francisco Dominguez, said the migrants would stay at Corregidora stadium in the state's capital and that authorities were ready to host 4,000 people.\n\nMeanwhile, migrants in the stadium in southern Mexico City were getting impatient.\n\n\"Let's go, let's go!\" shouted Eddy Rivera, 37, a rail-thin migrant from Honduras who said he couldn't take staying in the camp any longer. \"We are all sick, from the humidity and the cold,\" said Rivera, who left behind four children and a wife in Honduras. \"We have to get going, we have to get to Tijuana.\"\n\nThough he was unsure how an unskilled farmworker like himself would be allowed in the United States, he had a simple dream: earn enough money to build a little house for his family back in Puerto Cortes, Honduras.\n\nThousands of migrants have spent the past few days resting, receiving medical attention and debating how to proceed with their arduous trek through Central America and Mexico which began in mid-October. On Thursday, caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border, saying the trek would be too hard and dangerous for walking and hitchhiking.\n\nCaravan coordinator Milton Benitez said officials had offered them buses for women and children but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. By Friday, the migrants said they were so angry at the U.N.'s lack of help that they no longer wanted U.N. observers with the caravan.\n\nThe United Nations on Friday denied the offer, releasing a statement saying its agencies \"are unable to provide the transportation demanded by some members of the caravan.\"\n\nThe migrants made a big point of sticking together, their only form of self-protection.\n\nFelix Rodriguez, 35, of Choluteca, Honduras had been at the Mexico City sports complex for more than a week.\n\n\"We all want to get moving,\" he said. But he was waiting for the main group to leave Saturday, noting \"it is better to leave in a group, because leaving in small bunches is dangerous.\"\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, but the area around the Mexican border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo is so rife with drug gangs that the migrants consider it too dangerous to risk.\n\nA previous caravan in the spring opted for the longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\n\"California is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\" border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status. On Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nBut many want to continue on toward the United States.\n\nAuthorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.", "Just an hour's drive from one of South America's most populous cities, a sprawling wetland of bright green marshes and dark lagoons stretches far into the horizon.\n\nThe until-now little-known area, home to a wide range of birds, fish and other wildlife, has become Argentina's newest national park in a victory for nature preservation at a time when the country is facing an economic crisis and governments worldwide are cutting back funding for parks and environmental programs.\n\nConservationists say creation of the Ciervo de los Pantanos (Marsh Deer) National Park out of two nature preserves will increase resources to protect the more than 5,500 hectares (20 square miles) from real estate development and other threats while creating an open-air classroom for students in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area.\n\n\"The main factor here is environmental education ... because every school from (greater) Buenos Aires, where 14 million people live, will come here,\" said Jeronimo Valle, the park's director.\n\n\"It's important to have a direct contact with these ecosystems so that we stop seeing them as unfertile ... lands, and instead see them for what they are: lands that must be preserved.\"\n\nA group of students who arrived from the outskirts of the capital shared a picnic and played a pickup game of soccer on a meadow before trekking along the park's trails.\n\nFifteen-year-old Martina Suarez said the park was a reminder of what needs to be saved from development.\n\n\"Our natural resources will end if we continue on this path because urbanization is taking over our flora and fauna,\" she said. \"If it wasn't for this,\" she said gesturing to the lush vegetation surrounding her, \"we wouldn't be here.\"\n\nAt about 40 miles (70 kilometers) from Buenos Aires, it's the closest national park to the Argentine capital. The entrance is just off the Pan-American Highway and a railway cuts through the park. But the low, omnipresent hum of cars and even train horns seems distant, often drowned out by the constant calling of birds.\n\n\"We just heard a southern screamer,\" park ranger Agustin Mezzabotta said during a recent trek after crossing a long wooden footbridge over swamps to reach a lagoon.\n\nThis \"is a space where people can connect with nature, connect with their five senses, observe, smell the grass, hear the birds,\" he said.\n\nVisitors might not be blown away by monumental glaciers, waterfalls or even the large animals of other Argentine parks. But the wetlands are ideal for birdwatchers and visitors can catch glimpses of animals such as wildcats and foxes.\n\nThe park is named for the marsh deer, a vulnerable species found in a few other parts of South America that is known for its webbed hooves that allow it to cross swamps smoothly where other animals would easily sink.\n\n\"I think it's really important that in these places that have threatened species, that people can actually visit them because you know people tend to think: 'You know, these things are way out in the wilderness ... that I'll never see,\" said Clinton Jenkins, a professor at the Institute for Ecological Research in Sao Paulo Brazil.\n\n\"So it's important to have parks that are accessible to the public, such as this one in Argentina as it will hopefully be very well visited.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.", "Global stocks and the price of oil fell Friday after the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested it will keep raising interest rates, tightening the supply of money that has supported markets in recent years.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: Germany's DAX lost 0.7 percent to 11,442 and France's CAC 40 lost 1.1 percent to 5,077.

Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who was also jailed during the Marcos dictatorship, said it was up to voters in next year's May 13 local elections, where Marcos is a candidate, if they want \"somebody who has a bad name representing them, that's your call.\"\n\nImelda Marcos' husband was ousted by an army-backed \"people power\" revolt in 1986. He died in self-exile in Hawaii in 1989 but his widow and children returned to the Philippines. Most have been elected to public offices in an impressive political comeback.\n\nGovernment prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters that Marcos and her husband opened and managed Swiss foundations in violation of the Philippine Constitution, using aliases in a bid to hide stolen funds. The Marcoses have been accused of plundering the government's coffers amid crushing poverty. They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.\n\nImelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, said last year the Marcos family had indicated a willingness to return a still-unspecified amount of money and \"a few gold bars\" to help ease budget deficits. He indicated the family still denied that the assets had been stolen as alleged by political opponents.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by decree. His family is said to have amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.\n\nA Hawaii court found Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.\n\nDuterte has acknowledged that Imee Marcos, the couple's daughter and a provincial governor, backed his presidential candidacy.", "A Japanese broadcaster canceled a live TV appearance of the Korean band BTS after a photo went viral of a band member wearing a T-shirt showing an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea's liberation from Japan after World War II.\n\nJapanese social media was filled with chatter over the photo of Jimin wearing the shirt with an image of a mushroom cloud with the English words \"patriotism\" and \"Korea.\"\n\nTV Asahi said it had talked with the band's recording company to try to learn why he wore the T-shirt. The broadcaster's statement also apologized to viewers who had looked forward to the band's appearance, which had been scheduled for Friday.\n\nCompany spokesman Shinya Matsuki declined further comment.\n\nUniversal Music said it will continue to support BTS but confirmed their appearance on the live music show \"Music Station\" was canceled.\n\nSouth Korean K-pop and movie stars are extremely popular in Japan, sometimes in stark contrast to the controversy and hostility than can mark other aspects of the two nation's ties due to Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula in the early 20th century until the end of World War II.\n\nSome Japanese fans of the band expressed disgust on that their show was canceled over a T-shirt.\n\nThe seven-member BTS has collaborated with Japanese American DJ and musical artist Steve Aoki and has reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "A suspected Islamic militant's frenzied attack on a police station in the Indonesian capital was thwarted by an officer who shot the man in the hand, police said Friday.\n\nJakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono said the knife and machete-wielding man repeatedly shouted \"God is Great\" as he attacked officers, chasing some through the building and smashing a glass door.\n\nOne officer suffered light injuries to his arm from a machete blow and another shot the attacker's hand, forcing him to drop the weapon.\n\nPolice are a frequent target of attacks by militants in Muslim-majority Indonesia, who see them as representing the power of the secular government that they want replaced by an Islamic state.\n\nYuwono said the 31-year-old man, identified as Rohandi, arrived at the police station in Jakarta's north on a motorbike after midnight and tried to attack at least half a dozen officers by throwing his knife and striking out with the machete.\n\nHe said the attacker's house has been searched and counter-terrorism police are involved in the investigation.\n\nIn May, two weeks after suicide bombings that used children as weapons, Indonesia's parliament unanimously approved a tougher anti-terrorism law.\n\nThe suicide bombings at churches and a police station in Surabaya killed 26 people, including 13 members of the families that carried them out. The key perpetrator was leader of the Surabaya cell of an Indonesian militant network that professes loyalty to the Islamic State group.", "The British are coming again \u2014 this time in friendship.\n\nA memorial honoring fallen soldiers from the U.S. and Britain is being dedicated this month, and the venue couldn't be more ironic: Boston's historic Old North Church, where the American Revolution pitting rebellious colonists against English troops basically began.\n\n\"It's the one place in Boston where you wouldn't expect this to happen,\" said Simon Boyd, a British-born real estate executive and Royal Air Force veteran leading the initiative.\n\nOn April 18, 1775, two lanterns were displayed from the steeple of the church \u2014 a prearranged signal from Paul Revere that the British were heading to Lexington and Concord by sea across the Charles River rather than by land. That event, immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem, \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" ignited the war of independence from Britain.\n\nBut Old North Church, Boston's oldest surviving house of worship and the city's most-visited historical site, since has become a symbol of Anglo-American affection.\n\nEvery year on the Sunday closest to Nov. 11 \u2014 the date World War I ended in 1918 \u2014 the church built in 1723 has held a special remembrance service for Britons living in or near Boston, complete with bagpipes and poppies. This year's commemoration will fall precisely on the 100th anniversary of the bloody Great War's end.\n\nSince 2005, Old North Church also has hosted a touching tribute to American troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the courtyard of the church, jingling like wind chimes, hang nearly 7,000 blank military dog tags \u2014 one set of tags for every U.S. life lost.\n\nThe new memorial, a bronze wreath, will honor British and other Commonwealth forces who perished alongside U.S. forces in both campaigns. And a bronze plaque will explain the meaning of the dog tags to the hundreds of thousands of visitors who pause to pay homage each year while walking Boston's Freedom Trail \u2014 a 2.5-mile (4-kilometer) route that takes visitors past the church, Revere's house and other historic landmarks.\n\n\"We once were enemies, but we've long since gotten over that,\" said the Rev. Stephen Ayres, vicar of Old North Church. \"We're now a go-to church for the British community in Boston. That's part of the improbability and wonder of Old North.\"\n\nBruce Brooksbank, the Iraq-Afghanistan memorial's volunteer caretaker, remembers how soldiers in the 1960s and '70s were disrespected when they returned home from Vietnam.\n\n\"This is my own little chance to make amends,\" he said.\n\nFittingly, two top soldiers from both countries will join forces on Nov. 17 to unveil the wreath and plaque, both paid for by The Soldiers Fund, a Boston-based nonprofit that supports U.S. and British soldiers, veterans and their families.\n\nRetired Gen. Martin Dempsey, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under President Barack Obama who now oversees USA Basketball, and retired Gen. Sir Mike Jackson, who held the highest post in the British Army from 2003-2006 and now is president of Britain's Army Benevolent Fund, will preside over the unveiling. Both will speak at a Soldiers Fund dinner in Boston that evening.\n\nThere's another tie that binds, said Boyd, who chairs the board of the Soldiers Fund: In 1917, Massachusetts sent one of the largest U.S. regiments to fight in WWI, naively dubbed \"the war to end all wars.\"\n\n\"We're commemorating British and American lives lost, at a church where Paul Revere said with his lanterns that the British were coming,\" he said. \"It's really all kind of come full circle.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Bill Kole on Twitter at https://twitter.com/billkole.", "Already have an account? sign in\n\nCreate an ABC Account to get the most of your ABC experience\n\nSign Out\n\nAre you sure you want to sign out?\n\nBy signing out, you will not be able to resume watching content where you left off, enjoy cross-device viewing experience, or save your favorites to your My List.\n\nsign out", "Florida voters decided to phase out greyhound racing in the state by 2021, meaning thousands of dogs will soon need new homes.\n\nThe state voted 69 to 31 percent Tuesday to pass Amendment 13, which bans the sport beginning on Jan. 1, 2021. It is an overwhelming defeat for an industry already in decline, with 50 tracks closing nationally over the past 30 years because of shrinking crowds and accusations that dogs are mistreated.\n\nAdvocates for the ban say many of Florida's 8,000 racing dogs will now likely be adopted, as usually happens when they leave the sport, though some may be transferred to other states where the sport will remain legal.\n\nFlorida's 11 dog tracks constitute almost two-thirds of those remaining nationally. When they close, the sport may be too small to survive long term. Two tracks remain in West Virginia and one each in Alabama, Arkansas and Iowa. In Texas, three tracks rotate an annual meet.\n\nCarey Theil, executive director of Grey2K USA, one of the groups pushing for a nationwide ban, called the margin \"astounding\" and said it was one of the largest ever nationally for any animal rights measure. Amendment 13 even got majorities in 10 of the 11 counties where racing is held \u2014 in five of those, support exceeded 70 percent.\n\n\"It's a powerful endorsement of our humane values, and a repudiation of an industry that is cruel and inhumane,\" Theil said Wednesday. He said the state should provide resources for any workers who lose jobs because of the ban, including retraining.\n\nJim Gartland, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, said he was surprised by the amendment's passage \u2014 it needed 60 percent, under Florida law. He said hundreds of greyhound breeders and their employees nationally will be hurt by the Florida decision, and accused the amendment's backers of \"lying\" and giving \"misleading facts and figures\" when they said dogs are abused. State records show that, on average, two of the state's racing dogs die of injury or illness weekly.\n\n\"It makes no sense that people who make their livelihoods from dogs would abuse them,\" Gartland said. Abused dogs are slow dogs, he said, and trainers make their living by producing winners. He said it is unclear how many Florida tracks will keep live racing through 2020 and how many will drop the sport sooner.\n\nJack Cory, spokesman for the Florida Greyhound Association, said tracks and trainers will go to the Legislature and, if necessary, to the courts to be compensated for the revenue they will lose.\n\nBackers spent more than $3 million getting the measure adopted \u2014 10 times the amount spent by racing supporters. Almost half the backers' funding came from a $1.5 million donation by the Doris Day Animal League, a national group founded by the 96-year-old actress.\n\nThe anti-racing movement had support from across the political spectrum, from animal rights groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nAmendment 13's opponents included the National Rifle Association's state affiliate, which thinks the measure's language saying \"the humane treatment of animals is a fundamental value\" of Floridians could be a backdoor way to eventually ban hunting and fishing. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument during the opponents' failed effort to remove the amendment from the ballot.\n\nFor some tracks, losing live racing might actually increase profits. Under current Florida law, greyhound tracks must offer live racing to operate poker rooms and accept wagers on simulcast horse racing from tracks across the country. Amendment 13 allows them to keep those side businesses without live racing, even if they drop it immediately.\n\nThe amount wagered on greyhound racing in Florida decreased from $1.5 billion in 1992, adjusted for inflation, to just over $200 million in 2017, state records show. After paying bettors, purses and taxes, five tracks reported losses on live greyhound racing last year and the then-12 tracks combined net revenue on live racing was $20 million. That's about a fifth their poker net.\n\nJim O'Brien, president and CEO of Melbourne Greyhound Park, said his small track near the Kennedy Space Center loses about $250,000 annually on live racing, but he feels loyalty to the trainers who run dogs there. So he said he wants to take a few days to decide whether to run the track's upcoming meet. The track made $5 million last year on poker.\n\n\"We are probably going to run, but we will see,\" he said.", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to require strict limits on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes, including age verification controls for online sales, in an effort to curtail their use among children and teenagers.\n\nFDA officials told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday the actions are expected to be announced as early as next week. The move is an attempt to curb what many are saying is an epidemic of underage vaping.\n\n\"What I can't tolerate is another year of this level of growth,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview Wednesday.\n\nThe new policy will apply to flavored cartridge-style vaping products like Juul that have become popular among youths, not the open tank-style systems sold in vape shops and mostly used by adults, officials said.\n\nNo retail outlets will be allowed to carry them unless it restricts minors from entering the store or creates an off-limits area.\n\nSince 2017, FDA officials had discussed e-cigarettes as a potential tool to wean adult smokers off cigarettes, but in September the FDA reversed course and warned the industry to address the problem of surging teenage e-cigarette use or risk having their flavored products pulled off the market.\n\nGottlieb said then that the agency did not predict an \"epidemic addiction\" among youth, mainly driven by flavored products.\n\nThe FDA's new restrictions were earlier reported by The Washington Post.\n\nAlso Thursday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration announced plans to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes as soon as next year, possibly making his state the first to prohibit such vaping products often marketed as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Wall Street Journal, http://www.wsj.com", "Transcript for The race to escape the flames\n\nwas purchased in 2016.

And ABC's will Carr is on the scene there in northern California. Reporter: Tonight, racing to escape the flames. High winds driving a massive, dangerous, out of control wildfire north of Sacramento. We do have numerous structures destroyed and we have several civilian injuries. Reporter: Winds gusting above 50 miles per hour exploding the fire into an 18,000 acre out of control inferno in just a few hours. Not only is the wind playing a role, but the fire is creating its own weather. Right now, the fire, unfortunately, is moving through the town of paradise. Reporter: KRCR reporter Meaghan Mackey shooting this video as she made her way through the flames. Definitely a lot of people very scared. People driving on both sides of the road, going up the wrong way. And at the same time, there are all these fire personnel trying to get through and get close to the flames.

She also reflects on early struggles in her marriage to Barack Obama as he began his political career and was often away. She writes that they met with a counselor \"a handful of times,\" and she came to realize that she was more \"in charge\" of her happiness than she had realized. \"This was my pivot point,\" Obama explains. \"My moment of self-arrest.\"\n\nObama writes that she assumed Trump was \"grandstanding\" when he announced his presidential run in 2015. She expresses disbelief over how so many women would choose a \"misogynist\" over Hillary Clinton, \"an exceptionally qualified female candidate.\" She remembers how her body \"buzzed with fury\" after seeing the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women.\n\nShe also accuses Trump of using body language to \"stalk\" Clinton during an election debate. She writes of Trump following Clinton around the stage, standing nearby and \"trying to diminish her presence.\"\n\nTrump's message, according to Obama, in words which appear in the book in darkened print: \"I can hurt you and get away with it.\"\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of \"Becoming,\" one of the most anticipated political books in recent memory. Obama is admired worldwide and has offered few extensive comments on her White House years. And memoirs by former first ladies, including Clinton and Laura Bush, are usually best-sellers.\n\nObama launches her promotional tour Tuesday not at a bookstore, but at Chicago's United Center, where tens of thousands of people have purchased tickets \u2014 from just under $30 to thousands of dollars \u2014 to attend the event moderated by Oprah Winfrey. Other stops on a tour scaled to rock star dimensions are planned at large arenas from New York City's Barclays Center to the Los Angeles Forum, with guests including Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Jessica Parker. While some fans have criticized the price as too high, 10 percent of tickets at each event are being donated to local charities, schools and community groups.\n\nIn \"Becoming,\" Obama shares both pain and joy. She writes lovingly of her family and gives a detailed account of her courtship with her future husband, whom she met when both were at the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP; she was initially his adviser. Secretaries claimed he was both brilliant and \"cute,\" although Michelle Obama was skeptical, writing that white people went \"bonkers\" any time you \"put a suit\" on a \"half-intelligent black man.\" She also thought his picture had a \"whiff of geekiness.\"\n\nBut she was more than impressed after meeting him, by his \"rich, even sexy baritone\" and by his \"strange, stirring combination\" of serenity and power. \"This strange mix-of-everything-man,\" when she finally let him kiss her, set off a \"toppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\"\n\nBut throughout her husband's life in politics, she fought to balance public and private needs, and to maintain her self-esteem. She agonized over what she feared was a cartoonish, racist image. She remembered being labeled \"angry\" and, by the Fox network, \"Obama's Baby Mama.\" At times, she feared she was damaging her husband's 2008 presidential campaign, especially after conservatives seized on a line from one of her speeches \u2014 taken out of context, she notes \u2014 that for the first time as an adult she was \"really proud\" of her country.\n\nThe remarks faded from the news, but she sensed lasting damage, a \"pernicious seed,\" a \"perception\" that she was \"disgruntled and vaguely hostile.\"\n\nAs the first black first lady, she knew she would be labeled \"other\" and would have to earn the aura of \"grace\" given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \"Am I good enough? Yes I am.\"\n\n\"Becoming\" is part of a joint book deal with former President Barack Obama, whose memoir is expected next year, that is believed worth tens of millions of dollars. The Obamas have said they will donate a \"significant portion\" of their author proceeds to charity, including the Obama Foundation.\n\nWidely praised as a gifted orator and communicator, Michelle Obama has long said she has no interest in running for office, although she held a few campaign-style rallies before the midterms urging people to register to vote. The rallies were part of her work as co-chairman of the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization When We All Vote.\n\nLast month, she launched a program to help empower girls worldwide through education. The Global Girls Alliance aims to support more than 1,500 grassroots organizations combating the challenges girls encounter in their communities.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Mrs. Obama launched the program last month, not last year.", "A fire that likely blocked a crucial exit at a low-cost dormitory-style housing facility in central Seoul killed at least seven people and injured 11 others on Friday, according to fire authorities who were investigating possible safety lapses in the building.\n\nThe blaze has been extinguished, but it's possible that the death toll could rise, officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters said.\n\nThe fire probably started near an exit door on the building's third floor, Kwon Hyeok-min, chief of Seoul's Jongno District Fire Station, told reporters. The facility's residents were mostly manual laborers who made their living on day-to-day jobs, he said.\n\n\"It was dawn and the exit door was likely blocked, so it would have been difficult (for the residents) to escape,\" Kwon said.\n\nAnother official from the Jongno station said the facility, which was built in 1983, did not have sprinklers because current safety regulations can't be retroactively applied to older structures. The official, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules, said it was unclear whether the building's smoke detector worked.\n\nThe facility, called \"goshiwon\" in Korean, is where poor workers relying on construction jobs or student preparing for bar exams or civil service exams stay in individual rooms with tiny sleep and study spaces. Budget travelers also often stay in such facilities.\n\nSouth Korean media reported that most of the victims were manual laborers in their 40s to 60s. The fire agency couldn't immediately confirm the reports. It wasn't known whether any young students or travelers were staying there.\n\nThe facility was located on the second and third floors of a three-story building, where the fire agency said all the victims were found. Its first floor has restaurants.\n\nSouth Korea, one of Asia's richest economies, has struggled for decades to improve safety standards and change widespread attitudes that treat safety as subservient to economic progress and convenience.\n\nForty-six people died in January when a fire ripped through a small hospital with no sprinkler systems in the southern city of Miryang. It was the country's worst fire since 2008, when 40 people died at a refrigerated warehouse in Icheon, near Seoul. Twenty-nine people were killed in a building fire in Jecheon in December of last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.", "A panel of federal judges on the D.C.

Add Interest\n\nThe appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller, a former associate of political provocateur Roger Stone, and steered by the National Legal and Policy Center, a well-funded conservative legal group with a deep history of mounting legal challenges against left-leaning organizations and Democratic politicians.\n\n\u201cEven if we lose this [appeals] case we will certainly bring it to the Supreme Court,\u201d Paul Kamenar, an attorney for Miller, told ABC News after Thursday\u2019s court appearance.\n\nMiller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Mueller's federal grand jury and related attempts to make him testify, which also have been met with heavy legal resistance. In late June, Miller turned over requested documents to prosecutors, but he was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in the Russia probe.\n\nObtained by ABC News\n\nKamenar\u2019s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller\u2019s appointment was not handled properly. He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a \u201cU.S. Attorney at large,\u201d and as such, should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate \u2013 neither of which occurred.\n\nFour top prosecutors from the special counsel\u2019s office appeared at the hearing. In the lead was Michael Dreeban, who is the most experienced appeals attorney at the Department of Justice, having argued more than 100 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDreeban told the judges that Kamenar\u2019s description of Mueller\u2019s authority was overblown. He said the special counsel is operating in a less senior position, and as such, his appointment by the acting attorney general was procedurally sound and constitutional.\n\n\u201cIt is not the case that the special counsel\u2019s office is off wandering in a free-floating environment,\u201d Dreeban told the judges.\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters, FILE\n\nMiller, 34, paints houses for a living now, but served as an aide to Stone until 2013.\n\nStone, who was a longtime informal political adviser to President Donald Trump, once described Miller as his \u201cwingman\u201d because he helped manage Stone\u2019s schedule, travel and media appearances, and also provided \u201csome I.T. work.\u201d Miller identifies himself as a libertarian and has said he did not support Trump\u2019s candidacy, but he did accompany Stone to the 2016 Republican National Convention.\n\nMore than a dozen individuals associated with Stone have met with the special counsel since last summer and many of those have appeared before the grand jury impaneled by Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nThe witnesses have told ABC News they were asked about Stone\u2019s dealings during the 2016 election and what if any contact he may have had with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange through an intermediary - an allegation Stone denies.\n\nThe court hearing came just 24 hours after the dismissal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nAt the start of the hearing, the appellate judges told lawyers to present their arguments as if Sessions\u2019 resignation had not occurred because she did not want those developments to muddy the legal arguments.

Chris Christie, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe and acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.\n\nSources emphasized that the list is fluid, and that Trump is in no rush to name a permanent successor.\n\nThe next attorney general will inherit supervision over the Mueller probe, which President Trump and his allies have often referred to as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, is perhaps the most visible of the seven candidates. A longtime friend of Trump, Giuliani served as one of his closest aides on the campaign trail before joining his legal team in April, and since then he has made frequent cable news appearances as he represents the president amid ongoing discussions with the Mueller team.\n\nRegis Duvignau/Reuters\n\nGraham, who recently emerged as one of the president\u2019s fiercest defenders and is expected to take over as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has been rumored to be auditioning for the post for months, perhaps inspiring in part his vigorous defense of the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in September.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nWhitaker, Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff at the Department of Justice, has been tapped by Trump tapped to fill Sessions\u2019 shoes on an interim basis, but sources said he is also a contender for the permanent job.

But tonight, evidence of a troubled man, and that critical question, were warning signs missed? Neighbors describing fits of anger at the home he lived in with his mother. The walls are kicked in and, you know, he was just -- couldn't control him. Reporter: Police today confirming they responded to a disturbance at that home in April, just seven months ago. He was somewhat irate. Acting a little irrationally. Felt he might be suffering from PTSD, basing that on the fact that he was a veteran. Reporter: They say mental health specialists cleared him after the incident. And because he was not involuntarily committed, he was not prohibited from buying firearms. Authorities today saying he legally purchased that Glock .45-caliber pistol allegedly used in the attack. Pierre Thomas with us live tonight. And as you reported there, the gun was purchased legally, but authorities say he allegedly used an extended magazine, which is illegal here in California? Reporter: That's right, David. Long did allegedly use an extended magazine in his gun, illegal in California, allowing him to fire more than ten bullets at a time. And we're now learning that gun was purchased in 2016.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for The victims of the California bar massacre\n\nAll morning long, families and parents were arriving, waiting to hear, and one father, as I mentioned with that photo of his son, hoping someone had seen him.

Good evening from California tonight. And you probably woke up this morning like so many in this country, say ig, not again. We are here in Thousand Oaks, California, tonight, the scene of the nation's newest mass shooting. This time, at a popular country music bar, the borderline bar and grill on college student. For students as young as 18, hundreds of people inside, when the horror and the chaos began. The shots ringing out, people hiding wherever they could, under tables and bar stool S smashing windows to get away. Carrying the injured as they ran. Police rushing to the scene, heavily armed officers, including a police sergeant who was among the first to go in, that sheriff's sergeant did not survive.

As the camera shakes, that piercing sound. Gun fire. Silence. For six endless seconds. Then listen as people run for their lives. Guys, run. He's coming out this door. Reporter: It's 11:20 P.M. Wednesday night. Police say a gunman dressed in black started shooting before he went inside. He shot the doorman, the bouncer. Just a young man. And then he shot the cashier. Just a young girl. The subject was at the front shooting at everybody. Think he's still inside the bar. Reporter: Witnesses say the bar quickly filled with smoke. The gunman but throwing smoke grenades. We got multiple people down. We need a lot of ambulances. Reporter: Amid the chaos, the voice of a young man calling home. Mom, dad, this is max. There's been a shooting at borderline. Please wake up. Reporter: The gunman keeps firing. I was on the dance floor. I heard the shooter. I looked back.

Sergeant helus is shot several times and does not survive. 11 others also killed. Several more wounded. It's a horrific scene in there. There is blood everywhere.

His name is Matthew Whitaker, and he's been publicly critical of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation in the past. Here's ABC's chief white house correspondent Jonathan Karl. Reporter: Tonight, amid a growing outcry over the president's appointment of a political loyalist to run the justice department, multiple sources tell ABC news Matt Whitaker will not recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. And before joining the trump administration last fall, Whitaker made his views on that investigation perfectly clear. On the question of whether the trump campaign clulded with the Russians? The truth is, there was no collusion with the Russians and the trump campaign. There is not a single piece of evidence that demonstrates that the trump campaign had any illegal or even improper relationships with Russians. It's that simple. Reporter: And here's Whitaker on whether the president obstructed justice -- There is no criminal obstruction of justice to be had here. The evidence is weak. No reasonable prosecutor would bring a case on what we know right now. Reporter: Whitaker is now the acting attorney general, until a permanent replacement is confirmed. White house officials say Whitaker himself could be nominated. Other names on the short list include other staunch political supporters of the president. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and Chris Christie, now an ABC news contributor, who ran the trump transition during the campaign. Christie told David he would consider taking the job. You always take a call from your president, no matter which party. And you listen to what he has to say. Jon Karl with us tonight from the white house. How long can Matthew Whitaker remain in his position as acting attorney general? Reporter: David, under a law known as the vacancy act, he can remain acting attorney general for up to seven months.

Children play on a parallel stretch of railroad that hasn't been in regular use since before they were born. Behind a solitary guard stands a sign saying it's 68 kilometers (40 miles) to Sokcho, a town just across the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nAt the height of South Korea's policy of engagement with the North, the \"Diamond Mountain Resort\" area was a symbol of cooperation. More than 2 million South Korean tourists came to visit and some of the South's biggest corporations poured more than a billion dollars into what they hoped would be a world-class travel destination.\n\nToday it's almost deserted.\n\nA decade after the North-South experiment in cooperation on Kumgang ended in bitter failure, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in want to give it another try. By the end of the year they hope to begin working on opening this stretch of road and rail.\n\nThe push to jointly develop Kumgang is a direct challenge to Washington's policy of maintaining sanctions and \"maximum pressure\" until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChrystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling of the Kumgangsan Hotel, where a handful of North Korean tourists in Adidas sweatsuits gathers to catch a bus up the mountain. Elaborate murals of mountain scenery cover the walls of its second floor. In the cavernous lobby, there's a souvenir shop, a white concert piano on a stage beside billiard and pingpong tables and a well-stocked bar. There's a theater and a karaoke room.\n\nThe hotel is eerily silent, the quiet broken only by the occasional laughter of the local tourists and some scattered Chinese groups.\n\nBuilt in the 1990s with hundreds of millions of dollars of South Korean investment, mostly from a branch of the Hyundai Group, the resort was in its heyday an oasis of luxury, with conga lines and Filipino lounge bands. Its 10 hotels featured opulent fixtures and oil paintings framed in gold. Guests had the run of an 18-hole golf course, now closed, and a hot springs spa, which remains open and popular with North Koreans. Today, the resort's main role is to be the official venue for reunions of families divided by the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe Kumgang project was troubled from its outset, when it opened to South Koreans in 1998.\n\nVisitors from the South were allowed only day trips or visits of a few days. Initially they were brought in by ferry to minimize chances to see the North's countryside or interact with its people. Later, they were allowed in on buses through the DMZ, with the curtains drawn until they had arrived.\n\nThe resort drew only a fraction of the 500,000 tourists projected to come annually. Within a few years of its opening, it was hemorrhaging money.\n\nIts fate was sealed in July 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot dead tourist Park Wang-ja, a 53-year-old housewife from Seoul, after she allegedly wandered into a restricted area on a beach on the resort's fringes. Seoul quickly suspended all travel to Kumgang. In 2011, the North announced it was seizing all assets and taking back control of all real estate rights.\n\nThe Hyundai affiliate is believed to have lost more than a billion dollars. Its Kumgang office sits padlocked and unoccupied near an arena that once housed a circus.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrom their first summit in April, reopening the road and railway across the DMZ to Kumgang has been a top priority for Moon and Kim.\n\nMoon has helped bring Kim out of the cold. He wants to expand economic ties with the North to build trust and defuse tensions, creating conditions for Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. He also hopes to reopen another \"Sunshine\" era symbol, the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex on the North's side of the DMZ.\n\nAt their third summit, in September, Kim and Moon formalized Mount Kumgang's role as the reunion venue, agreeing to \"promptly restore the facility toward this end.\" Their joint statement included plans for a ground-breaking ceremony for work to reopen cross-border railways and roads, including the ones near Kumgang, by the year's end and to \"normalize\" the Kaesong industrial complex and Mount Kumgang tourism projects when the time is ripe.\n\nMoon's seeming readiness to scale back sanctions even before Pyongyang takes major steps to denuclearize is raising red flags in Washington. Such concerns spiked when South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha suggested Seoul might lift unilateral sanctions it imposed after an 2010 attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.\n\nTrump's response was quick and, to many Koreans, deeply insulting.\n\n\"They won't do that without our approval,\" he said. \"They do nothing without our approval.\"\n\nLim Soo-ho of the Seoul-based Institute for National Security said it's all but impossible for South Korea to resume joint tours to Kumgang, operations at the Kaesong joint factory park or any other form of economic cooperation under the current international sanctions, which have strengthened significantly since 2016. Washington's own sanctions against Pyongyang restrict an even broader range of economic activities and target a larger list of companies and individuals.\n\nSouth Korea will never abandon the Kumgang joint tours or Kaesong factory park because they are such powerful symbols of inter-Korean cooperation, Lim said. But a less risky business environment for southern companies is needed, perhaps with a free trade agreement that would bring inter-Korean economic activities closer to global standards.\n\nFor now, ground-breaking ceremonies for projects not yet started are the best Seoul and Pyongyang can manage.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA special permit is required to get to the beach from the base of the mountains.\n\nWinding through freshly harvested farmland, the rice still spread out on the roadsides to dry, travelers come to an imposing checkpoint manned by armed soldiers. A tall, electrified fence marks the entrance into the DMZ.\n\nPae Un Sim was a child during Kumgang's boom years.\n\nLeading the way down a gravel path to the rugged beach where the South Korean housewife was killed, she recalls meeting a tourist who said he once told everyone Yosemite National Park in the United States was the most beautiful mountain scenery in the world. He had to revise that after seeing the Alps, and again after seeing Kumgang.\n\nThe sun is setting. Lights along the North-South demarcation line can be seen flickering in the hills.\n\nPae stops to point to the ocean.\n\n\"If you look between those two little islands, you can see the South,\" she said. \"There used to be so many tourists. It was very lively.\"\n\nAsked about her impressions of the South Koreans who came to visit or her hopes for the future, she hesitated. Those topics are still perhaps too sensitive and too political to discuss freely. After some thought she voiced a commonly heard refrain.\n\n\"We Koreans are one people,\" she said. \"It is our common wish to be reunited.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP reporter Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this story from Seoul.

Galaxy Securities, a brokerage, says about 30 percent of that, or 1.9 trillion yuan ($271 billion), was in mutual funds.\n\nInvestors already were skittish after the 2015 price collapse. Then, Beijing plowed billions of dollars into stopping the slide and suspended plans for stock offerings by state-owned companies.\n\nConfidence took another hit after a wave of arrests of brokerage executives, a star Chinese trader and a former market regulator on charges of insider trading and manipulating prices.\n\nLi Jun, a retired hotel chief executive in the eastern city of Nanjing, said his nest egg of 300,000-400,000 yuan ($40-$60,000) in stocks was cut in half by the market routs in 2008 and 2015.\n\n\"I avoid putting in more money, because what is the use of doing that?\" said Li, 81.\n\nRegulators have tried in vain to encourage investors to shift from rapid-fire trading to holding for the long term. The Shanghai exchange said individual investors accounted for 82 percent of its daily trading volume in 2017, little changed from previous years.\n\nInstead, regulators are gradually allowing in more foreign buyers in hopes they will provide ballast as long-term investors.\n\nSince 2014, foreigners have been able to buy some \"A'' shares through Hong Kong. In July, regulators announced foreigners working in China would be given access to the whole market.\n\nNow, investors worry about a possible new downward spiral if prices of shares pledged as collateral by companies for loans fall far enough that banks and brokerages might seize and sell them to recover their money.\n\nThe government tried to allay those fears by announcing on Oct. 19 that Chinese insurers would be allowed to create units to buy such shares temporarily to keep them from flooding the market.\n\nThe same day, officials led by Vice Premier Liu He, Xi's top economic adviser, launched a media campaign to talk prices back up. The central bank governor, Yi Gang, was quoted as saying \"economic fundamentals are good.\" Liu said cheaper stocks created \"good investment opportunities.\"\n\n\"I welcome the government's efforts to support the markets,\" said Li, the retired hotel executive. \"But as for whether that is effective, I really don't know.\"\n\nThe Shanghai index gained 4 percent after the ruling party leadership promised Oct. 31 to \"intensify reform.\" That prompted expectations of further easing in lending controls.\n\nXi followed with a Nov. 1 speech that promised tax cuts and other help to entrepreneurs that generate new jobs and wealth. Private sector analysts saw that as an affirmation of the importance of private business amid complaints state industry is a drag on the economy.\n\nThe latest measures helped to reassure Liu Fei, a manager at a Shanghai real estate company. She stuck with the market after losing 40 percent of her money in the 2015 crash but said her faith was waning.\n\n\"A week ago, I panicked and felt the Chinese stock market was finished,\" said Liu, 28. \"But I gained confidence after the government issued supporting policies.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.", "No state can deliver post-election day drama quite like Florida as both the statewide Senate and gubernatorial Democratic candidates push for a recount decision as early as Saturday.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Saturday is when all the unofficial returns need to be turned in from the state\u2019s canvassing boards.\n\nIf, after the machine recount, a 0.25 percent margin remains separating the candidates in their respective races, then a manual recount would be ordered with a Nov. 18 deadline to ensure all overseas ballots are in and available to be counted. The Elections Canvassing Commission would then meet Nov. 20 to certify the results.\n\nThe current secretary of state, Republican Ken Detzner, was appointed by Scott and has been in the post since February 2012. This is his second time as Florida's secretary of state after also serving under former GOP Gov.

It's a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career.

Yoga was the most common form of complementary medicine reviewed. However, meditation saw the most drastic rise in use, with 4.1 percent of adults practicing it in 2012 versus 14.2 percent in 2017.\n\nWhile adults were found to practice yoga and meditation the most, a separate report said that children were also taking part at an increasing rate. From 2012 to 2017, the number of children ages 4 to 17 doing yoga rose from 3.1 percent to 8.4 percent. Similarly, the number of kids who meditated rose from 0.6 percent to 5.4 percent.\n\n\u201cYoga and meditation are practices which can make you feel better, improve your overall health and are generally safe,\u201d said Dr. Anton Borja, Medical Director of Integrative Oncology at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Or would they not have voted at all? There\u2019s no way of knowing those answers.\n\nRichard Herrera, an associate professor of political science at Arizona State University, says that he doesn\u2019t consider Green to be a spoiler.\n\n\"The election was always going to be very close, regardless of the number of parties involved,\" he said.\n\nMatt York/AP\n\n\"Almost by definition someone who votes for a third party candidate is not interested in winning the election. They\u2019re interested in making a statement that's ideologically central to their political core and you dilute that message if you vote for the best of two bad alternates, in your mind,\" Herrera said.\n\nSome of the clearest examples of third party spoilers have been on the presidential level, with Ralph Nader being seen in that role by many in the 2000 election.\n\n\"If about 1 percent of the Nader vote in Florida had gone to [Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore, then that might have been enough to change the outcome,\" Noel said.\n\nAnother example nearly a century earlier was that of Teddy Roosevelt, the then-former Republican president who ran as a part of the Progressive party while then-incumbent President William Howard Taft ran as the Republican.\n\nRoosevelt and Taft effectively split the vote of many Republicans, giving Democrat Woodrow Wilson the highest percentage of the vote and, in turn, the presidency.\n\n\"As an electorate, we've gotten smarter about this and that's why it doesn\u2019t happen as much anymore,\" Noel said.", "A video distributed by the Trump administration to support its argument for banning CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House appears to have been doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he was during an exchange with a White House intern, an independent expert said Thursday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, which shows Acosta asking President Donald Trump a question on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away. But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta's arm movement as he touches the intern's arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP's request.\n\nEarlier, Shapiro noticed that frames in the tweeted video were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one.\n\nThe alteration is \"too precise to be an accident,\" said Shapiro, who trains instructors to use video editing software.\n\nThe tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter. It's also unlikely the differences could be explained by technical glitches or by video compression \u2014 a reduction in a video's size to enable it to play more smoothly on some sites \u2014 because the slowing of the video and the acceleration that followed are \"too precise to be an accident.\n\nSanders, who hasn't said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern. In her statement announcing Acosta's suspension, she said the White House won't tolerate \"a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job.\"\n\nWhile the origin of the manipulated video is unclear, its distribution marked a new low for an administration that has been criticized for its willingness to mislead.\n\nThe White House News Photographers Association decried the sharing of the footage.\n\n\"As visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\" said Whitney Shefte, the association's president. \"It's deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country's highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\"\n\nCNN has labeled Sanders' characterization of Acosta's exchange with the intern as a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee. Rather, he said he saw him holding on to the microphone as she reached for it.\n\n\"The irony of this White House video involving Jim Acosta is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing \u2014 engaging in fake information,\" said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics at Washington & Lee University.\n\nSeveral journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Online News Association \u2014 demanded Acosta's press pass be reinstated.\n\n\"It is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,\" said Julie Pace, AP's Washington bureau chief. \"We strongly reject the idea that any administration would block a journalist's access to the White House.\"\n\nThe New York Times editorialized in favor of restoring Acosta's pass, saying it signaled Trump's view that asking hard questions disqualifies reporters from attending briefings. The newspaper said that if Sanders was so offended by physical contact, \"what did she have to say when her boss praised as 'my kind of guy' Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana, who was sentenced to anger management classes and community service for body-slamming a Guardian reporter last spring?\"\n\nCNN has been a frequent target of the president, who has characterized journalists as enemies of the people and who routinely accuses the mainstream media of spreading \"fake news.\" And Acosta has been one of the more visible thorns in the side of the White House. During their verbal altercation on Wednesday, Trump called Acosta a \"terrible person.\"\n\nStill, it's rare for the White House to pull the so-called hard passes from journalists.\n\nDuring Lyndon Johnson's presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials. During the George W. Bush presidency, Trude Feldman, who worked for various news outlets, was suspended for 90 days after security cameras recorded her looking through a press aide's desk late one night. In the 1970s, President Nixon tried to get Washington Post reporters banned from the White House.\n\nDespite losing his White House pass, Acosta is expected to travel to Paris this weekend to cover Trump's trip to meet with world leaders.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCalvin Woodward reported from Washington.

Trump said \"we're putting up massive tent cities\" with \"the military's help\" although a defense official said at the time that the Pentagon had received no request to set up tents for detained migrants.\n\nUnder current law, immigrants may apply for asylum regardless of how and where they enter the country.
