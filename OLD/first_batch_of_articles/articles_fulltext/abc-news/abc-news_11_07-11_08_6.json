["Matthew Whitaker, who was named acting attorney general by President Donald Trump on Wednesday in the wake of Jeff Sessions' resignation, has ties to a Florida-based company that came under fire from the Federal Trade Commission last year, which sued the firm for allegedly running an \u201cinvention-promotion scam.\u201d\n\nWhitaker sat on the board of World Patent Marketing, Inc., an invention marketing company the FTC has called \u201ca scam that has bilked thousands of consumers out of millions of dollars\u201d, from 2014 until 2017, when a federal court in Miami temporarily halted the company\u2019s operations and froze its assets. According to court filings, the FTC alleged that the company lured in customers by publishing fraudulent \u201csuccess stories,\u201d failed to deliver on promises, and took drastic measures to suppress negative reviews.\n\nThe FTC did not accuse Whitaker of any wrongdoing. The FTC\u2019s lawsuit concluded in a settlement, in which World Patent Marketing, Inc neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but the defendants were banned from invention-promotion related activities. The settlement also mandated that the defendants pay nearly $25 million in fines, but the FTC ultimately accepted less than $1 million.\n\nWhitaker joined the company\u2019s advisory board in October 2014, and in a press release issued at the time, he praised the company\u2019s business practices.\n\n\"World Patent Marketing has become a trusted partner to many inventors that believe in the American Dream,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a former US attorney, I would only align myself with a first class organization. World Patent Marketing goes beyond making statements about doing business \u2018ethically\u2019 and translates those worlds into action.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment for this report.\n\nWhitaker was reportedly paid nearly $10,000 for his service on the advisory board. Federal Election Committee filings also show that Scott Cooper, the former CEO of World Patent Marketing, Inc. donated $2,600 to Whitaker\u2019s unsuccessful Senate bid in 2014.\n\nThe 2014 press release touted Whitaker\u2019s experience as a United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, listing some of his responsibilities as \u201cdefending civil lawsuits brought against the United States, handling federal forfeiture actions, and collecting debts and restitutions.\u201d One of the company\u2019s vice presidents is quoted as saying \"Matt's experience in politics, law and regulatory matters will be an invaluable asset for our company.\u201d\n\nRecords obtained in the FTC\u2019s investigation show that, on at least one occasion, Whitaker appeared to highlight his political pedigree while defending the company in an email to a disgruntled customer.\n\n\u201cI am a former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cYour emails and message from today seem to be an apparent attempt at possible blackmail or extortion.\n\n\u201cYou also mentioned filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and to smear World Patent Marketing\u2019s reputation online,\u201d Whitaker continued. \u201cI am assuming you understand that there could be serious civil and criminal consequences for you.\u201d\n\nThe FTC\u2019s initial complaint alleges that emails like this were part of a strategy the company employed to prevent upset customers from sharing their accounts.\n\n\u201cIf consumers threaten to complain about Defendants business practices, including by threatening to post complaints on the internet or complain to the Better Business Bureau or law enforcement, Defendants respond by threatening to file a lawsuit for extortion, defamation, and other causes of action,\u201d the FTC claimed in court filings.", "A man convicted of raping a German tourist in Hollywood two years ago has been sentenced to 240 years to life in prison.\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Kenneth Mack was sentenced Thursday.\n\nProsecutors say Mack and another man lured the woman to an isolated rooftop by promising to show her the city lights.

It also argues the provision creates an undue burden to abortion access.\n\nIf the ban takes effect Jan. 1 as scheduled, doctors would have to be physically present when a woman takes medication to end her pregnancy, the group contends.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights filed its lawsuit on behalf of Trust Women Wichita, which has operated a clinic offering reproductive health care, including abortions, since 2013.\n\n\"This ban hurts Kansas women by mandating that they must travel farther and pay more in gas, child care, lost wages and lodging to access necessary medical care,\" Julie Burkhart, chief executive officer of Trust Women, said in a news release. \"Medication abortion is safe whether provided in-person or by telemedicine.\"\n\nThe Kansas attorney general's office, which represents the state in lawsuits, did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe complaint filed in Shawnee County District Court argues that 97 percent of Kansas counties in 2014 were without a single clinic that provides abortions, and more than half of Kansas women live in those counties. The five clinics in Kansas that offer abortion services are all in Wichita or suburban Kansas City.\n\nTrust Women recently began providing medication abortion via telemedicine to expand access to the clinic's services, according to the lawsuit. Before Trust Women introduced telemedicine, the clinic was able to provide abortion care two days a week because its physicians had to travel to Wichita. Telemedicine allowed it to offer the service on additional weekdays and Saturdays.\n\nThe Kansas Telemedicine Act requires insurances companies in Kansas to cover health care services provided through telemedicine if insurance already covers the services during personal visits to a doctor. The law aims to improve access to health care in underserved communities and rural areas.\n\nAbortion opponents insisted the telemedicine bill include language forbidding abortion by telemedicine. Lawmakers then added a \"non-severability\" clause aimed at ensuring the entire law is nullified if the abortion ban is struck down. The lawsuit argues that it's ultimately up to the courts, not the Legislature, to decide whether a section of the legislation can be severed.", "___\n\nFed leaves key rate unchanged but sees further hikes ahead\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Federal Reserve has left its key policy rate unchanged but signaled that it plans to keep responding to the strong U.S. economy with more interest rate hikes.

And it sometimes feels as though J.K. Rowling \u2014 a screenwriter here for the second time \u2014 is similarly infatuated by her unending powers of conjuring. In this overstuffed second film in the five-part Harry Potter prequel series, every solved mystery unlocks another, every story begets still more. Narratives multiply like randy Nifflers (one of the many species of creature in Newt's bag).\n\nThe usual problem for spinoffs is their thinness or their unfulfilled justification \u2014 especially ones that stretch an already much-stretched tale. (There were eight Potter movies.) But neither are issues in the two \"Fantastic Beasts\" films, each directed by former \"Potter\" hand David Yates. Both movies are rooted in purpose. \"The Crimes of Grindelwald,\" especially, is an impressively dark and urgent parable of supremacist ideology aimed squarely at today's demagogues of division. And neither film lacks in density of detail, character or story.\n\nNo, the only real crime of \"Gindelwald\" is its sheer abundance. In zipping from New York to London to Paris (with ministries of magic in each locale), this latest chapter in Rowling's pre-Potter saga feels so eager to be outside the walls of Hogwarts (which also get a cameo) that it resists ever settling anywhere, or with any of its widely scattered characters \u2014 among them Newt, the conscientious dark magic investigator Tina (Katherine Waterston), the New Yorker no-maj Jacob (Dan Fogler), Tina's sister and Jacob's sweetheart Queenie (Alison Sudol) and the haunted former schoolmate of Newt's, Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz)\n\nNo one does the foreboding sense of a looming battle better than Rowling. Now, it's the rise of Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp), freshly escaped from prison, who casts a lengthening shadow over the land. With a blond shock of hair and a ghostly white face, Grindelwald is Rowling's magical version of a white nationalist, only he believes in the elevation of wizards \u2014 \"purebloods\" \u2014 over those who lack magical powers, or \"no-majes.\"\n\nIt's 1927 and the dark clouds of fascism are swirling; World War II feels right around the corner. In one the movie's many tricks, Grindelwald drapes Paris in black fabric, like a wannabe Christo.\n\nDespite the gathering storm, the pacifist Newt (Redmayne, cloyingly shy), resists drawing battle lines. When pushed by his brother Theseus (Callum Turner), who like Tina is an \"Auror\" who enforces magic law, Newt responds: \"I don't do sides.\"\n\nThe events of \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" will test Newt, just as they will anyone trying to follow its many strands. The hunt is on for at least three characters \u2014 the missing Queenie, the on-the-lam Grindelwald and Credence Barebone (Eza Miller), the powerful but volatile orphan who spends much of the film seeking answers to his identity. He's the Anakin Skywalker of \"Fantastic Beasts,\" whose soul is fought for by both sides.\n\nIf all of this sounds like a lot, it most definitely is, and that's not even mentioning Jude Law joining in as a young Albus Dumbledore, who turns out to be awfully roguishly handsome under that ZZ-top beard. But our time here with him is short, just as it is with so many characters who \u2014 to the film's credit \u2014 we yearn for more of (Fogler's Jacob, especially). There is a flicker of a flashback that hints at a long-ago, maybe-sexual relationship between Dumbledore and Grindelwald; it would be the film's most intriguing revelation if it wasn't merely baited for future installments.\n\nSiblings are everywhere in \"The Crimes of Grindelwald.\" Just as in the houses of Hogwarts, Rowling delights in duality and the interplay of light and dark. Even within the Aurors there are competing methodologies of law enforcement to face the growing threat. Newt is carried along like an avatar of sympathy: he believes that every beast can be tamed, that every trauma can be healed.\n\nRowling's only source material going into the \"Fantastic Beasts\" films was a slender 2001 book in the guise of a Hogwarts textbook. But she has, with her mighty wand, summoned an impressively vast if convoluted world, one that's never timid in exploring the darkness beneath its enchanting exterior. And, with Yates again at the helm, \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" is often dazzling, occasionally wondrous and always atmospheric. But is also a bit of a mess. Even magic bags can be overweight.\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,\" a Warner Bros. release, is rated PG-13 for some fantasy action violence. Running time: 134 minutes.

Scott Walker, said GOP legislative leaders should \"stop any and all attempts to play politics and weaken the powers of the governor's office.\" Evers said in a statement that making those moves before he takes office Jan. 7 would be a \"complete violation of the separation of powers in our system.\"\n\nSenate Republicans met privately Thursday to discuss ways to reduce Evers' powers, a day after Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said he, too, would be open to doing that. Republicans have been vague about their specific plans.\n\nWalker hasn't said whether he would sign any such bills into law. His spokeswoman, Amy Hasenberg, didn't immediately reply to a message seeking comment. Such a move has precedent: Republicans in North Carolina two years ago limited the number of appointments that the Democratic governor-elect, Roy Cooper, could make once he took office.\n\nGOP Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald downplayed what Republicans were considering, saying they were primarily focused on making sure the rules for how some laws are enforced wouldn't be changed, including the state's voter photo ID requirement.\n\nHe said Republicans are also looking at reconstituting boards to make sure they have equal representation, but didn't specify which ones.\n\nFitzgerald also said Republicans would look to limit the governor's authority over the process of enacting rules designed to carry out laws the Legislature passes. The Legislature increased Walker's authority over that process shortly after he took office in 2011. Republicans have been in complete control of the Legislature and governor's office since that year.\n\n\"I'm not sure why there's all this discussion we're trying to somehow undermine the new governor,\" Fitzgerald told reporters. \"That's not the case at all. I think there's some stuff that's going to be reasonable.\"\n\nFormer Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle told The Associated Press on Thursday that he hopes Walker will protect the powers of the office for his successor, Evers.\n\n\"There's some obligation on a governor in that situation to not just be a partisan player anymore and be a protector of the office, and I hope the governor does that,\" Doyle said. \"I think that's how many governors would see it. You're no longer just a party operative, you're somebody who has to look at the bigger picture.\"\n\nThe lame duck session, which legislative leaders called at Walker's request during the campaign, was supposed to be exclusively about approving a $100 million tax break bill for paper products giant Kimberly-Clark Corp. The incentive package is designed to save a Fox Crossing plant that employs about 500 people. Republicans still don't have the votes to pass it and its future is uncertain.\n\nWhile that measure is in limbo, Republicans are talking about doing much more, including kneecapping Evers before he takes office. But Fitzgerald said that because of the governor's substantial veto power, Evers will be able to keep the Legislature \"in check.\"\n\n\"It's equal, balanced government,\" he said. \"We'll respect Tony Evers like we have any other governor and we'll work with him.\"\n\nRepublicans have an 18-15 majority in the state Senate for the lame duck session, giving them little margin to lose votes. But starting in January, their majority will increase to 19-14.\n\nEvers said in his statement that he wants to work with Republicans and Democrats on issues, including health care, education and infrastructure.\n\nDoyle was in office the last time there was divided government, in 2007 and 2008, when Republicans controlled the Assembly and Democrats had the majority in the Senate. Doyle said he anticipates that Evers will \"make every effort to reach across the aisle\" and work with Republicans.\n\n\"He should approach them in good faith with an open hand,\" Doyle said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Luther Olsen is chairman of the Senate's Education Committee and has worked closely over the years with Evers, the state superintendent since 2009. Olsen said he'd be open to scaling back the powers of the governor but acknowledged it would not look good for Republicans to undermine Evers before he takes office.\n\n\"The problem is it just looks like you're trying to tie the hands of the new governor,\" Olsen said. \"The optics problem looks bad.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSign up for \"Politics in Focus,\" a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP's best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D", "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, was hospitalized Thursday morning with three broken ribs after falling on Wednesday evening. She went home after her fall, but had discomfort throughout the night and was later admitted to the hospital for broken ribs on her left side. This is not the first time Ginsburg has suffered this kind of injury; she broke two ribs in 2012 as well. Unfortunately, this is a common injury for the elderly.\n\nHow common are falls in the elderly?\n\nFalls are the leading cause of injury and death among older Americans. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in four Americans age 65 and over falls each year. Every 11 seconds, an older adult is treated in the ER after a fall, and every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall.\n\nWhat causes falls in the elderly?\n\nAccidents, environmental hazards, and falls from bed are leading causes. As we age, our senses dull, our sense of balance is compromised and we can have difficulty walking, weakness, pain related to arthritis, confusion, cognitive impairment, and poor vision, which all contribute to the problem.\n\nWhat injuries happen after falls?\n\nEvery case is different and a fall may result in nothing serious or severe damage. Common injuries after a fall can include bruising, broken bones, internal bleeding and head injuries. These range from minor injuries to life threatening injury, particularly if there is internal bleeding or head injury. Rib fractures can lead to potentially life-threatening conditions including pneumonia and lung collapse. Falls also have a heavy impact on quality of life -- many older adults fear falling, and as a result decrease their daily activities often leading to physical decline and depression.\n\n\u201cIn patients with rib fractures, it\u2019s important to adequately manage pain and pay careful attention to fluid status to help ensure a good outcome,\u201d said Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s especially important to avoid excessive administration of IV fluids -- without evidence of ongoing bleeding -- since this can lead to fluid overload in the lungs known as pulmonary edema.\u201d\n\nWhat is the recovery time after a fall?\n\nThis really depends on the injuries sustained. Broken ribs usually heal on their own and this often takes about six to 10 weeks. In some cases, if you have many broken ribs, your doctor may recommend rib fixation which is a surgery that uses plates and screws to stabilize broken ribs; the recovery time for this varies.\n\n\u201cRib fractures in the elderly population are quite common following even the most seemingly innocuous falls from ground level,\u201d said Dr. David Forsh, chief of orthopedic trauma for the Mount Sinai Health System. \u201cGenerally these injuries heal rather readily in a matter of eight to 10 weeks, but may be a source of significant pain and debilitation for a short time. Treatment is usually supportive with pain medication and expectant management. If patients have intractable pain that causes respiratory dysfunction they may be candidates for an epidural to alleviate symptoms and facilitate improved breathing mechanics.\u201d\n\nDr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, Director, Geriatric Education, Northwell Health, Great Neck, New York, said \u201cthe number of ribs broken is also a major factor in recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree or more rib fractures will double the risk of death,\u201d said Wolf-Klein. \u201cPre-existing conditions such as cardiopulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure also increase the risk of potential complications after rib fractures. Therefore, older patients may require admission to hospitals for monitoring and management of their rib fractures.\u201d\n\nHow the injuries will impact Justice Ginsburg is yet to be seen, but her history suggests they are not likely to keep her away from the next Supreme Court term beginning on Nov. 26. In 2012, she broke two ribs without missing work.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nWhen should the elderly see a doctor after falling?\n\nFollowing up with a doctor after a fall is critical to identifying injuries and discussing the best ways to prevent additional falls. People can be seen in an ER immediately after the fall or be seen by their primary care physician. The elderly should be seen in the ER if they hit their head, lose consciousness, are on blood thinners, have chest pain, have difficulty breathing, can\u2019t walk after falling, have an obvious broken bone, or have been on the ground for a prolonged period of time. They should also be seen in the ER if they fell from passing out (as opposed to tripping and falling), if the fall was unwitnessed, or for anything else that is concerning to them.\n\nHow can falls be prevented?\n\nTalk with a doctor about falls and fall prevention. Medical assessment by a doctor can identify risk factors and provide appropriate interventions to reduce the risk of falling. These interventions include making the home safer by removing loose rugs from the floor, removing objects scattered on the floor, proper lighting, and placing hand rails in commonly used spaces. Get an eye exam and update glasses or contacts as needed. Talk to a doctor about medications that may make it more likely to fall and be evaluated for any mental status changes including increased confusion. Participating in programs to improve balance and strength is also helpful.\n\n\u201cWith elderly individuals at risk for trips or falls it\u2019s important to consider making space in the home or office to mobilize freely and eliminate clutter or items that one could trip over,\u201d said Dr. Forsh. \u201cKeeping active with exercise or doing physical therapy can also help with proprioceptive neuromuscular coordination/control to help prevent missteps or falls.\u201d\n\nDr. Johanna Kreafle is an emergency medicine physician at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "The European Union expects Serbia and Kosovo to \"swiftly deliver\" on their commitment to talks on normalizing relations, which is the key for the two nations to advance toward membership in the bloc, the EU's foreign policy chief said Thursday.\n\nFederica Mogherini met with the presidents of Serbia and Kosovo as part of an EU-mediated dialogue that is designed to solve their decades-long dispute, which has threatened the stability of the Balkans.\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade does not recognize the move.

Access a Zacks stock report on DIS at https://www.zacks.com/ap/DIS", "With Democrat Stacey Abrams insisting there are enough votes to keep her in Georgia's fiercely contested governor's race, a key focus will be an estimated 21,300 provisional ballots and whether those will help her make enough of a dent in Republican Brian Kemp's lead to trigger a December runoff.\n\nFederal law requires provisional ballots to be offered to voters whose eligibility cannot be immediately determined, but there is no guarantee that such a ballot will ultimately be counted.\n\nHere is a closer look at provisional ballots and how they work:\n\nWHAT ARE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS?\n\nProvisional ballots are similar to regular ballots, but they are kept separate and not counted unless the voter's eligibility is confirmed.\n\nThe process for issuing them and determining which ones are eligible is left to state and local election officials.\n\nIn Georgia, for instance, if a voter forgets a photo ID, he or she will receive a provisional ballot. In these cases, the voter must present their identification at their local election office within a few business days to have their vote count.\n\nIf a voter's name does not appear on the list of registered voters in a precinct, he or she will also receive a provisional ballot. Later, election officials will determine if that voter was eligible to vote but voted in the wrong precinct. In that case, only the votes in races he or she was eligible to vote in will be counted.\n\nFederal law requires election officials to provide a way for voters to check on their provisional ballot, typically by using a toll-free phone number or a website. If a provisional ballot was not counted, a reason should be provided.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nHOW COMMON ARE THEY?\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, 16,739 provisional ballots were cast in Georgia, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.\n\nThat means the 21,300 provisional ballots cast in this year's election is greater than 2016, when a slightly larger electorate in Georgia voted for president.\n\nNearly 60 percent of the 21,300 provisional ballots in this year's election were clustered in the state's most populous counties \u2014 Fulton, Gwinnett, Cobb, DeKalb, Chatham and Clayton. Those also happen to be counties with large numbers of Democratic voters, something Abrams is banking on.\n\nWhile DeKalb County saw a 160 percent jump in provisional ballots over 2016, Gwinnett County only saw a 3 percent increase. Abrams won 83.4 percent of the vote in DeKalb County compared to 56.5 percent in Gwinnett County.\n\nThe 21,300 provisional ballots alone wouldn't be enough for Abrams to erase Kemp's lead or to force a runoff. With all precincts reporting, Kemp holds a lead of 62,722 votes. Kemp has 50.3 percent of the votes so far, while Abrams has 48.7 percent.\n\nAbrams' campaign is convinced that provisional ballots combined with other ballots, such as absentee votes, haven't been counted and could trigger a recount or runoff. Kemp needs to stay above 50 percent to avoid a runoff.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nWHY MIGHT THERE BE MORE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THIS YEAR?\n\nIt's tough to say at this point. Voting rights experts say provisional ballots are an important tool to ensure that a voter is not disenfranchised due to an administrative error. They also create a paper trail for identifying potential areas of concern, such as overly aggressive efforts to remove eligible voters from the rolls.\n\nExperts caution against provisional ballots being overused because there is no guarantee they will be counted.\n\nIn Georgia, there have been lawsuits over efforts by Kemp's Secretary of State's Office to implement the state's \"exact-match\" law, which flagged some 53,000 voter registration applications this year. The law requires information on the forms to match certain state and federal records, with civil rights groups saying the policy disproportionately affects black, Latino and Asian-American applicants.\n\nKemp has said the concerns are overblown because those on the list can vote if they bring a valid photo ID that substantially matches the information on file, something already required under the state's voter ID law.\n\nBut if the election worker decides it doesn't, the voter could be directed to cast a provisional ballot.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nARE PROVISIONAL BALLOTS ALWAYS COUNTED?\n\nNo. If a voter is determined to be ineligible, the provisional ballot is rejected and will not be counted.\n\nIn Georgia in 2016, 55 percent of provisional ballots were rejected. That means 9,147 people did not have their votes counted.\n\nNationally, of the 2.4 million provisional ballots cast in the 2016 presidential election, 25 percent were rejected.

Now he adds and today we're talking about this film a very important now very hard hitting film a film that we need right now in this time. Old Jane.

I'll become an 1115 and then it goes into on demand and digital HD on November 16 point yes I mean. I tuned all that good play anyways check it out is due this wonderful woman in cluster he I want to jump into this film because. As I mention it it's if we need right now and I am gonna give a little bit of the backdrop to analogy would be able of course fill in the blanks here. It it's about. A young girl whose very care free who. Is is learning to exist in this case where her mother has a new found religion that she's very adamant about and is very important to her. And she still trying to figure hurt the young girls her that her identity identity in the midst of all it. And you play these wonderful young actresses mob there. And talk a little bit about your role of the mother's name is G yes and she is a whether or meet meet and an era in meant meteorologist at you can feel what his low ever there were bent at. A meteorologist. Talk a little bit about your role. Obviously as Jed. And what attracted you to this since they narrative. Why wasn't occupation. You how do you ever see let human meteorologist. Steve fee and now it was this though I Lee. Lou is a on air camera personality. And a woman who is searching. Or are leaks in the world and either woman who's constantly. Reinventing herself. And in this moment that we see her. The wave that it's been. A relationship with her daughter Liz before this moment her best brand. It's very interesting because it is a time both of these women's lives are they are gearing out who they are. And as a seventeen year old girl have such a huge change. Happening in your house old. It relieved it's a strain on their relations and so it was just. I'm thing that I think we've never seen. Women of color do in. The black list from the period in America and in the film is not something that we relieves lower. Especially within the African American immunity. And so it was just an honor to be able all the story which is partly biographical. I Nigel movement whose right in. And you know before we delve more into this this this role in your character. What was your experience with Islam what did you know about it. On an end Howell. Essentially did you have to educate yourself if if that needed to hacked into do you prepare for this role. I had a hand tremendous honor of workshop in a play maybe or years prior to this project. In the character was Muslim living in Iraq with art black. And so I had ten all of this research of Islam during that time. And being able to or having to bid on learns a in order to age aid because this is a woman who is just finding. Religion so everything is new so are the audience you get to go through all of the new newness of are discovering Islam. And for me that was. You know it's it's a beautiful thing I a numbered it's Sheehan of the UN arms when he areas and well. And so some of that same excitement and passion and sense of belonging. Comfort at I know that I found. When I converted christianity is the same. Emotional journey the AG eight. In the same way that her immunity her family her job everyone is looking Ehrlich a listens. Half that your choosing I had some of the same reactions from the people that I knew. You know an art in America we live in a pro dom into our country and so it's not. Something that is. You don't normally ball. In the same way that they do when someone Islam but there's still the same. Need for people to kind of. Adjust and you are now and so that was this wonderful element of this or did you hear. In a powerful one as well didn't really show that you know. This is something that is very much ar to Ers and let's talk about that element of how this becomes a part of who jade is in how of that. As a result affects her daughter in very deep way om and only give too much away because of course. I want to go out and watch this and NCA it. But you know. The climate that we're in again you know there is a Lotto and in fact a better way of seeing ignorant about the religion people just don't know. Really what it means an end and in what the beliefs are. And I know you said that this was partly are autobiographical. On did you feel a certain. Wait for. You know just an eggs extent of saying okay this is somebody's gory now. I need to have this conversation and to say make sure I do this and it and give this just as. What was that conversation like with the director. And eagle a shorter version of that if you you know just in the sense of do you feel there was a certain man Gator thing that you had to be able to accomplish in this role. I think for myself I felt a responsibility. You betrayed. This woman and her story honestly. And Nigel and I did have a chance to rock and leave before we started filming 'cause this was currently hearse orient. As she was sharing something that was so in me she gave me a lot of back ground information on how she created this air fares. When it was issues and get I'm cross on screen. The fact is. You know we are living in a Iman of Islam phobia especially in our country. And to label in higher religion. This is millions and millions of all of the world. As one comes out of featuring he's all. And it's wrong and it's it's something that continues to divide us. In this country and globally Morin more every day and so Nigel a really wanted to. Share with people the beauty and the love and the community that she grew up. And in some of the things it's about word are some of the moment that we see in the filmed is multi tells things like smell. A prayer. Than rituals that they act is all on prom. A very loving lays the knee and neck with creator in a way they. It's very. Devout how. And in it there is no hatred in that. And so I felt a responsibility. In you know show this woman who is very much like we all are someone who is searching. And find something that is that missing. Enacting that we all. Identify with at whether it. A lifestyle change or help change or a change of religion. All of these things are things that we do to better ourselves. As human being on this journey that we all might. And there was a responsibility to. Show moved black Muslim community but also Muslim. As people who were just like math ain't been left it Riley loved me majoring in grieve. All the same. And so yeah I'm honored to be able to I'll just. Small portion of new and you know as you guys check it out it's after me do it just listen and keeping that. Did you find this to be one of your more challenging roles you've an array of stuff from you know. Action to weigh denied and he'll you know tapping into something like this I would deem to be. Not an easy feat show how. Would you say this would. When he moved I say that. This. It challenging part about this RJ with the amount of I'm. I had to hew to. You know independent films. In to have smaller budget. Murders shooting schedules and you just have less crimes are at that at the time that we are filming in. Even tire issues with maybe I did he day. And hour with there was. Babies seven of those days if that. At the same time I was filming back in New York. I had to fly in now in order to shoot so we've minimally but shoot we literally shot Al. All of my work in a matter of needs and so. Unlike you know bigger budget project or EB shows were you. We visit the character that episode and you maybe I'm these out of this episode in. Raft that story this was a much asked eight. And say you had to. Com the work repaired there is no elect and his. Figured out on the day late and now you have to know where where you are in this. This part of the story in in this woman's life and so I would say that that was challenging. But not. Anymore and then any other project because everyone came with their a in work opposite. Lori Renee who is of a nominal young actors he's absolutely beautiful in this role. And she takes are crafts though seriously that. You know you hear about younger act introduced in Latin are we doing today in his own way who knows what they did the night or in Delhi was always. Mayor Brady aimed. And then I get to work my husband. Who is you know my best acting partner in so it's almost like cheating in terms of working really. Up a more about that I find that so gray I mean you would think that. Working with a south Oracle's family member might be a little inner being because in my head I don't know. What I am always curious about that I mean do you feel like you know they say iron sharpens iron do you feel like he helps you to be your best. You know I am still might guess where they tears mining. Not a 100%. This project was maybe. Ward on camera job that we attend together. And the Ers teacher now. Every. Urgent that we do together it's a different phase of her relations. That we played fiance is we've my boyfriend and girlfriend. We played mortal enemies in Luke cage season to that he with our groups and I was misty neck and in this weekly ex husband and wife. And so. He is my my favorite acting partner but by that I insure that iron and oh. I know that I can trust use. Yeah you know. It's so funny people don't. Maybe they do know that you know with acting you've you've got it's a partnership and even their some people who were Alfred. And I give union. And save in all of it from my my car reached my shack. And then you know you have a yeah it's like you're acting opposite of a brick wall. And biggest into the camera turns around them they've got the waterworks crying nearly all of emotion and passion he let we're I don't sat. With my husband he comes in he brings it every single time. We just had the opportunity to work together on his shows CBS's. A mes story. The new show on CBS on access and deeply husband and wife Mary thank. It it's easier every time doesn't matter what we're doing in the we act together every day. I love that isn't it it's great to hear that you know it just makes you smile bigger Breyer because of the fact that you happen. Natural effortless chemistry rarely had been hey area and air row I think that it was behaving and at Heinz history and lending needs. Yes I do have to delve into what you just mentioned as human league board enemies because I was and am still a huge fan of Luke cage. Yeah and first question. You know every. He has been so great it and you work with such an amazing cast. You know had used pop to them since even news of the cancellation and let what has that conversation than Mike and everybody has been saying or would move being an. You know I spoke tail and all that good stuff so what has been deemed resounding. SoundBite from them I mean you know I got to work with like he says some amazing actors I'm of whom have been. In this industry for one. EO Rossini might old there all of these amazing. People who have been working and all of us were so I've been in. And I think it'd definitely hit a marvelous art than a hit other's. There is this understanding in this disputed nothing. And you know I am honored to have been able to miss. Roof or different. Season you know with Luke agencies who won and you and it's been. Defenders and so when I signed up to lead this woman I didn't know what was what was gonna happen how many seasons of the show we were gonna have how many different. Joe's they were gonna put me on in so it was. Definitely and tremendous blessing and I'm I wish that we were able to give ends a different kind of Indian in this story by. You know everything happens we the oath and in. Well alone in believing that Aries if it isn't it would be another adoration of the air here's somewhere else. Will have. Well that's what people are patiently waiting on a double forming it into that adoration. You don't. I know there's been a lot of conversation and when I am he pretty much saying you know heaters there is division there was an a planned. Do you are you aware of what that season three of the cage was going to look like heat even in Russia's. Yeah. Yes I mean I can most certainly say that chair and I sat down and we sat down after eaten. In rap he onto your scene unit off when. We went to dinner and I was like okay. This is what I need from his need for us it's the her arm reborn. As we just destroyed. At the end of its knees and you. And so that was definitely on the dock and then more of she is and should. You know we knew Lou origins or at least that these once he's in his father's. A little bit more of who he was as a man. We did see these beautiful story with Mariah and Alfre Woodard a daughter. How she came to be who she lives as militia death. Watch on greens I was like. Press this is this he's back story that's what we're. Looking forward to buy it. The villains that he wanted to in news. Characters that he went to bring we're really writing. And he's leaf it means of Ers it says grow I have not. And the chance read them yet. If you know it's it's one of those things where. Who knows. How bees characters will ever com. In if they Willard they won't let you know fans will be enabled live on effort you know. When he six episode on naturally on each. And then you know this iteration. Which I'm sure you've heard many times what it will what the fans want weather started to drag and or you know I air. First off. Obviously. You're definitely willing and able and I am assuming that have gat but I act. Brantley and and in that you know what would be the take no you know for the heat it was hopefully you know the regal birth of arm and it was the back story. Would you like to see that go into that potentially. Would you like to be something completely different. I think. Jessica Hanik who plays Colleen wing and this were able to find such delicious. Relationship where when I was on iron this it was. Really a British have developed a love her that. Mainly to issues such knee. Wonderful act her. Eight with our all of the spent each species doing them herself. Spends hours in the Dojo burning the right rare is absolutely amazed. And so I think that whoever. Weeks on the show if there was ever to be one. Would need to play up on the fact that these are used strong women come from different backgrounds. Who. Are able to address. Issues that are that affect women and women of Eleanor I mean you know one of the amazing things about just Joan. Was that this is a superhero who's a woman who a whole other set of issues and it. A daredevil and iron as we age it asked. And that was the thing that really drew audiences in to her story he's. You mean with rate ESE. Abusive relationship. All of these things. Our intrinsic to their email Erie. And so I think any woman who handles story. Dark as the rag and would have our rich minefield. Of with Muriel navigate when it goes through women experiencing the same thing with it being women. I mean act. That would be ideal if we can get that and I hope that's gonna happen in some way shape or form. Now just. Still. It's a gulp of you know we signed an added I'm whole night you know I I just can't take much more back up alone. Now I don't did the defenders is always goes to be winds. Mini series they're yet. Just outlets to India and build likes to defend island New York have some big hitting Aaron. Aren't well you know I can talk about does all of they have lowers blood you know that the film Portman really talk. About the film Jan and I I think it's excellent and I think that people do need to see this. I I just went askew. If anything what would you hope and I think at that you know and in our conversation here. Is that ultimate take away for you all we're gonna tune in because this could be. In some way shape or form a little too cool a teaching tool for those who. Media or new new convert your meteor or are talking about faith in their homes and really know all you know this ace because of unfortunately the ignorance and has been you'd about certain religions. That you know they don't really know how to open up a conversation actually let me what do you O would be the tickle you do it so. Into seeing this film is not one thing. We look at in this oh. This woman converting to Islam and out. Of an impact makes on we heard he Summers wife or daughters I've. It's also story. Young girl. Finding hearse. And I think that that is something that so many did with male or female old or young. Black white Latino. Native American Asian it is coming of age story about. Girl living in Los Angeles. And that things she hath EO. Things it. Young people. Deal with every single day social media. And how to exist within that how to participate and not allow for it in change who you are or EU law. The Emmy. Actuality you know this is a girl who his ex lowering. She is as a woman and I think we can all think about what timeless ourselves we were seventy. And trying to figure ourselves out I mean when I think about who I was at 17 and who I am now I'm thankful that. I had people around me who allowed me grow but Matt. Heart of this film is watching. These two women trying to give themselves and figure out there I didn't and remained in. I think that if you are someone whose periods about. It's common and what religion represent in this is an added. Only to see because it's not again it's not. You know. Spitting down in Spain this is what it is you should read this. It's just showing people living and living a life and I think it soaks nationally such a special home and not one and acting that it. And really changed you have. People have seen readings and a late New York. Axis and one day. And had people come up and tell me how in Morton. Was homeless on and so I just hope people don't. It hot. Off by now this is owned by Islam and then immediately shut down because I think the ad is way you know people who are. Areas. And misrepresent in this eat what a tale which opened your arms in your mind. And so it's like. You know breaking bat was a peek inside of a teacher living Albuquerque and cook in drugs in the in the basement. This is as slice and on trade and the world that maybe you've never seen growth. Debuted at least act in ain't you. Of course you guys needs this is a filmed ornaments. Content now. November 15 and it hit. Green near you know abandon.

Our justice correspondent all somewhere else parks deputy political director we come T today obviously on the heels of yet another. Deadly shooting in this country mass shooting this one the deadliest since the Parkland high school shooting earlier in the year. Left seventeen kids dad the death total in Thousand Oaks, California. 1112. Including the shooter overnight simply a tragic scene at a country western bar there and community. Full of college students and our Natalie brewer now. Joins us now she's live in that community she knows it very well she went to school there are Natalie. I imagine that if there's certainly been an outpouring of grief this afternoon. Absolutely seven if it's very close to home and my heart goes out for all of the college students that were in there as well as that the college communities including Pepperdine University. Where we have learned that one of the students. Was among the extent that we are standing right across the street from the bar where. It's how behind me there are a lot of command units. And a massive law enforcement presence that is still here. Canvassing the scene for evidence is all. Unfolding last night at about 11:20 PM when the gunman went into the borderline barring Grail here in Thousand Oaks. And some great big area with bullets killing a bouncer first and then hiding inside. I'm and shooting victim inside people and went into a state of chaos people throwing chairs through windows trying to get to safety and helping each other. I get to first responders. And right now we're learning a little bit more about this. Suspected gunman 28 year old. I in the long heat and with a battery of the United States Marine Corps and we know that he had several run in. With the law enforcement but really the big question is what was the motive why would he choose this. Area the target because as you mentioned. So many college students here last night it was actually college tonight and this happened on Wednesday I remember it from my time at Pepperdine. And this is a night where 1819 to one year old. Were able to come here they got and act on their hands it's his signal to the bartenders that they were not old enough to drink. The aim here was it. To drink it was really did just go wow how fun dancing around line dancing night helped the dancing night. And this is really hitting the community hard to say an absolutely heartbreaking tragedy. Natalie thank you so much for that report and we know you'll see on the story for ABC news peer. You know he feels like we've been here so many times before just last week. It feels so long ago but that shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh eleven dead senseless acts they keep happening. We can talk about guns we have some guests coming up to talk about that but also seems here with the former marine potentially some mental health issues at play. It looks like it there was an incident in April and neighbors are telling. Some of the reporters there that the mother was concerned about. Acts of violence are prone. To violent outburst if you will. In one particular call there was a lot of banging on the walls when neighbor described the mother is telling them that her walls had been kicked in. So that was the state of the home so. Police came to the scene apparently there was some conversation about whether he should give a psychological evaluation. Nothing was done or nothing was found not enough evidence to have and committed. And no. Stop put on his ability to buy weapons and apparently bought the weapon legally and as you said. The country is dealing with an increasing number of mass shootings are increasing in frequency and larger and larger in scale. Just a thumbnail search since last on October. Las Vegas have been at least six of these type issues including yesterday with a 129. People killed. This is simply incredible and we know that two of our guests joining us now. Doctor Jon Ash and ABC news medical correspondent of course. Mark Kelly former astronaut and gun control advocate joins us as well it's great to have both them in this conversation mark let me start with you. From you we don't know what's your reaction to 222 this this latest killing in in the context of the numbers peiris siding and your efforts seems. We've been here so many times in just the past year lot of positive momentum lot of young people out there and yet these things simply keep happening. Well we've got 4% of the world's population and 46%. Of the world's firearms we've got more. Guns and people and we make it very easy for people who are. Have mental health issues are felons even. League lead in that suspected terrorists can buy firearms and our country. So we've got a lot of loopholes in the laws we've got to fix than California actually has done. A pretty good job at this. It's not gonna stop everything. Several years ago in California there was a gun violence restraining order that was passed through ballot initiative at what that means is. If you identify a family member or friend who you feel is a danger. In danger of shooting themselves or somebody else you can have that firearm pretty easily removed from the from the home under current law in California. Obviously you know this this person slip through those cracks but you know we know that with stronger. Gun laws there is less gun violence that's clear across the country it's clear across the planet as well. So we've it would just got to do a better job we had an election that. Really spoke to this just two days ago the pass is gonna allow us to make some serious change in congress. And I do want to ask you about that in a second who want to bring jobs doctor Chan Ashton into this as well doctor rationing does scene here is mark was saying that. The mental health system. Sort of failed to cash sister felt the reporter the systems work there are on the suspect had been getting some help had been seen and been on the radar. Com. What's the fix for that and why can't we seem to to break through and stepping up the availability of those resources. You know I think when you talk about the mental health issue here they're really two elements are two sides admit that we need to be aware of number one. The shooter. In many many cases of these horrible tragedies. There is a clear mental health or mental illness angle to this. Because otherwise. A scene healthy person could not possibly do. 21 other human being let alone many others. What went a lot of these people do that's the case in the majority of cases not all but the majority so what do we need to do for that. The things that mark Kelly was just talking about we need to treat this no differently than if you saw someone bleeding on the street or having a seizure on the street. We hoped you wouldn't just walk over that person you would bring them to medical attention or bring medical attention to them. If you feel that someone is in danger of hurting themselves or someone else. We need to drop the stigma that's associated with mental illness and get that person help. That's one aspect the other aspect here which is very very important for all of us to keep in the front of our minds and hearts on a daily today. Is that when we keep hearing and seeing. Tragic and violent cases of violence particularly gun violence lake we're seeing now a lake wesun Pittsburgh. It takes its hold on all of our mental health and condition you can't watch these things were here about them. And not empathize and sympathize with the victims their families the first responders and that. Does psychological stress and damage to us as a society that we need care for so we need to care for the victims we need to care for. Be shooters in many cases and we need to care for ourselves. It you've heard people talking about. Cases like this fall into the cracks and not talk to law enforcement officials around the country one of the things they mentioned is that. When you have police or others in the government own community if you will who have interactions with someone who's showing some level of distress or violence particularly if that the police have an encounter. They say that there's got to be a better way for the system to blink or read if that person goes in to tried to buy a weapon. Elise to let law enforcement no hey that person that you had a conversation with two months ago six weeks ago. This person is trying to buy a weapon so that could be some sort of follow even if you don't confiscate weapons. And I want to put that to mark Kelly mark in trying to find some common ground here does seem that mental health protections. Restrictions on gun buyers seems to be one of at least from recent polling the pew institute. Had 89% of gun owners in non gun owners alike supporting. Preventing people with mental illnesses from getting. Be able to purchase a weapon. You have your pulse on congress in the legislative pipeline is there an effort afoot could we see something take place on mental health in this new congress to think. What we could look let me just say when you say 80% of Americans that's true right 94% of Americans. Support. Universal background checks for all gun sales 67%. Support stronger gun laws to protect people from gun violence. That does not extend to the gun lobby that though and that's part of the problem is that fell. At about every turn will oppose. What seems to the rest of us to be common sense legislation let me give you an example. Under current federal law. The veterans administration. Consent names. To the national instant criminal background check system of people that they really feel are a danger to themselves or others there's a 174000. Of those. In the system and those people are in theory prevented from buying a firearm. The problem with this says. Just about two years ago the House of Representatives try to undo that with a new piece of legislation I think it was eight Charlotte and 81. To try to remove that from the system it hasn't been debated in the senate. War voted upon we hope it doesn't pass but my point yes even when it comes to mental health. And keeping guns out of the hands of people that are. Potentially dangerously mentally ill we have the National Rifle Association. And some members of congress a lot of home. Largely from the Republican Party work against us. This congress though this election two days ago was a referendum on gun safety. An NBC poll showed that it was the top it was a set you know second most important issue. Among Democrats fourth most important overall. People want to see some change and now we have a House of Representatives that can deliver that. You a Newser sure did your organization. Michael Bloomberg's every time for gun safety also had some electoral success as we saw on the number of races Mary else distracting those. Virginia Pennsylvania Colorado Arizona Minnesota candidates sweeping in. On platforms running on platforms for gun violence safety protections. And I know you'll knock was able in a lot of ways to. How climber is for a lot of those candidates. From emails and to what has been sort of a fundraising and manage that and carrying it backed candidates and how in the past can you see it's not did you feel like this year you had. More power not stand. Yeah well we we endorse 307 candidates 249 number 195. Of them are going to congress. The NRA lost 333. Of their. Top rated people from the House of Representatives. Not only did we you know help raise money for candidates we raise money ourselves and spend money. On this issue to get people elected office. In one key in in the case of four house races we we put up about seven million dollars to hope these people and we we had people across the board both Democrats and some Republicans by the way that ran on a platform of gun safety. So this issue one at the ballot box in the House of Representatives. Here couple days ago and now we're gonna we're gonna pass some legislation in the house and now it's gonna go over to the senate. To see if they're just gonna sit by and do nothing which is typical or they're going to feel some pressure to actually act. You know what percent like to put to both of you. That actually came from from a fact sheet that the difference group put outs just today your group but I just today. So that women in the United States eleven times more likely to be murder with a gun and peers in other country we often see that women are more likely to be victims. Why is Matt. Well it's cause of domestic violence a lot and women are more often in. Shot and killed by people they know where for men and it's more likely that it comes from a stranger. Strong domestic violence legislation why ache. Ability he clover charts a sponsor of in the United States and it. Can really go a long way to protecting women from gun violence. I think it comes back to the fact and and this is coming from a gun owner somebody who served in the military for 25 years I'm a supporter of the Second Amendment. But when we have. 46%. Of the world's firearms among 4% of the world's population. We've got a lot of guns and made very frequently wind up in the wrong hands so because of that. We need to take extra steps to make it hard for certain people to get guns and we generally don't do that. And doctor Ashton one of those low hanging pieces of fruit if you will for. Gun safety advocates here also even the NRA in some cases seems to be re starting some government or search on the gun violence epidemic in this country it effectively hasn't taken place aren't any. Government studies by the CDC since 1997. Since the so called Dickey amendment went into place some effort now to get better or how important is it to get those do get that data to get the CDC to look at this. As a health and safety problem for America. It's important. You know we're starting to see more of it in the medical literature. There have been articles about guns. And gun violence and gun shot wounds in OB GY and journals and pediatric journals. The CDC starting a chorus a little bit late but to be more aggressive with how they collect deed. But I I just want to get back to the to the issue about gun violence against women because I think. It really bears emphasis here that we hear so much now in the me to movement. About the path to parity in everything I want to be crystal clear in medicine in health. Women are. Decades behind where they should be in a country like the United States. And we need to change that there are major gender differences in Madison. And in terms of access of care care that women gad. Disease process sees that affect women differently than men and now we're hearing statistics like gun violence against women we have to be very careful when we say treat women exactly the same as men because in medicine at least. In some cases they shouldn't be treated exactly as men they're different in some ways they need more attention. Things occurred differently this is not a one size fits all approach in medicine and in science and I think to do that. Runs the risk of not giving women the care of the research and the attention that they need. An important reminder for sure as we all sort of hope. That this moment is a turning point and ways that others have not our thanks to mark Kelly. For joining us are alive today for his import and doctor Esther we know you're sticking around so thank you both. Very much for coming to the briefing room. Moving on today here Washington Mary Alice we've got continuing fallout from the firing of attorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday by president trump. And today scrutiny sort of focusing on his replacement ad the former chief of staff Jeff Sessions that would occur someone who has a controversial past. Are criticizing. In the Muller probes. And Democrats demanding that he also refuse himself. From oversight over the Muller investigation at this point that doesn't look likely. But politically really puts Democrats in a tough spot they wanted to come in with a new majority in the house and passed some legislation potentially on health care or crunch and and now almost as if the president. Daring them to work on investigations in this nature instead. And they are going to investigate in fact today right out of the gate a number of Democrats have sent letters to the White House asked him to preserve documents related to the firing of Jeff Sessions. Looking into the past of Matthew Whitaker. And our legal contributor Kate Schott joins us now by phone to talk a little bit more about that background how could impact a fight. Over the appointment of Matt would occur to be the acting attorney general Kate great to have you with us. We understand that the west wing is buzzing this afternoon over not bad that just posted in the Washington Post by the husband of Kellyanne Conway George Conway he's a constitutional. I scholar and he is raising some question as a contrarian and a contrarian. He is basically raises some questions that this is unconstitutional two point Matt would occur and take a look here he says that we can't tolerate. The evasion in the constitution's explicit presides design that mean that the senate has to confirm. Someone who is gonna lead the Justice Department. Matthew workers and nobody's job as chief of staff didn't require confirmation. And for the presence to install Matt when occurs the chief law enforcement officers to betray. The charter of the document the constitution. Does he have a fair point Kate shock. You know I think it's a joint op that the church currently authored with democratic lawyer Neal Cotts jell and this is the second recent upset because it and that Britain together. And the thing to be trying to make the point that certain constitutional principles transcend partisanship so they wrote an op Ed a couple of weeks ago. Arguing against the president proposal to end birthright citizenship and now we had this thought that that suggests. That installing without senate consideration or confirmation. Somebody to head the Justice Department is unconstitutional now there's a statute. That don't allow the president to insult someone on an acting basis but they're suggesting that in this instance that statute is unconstitutional. And no cut killed himself with actually the acting solicitor general under President Obama but he says. That was you know that's an inferior kind of position in the acting solicitor general at the couple bosses about him. The attorney general to the top of the Justice Department. Interpretation doubt important the constitution says the president had to nominate the senate had to take a look right nobody scrutinize the background of its individual. To assess you know the kind dispute he holds the kind of you know whether he's actually fit for a position like that and that they suggest it's unconstitutional and I'm not surprised her the west wing is buzzing about it. Yeah in fact they point out these two constitutional scholars that this has never before happened in those several hundred years as it as an attorney general of the United States been appointed without any confirmation any scrutiny as you point out to certainly unprecedented in many ways. I guess the next question is before that she OK can just be challenged who would bring a challenge to this appointment. Yeah I mean being in public anyone who is subject to any kind of action that initiated by the Justice Department could bring to challenge that the Justice Department is headed by an individual who has installed unconstitutionally. Center. You know it literally any action that there are that they take right now. Could be fraught become legal doubt you know I should say that just balancing it's not just. George Connolly but other prominent conservative thinkers including it looks like John you. Who was ahead of the opposite legal counsel under George W. Bush and awfully scary. Prominent conservative scholar and a proponent of executive power in presidential power also seem to agree that the took an unconstitutional claiming cook. I think we really your credit. A growing chorus. Are skeptics about the constitutionality of what it happened. I don't like that and I look at it quickly need to move to actually nominate someone and subject them to senate scrutiny. Or there could be I think period legal challenge you know in the very near future. And we don't like interest it's fascinating we know the White House those planning on taking their time and on naming the permanent replacement for Jeff Sessions case shot during us by phone. ABC news legal contributor think you so much Kate good job. Is shifting gears a little bit to mid term politics were still tracking the results from Tuesday night's historical actions Mary Alice and there are some cliff hangers out there in fact. I'm fascinated by what's going on in Florida and Andrew him gill on the Democrat African American candidate conceded now he's sort of walking it back. Right not a complete walk back but we all -- on election night there on stage kind of formally concede in front of the cameras. And yet asked me is absentee and provisional ballots have come in and the margin has really narrowed in his theater also in bill Nelson's favorite Democrat. Senate senatorial candidate now we're talking about the potential for recounts it's looking like we really could end up with in not margin that would trigger an automatic. Recap here about my last check just before we came to air they are under half a percent. Apart and that alone and we would be the which would be the trigger about 38000. Votes. And Andrew Young you saw they're just speaking says let's count every vote let's see it so that could be headed also in the senate race in Florida Bill Nelson Democrat Rick Scott. That's also a here sliver. And that was part of flat out ensured that all he is remaining prison about Scott county was a Bill Nelson said he wasn't going anywhere he he wouldn't concede he said he needed to keep counting. I'm and edit and so the margins have gotten this close unbelievably close it's possible we get a recount in. Well arts of flashbacks to 2000 and hanging chads and Lawrence Lindsey no interest saying it's often razor thin in Florida and that is why it is a truce there we could be headed to Florida soon broadcasting live from there were also keeping our eyes and the Georgia governor race Stacey Abrams. In a very close race there were trying camp although he's declared he's resigned today his post as secretary of state he's. Ready to move into his new day so he's experienced. Says we're counting every vote as. Ultimately her team demanding that every vote is counted we know it has some of the outstanding provisional ballots are in heavy democratic area so her team feels like it's in our interest to make sure that all those votes are counted. But it's of course not it's not necessarily. That she thinks she would surpass him in a total well count but keep him from an automatic victory because. In Georgia you have to get 50% plus one to not go chill. Run off election and it is back close in that narrow. Not so she's trying to hit the runoff threshold in the and we jetty on there as well. If you weak little Georgia winning Florida actions and initiatives on the number of our outstanding house races that have yet to be caught all right moving on and finally today speaking of Democrats and something that could send shivers down their spine. Liberal icon on the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg suffered an accident last night at the court she fell in her chambers according to the court. And it has been hospitalized she is still like George Washington University Hospital she broke three ribs were told. At 85 years old that is no insignificant thing we have doctor Jan Ashton is back with us doctor Jan. Give us that your sense obviously not seen her first hand or seeing her chart but how serious is something like some broken ribs in a fall at age 85. Serious I have really anything that happens and someone who is 85. Even in the best of health could be potentially serious that's why there's a whole specialty in medicine called geriatrics. To take specialized care for for people in this age group. They are more susceptible to complications. For the scene type of injury or disease as a younger person would be but here's what I really want people to know about rib fractures. They are excruciatingly. Painful and that's when just. One rim is fracture broken when you have multiple fracture rinse used to think about it is impossible to rest the rib cage every time we take a breath. Those ribs are moving you can't put a cast on the ribs. Lake you Ken with a broken arm or broken leg so the the bulk of initial hospitalization. Is usually for pain control. But the other things you want to keep an eye on when you talk about an elderly person any internal bleeding weather at the fall that was strong enough. In some cases to break grids could cause a head injury although you know also if to remember that. Both men and women develop osteoporosis with age so often times can be an incredibly minor fall that causes a rib fracture in an elderly person. And then that things that we would watch down the road. Breathing pneumonia risk if you can't take deep breaths it does please see you at increased risk for pneumonia so. It's actually the opposite of counter intuitive thank you want to get someone up. And regulating moving around sitting up. As quickly as possible as long as their pain is well managed because. That's gonna generate the best air movement and the best environment for their lungs to help prevent. The onset of pneumonia but. She's one tough cookie cells. A tough I think. Probably out moving around right now I broke six ribs just a few years ago and she of course beat cancer. And we just sovereign and on doing daily pushups yeah. And she was he pumping some iron there she hired clerks to be with Richard Forney Forney says she is determined to stay on that court yet and we wish her well. We do thank you so much for sticking around Jan appreciate that very much. What a footnote to today's news out of the court president trump went to the court this afternoon for the investor ceremony for the newest Supreme Court justice for Kavanagh of course with greater Ginsburg wasn't there but I think we have a picture. Here's the president with his newest justices seeming mean he can't get enough of Brent Cavanaugh. And the pacers a big smiles there and of course fascinating to see the president. Among all those justices who Mary Alice could. Decide. Some pretty significant cases challenges perhaps involving the mall or investigation. Coming very soon. Among other things as well honest gerrymandering. Abortion case says. States are and it circuit courts I know that this is a very new Supreme Court and they're looking for cases that they potentially can work to get up to them thanks very fast. Are much more had from the Supreme Court and tomorrow here in the briefing room we thank you for joining us today of course you can follow the latest on all these stories and abcnews.com.

The Montreal-based company also announced the sale of its flight training business to CAE Inc. for about US$645 million.\n\nThe announcement comes after mass layoffs over the past three years, with about 14,500 positions cut around the world in the aerospace and railway divisions.\n\nBombardier shares tumbled by more than 24 per cent to $2.41 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange due to concerns over cash flow.\n\n\"With the measures announced, we are confident that we will be able to reach our goals in 2020,\" chief executive Alain Bellemare's said of his plan to reduce debt.\n\nLast year Bombardier sold a majority stake in its C Series passenger jet business to European aerospace giant Airbus for no cost. Montreal-based Bombardier had dreamed of capturing half the global market for 100-to 149-seat planes.\n\nKarl Moore, an aviation expert at Montreal's McGill University, said the layoffs and selloffs will allow Bombardier to shift away from regional jets and shrink its debt.\n\n\"The transportation side and business jets are clearly the central focus of Bombardier going forward,\" Moore said\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to add that Bombardier is saying there will be 500 cuts in Ontario, not 600", "Search crews have found eight more sets of remains in the burned-out rubble of Northern California, as officials there fear more deaths in the destructive wildfires raging at both ends of the state that has already claimed a total of 74 lives, including three lost in Southern California blazes.\n\nThe deadliest and most destructive of the two massive blazes is the Camp Fire in Northern California's Butte County, which has killed at least 71 people.\n\nThere were more than 1,000 people still missing in the Butte County fire zones on Friday night, though authorities were working to track them down. Officials asked residents to go to the Butte County Sheriff's Department's website to check the missing persons list to make sure they are not on it.\n\nTerray Sylvester/Reuters\n\nThom Porter, chief of strategic planning for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the death toll from the Camp Fire is expected to climb higher as search crews comb through more than 12,000 structures destroyed by the flames.\n\n\"It is by far the most deadly single fire in California history and it's going to get worse, unfortunately,\" Porter said of the Camp Fire.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown toured the devastation caused by the Camp Fire earlier this week with Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The government leaders visited the firefighters still battling the inferno, which has burned an area of 142,000 acres and obliterated the city of Paradise, ravaging nearly every home in the bucolic community of 30,000 people.\n\n\"This is one of the worst disasters I've ever seen in my career, hands down,\" Long said at a news conference Wednesday in Northern California.\n\nRingo H.W. Chiu/AP\n\nBrown said the destruction \"looks like a war zone.\" He said he spoke earlier Wednesday to President Donald Trump, \"who pledged the full resources of the federal government\" to help in the recovery effort.\n\nTrump said he plans to visit the area on Saturday to meet with survivors and firefighters.\n\nA public health emergency\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Wednesday declared a public health emergency in California, where the wildfires forced the evacuation of at least two hospitals and eight other health facilities.\n\n\"We are working closely with state health authorities and monitoring the needs of healthcare facilities to provide whatever they may need to save lives and protect health,\" Azar said in a statement. \"This declaration will help ensure that Americans who are threatened by these dangerous wildfires and who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have continuous access to the care they need.\"\n\nA smoke advisory was issued for portions of Los Angeles County amid concerns that smoke from the fires could present a \"significant health threat\" for people with asthma and other lung conditions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe best time to venture outside will be in the early afternoon, National Weather Service meteorologist Aviva Braun told reporters Wednesday night, blaming the light winds for the continued poor air quality.\n\nOn Saturday, stronger northeast winds mixing in the valley will help improve the air quality, according to Braun.\n\nLisa Almaguer, public information officer for Butte County Public Health, recommended residents stay indoors as much as possible and to wear properly fitting masks when going outside.\n\nIn addition, an outbreak of norovirus has occurred at one of the shelters, Almaguer said, describing its presence as \"not uncommon,\" especially at this time of year and \"with hundreds of people living in close quarters.\"\n\nPeople who are ill at the shelter have been taken to a separate location, are using separate restroom facilities and are being cared for by public health experts, according to Almaguer.\n\nNoah Berger/AP\n\nBattle rages on\n\nThousands of exhausted firefighters battling the Camp Fire in Northern California and the Woolsey Fire in Southern California appeared to be getting a handle on the two massive blazes this week.\n\nChief Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said weather conditions at both fires have improved and the strong winds firefighters were seeing over the past three days have started to dissipate.\n\nBut Pimlott said \"critical fire conditions\" still existed with an abundance of dry vegetation in both fire zones that could flare-up with the slightest spark.\n\nJohn Locher/AP\n\n\"We're not keeping our eye off this ball at all,\" Pimlott said Wednesday, adding that 9,000 firefighters were working on the front lines of both blazes.\n\nFirefighters, with the help of out-of-state fire crews, were showing progress in their twin battles to subdue the widely destructive blazes that have blackened a combined acreage larger than the size of New York City.\n\nThe Camp Fire showed \"continued activity\" on its northeast side, along the Feather River drainage basin, as it pushed toward the community of Big Bar, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection announced Tuesday night.\n\nThe lower part of the area continued to be a challenge because of the \"extremely steep, extremely rocky\" terrain, fire officials said.\n\nDry conditions will continue this week but precipitation is expected next week, Braun said.\n\nCamp Fire\n\nThe Camp Fire ignited Nov. 8 in Northern California's Butte County and has since burned an area of 142,000 acres. The flames were 45 percent contained on Friday morning.\n\nThe death toll from the monstrous blaze now stands at 71, making it the deadliest single wildfire in California's recorded history. Officials have tentative confirmation of the identities of at least 53 of those found dead, but are awaiting DNA confirmation, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters Thursday night.\n\nThe sheriff warned that the remains of some of the missing may never be recovered due to the severity of the fire.\n\nTwo prison inmate firefighters were among three injured battling the Camp Fire, fire officials told ABC News.\n\nStephen Lam/Reuters\n\nMany of the deaths from the Camp Fire have taken place in Paradise, which was virtually destroyed by the flames.\n\n\"The entire community of Paradise is a toxic wasteland right now,\" Paradise City Council Member Melissa Schuster, who lost her home in the calamity, told ABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast. \"In addition to that, and this is the hardest part for me to even talk about, is the number of fatalities is [among] things that we don't know at this moment and that's something that has to be determined before people can move back in.\"\n\nEric Thayer/Reuters\n\nSchuster said teams from the Butte County coroner's office are combing through thousands of destroyed homes and burned cars in Paradise.\n\n\"We will rebuild our homes, we will rebuild our town stronger, better, safer and more beautiful than ever,\" she told ABC News' \"Start Here\" podcast.\n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nThe Woolsey Fire, which also started on Nov. 8, rapidly spread from Southern California's Ventura County to Los Angeles County, jumping the 101 Freeway before sweeping through the celebrity enclaves of Malibu and Calabasas.\n\nAuthorities had warned the flames could potentially spread all the way to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt has burned 98,362 acres and was 78 percent contained on Friday night, as firefighters successfully stretched containment lines. But the blaze has already damaged or destroyed over 900 structures, including many homes and a legendary Hollywood film set.\n\nThe fire burned down a portion of Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills known as \u201cWestern Town,\u201d where hundreds of movies and television shows, including HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld,\u201d have been filmed, dating back to the 1920s.\n\nThe blaze has been blamed for the deaths of at least three people, and three firefighters sustained injuries while battling the flames, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nAFP/Newscom\n\nABC News' Karma Allen, Brandon Baur, Will Carr, Stacy Chen, Matthew Fuhrman, Marilyn Heck, Bonnie McLean and Daniel Peck contributed to this report", "Police say they are investigating a protest and vandalism at the home of Fox News host Tucker Carlson as a possible hate crime. It's the latest example of protesters targeting the personal lives of Trump administration officials and allies in the D.C. area.\n\nCarlson, in a phone interview with his network Thursday night, called the incident \"chilling\" and \"upsetting.\"\n\nWashington's Metropolitan Police Department reported that officers were summoned to Carlson's home Wednesday evening and found about 20 protesters and a commonly used anarchy symbol spray-painted on the driveway.\n\nA brief video posted on social media by a group calling itself \"Smash Racism DC\" shows people standing outside a darkened home and chanting, \"Tucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night.\"\n\nThe video was later removed from Twitter.\n\nThere were no arrests, but police confiscated several signs. The report lists the incident as a \"suspected hate crime\" on the basis of \"anti-political\" bias.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement that they welcome and support all expressions of free speech and First Amendment rights but that \"defacing private property\" is an obvious violation.\n\n\"We will work to hold those accountable for their unlawful actions. There is currently an open criminal investigation regarding this matter,\" the statement said.\n\nCarlson has been a major supporter of President Donald Trump and his policies. In recent months, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas were all either refused service or berated by protesters in area restaurants.\n\nCarlson was scheduled to be on vacation Thursday from his Fox News program, \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" but he called in to talk with substitute host Brian Kilmeade.\n\n\"They weren't protesting anything,\" Carlson said of the crowd. \"They weren't trying to change my mind or advocate for a position. They were threatening my family to get me to stop talking.\"\n\nWednesday's incident prompted reactions from across the political spectrum.\n\nA statement released by Fox News dubbed it \"reprehensible\" and called for more civil discourse at a time of intense political polarization.\n\n\"We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view,\" the statement said. \"Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation.\"\n\nFormer Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly tweeted that the incident was \"stomach-turning,\" and late-night talk show host Stephen Colbert, a frequent critic of Trump and Fox News, also condemned it on Twitter.\n\n\"Fighting Tucker Carlson's ideas is an American right. Targeting his home and terrorizing his family is an act of monstrous cowardice,\" Colbert wrote. \"Obviously don't do this, but also, take no pleasure in it happening.

But it can also be applied to Emmanuel Macron,\" Cizel told ABC News.\n\n\"The U.S. president sees Macron as a negotiator, a pragmatic. Trump likes these attributes,\" De Hoop Scheffer said.\n\n\"On the fight against global terrorism, most notably in Africa and Syria, there have been strong, concrete results by the two allies,\" De Hoop Scheffer added.\n\nBut Macron has failed to persuade Trump to remain in major international agreements, including the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement.\n\nUnable to influence Trump on these issues, the French president has chosen to adapt his strategy, according to V\u00e9drine.\n\n\"Macron has not given up on the personal friendship approach he put in place toward Donald Trump since the beginning,\" V\u00e9drine said. \"But he has completed it by pointing out disagreements between the two leaders.\"\n\nThose disagreements were on display at the UN General Assembly in September, where Trump and Macron's speeches revealed their two very different views of the international order. Trump\u2019s unilateralist agenda sharply contrasted with Macron\u2019s support for multilateralism and liberal values, De Hoop Scheffer said.\n\nThese two speeches marked a turning point, according to Cizel.\n\n\"It felt like President Macron was responding to President Trump point by point when he took the stage at the UN last September,\" Cizel said.\n\nThe challenge for the French president now is to reconcile the strong personal relationship he has created with Trump with his criticism over his approach to world affairs, V\u00e9drine said.\n\n\"Who knows: maybe one day Macron\u2019s method will bear its fruits,\" the former French foreign minister said.", "The midterm elections are over, but the contest for the year's best country songs is just around the corner at the 2018 Country Music Association Awards.\n\nThe two categories \u2014 song of the year and single of the year \u2014 look similar with three songs nominated in both, but the writers behind the hits say these awards are hard to predict.\n\nNominees include a monster pop song that went country, country songs that went pop, a message song for the #MeToo era and, of course, drinking songs.\n\nSong of the year is awarded to songwriters, while single of the year goes to the artist, producer and mixing engineer.\n\nThe CMA Awards will air live on Nov. 14 from Nashville, Tennessee. Here's a look at the single and song of the year nominees.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Drowns the Whiskey\" by Jason Aldean featuring Miranda Lambert, nominated for single and song of the year:\n\nThis song was originally pitched for country singer Tyler Farr, explains Josh Thompson, who co-wrote the song with Brandon Kinney and Jeff Middleton. When it didn't make Farr's album, Aldean grabbed it and turned it into a No. 1 hit.\n\nThe three writers were on the road in 2013 when they wrote it, staying up until 4:30 in the morning while drinking whiskey to finish it, Thompson said.\n\n\"I am huge believer in the idea that you've got to get in the character of your song,\" he said.\n\nThompson said the twist on a whiskey song and the opening line make it unique, but the production and turning it into a duet made the song sound like a new classic.\n\n\"It feels modern and timeless at the same time and the smoky Miranda notes in there just send it through the roof,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Broken Halos\" by Chris Stapleton, nominated for single and song of the year:\n\nMike Henderson has written with Stapleton for years, long before they were both in the bluegrass band The Steeldrivers and way before Stapleton broke out with his 2015 solo debut, \"Traveller.\"\n\n\"I was reading Keith Richards' biography and he had a chapter called 'Broken Halos,' and as soon I saw it, I was like, 'Whoa, song title,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe track won the best country song Grammy earlier this year, making it a strong contender in both CMA categories, and the emotional way Stapleton sings the song makes it a fan favorite.\n\n\"We've had a lot of folks say that the song had a really special meaning for them \u2014 people that have lost a loved one, who had been through some personal tragedy,\" Henderson said. \"It does seem to touch people, which as a songwriter, you're trying to do.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Tequila\" by Dan + Shay, nominated for single and song of the year:\n\nDan Smyers and Shay Mooney genuinely love tequila. They drink it on tour and at home, but the duo wasn't really looking for party song about getting drunk.\n\n\"So we flipped that,\" said Smyers. \"Tequila was basically the trigger that took you back to a certain place, so it's a nostalgic heartbreak song, which is kind of Dan + Shay's wheelhouse.\"\n\nThe song, co-written with Nicolle Galyon and Jordan Reynolds, crossed from country to pop radio, even peaking at No. 21 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Smyers said he's sees the crossover success as an advantage in building fans among people who don't traditionally listen to country music.\n\n\"This could be their gateway into country,\" Smyers said. \"They hear that song and say, 'I love that,' and flip over to the country station.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Meant to Be\" by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line, nominated for single of the year:\n\nIt's the song that has dominated country music for all of 2018. The inescapable, record-breaking monster hit has surpassed 1 billion streams, achieved four-times platinum status and reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 chart.\n\nSongwriter David Garcia wrote the song in Los Angeles with Rexha, FGL's Tyler Hubbard and songwriter Josh Miller and it was originally released on Rexha's 2017 EP, \"All Your Fault: Pt. 2.\"\n\n\"There is a little more merging of L.A. and Nashville now more than ever,\" Garcia said.\n\nGarcia said while he'd love to see the song win, he's not putting any bets down. He attributes the song's success in part to Rexha's huge streaming popularity.\n\nBut it's also a polarizing contender with many arguing it's not a true country song and its crossover success could turn off some more traditionally-minded CMA voters.\n\nGarcia said he doesn't concern himself with those critics.\n\n\"I believe we're in an amazing place where the fans and the listeners decide what their favorite songs are,\" he said. \"I think the song is undeniable in what it is.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Body Like a Back Road\" by Sam Hunt, nominated for song of the year, and \"Drinkin' Problem\" by Midland, nominated for single of the year:\n\nBoth songs were created in part by the songwriting-producing power duo Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, but they are on different spectrums of the genre.\n\nSam Hunt's 2017 hit crossed to pop and became a five-times platinum success with a catchy, finger-snapping rhythm. But even McAnally admits to being a bit surprised about seeing it pop up on the nominee list again after it lost last year in the same category (\"Better Man,\" written by Taylor Swift for Little Big Town, won the prize).\n\nEven though it was not released in the eligibility period, Hunt's song made the second ballot because it remained a Top 5 country single. The fact that \"Body Like a Back Road\" hasn't won any CMA Awards, despite being nominated three times, suggests that pop crossovers might not be the key factor to winning.\n\n\"There's a five-way race for this one,\" McAnally said of the song of the year category. \"There's not a 'Girl Crush' that feels like a steamroller. I just don't know who could win.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Midland broke out as a neo-traditionalist band with \"Drinkin' Problem,\" a George Strait-style throwback.\n\n\"I would love to see it win single of the year because of its traditional sound,\" McAnally said. \"(Single of the year) is about commercial impact, but I've always thought about it as the sound of the record.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"Drunk Girl\" by Chris Janson, nominated for song of the year:\n\nMost country singers steer away from politically charged topics, but during the #MeToo movement, Janson had a pointed message for men. \"Take the drunk girl home,\" he sings, and walk away.\n\nJanson said he wrote the song with Tom Douglas and Scooter Carusoe long before #MeToo spread virally last year, but with Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings this year, the song was relevant enough to gain a nomination.\n\n\"I am not really a soapbox guy,\" Janson said. \"I just write what I write and sing what I sing. I do believe in the message very powerfully and I am glad that it is connecting.\"\n\nCMA voters do like message songs: Tim McGraw's \"Humble and Kind\" and Kacey Musgraves' \"Follow Your Arrow\" both won because they had something important to say. But the bluntness of the song has given some critics pause, most notably when a New Yorker column called it a \"#MeToo misfire.\"\n\nBut Janson says he's not trying to appeal to everyone.\n\n\"I've never really tried to sell this song to anybody or shove it down anybody's throat,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://cmaawards.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Kristin M.

Shawn McKnight released a complete list of the names that followed an internal investigation begun in February. The list includes 25 priests from the diocese, three priests from other areas who previously served in the Jefferson City diocese, and five members of a religious order.\n\nFourteen of the 33 men named are dead. Many of them are elderly. The diocese said the most recent case of physical sexual abuse found in the investigation occurred in 1997. He said only one man on the list was criminally convicted.\n\n\"Although the incidents are in the past, the pain caused is still a present reality for the survivors of abuse and their loved ones,\" McKnight said in a statement. He apologized for the actions of the priests and brothers, \"and the incomplete transparency we have lived under by not making all their names public.\"\n\nMcKnight said another 18 allegations have been made since August, and internal investigations into some of those claims are ongoing. He encouraged any additional victims to come forward.\n\nMcKnight said the diocese has spent $2.3 million on survivors of abuse since July 2003 and $2.1 million on the care of \"credibly accused diocesan priests.\"\n\nDavid Clohessy, St. Louis director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, called the list \"irresponsibly and painfully short on details.\"\n\nMcKnight \"should reveal where each of these men worked, when they were accused, when those allegations were deemed credible, why the years of secrecy, and where the men are now,\" Clohessy said in a statement.\n\nMcKnight told reporters that he was not \"trying to hide something\" by declining to say where the men had served. He said many of them had served in a variety of places. He said it would be misleading to report only where allegations were made and also said some victims asked him not to reveal that kind of information.\n\nThe internal investigation is unrelated to an investigation announced in August by Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, in which the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, the Diocese of Jefferson City, the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau and the Archdiocese of St. Louis all agreed to open their records.\n\nHawley's announcement came amid renewed concern about sexual abuse by priests that followed the release of a scathing report in Pennsylvania citing abuse of more than 1,000 children by hundreds of priests since the 1940s, along with cover-up by church leaders.\n\nMary Compton, a spokeswoman for Hawley, said that investigation is \"active and ongoing,\" but offered no timetable for when it will be completed.\n\n\"We are working as quickly as possible to carefully and thoroughly review all evidence obtained by our office,\" Compton said in a statement. \"The Pennsylvania Grand Jury completed its work in two years.

I can have any woman I want to, but younger age makes things better,\" Ratelband said.\n\n\"I look younger, but I don\u2019t want to lie about it,\" he added, mentioning that his current age has made it more difficult to find matches on the Tinder dating app.\n\n\"When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer,\u201d Ratelband said, according to the BBC. \u201d When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position.\"\n\nBrimming with confidence, Ratelband said he was inspired by Tony Robbins, an American motivational guru, who believes that visualization is the first step to making your dreams come true.\n\nThe father of seven boasts a healthy lifestyle \u2014 having quit smoking, drugs and alcohol in 1986 \u2014 as medical evidence that he is, in fact, a man in his 40s.\n\n\u201cMy body and my mind is of a 40-year-old person,\u201d said Ratelband. \u201cThat\u2019s how I identify myself. I am not a victim of Peter Pan syndrome. There are medical experts who have tests to prove that.\u201d\n\nOfficials are reportedly skeptical that the courts will grant Ratelband the change in his birth certificate. Currently, there is no legal mechanism to change one\u2019s birth date in Dutch courts, according to the BBC.\n\nIt is not the first time that Ratelband has come to the authorities with an eccentric request. In March 1977, he was denied permission by town officials to name his twins Rolls and Royce. They ended up being named France and Minou, although they are still known to family and friends as the name of the luxury car brand.\n\nRatelband remains hopeful that his request will be granted and will greatly improve his quality of life, saying, \u201cIf I\u2019m 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a new, better car. I can get more work, and dating prospects are better.\"", "The mayor of Moscow has decreed that a square near the headquarters of Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service be named after Kim Philby, the Briton who was the most successful Soviet double agent of the Cold War period.\n\nMayor Sergei Sobyanin signed the order on Tuesday. The move comes amid tensions between Russia and Britain over this year's nerve agent poisoning of Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury.\n\nPhilby joined Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service in 1940, eventually heading its counterespionage division and serving as intelligence liaison with the United States.

Cuba imports most of its food products from abroad, a multibillion-dollar market that has flourished despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nRelations between both countries normalized somewhat after former U.S. President Barack Obama loosened the trade embargo while in office. But President Donald Trump has intensified sanctions, making it harder for Americans to travel to Cuba and conduct business.\n\nIn 2017, the United States sold $260 million of food to the Cuba, but the figure was one of the lowest in this decade and paled in comparison to the $450 million of U.S. food sold in 2012.\n\nThe island still cannot sell its own products in the U.S. and is not given credit to help pay for imports as a result of the embargo.\n\nCuba spends about $2 billion a year to import food for its 11 million citizens, who are given almost free rations each month of products such as chicken, rice and milk.\n\nPhil Peters, a trip organizer, said U.S. agribusiness is interested in exporting more products to Cuba and improving regulatory conditions, and in \"building a broader and more normal relationship in which there is investment and shared business.\"\n\nAbout 30 participants were meeting with officials at the conference and visiting farms and cooperatives in the Caribbean nation.

It recommends cooking turkey to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees, and washing hands and counters that touch uncooked meat.", "While President Donald Trump said he \"stopped the blue wave\" by Democrats as a result of his campaigning for Republican candidates, there were significant wins in historically-red strongholds across the country.\n\nAn exit poll analysis by ABC News showed that across the nation, Americans were ready for change in the House. Voters 53-43 said they'd rather see Democrats in control of the House after this election and the results in some historically Republican districts reflect just that.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a state Trump owned by 36 points in 2016, Democrat Kendra Horn flipped Oklahoma's 5th district seat, which has been represented by a Republican for 44 years. The president won the district by double digits and GOP Rep. Steve Russell won his first election there in 2014 by 23 points.\n\nHorn edged Russell out of the seat by just two points, according to ABC projections, based on exit polling. Russell's campaign raised less than $1 million and got almost no money from outside groups. Comparatively, Horn was able to attract some national attention and pulled in about half a million dollars from billionaire Democratic donor Michael Bloomberg's Super PAC, Independence USA.\n\nAhead of the election, ABC News partner FiveThirtyEight forecasted Horn had a one in seven chance of winning.\n\nThe 5th district is now the lone congressional seat in the state represented by a Democrat. Horn told ABC affiliate KOCO-TV she planned to focus on health care and education, which was where she staked most of her campaign.\n\n\"We talked about health care, we talked about education and all of these people are the ones who helped make it happen,\" Horn said. \"It's a historic election moment for a number of reasons. I am the third woman ever elected to represent Oklahoma in Congress, and we are talking about issues that are so important.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, two incumbents -- one a three-term Republican and the other a Democrat who won a special election earlier this year -- battled for the recently redistricted 17th congressional district. Rep. Conor Lamb successfully unseated three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the race.\n\nThe race grew more complex after the state\u2019s Supreme Court found the old congressional map violated the state's constitution through a partisan gerrymander. As a result, experts predicted that over the long term, Democrats could expect to pick up one or two seats with the state Supreme Court's newly redrawn map.\n\nGene J. Puskar/AP\n\nLamb's success in the district may also have been a result of his more conservative views. He has sided with Trump -- who won the district by nearly 20 points in 2016 -- on issues involving steel and aluminum tariffs, and personally opposes abortion, but backs the Supreme Court's decision to legalize it.\n\nThe Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor defeated Republican Rick Saccone in a March 2018 special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District. The seat was left open after GOP Rep. Tim Murphy resigned after a report that he had asked an extramarital lover to end her pregnancy. The area had not been represented by a Democrat since 2002, when Murphy won the seat with more than a 20-point lead.\n\nRepublicans tried during the special election to tie Lamb to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, but he came out strong against those claims, saying in an ad that he wouldn't support her as the House speaker.\n\nIn South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Democrat Joe Cunningham defeated Republican Katie Arrington, in a district Trump won by 13 points in 2016. Cunningham\u2019s win is the first time Democrats will represent the district in 40 years.\n\nThe district was represented by Republican Rep. Mark Sanford, who lost his primary to Arrington in June. His loss may have been tied to his willingness to criticize the president. Ahead of the primary, Trump tweeted that Sanford was \"nothing but trouble\" and then he endorsed Arrington. After Sanford lost, Trump wrote on Twitter that he'd \"never been a fan of his.\"\n\nArrington is one of 21 candidates who Trump endorsed that did not win their races Tuesday. There were still eight races undecided Wednesday.\n\nIn Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, Navy veteran Elaine Luria managed to unseat GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in the Republican-leaning district.\n\nStephen M. Katz/The Virginian-Pilot/AP\n\nThe district has been reliably red since 2000, with the exception of Democrat Glenn Nye's single term from 2009-2011. It is also worth noting that Republicans in that period have not won in the Virginia Beach-area district by large margins. Former Republican Rep. Scott Rigell won reelection in 2014 with the largest margin, defeating his Democratic challenger by 17 percentage points.\n\nComplicating this year's race was a lawsuit brought by state Democrats to remove Independent candidate Shaun Brown from the ballot when her qualifying petition appeared to have forged signatures. According to news reports, many of the signatures were gathered by staffers working for Taylor. While there were names listed of people who supported Taylor, the news reports indicated that those people didn't actually sign the petition. Brown told The Virginian-Pilot she didn't know Taylor staffers were collecting signatures for her. Taylor acknowledged to the newspaper that he knew his campaign workers were collecting signatures for Brown, but said it was because they thought Brown had been treated unfairly by Democrats.\n\nA judge later ordered Brown's name removed from the ballot, citing the forged signatures. Taylor had fired his campaign manager before the petition signatures came into question, The Virginian-Pilot reported, and cut ties with his campaign consultant afterward.\n\nWith only the two Navy veterans on the ballot, Luria squeezed out Taylor with a two-point lead.\n\nLuria was one of the first woman to serve her entire career on a Navy combat ship and campaigned on how her military experience could help her get things done in Washington.\n\n\u201cHaving that experience of working together with people of all perspectives, all backgrounds, and accomplishing a mission is something that I think we as female veterans collectively feel we can take to Washington,\u201d she said.\n\nABC News has not yet been able to project the outcomes in two House districts, Maine\u2019s 2nd and New Jersey\u2019s 3rd, which were among 21 that voted for former President Barack Obama and then for Trump. As of Thursday afternoon, ABC News could project that Democrats currently have a net gain of 31 seats in the House, with 10 races still outstanding.

Bill Withers' \"Grandma's Hands\" is a tribute to past generations but also about their own family roles.\n\nGuests include Taj Mahal, Bob Weir, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Jack Casady, Jorma Kaukonen, Charlie Musselwhite and Peter Coyote, all making distinguished contributions.\n\nThe album comes with detailed notes to each song and the story behind \"Stones,\" with lyrics now reworked to reflect Kaufman's harrowing experience at the deadly 1969 Altamont concert, is quite distressing and very unflattering to the event's headliners, the Rolling Stones.\n\nHearing \"Ace of Cups,\" one can imagine what the band may have sounded like all those decades ago.

Reilly on how his new movie 'Ralph Breaks the Internet' empowers girls\n\nSo, this is an actor who for me is one of the great journey man actors. You've seen him in so many things from \"Magnolia\" to \"Talladega nights.\" He's a magnificent actor. Now he's in the sequel to Disney's animated blockbuster, \"Wreck-it Ralph,\" called \"Ralph breaks the internet.\" Please welcome the fabulous John C. Reilly. Good morning. I love how you're dressed. It's fabulous. You have to see the whole thing. Stand up. I'll do a fashion show. All right. Do you always dress like this? Yeah, I do actually. When I was making \"Wreck it Ralph\" I would wear three-piece suits every time I did it. It became a running joke with me and Sarah Silverman, like oh you're dressed for me. I read that you collect clown pictures, that you have 100 of them. Clowns can be scary to some people. Yes. What made you do that? Clowns get a bad rap actually. I used to be a clown when I was younger. I started collecting amateur clown painting, paintings that not professional artists do. There's something really sweet about it. There's the person behind the makeup and then there's the idea that this person painted a painting that they weren't an expert at it, they were just trying to capture. Anyway, some people are afraid of clowns but I really try to turn that tide. Where do you hang them? Whoopi's a clown, I'm a clown. I understand that but where do you hang them? In my office. I'm not allowed to put them in the house. My office is packed with them. We have to talk about \"Ralph breaks the internet\", the sequel to \"Wreck it Ralph.\" We have a clip. I'm sure someone out here could give us directions. Oh, look at that little egg guy. He's got on one of those hats that smart people wear. I bet he could help us. Come on. Oh, hello, sir. Interesting, you don't seem to have a search history. Well, let's start one for you. What can we help you find today? Um. Umbrella, umbrage, urban outfitters? Looks like no one put humty dumbty together again. This guy is a little soft boiled. He's trying to guess what you're going to say. Sorry. But my auto fill is a tough aggressive today. A tough aggressive. You say that this movie is in particular empowering to girls. There's a really cool scene in it, you've probably seen it in the trailer where vanellope, Sarah's character, meets all the Disney princesses. We go to oh my Disney, this website, when we go onto the internet. She stumbles onto all the Disney princesses and she has this amazing moment where they ask her, are you a princess? Do men always try to save you? Do you have to wear a corset that you can't breathe in? All these horrible things that princesses have to deal with. So it's a really cool thing that Disney did with the movie actually. In this moment we're in with female empowerment it's a really cool thing that Disney went back and said we created some of these princess stereotypes that are hard for girls to live up to and we're going to talk about that now in a real way. Sarah convinces all them to wear hoodies and sweats. What is this thing called a hoodie? I love it. That's great. There's a lot for girls in this movie even though the movie is called \"Ralph breaks the internet.\" A lot of the story is about my friendship with Sarah, Penelope. You actually hear from a lot of kids because your character, Ralph. Yeah. What do they say to you? It's funny. Kids, sometimes I'll get -- one time I got this voice mail from a kid that's like, hello, John C. Reilly? I want to thank you very much for making the movie wreck it Ralph. Thank you very much, click. Literally some kid got my phone number from like the little league roster or something. But sometimes parents will say to me, like, John, my kid's having -- I'm having the toughest time with him, he won't brush his teeth. Kevin won't brush his teeth. I'm like, let Ralph give a call. I'll leave a voice mail, Kevin, it's your old pal, wreck it Ralph. You don't want sugar bugs on your teeth, do you, buddy? Listen to mom now. They'll play it for the kid and like, minds are blown. Speaking of kids, there's a trend online of babies who look just like John C. Reilly, who look just like you. It started when I think someone tweeted -- Oh, that's a good one. That's Jay Leno as a baby. I'm sure you've seen all these. Someone showed me. That's Jay as a baby. That one's good. Oh! That's a face swap. That's not an actual baby. That's scary. Is that how you looked as a baby? Someone sent me a picture of a baby that looks exactly like me. Do you guys have it? Because it is me. So cute. Such a great smile. You were a cute baby. I know, my mom -- there are six kids in my family and my mom made those copy doll curls on our head before we could style our own hair. I want to talk to you about another movie that's coming out. You are playing -- You're very excited, ma'am. It's so good. You're playing Oliver hardy in \"Stan and Ollie.\" I have to tell you, I saw it, man, and it is -- it is uncanny. You and Steve -- Coogan. Coogan, are just extraordinary. And to bring them to life, I know that's not your body because how much -- because you're wearing him huge. Yeah, yeah. How was that? I mean, I know, but tell us, tell them how it was. First of all, thank you for mentioning the movie. It's a real labor of love, that one. I mean, laurel and hardy were so important to me growing up. I don't know if the younger people know who they are but the fat guy and the skinny guy. They were the most famous comedians in the world in the 1930s. People rediscovered them through TV and stuff. Anyway, they were very important people to me and I felt like it was this sacred mission to bring their films to the next generation of people. But yeah, I had to wear this giant fat suit, tons of prosthetic makeup. Did people know it was you? My face and the inside of my hands. The rest of me was covered every day. Listen, it's never enough time with you. You got to come back. I'll come back for that movie. How about that? She's crying over this. It's a great thing.

Olga Sanchez Cordero presented the measure, saying that everyone should have \"the right to carry up to 30 grams (one ounce) of cannabis.\" People could carry more than an ounce if they requested a permit to do so under the proposal.\n\n\"From the point of view of negative effects, there is no reason why marijuana should not be legal, if alcohol and tobacco are,\" according to the bill.\n\nCordero has been picked as interior secretary by President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1. She is currently a senator for Lopez Obrador's leftist Morena party.\n\nHer bill also would allow every Mexican to grow up to 20 marijuana plants on private property and produce up to 17 ounces (480 grams) a year. Public smoking of marijuana would be allowed, \"except in tobacco smoke-free spaces.\"\n\nSales of marijuana would be regulated by a special agency, which would oversee purity, packaging and quality. Sales of edible marijuana products would be prohibited, as would advertising or promoting marijuana. Providing pot to minors would be illegal, and driving while under the influence of marijuana would be subject to prosecution.\n\nThe bill would have to be approved by both houses of congress, where Morena and its allies hold majorities in both chambers.\n\nIn 2016, Mexico's government began granting permits for some patients to import medicinal marijuana products. It has also decriminalized the possession small amounts of marijuana (about 5 grams) and issued several permits for people to cultivate and possess pot for personal use.\n\nUruguay was the first country to legalize marijuana for personal use.

She says she didn't know she was pregnant and was told it was just a means of pregnancy prevention. Over several days she endured bleeding and intense pain as a pregnancy was aborted. With time, and much therapy, she says she came to view the experience as a \"violation.\"\n\nShe writes that she had been \"paralyzed\" with fear the first time Escobar was intimate with her. \"I wasn't ready, I did not feel sexual malice, I did not have the necessary tools to understand what this intimate and intense contact meant,\" she says.\n\nTalking of the abortion, something she had kept even from her children until now, she says, \"I had to connect with my history and immerse myself in the depths of my soul, to find the courage to reveal the sad secret that I have harbored for 44 years.\"\n\nHenao says she decided to break her long silence and write the 523-page book with the hope that younger generations of Colombians would see how much blood has spilled in Colombia as a result of its cocaine business.\n\nBut it is also a page-turner that provides an intimate look at Escobar's fast evolution from a small-time grave robber to one of the world's most wanted fugitives.\n\nHenao says she met Escobar when she was 12. She came from an upstanding, traditional family in the Envigado district near Medellin and disobeyed her parents by falling in love with Escobar, the son of a poor watchman who rode around their neighborhood in a flashy Vespa motorcycle and was 11 years her senior.\n\nDuring a courtship that led to marriage when Henao was 15, Escobar showered her with gifts like a yellow bicycle and serenades of romantic ballads.\n\n\"He made me feel like a fairy princess and I was convinced he was my Prince Charming,\" she writes.\n\nBut from the start there were long, unexplained absences and he frequently flirted with other women. As Escobar began to amass a fortune, he also became manipulative and paranoid, she says.\n\nHenao insists she was largely kept in the dark about details of his criminal activities and says she escaped from the \"inferno\" of living alongside Escobar by creating an alternative world devoted to their two children and collecting expensive artworks by the likes of Dali and Rodin.\n\nAfter the Medellin cartel's 1984 assassination of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara, Escobar went into hiding and waged a bloody war with the state that included killing a presidential candidate and blowing up a commercial jetliner. Over much of the next decade, until Escobar died during a 1993 rooftop shootout with police, the family's contact with the kingpin consisted of short visits to safe houses where Henao and her children arrived blindfolded and were escorted by Escobar's army of assassins.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with Colombia's W Radio before the Nov. 15 publication of the book, Henao started off by apologizing to Colombians for what she said was the enormous damage her husband caused the nation. Referring to him throughout the interview as \"Pablo Escobar,\" she said she felt a mix of pain, profound embarrassment and disappointment with the man who had been the love of her life.\n\n\"I chose to bear all of this pain to protect my children,\" she said.\n\nAfter Escobar was killed, Henao began a frenzied search for asylum, fearing that his many enemies would extract revenge and kill her children. After being turned down by several count they settled in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and changed their names.\n\nThere, an attempt to lead a relatively normal life was interrupted when they were arrested in 1999 for money laundering. They were charged again this year for allegedly helping a Colombian drug trafficker hide money through real estate and a cafe known for its tango performances. Henao denies any wrongdoing and said once again that she and her children are being unfairly targeted because of their former last name.\n\nIn 2009, Escobar's son, who now goes by the name Sebastian Marroquin, starred in a documentary in which he seeks to atone for his father's sins by meeting with the orphaned sons of Lara and another prominent victim of his father's cartel. The film left Colombians transfixed and spurred a more dispassionate look at Escobar's role in the 1980s and 1990s drug wars.\n\nBut with the proliferation of books, the hit Netflix \"Narcos\" series, and tours of Escobar's former haunts in Medellin, some worry that the capo is being glorified by younger Colombians who didn't live through the bloodbath.\n\nAnd even a quarter century after his death, not everyone is willing to forgive.\n\nWriting recently in the newspaper El Tiempo, popular columnist Maria Isabel Rueda said that Henao's book \"isn't the excuse of a victim, but of a shameless senora who knew perfectly well that she and her family swam in rivers of gold preceded by a flood of deaths.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJoshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "The Salvatore Ferragamo fashion house says earnings in the first nine months of the year were down 18 percent as sales of the trademark footwear slumped.\n\nThe leather goods and apparel maker on Thursday reported net profit of 65 million euros ($74 million) in the period, compared with 79 million euros in the first nine months of 2017.\n\nRevenue was down 3.3 percent to 972 million euros, from 1 billion euros in the same period last year, with decreases in every region.

The next rate increase is expected in December.\n\nThe Fed kept its benchmark rate in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. A statement it issued Thursday after its latest policy meeting portrayed the economy as robust, with healthy job growth, low unemployment, solid consumer spending and inflation near the Fed's 2 percent target.\n\nDespite a U.S. trade war with key nations, weaker corporate investment and a sluggish housing market, the Fed is showing confidence in the economy's resilience. To help control inflation, it has projected three rate increases in 2019 after an expected fourth hike of the year next month.\n\nAnalysts saw the central bank's decision to highlight the economy's strength and to make few changes in its policy statement as a sign that it remains on track to raise rates next month.\n\n\"The Fed's economic assessment remains very upbeat, noting declining unemployment and continued strong growth,\" said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com's chief financial analyst. \"All signs point to a rate hike at the December meeting.\"\n\nThe Fed's decision Thursday was approved 9-0 by its voting policymakers. Its brief statement was nearly identical to the one the Fed issued in September. It said the job market has continued to strengthen and noted that economic activity has been rising \"at a strong rate.\"\n\nIn one of its few changes, the Fed downgraded its assessment of business investment spending, observing that it had slowed from its pace earlier in the year.\n\nThe Fed did not specify any risks to the economy it perceives. Analysts will be studying the minutes of this week's meeting, to be released in three weeks, for any insight into economic threats Fed policymakers may see, such as the trade war between the United States and China.\n\nIn deciding how fast or slowly to keep raising rates, the Fed will be monitoring the pace of growth, the job market's strength and gauges of inflation for clues to how the economy may evolve in the coming months. The brisk pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate in the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating.\n\nSome economists foresee only two Fed rate hikes next year. Others expect that economic growth will remain solid and the job market strong and that the Fed will decide that four rate increases will be justified next year to guard against high inflation. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is already at its lowest level since 1969.\n\nLast week, the government reported that the economy added a sizable 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay rose 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the sharpest year-over-year gain in nearly a decade. That's welcome news for workers. But it's a trend that may raise concern that accelerating wages will help fuel undesirably high inflation.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a middle-of-the-road approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\nEven after three increases this year, the Fed's benchmark rate is still low by historical standards. The central bank's policymakers have stressed, and most economists agree, that these small quarter-point increases amount to a gradual pace of credit tightening.\n\nStill, the Fed's benchmark rate affects many consumer and business loans, including mortgages and credit cards, and when it raises it, borrowing can become more expensive for many. Savers, though, typically earn more on their cash deposits as interest rates rise.\n\nSince the stock market started tumbling last month, President Donald Trump has attacked the Fed's rate hikes as well as Powell's leadership. Trump's public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the central bank's long-respected political independence and its need to operate free of outside pressure.\n\nAt the same time, the nervousness among stock investors reflects the reality that the Fed's steady march toward higher rates is removing a key factor that has underpinned the bull market in stocks: The richer returns that investors could achieve in stocks than in bonds or savings accounts.\n\nFed critics had charged that the central bank was creating a bubble in stocks that would eventually pop with disastrous results. Trump, who has often invoked high stock prices as evidence that his economic policies are succeeding, has made clear his disagreement. He has called the Fed, with its string of rate increases, \"my biggest threat.\"\n\nPowell, who was Trump's hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly. The chairman has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed's mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.\n\nThe Fed is edging closer to what it sees as the \"neutral\" level. This is the point at which the Fed's key rate is thought to neither stimulate the economy nor restrain it.\n\nThe median assessment of Fed officials has pegged the neutral rate at 3 percent. One more rate increase this year and two more in 2019 would leave the Fed's benchmark rate at a range of 2.75 percent to 3 percent.", "Interest Successfully Added\n\nWe'll notify you here with news about AlertTag\n\nTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?", "Transcript for Dangerous pollution levels, confrontations with Trump, Earth's glow: World in Photos\n\nIt's.

Add Interest\n\nA U.S. appeals court blocked President Donald Trump on Thursday from immediately ending an Obama-era program shielding young immigrants from deportation, saying the administration's decision was based on a flawed legal theory.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously kept a preliminary injunction in place against Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nLawsuits by California and others challenging the administration's decision will continue in federal court while the injunction stands.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court could eventually decide the fate of DACA, which has protected about 700,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families that overstayed visas. Earlier this week, the Trump administration took the unusual step of asking the Supreme Court to take up the case even before any federal appeals courts had weighed in. It was the second time the administration sought review of its DACA decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Thursday's ruling, 9th Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw said California and other plaintiffs were likely to succeed with their claim that the decision to end DACA was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security moved to end the program last year on the advice of just-fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who determined DACA to be unlawful because, he said, President Barack Obama did not have the authority to adopt it in the first place.\n\nThat was incorrect, Wardlaw wrote, noting that the federal government has a long and well-established history of using its discretion not to enforce immigration law against certain categories of people. Examples include President Dwight D. Eisenhower's decision in 1956 to extend \"immigration parole\" to 30,000 Hungarian refugees otherwise unable to remain in the U.S. and President Ronald Reagan's \"Family Fairness\" program, which allowed certain relatives of illegal immigrants who had been granted amnesty to likewise remain in the country.\n\nWhile the federal government might be able to end DACA for policy reasons under its own discretion, it can't do so based on Sessions' faulty belief that the program exceeds federal authority, the court held.\n\n\"We hold only that here, where the Executive did not make a discretionary choice to end DACA \u2014 but rather acted based on an erroneous view of what the law required \u2014 the rescission was arbitrary and capricious,\" Wardlaw wrote. \"The government is, as always, free to reexamine its policy choices, so long as doing so does not violate an injunction or any freestanding statutory or constitutional protection.\"\n\nThat said, the judges also declined to dismiss claims that the government's action might violate the constitutional rights of DACA recipients. The disproportionate effect the decision would have on Latinos might be unconstitutionally discriminatory, the court said, and the plaintiffs had also made a credible claim that it would violate due process for the government to turn around and use information they provided when they enrolled in DACA in deportation proceedings.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it moved to end the program last year because Texas and other states threatened to sue, raising the prospect of a chaotic end to DACA. The administration cited a 2015 ruling by another U.S. appeals court that blocked a separate immigration policy implemented by Obama.\n\nThe 9th Circuit disagreed with the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and said one of its conclusions did not apply to DACA.\n\nAn email to the U.S. Department of Justice was not immediately returned.\n\nTrump's decision to end DACA prompted lawsuits across the nation, including one by California. A judge overseeing that lawsuit and four others ruled against the administration and reinstated the program in January.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup rejected the argument that Obama had exceeded his power in creating DACA and said the Trump administration failed to consider the disruption that ending the program would cause.\n\nThe administration then asked the 9th Circuit to throw out Alsup's ruling.\n\nDuring a hearing in May, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Hashim Mooppan argued that the courts could not review the administration's decision to end DACA. The 9th Circuit rejected that notion.\n\nThe administration has been critical of the 9th Circuit and took the unusual step of trying to sidestep it and have the California DACA cases heard directly by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court in February declined to do so. It again asked the Supreme Court on Monday to take up the case after warning that it would seek review by the high court if the 9th Circuit did not issue a ruling by Oct. 31.\n\nFederal judges in New York and Washington also have ruled against Trump on DACA.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Gene Johnson contributed from Seattle.", "Transcript for Father talks emotionally about his son, killed in California bar shooting\n\nAdobe digital and music it was what do you let him get where it killed.

Scott McLean late Thursday. \"The wind that was predicted came and just wiped it out.\"\n\nMcLean estimated that a couple of thousand structures were destroyed in the town of 27,000 residents about 180 miles (290 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, where residents scrambled to flee. The extent of the injuries and specific damage count was not immediately known as officials could not access the dangerous area.\n\nButte County CalFire Chief Darren Read said at a news conference that two firefighters and multiple residents were injured.\n\nAs she fled, Gina Oviedo described a devastating scene in which flames engulfed homes, sparked explosions and toppled utility poles.\n\n\"Things started exploding,\" Oviedo said. \"People started getting out of their vehicles and running.\"\n\nAn Associated Press photographer saw dozens of businesses and homes leveled or in flames, including a liquor store and gas station.\n\n\"It's a very dangerous and very serious situation,\" Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. \"I'm driving through fire as we speak. We're doing everything we can to get people out of the affected areas.\"\n\nThe blaze erupted as windy weather swept the state, creating extreme fire danger. A wind-whipped fire north of Los Angeles in Ventura County burned up to 15 square miles and at least one home in a matter of hours. It threatened thousands of homes and prompted evacuations of a mobile home park, a state university campus and some neighborhoods. A nearby blaze was smaller at about 2 square miles but moving quickly.\n\nActing California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for the fire-stricken area in Northern California and requested a presidential disaster declaration, saying that dangerous weather conditions were expected to last several days.\n\nShari Bernacett said her husband tried to get people to leave the Paradise mobile home park they manage. He \"knocked on doors, yelled and screamed\" to alert as many residents as possible, Bernacett said.\n\n\"My husband tried his best to get everybody out. The whole hill's on fire. God help us!\" she said before breaking down crying. She and her husband grabbed their dog, jumped in their pickup truck and drove through flames before getting to safety, she said.\n\nTerrifying videos posted on social media showed cars driving along roads that looked like tunnels of fire with flames on both sides of the road.\n\nConcerned friends and family posted frantic messages on Twitter and other sites saying they were looking for loved ones, particularly seniors who lived at retirement homes or alone.\n\nAmong them was Kim Curtis, who was searching for her grandmother, who told family at 8 a.m. Thursday that she would flee her Paradise home in her Buick with her cat. Her grandmother, who is in her 70s and lives alone, never showed up up at a meeting spot in Chico, though.\n\n\"We've just been posting all over social media. And just praying for a miracle, honestly,\" said Curtis, who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nOfficials were sending as many firefighters as they could, Cal Fire spokesman Rick Carhart said.\n\n\"Every engine that we could put on the fire is on the fire right now, and more are coming,\" he said. \"There are dozens of strike teams that we're bringing in from all parts of the state.\"\n\nThe sheriff confirmed reports that evacuees had to abandon their vehicles. Rescuers were trying to put them in other vehicles, he said.\n\n\"We're working very hard to get people out. The message I want to get out is: If you can evacuate, you need to evacuate,\" Honea said.\n\nThe wildfire was reported around daybreak. Within six hours, it had grown to more than 26 square miles (69 square kilometers), Gaddie said.\n\nThick gray smoke and ash filled the sky above Paradise and could be seen from miles away.\n\nFire officials said the flames were being fueled by winds, low humidity, dry air and severely parched brush and ground from months without rain.\n\n\"Basically, we haven't had rain since last May or before that,\" said Read, the fire chief. \"Everything is a very receptive fuel bed. It's a rapid rate of spread.\"\n\nAt the hospital in Paradise, more than 60 patients were evacuated to other facilities and some buildings caught fire and were damaged. But the main facility, Adventist Health Feather River Hospital, was not, spokeswoman Jill Kinney said.\n\nSome of the patients were initially turned around during their evacuation because of gridlocked traffic and later airlifted to other hospitals, along with staff, Kinney said.\n\nFour hospital employees were briefly trapped in the basement and rescued by California Highway Patrol officers, Kinney said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued red-flag warnings for fire dangers in many areas of the state, saying low humidity and strong winds were expected to continue through Friday evening.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Paul Elias, Jocelyn Gecker, Janie Har, Daisy Nguyen, Olga R.

The Rev. Stanley Rother, who was gunned down during the Guatemalan conflict in 1981, was beatified as a martyr in his native Oklahoma last year.\n\nThe Vatican said Thursday that Francis approved a decree recognizing that Miller, from Stevens Point, Wisconsin, died as a martyr on Feb. 13, 1982, in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The 37-year-old Miller had been working with indigenous youths as a member of the De La Salle Christian Brothers when he was killed by three masked men.\n\nNo one was ever arrested in the slaying. Miller's fellow brothers reported receiving warnings that Guatemala's armed forces intelligence unit, the G-2 death squad, was looking for them.\n\nA U.N. truth commission determined that some 245,000 people were killed or disappeared during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war, which pitted right-wing, U.S.-backed governments against leftist guerrillas and indigenous peoples. The vast majority of the killings were attributed to the army or to pro-government paramilitary groups.\n\nBeing declared a martyr exempts Miller from the usual beatification requirement of having a miracle attributed to his intercession confirmed. However, such a miracle would be required for him to be declared a saint. A date for his beatification has not been set.\n\nMiller was one of more than a dozen people whose saint-making causes advanced during an audience Wednesday between Francis and the head of the Vatican's saint-making office. During the audience, Francis took the unusual step of decreeing that Michael Giedroyca, a lay member of the Order of St. Augustine during the 15th century, could be beatified without being declared a martyr or having a miracle attributed to his intercession.\n\nGiedroyc was born in Lithuania with a condition that resulted in short stature. He spent much of his life in Krakow, Poland, where he died in 1485.\n\nFrancis has granted a handful of such \"equivalent\" decrees for well-known and revered saintly figures, including Pope John XXIII, whom Francis declared a saint alongside St. John Paul II in 2014.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the city where Miller was killed is spelled Huehuetenango, not Huehuetenago.", "Ethiopia's state affiliated broadcaster says police have uncovered a mass grave of 200 people in the troubled area between the country's Oromia and Somali regions.\n\nFana Broadcasting reported Thursday evening that police were carrying out a court-ordered investigation for evidence of alleged abuses by forces loyal to the former president of the Somali region, Abdi Mohammed, who is now in detention.\n\nThe Fana report said that police were granted 14 days to unearth and do forensic examinations on the estimated 200 bodies that have been found.\n\nThe bodies appear to be related to a series of ethnic clashes carried out by an unofficial militia known as the Liyu that were loyal to the former Somali region leader.

It is estimated that 14 percent of American adults (34 million people) were smokers in 2017, a drop from 15.5 percent in 2016.

In total, about 47 million people in the U.S. use tobacco products.\n\nCertain groups of people were more likely to use tobacco products than others, the CDC said. These groups included people with incomes below $35,000, and those who had a GED, were uninsured, insured by Medicaid or received public assistance.\n\nSome ethnic groups were also pointed out as more likely to use, including non-Hispanic American Indian/Native Americans, multiracial, white or black adults.\n\nHigher rates of tobacco use were also seen in adults who identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual. Being divorced, separated, widowed, single, never-married or not living with a partner was also associated with higher use.\n\nMark Lennihan/AP, FILE\n\nAdults living in the Midwest or the south tended to use tobacco the most.\n\nThe CDC mentioned that serious psychological distress was associated with an increase in tobacco use, with 40.8 percent of adults who reported serious psychological distress reporting tobacco use compared to 18.5 percent in those without serious psychological distress.\n\n\u201cFor more than half a century, cigarette smoking has been the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States.

In 1997, House Republicans under Newt Gingrich spent some $7 million on a campaign finance investigation involving the Democratic president that resulted in almost 1,300 subpoenas and the release of 1.5 million pages of documents.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party? Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the top issues where House Democrats might try to go after the GOP-led administration:\n\n1. Trump's taxes\n\nTrump was the first major party candidate in four decades to refuse to disclose his tax returns, which could disclose any potential conflicts of interest. Trump once again said in a press conference Wednesday that he's willing to release the records, but only after he said his taxes are no longer under an audit.\n\nCome January, Democrats will take control of the House Ways and Means Committee, which gives them the authority to compel the Internal Revenue Service to produce the tax return of any U.S. citizen \u2013 including the president.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, told ABC News shortly before the election that the committee would launch a review of Trump's tax filings if and when Democrats take the reins: \"We are allowed to investigate this. Nothing should step in our way.\"\n\n2. Trump real estate\n\nEarlier this year, a government watchdog raised questions about Trump's involvement in real estate discussions about the FBI headquarters in downtown Washington. The decision could affect potential commercial development that would directly compete with the Trump Hotel across the street.\n\nThe White House maintains the president wasn't interested in trying to influence the decision.\n\nAmerican Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, has filed a lawsuit seeking more information on the FBI headquarters project and another lawsuit digging into allegations of improper influence of members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago Florida resort at the Veterans Affairs Department. The group says it will file an additional lawsuit related to Trump's brother-in-law, Jared Kushner and his business interests.\n\n3. Russia\n\nFor 18 months, special counsel Robert Mueller has been looking into Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 election, whether Trump campaign officials or associates might have cooperated with such efforts, and even possibly whether Trump himself obstructed justice in the probe.\n\nStill, Democrats say they have their own questions, including why Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned Wednesday at the president's request.\n\n\"It is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions\u2019 firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation,\" tweeted House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nIt is impossible to read Attorney General Sessions\u2019 firing as anything other than another blatant attempt by @realDonaldTrump to undermine & end Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) November 7, 2018\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nOther questions include whether Russian oligarchs used Trump properties to launder money - an allegation Trump aides strongly deny. Democrats say they intend to seek testimony from more than 30 witnesses \u2013- including Trump family members and confidants.\n\nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a political \"witch hunt.\"\n\n4. Climate change and the environment\n\nEnvironmental science can make a voter's head spin. But House Democrats focused on the issue could also spent the next two years using their subpoena power and committee gavels to dig into the matter, namely: Is the federal government doing enough to protect the air Americans breathe or the water they drink?\n\nAnother possible line of inquiry is the overall handling of the Interior Department, which oversees the nation's federal land. Rep. Paul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House committee with oversight of Interior, has already called for multiple investigations into allegations that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated ethics policies and has said he wants Zinke to testify. An internal watchdog has referred an unspecified investigation involving Zinke to the Justice Department.\n\nZinke has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n5. Health care\n\nHealth care is a big one for Democrats because it consistently ranks high among voters' concerns and some Democratic-led initiatives have proven popular with time. On Election Day, for example, three heavily Republican states - Idaho, Nebraska and Utah - each voted in favor of expanding Medicaid under the Obama-era health care law.\n\nTrump, who campaigned against \"Obamacare,\" now says he backs many of the more popular provisions, including efforts to protect people with pre-existing conditions. He also has made lowering the cost of prescription drugs and addressing the opioid crisis a priority.\n\nBut Democrats point to court filings by the Trump administration asking a judge to invalidate the health care law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration also has relaxed regulations that could open the door to insurance plans that don't cover pre-existing conditions or recovery treatment for drug addiction. It\u2019s likely that House Democrats will use their newfound power to investigate climbing drug prices and whether executive actions are undermining protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n6. Immigration\n\nTrump has made border security a major push in his administration, and his inflammatory rhetoric seems to have galvanized his base in the recent election.\n\nBut Democrats say the president still needs to find a permanent solution for \"Dreamers,\" teens and young adults who were brought to the United States as children and are in the country illegally. Trump announced the end of an Obama-era program that granted these young immigrants temporary legal status, but that decision is in legal limbo after numerous lawsuits.\n\nIt's possible that House Democrats will try again to tie additional border security money to protections for Dreamers.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\n7. Trump's Cabinet\n\nIt's common for presidents to shake up personnel following an election. But for those Cabinet secretaries who might stick around, it's likely the House will call on several cabinet-level officials to testify on any number of issues.\n\nIn addition to Zinke, Democrats are interested in hearing from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in her oversight of for-profit schools, as well as her department's upcoming guidelines for schools to address sexual assault allegations. At the Commerce Department, questions remain about who exactly led an effort to change the U.S. census to include a question about citizenship, which Democrats allege are tied to Trump's anti-immigration agenda.\n\nTrump though is warning against any aggressive tactics. And so is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, citing his own experience in the 1990s with Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting,\u201d McConnell told reporters Wednesday. \u201cI remember when we tried it in the late 90s. We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down, and we under-performed in the next election.\u201d", "Shares of energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. tumbled after the company said its partner Coca-Cola Co. is developing energy drinks of its own.\n\nCoke bought a stake in California-based Monster in 2014.

But did confirm that he was in fact still on his job. Interesting yesterday Kimberly of the the president was asked about potential staff shakeup including Jeff Sessions out at justice and the presidents and he wanted to answer that question at a better time at that point in the late morning early afternoon. The president's chief of staff John Kelly had already reached out Jeff Sessions and told him. The president wanted him to offer his resignation so like many things here in Washington it was a letter of resignation but it was at the request of the president which of course Kimberly. Is a fire. Yes it's a firing do we have any idea on who'd a full time. Replacements Houda considerations are who might meet. Yeah at a White House is not getting into any of that just yet but certainly it's something that they'll be moving forward quickly on names that you have been tossed around down here in Washington senator Lindsey Graham who has said he would like to stay in the senate he's comfortable up there in Capitol Hill. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie is of course a name that will get a lot of attention given his work as a federal prosecutor and his ties to the president very close ally advisor confidant of the president. But now in the senate would have to move forward once the president announces his pick to take over full time at the Justice Department there have to be a confirmation. Tape that would take place up on Capitol Hill and of course the midterm results this week this Republicans picked up three seats in the senate so its currency and they would do this in the next couple of weeks during this lame duck session but if they weeks of January. They have a bigger majority at that point. Yes and as if there is an announced a crazy news I do want to make sure ask you about the Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Who was hospitalized.

Six suspected Bangladeshi traffickers were also arrested while the rescued refugees were sent back to their camps in the district, he said.\n\nDas said they were lured by the traffickers with promises of marriages and jobs in Malaysia.\n\nHe said the rescued refugees told them they paid money to the traffickers who said they would soon land in Malaysia amid fears that they would have no future in Myanmar's Rakhine state if they are sent back.\n\n\"I paid 10,000 takas ($120) to a Rohingya man who told me he will send me to Malaysia. He has chosen a man there for me for my marriage,\" 17-year-old Shawkat Ara said.\n\n\"I attempted once at night but returned as my boat left before I could reach there recently,\" she said.\n\nBangladesh and Myanmar said recently that the countries want to start repatriation of the refugees in a limited scale from mid-November.\n\nAbul Kalam, a senior Bangladeshi repatriation official in Cox's Bazar, told The Associated Press that they were preparing to start the repatriation of some 2,660 refugees from 485 families on Nov. 15. But many of the refugees are reluctant to go back, fearing persecution and an uncertain future.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations in a statement in Geneva urged Bangladesh and Myanmar to halt the process of sending them back from this month, saying it does not see any guarantee that they would not suffer \"the same persecution and horrific violence\".\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since last year amid an army-led crackdown. Thousands were killed in the violence.\n\nRohingya Muslims have lived for centuries in Myanmar but they have long been treated as outsiders in a largely Buddhist nation who are denied citizenship and many basic rights. Many in Myanmar ridicule them as \"Bengalis\" who came from Bangladesh.\n\nThe refugees are seeking U.N. protection to return home. The U.N. refugee agency and Bangladesh had earlier finalized a memorandum of understanding that said the repatriation process must be \"safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards.\"", "After a historic midterm election that saw an estimated 113 million Americans cast their ballots and elect the most diverse group of leaders ever in America, many are wondering what it all means.\n\n2018 saw the highest raw vote in a midterm and the highest percentage of voter turnout since before 18-year-olds were given the right to vote. Both parties have something to cheer about and both parties have a good bit to lament. The overall margin favoring the Democrats was approximately 8 percent, or roughly 9 million votes. They took back the House, picked up numerous gubernatorial and state legislative wins, and progressive measures won at the state ballot box. But they also fell further behind in the Senate, lost some key races in Florida and Ohio, and continue to lose ground in the rural areas and small towns of America.\n\nJessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nFor its part, the GOP picked up seats in the Senate, won some key races in Florida and Ohio, and limited their House losses. But they were beaten badly in the popular vote, and continued to lose ground in the suburbs, especially among women. They also fared badly among young people.\n\nSo what do these results mean for both parties? Examining the results from a higher altitude, here are the three major takeaways from this election.\n\nThe divide between geography and demography is deepening\n\nIn 2016, we saw a titanic battle between the powerful forces of geography and demography. The GOP has continued to perform better in large geographic portions of America, winning around 2,600 counties in 2016 and losing only 500.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats continue to build margins among the fastest-growing parts of the electorate: people of color, young voters, single women, and folks with college degrees. The outcome in 2016 was a split decision between the forces of geography (represented by the electoral college) and demography (represented by the popular vote).\n\nIn the midterms, we saw this dynamic unfold once again. The Democrats built up an ever-larger popular vote margin, but simultaneously lost ground in the Senate. If these midterms had been an electoral college vote, Democrats would have picked up Pennsylvania and Michigan, but Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio and Arizona would have gone down to the wire as to who would have won.\n\nThis should be of concern to both parties for 2020. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the GOP to win the national popular vote, and the playing field in the electoral college for Democrats puts them at a disadvantage. Each of the major political parties are able to run up points in home games, but have a difficult time scoring in away games.\n\nTrump still has a popularity problem\n\nPresident Trump could validly claim some successes from this election, but his political advisers should be concerned about his approval numbers on Election Day.\n\nFor all of the anger and disapproval of past presidents at midterm time, including Obama, Bush, Clinton, Reagan, and Carter, not one has had as many people say they strongly disapprove of them on Election Day as Trump.\n\nJonathan Ernst/Reuters\n\nNearly a majority of Americans (46 percent) who voted Tuesday said they strongly disapproved of the president\u2019s performance in office, according to a national ABC News exit poll, with strong critics outnumbering strong supporters by a 15-point margin. It's an astoundingly high number, especially when you consider the positive economic indicators Trump has enjoyed. The number of jobs and the stock market have both continued to grow, but Trump is performing below the normal job approval rating in an economy like this by 20 points.\n\nAnd the number of people who strongly disapprove of him is especially negative among some of the groups who make up the fastest-growing part of the electorate. President Trump, if he cares to possibly win the popular vote in a 2020 re-election, would need to do some dramatic shifts in tone, strategy, and communication to make that happen.\n\nAmericans are still waiting for a national leader\n\nMy fear is both parties will learn the wrong lessons from this midterm. The GOP will think the Trump way works because they will point at certain evidence, when in fact they should be asking what's holding them back from bigger electoral wins under such a good economy.\n\nThe Democrats will concentrate on the House wins, and not look at the great expanse of America they are continuing to lose ground in, even with large national popular vote margins.\n\nIn order to win both demographically and geographically, each side has to figure out what message and candidates appeal to both.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t about ideology or some point on the political spectrum: it is about how a candidate is culturally aligned with an area or population.\n\nA progressive message can work in red areas as long as it fits in culturally through authentic words and alignment. Likewise, a conservative message can work in blue states if it does the same culturally.\n\nThere is a path to success in uniting our country, and Americans are still waiting for that national leader to emerge to guide us down it.\n\nMatthew Dowd is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent. Opinions expressed in this column do not necessarily reflect the views of ABC News.", "New York\u2019s former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will not face criminal charges following allegations from four women that he assaulted them \u2013 a string of accusations that led to his abrupt resignation in May, the prosecutor charged with investigating the incidents announced today.\n\nInterested in New York? Add New York as an interest to stay up to date on the latest New York news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn statement in response to the announcement, Schneiderman, who spent time in a rehabilitation facility after resigning, said that he recognizes that \u201cthe decision not to prosecute does not mean I have done nothing wrong,\u201d and reiterated what he has said before \u2013 that he takes \u201cfull responsibility for my conduct.\u201d\n\nSchneiderman resigned only hours after the New Yorker magazine published the claims, each of which came from women whom he had been romantically involved with at the time.\n\n\u201cFollowing an exhaustive review, evaluation of the facts, the law, and applicable statutes of limitations, I have concluded our investigation into the allegations of physical abuse allegedly committed by former New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman without criminal charges,\u201d Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas wrote in a statement released this morning.\n\nSeth Wenig/AP\n\nSingas stressed in her statement that she believed the women who made accusations against Schneiderman, citing \u201clegal impediments\u201d to successful prosecution as a reason for choosing not to file criminal charges.\n\nI believe the women who shared their experiences with our investigation team, however legal impediments, including statutes of limitations, preclude criminal prosecution. Our investigation also highlighted deficiencies in New York law for which I have drafted remedial legislation.[1]\n\nSingas also stressed that she had relied on both a team of seasoned special victims\u2019 investigators and prosecutors, and her own interviews with the women who cooperated with her investigation and their attorneys.\n\nAdditionally, she wrote in the statement, \u201cOur team interviewed members of Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s security detail, employees of the Office of the Attorney General, potential witnesses identified during the pendency of our investigation, and we followed-up on each call to the tip line we established for this matter.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Schneiderman released a statement reiterating that, \"I accept full responsibility for my conduct in my relationships with my accusers, and for the impact it had on them.\"\n\nSchneiderman continued: \"After spending time in a rehab facility, I am committed to a lifelong path of recovery and making amends to those I have harmed. I apologize for any and all pain that I have caused, and I apologize to the people of the State of New York for disappointing them after they put their trust in me.\u201d\n\nThe investigation found no misconduct by Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s staff in the Office of the Attorney General, according to Singas. How the story broke The New Yorker and The New York Times had been racing for weeks to report and confirm the story and, by last week, Schneiderman's camp was quietly talking about the ongoing reporting, according to people directly involved in the discussions.\n\nSchneiderman insiders had no clue about the details, the individuals told ABC News, noting that some acknowledged that Schneiderman drank heavily at times but they did not know anything about his sex life.\n\nSchneiderman's inner circle is an amalgam of liberal Democratic staffers who have, at various points, worked for Hillary Clinton, Gov. Cuomo, Sen. Chuck Schumer, former Mayor Mike Bloomberg and the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs the day began Monday, hours before The New Yorker story was published, there was little to suggest events would roll out as they did.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, a detailed list of questions had come in from The New Yorker and Schneiderman, his ex-wife and consultant Jennifer Cunningham and other key people were on a series of conference calls going through possible responses.\n\nThis went on for hours. They discussed whether any of the assertions could be denied. They considered whether to announce the Attorney General was heading to a rehabilitation program.\n\nOne person suggested denying something that seemed true and the group advised against lying, the individuals with knowledge of the discussions told ABC News.\n\nThe first public statement \u2013 in which Schneiderman denied assaulting anyone but said that he \"engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity\" -- was issued in an effort to stanch the bleeding while holding back some material that might be suitable for second- or third-day statements, the individuals said.\n\nAs the evening progressed, there was no thought about the blow that might come. Schneiderman and Cuomo have disliked each other for quite some time -- a sentiment that only grew when Cuomo ascended to his current post, leaving Schneiderman to replace him as attorney general, the individuals said.\n\nSchneiderman and Cunningham didn't consider that the governor, now facing his own re-election and nervous about a challenge from the left by actress Cynthia Nixon, might throw him to the wolves, the individuals said.\n\nThen, as the group was on yet another conference call, Cuomo's office issued the call for Schneiderman's resignation.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" one person asked on the phone. The answer came fast: \"You resign,\" the individuals recounted to ABC News.", "The captain of a tourist boat that sank in southwest Missouri and killed 17 people, including nine members of an Indiana family, didn't tell passengers to put on flotation devices or prepare them to abandon ship even after waves crashed into the boat during a severe storm, according to an indictment released Thursday.\n\nThe federal indictment shows Kenneth Scott McKee faces 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship's officer resulting in death. The deaths occurred after the duck boat, a refurbished amphibious vessel originally used by the military during World War II, sank during a storm in July .\n\nU.S. Attorney Tim Garrison said the 51-year-old McKee also is accused of failing to properly assess the weather before and after the boat went into Table Rock Lake near Branson, a Midwestern tourist town known for country music shows and entertainment venues.\n\n\"This is the beginning, not the end, of our efforts in this matter,\" Garrison said during a news conference in Springfield, adding that he couldn't release specifics about the investigation.\n\nRipley Entertainment, the company that operated the boats and suspended the operation following the accident, didn't respond to messages from The Associated Press. McKee's attorney declined comment.\n\nIf convicted, McKee could face up to 10 years in prison for each count and a fine of $250,000. Garrison said he expects McKee to surrender.\n\nTia Coleman \u2014 whose husband, three young children and five other family members died in the sinking \u2014 released a statement Thursday saying she was pleased an indictment had been filed. Coleman was among 14 people who survived the sinking.\n\n\"While nothing can ever ease the grief in my heart, I am grateful that the U.S. Attorney's Office is fighting for justice for my family, and the other victims, and is committed to holding fully accountable all those responsible for this tragedy,\" Coleman said.\n\nThe other people killed included two couples from Missouri, an Illinois woman who died while saving her granddaughter's life, an Arkansas father and son, and a retired pastor who was the boat's operator on land.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed on behalf of victims and survivors against Ripley Entertainment and other companies involved with the manufacture and operation of the boats. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney representing Coleman and several others, said he's confident the federal investigation will go beyond McKee.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard had found probable cause that the accident resulted from McKee's \"misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties,\" according to an August court filing. The U.S. attorney's office said the captain of a second duck boat that safely made it to shore during the storm acted in a \"grossly negligent manner,\" though the court filing didn't elaborate on those findings.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment has repeatedly declined to comment on the investigation but has said the company has cooperated with authorities.\n\nOn Thursday, Garrison said McKee violated conditions specified in the boat's certificate of inspection by failing to tell passengers to put on personal floatation devices and not immediately increasing speed and driving to the nearest shore, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment also alleges McKee allowed the boat's plastic side curtains to be lowered, which blocked the exits, and didn't instruct passengers to put on flotation devices or prepare them to abandon ship even after the bilge alarm sounded twice.\n\nThe vessel first took tourists on a trip through Branson, which is about 170 miles (274 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The amphibious vehicle then traveled to Table Rock Lake for a short excursion on water.\n\nWeather was calm when the vessel known as a Stretch Duck 7 began its trip on July 19, but investigators have contended that operators had ample warning that a strong storm was approaching.\n\nThe vessel's certificate of inspection issued by the Coast Guard in 2017 established rules and limitations on when it could be on the water. It states the boat \"shall not be operated waterborne\" when winds exceed 35 mph and/or wave heights exceed 2 feet.\n\nGarrison said McKee violated those limitations when he put the boat into the lake.\n\nVideo and audio from the boat, recovered by divers, showed that the lake was calm when the boat entered the water. But the weather suddenly turned violent. Within minutes, the boat sank.\n\nThe wind speed at the time of the accident was more than 70 mph, just short of hurricane force, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Weather forecasts had warned of an impending storm with winds possibly exceeding 60 mph.\n\nThe wave height wasn't known, but cellphone video shot by passengers on a nearby excursion boat showed waves that appeared to be far greater than 2 feet (0.61 meters) high.\n\nIn addition to the weather, the Coast Guard has said it was looking into regulatory compliance of the boat and crew member duties and qualifications.\n\nBranson is among several places around the country where the amphibious vehicles offer excursions. Since 1999, 42 deaths have been associated with duck boat accidents .\n\nOn May 1, 1999, 13 people died when the Miss Majestic duck boat sank on Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 2015, five college students died and more than 70 people were hurt when a duck boat veered into a charter bus on a bridge in Seattle. Two Hungarian tourists died in 2010 when a stalled duck boat was struck by a tugboat-guided barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Jim Salter contributed to this report from St. Louis.", "Police in Northern Ireland have arrested two men after investigating reports that people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members posed for photos outside an Islamic prayer center.\n\nThe images circulating on social media are said to depict people dressed as KKK members in a town near Belfast last month.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland has launched a hate crime investigation.

It's for temporary relief of mild, intermittent asthma symptoms in people ages 12 and up.\n\nThe original Primatene Mist was discontinued seven years ago because the inhaler's ozone-depleting propellant had been banned. That version had been marketed for half a century, including in memorable TV ads.\n\nThe new product developed by Amphastar Pharmaceuticals uses a safer propellant. The inhaler will cost about $25 and contain 160 doses. It should be available by the end of the year.\n\n\"Rescue inhalers\" are meant to quickly relieve asthma symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, which can be triggered by pollen, mold, dust mites, pet dander, stress or exercising in the cold.\n\nPrimatene Mist's active ingredient, the hormone epinephrine, relaxes muscles in the lungs to increase airflow. The product is the only FDA-approved over-the-counter inhaler. Numerous prescription rescue inhalers, containing the medicine albuterol or levalbuterol, are available.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, FDA officials noted concerns that some people may inappropriately use or overuse the new inhaler. The agency said it should not be substituted for prescription treatments or used by people with severe asthma.\n\nPrimatene Mist was pulled from stores in 2011, but it still has many fans, including tens of thousands who have liked pages advocating its return. TV ads for the old version touted its speedy relief with endorsements from athletes such as Bob Gibson and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, or by showing a gasping person getting relief as a stopwatch ticked off 15 seconds.\n\nAn Amphastar subsidiary bought rights to the product's name and spent several years improving it.\n\nThe new version contains less alcohol and epinephrine, which can increase heart rate, especially if the inhaler is used too much. Side effects include tremors and dizziness.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Linda A.

The problem can cause drivers to run out of fuel and stall, increasing the risk of a crash.\n\nThe other recall covers Subaru Imprezas from 2012 to 2014 and the 2013 BRZ, XV Crosstrek and Toyota Scion FR-S.\n\nThe engine valve springs in about 411,000 vehicles worldwide can fracture, causing the engines to malfunction or stall.\n\nDealers will replace the springs. Toyota and Subaru jointly designed the FR-S sports car.\n\nIn both recalls, owners will be notified starting in December, Subaru said. In the fuel indicator recall, dealers will reprogram the software. If reprogramming tools aren't ready, owners will be notified by letter again when they are. In the valve springs recall, if parts aren't ready, owners will be notified a second time of when they should take vehicles in for repairs.\n\nSubaru says it has no reports of crashes or injuries due to either problem.", "Transcript for Luke Bryan on getting personal for his ABC special 'Living Every Day: Luke Bryan'\n\nDrop it.

The glacier, which is thought to be about 18,000 years old, once served as the site of Bolivia's only ski resort before it melted a decade ago.\n\nInitially, the station was launched as a cosmic ray observatory in the mid-1940s, when just hauling up heavy scientific instruments on the back of llamas was a feat in itself. But Chacaltaya's altitude and location near the Amazon region \u2014 and its proximity to Bolivia's capital city \u2014 eventually led scientists to obtain information about the pollution released from the burning of forests, coal, oil and gas.\n\nIn 2012, the site became an atmospheric station used to measure greenhouse gases, reactive gases and particles that can spread all the way to the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles away. Its altitude is only rivaled by a station recently built by China on the Quinhai-Tibet plateau near Mt. Everest which sits at 17,060 feet (5,200 meters).\n\nChacaltaya, which means 'Cold Road' in Aymara, is jointly funded and managed by groups from the United States and Europe, and the initiative is led by Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz.\n\nJames Butler, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global monitoring division, said the samples taken and observations made \"are not influenced by local emissions or similar influences.\"\n\n\"Upward looking observations from a mountaintop also provide a much better picture of changes in the stratosphere than do observations from lower elevations, because interference in the signal is greatly reduced,\" he said.\n\nFernando Velarde, a physicist who works at the observatory, said the data is shared with the international community.\n\n\"As scientists we take a problem, study its effects and try to give answers to society,\" he said. \"But the final decisions are in the hands of governments and politicians.\"", "Self-styled positivity guru Emile Ratelband thinks age is just a number. And his is a number the Dutchman wants changed.\n\nThe 69-year-old television personality has asked a court in the Netherlands to approve his request for a new birthday that officially would make him 49.\n\nRatelband says his legal appeal is consistent with other forms of personal transformation that are gaining acceptance and government recognition in the Netherlands and around the world.\n\nHe said on Thursday: \"With this free(dom) of choice, choice of name, freeness of gender, I want to have my own age. I want to control myself.\"", "Hardcore fans of the Beatles like to pore over every detail of the band and endlessly dissect their songs. Then there's Giles Martin, who manages to time travel to meet the Fab Four.\n\nMartin is the son of legendary Beatles producer George Martin, and he's lately been returning to the treasure trove of original recording sessions to remix key albums by John, Paul, George and Ringo.\n\n\"It's really nerve-wracking because it's a legacy of music which is really important,\" the soft-spoken Martin said. \"What I do is make sure I provide the fans \u2014 and people who don't even know the Beatles \u2014 with music that's worth listening to and is interesting.\"\n\nMartin last year remixed \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and this year resurfaces with a fascinating and exhaustive look at \"The Beatles,\" better known as the \"White Album,\" which contains such classics as \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" ''Blackbird\" and \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\" It coincides with celebrations for the album's 50th birthday.\n\nBesides punchier, remixed versions of the 30 songs on the original double album, the anniversary package includes 27 acoustic demos of material the Beatles made at Harrison's house before going into the studio and 50 studio outtakes, including the unreleased \"Not Guilty,\" a studio jam of \"Blue Moon\" and early versions of \"Let It Be,\" ''Lady Madonna\" and \"Across the Universe,\" which would appear on other albums.\n\nMartin was tapped by the surviving Beatles and the wives of Harrison and Lennon to rummage around in Abbey Road Studios in London and re-listen to everything, including abandoned songs and rehearsals.\n\nThat meant going through 107 takes of \"Sexy Sadie,\" dozens of versions of both \"I'm So Tired\" and \"Long, Long, Long\" and a 13-minute \"Helter Skelter.\" It meant hearing the Beatles discuss songs, joke and even order lunch. (You can hear Harrison at one point from the studio order a \"cheese, lettuce, Marmite sandwich.\")\n\nMartin couldn't help using a Beatles reference to explain what his goals are: \"I'm sort of trying to peel back the layers \u2014 the glass onion, if you like. I peel back the layers so you get to hear what I can hear at Abbey Road.\"\n\nAmong the gems in the box set is an unrecorded Lennon song called \"Child of Nature\" that will later morph into his solo hit \"Jealous Guy\" and also a very cool \"Good Night\" stripped of the orchestrations it got on the \"White Album.\" You can hear \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" start out life as quite gentle before ending up on the \"White Album\" like a template for Frank Zappa.\n\nThe Beatles worked through the summer of 1968, often in exhausting all-night sessions. Martin says the multiple takes for many songs may be because the band had largely stopped performing live.\n\n\"I think the most revealing thing for me working on the 'White Album' is just how creative they were, all of the time,\" said Martin. \"It's almost like the studio couldn't handle the level of demand that they wanted to do and the amount of songs they wanted to record.\"\n\nMartin's father was heavily involved in the Beatles' prior album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\" and was even lauded as the architect of their sound. But the Fab Four came together for the recording of the \"White Album\" in the summer of 1968 with a different goal in mind.\n\n\"They didn't want an architect. They wanted to build an album from the bricks up and without any real idea about what it was going to be,\" said Martin. \"They indulged themselves because they knew that each member of the band would make the song better.\"\n\nWilliam Moylan, a professor of music and sound recording technology at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, said the recording of the \"White Album\" found the members of the Beatles at a crossroads.\n\n\"It's really where the Beatles are exploring their own individuality and they're still working off the collective. They're coming out of 'Sgt. Pepper's' and they're coming out of 'Magical Mystery Tour' and they're coming out of the psychedelia,\" Moylan said. \"They're branching out, into popular music, into musical theater, back to rock, even Tin Pan Alley-type pieces.\"\n\nThe accepted wisdom when it comes to the \"White Album\" is that it was a rocky time for the band, which was disintegrating. Starr quit and walked out for an 11-day period. Critics have called the record a mess \u2014 a brilliant mess, of course \u2014 with each member often delivering solo songs.\n\nBut, like a polite Moses coming down from the mountain with the original tablets, Martin disagrees. He believes some of those interpretations to be exaggerated. He hears the Fab Four working together even on songs long considered to be done by only one Beatle.\n\n\"The revealing thing for me is you go back and listen to the tapes and what we have on the tapes is a cohesive unit playing together and working on songs together,\" says Martin, who was born a year after the \"White Album\" was released.\n\n\"Listen to the sessions \u2014 they were very warm. And that's the surprising thing. I think we thought the 'White Album' was this disparate, angry record \u2014 and it has certainly elements of that \u2014 but, in essence, the four of them made an album together they wanted to make.\"\n\nThat sounds about right said Moylan, who has been a record producer, engineer, composer and teacher for 25 years: \"I've really always had a sense that the Beatles were professional musicians as well as being friends. When they were performing, any personal friction evaporated because it was all about the music.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline: https://www.thebeatles.com\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "Transcript for White House flag lowered to half-staff to honor victims of Thousand Oaks shooting\n\nIn the meantime you know this as a prompted national.

The topics loom large over every languorous turn of \"Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2,\" making the set a natural follow-up to Peep's 2017 studio debut.\n\nSonically, the albums are quite similar \u2014 somber but melodic, hovering at the intersection of where emo meets rap. A toxic combination of prescription drugs resulted in Peep's death at age 21, so on his new album his lyrics aren't just typical sad-rap fare, they give a glimpse into real-life tragedy. \"It comes a time, everybody meets the same fate/I think I'm gonna die alone inside my room,\" Peep sings on the introspective standout track \"Life is Beautiful.\"\n\nWhen he sings \"I gotta go right now.\" on album opener \"Broken Smile (My All),\" Peep's words carry the weight of a prediction proven true. As with his previous work, Peep's sorrow is sugar-coated by peppy beats, like on the guitar-laced and catchy \"Cry Alone,\" where he fantasizes about burning down his old high school. \"Tell the rich kids to look at me now,\" he muses.\n\nFrom the head-bob-inducing \"16 Lines\" to the bittersweet \"Sex with My Ex,\" one emotional song seems to roll into the next, ending with final track \"Fingers,\" where Peep signs off with these final bars: \"I'm not gonna last here/I'm not gonna last long.\"\n\nAs a whole, \"Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2\" serves as a soft bed for wallowing in dark thoughts. Some will find it a relatable respite, while others will count it as, simply, a tough space to be in.", "Interpol's secretary general said Thursday that the international police organization's rules forbid him from probing into the fate of the Chinese government official who served as Interpol president for almost two years before he vanished during a trip to China.\n\nIn his first public remarks about the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, Interpol Secretary General Juergen Stock said he \"encouraged\" Chinese authorities to provide information about Meng's location and legal status but can do no more.\n\nStock spoke to journalists as Interpol member prepare to elect a new president to replace Meng during a general assembly in Dubai on Nov. 18-21. Meng became the organization's president in November 2016.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China's vice minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng's disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng's wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol's Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina's Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day. Pressed on whether Interpol had assurances Meng actually wrote it or did so without duress, Stock hedged.\n\n\"There was no reason for me to (suspect) that anything was forced or wrong,\" he said.\n\nInterpol appeared to accept the Chinese delegation's explanation at face value and publicly announced that night that Meng had stepped down, without commenting on why or what happened.\n\nStock cited the structure and nature of the 192-member organization, which provides a platform for member nations to share information on criminal activities, and the vast needs it fulfills in trying to contain ballooning transnational crime. Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\"We are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\" Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \"not to govern over member states.\"\n\n\"We are not an investigative body,\" he said.\n\nStock said he is in \"constant\" contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol's point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol's day-to-day activities, while the agency's elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\"We are strongly encouraging China\" to come forth with details of Meng's case, Stock said. He suggested Chinese officials would \"when the right moment comes.\"\n\nMeng's wife, Grace Meng, told The Associated Press last month that she received threats after her husband disappeared. She and their two children are under police protection in Lyon.\n\n\"There is no doubt this is a very regrettable situation,\" Stock said. \"But on the other hand, we have to ensure day-to-day operations ... continue.\"\n\nHe also conceded that Interpol must \"mitigate negative impact\" springing from Meng's disappearance.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. Governments have repeatedly tried to use Interpol to find political enemies, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nStock said that ensuring the notices are not misused has been one of his priorities.", "This is a Kaiser Health news story.\n\nInterested in Democratic Party? Add Democratic Party as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Democratic Party news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nFor the first time since passing the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will soon control the House of Representatives and its powerful health committees. But Republicans\u2019 tightened grip on the Senate means those hoping for another round of dramatic, progressive reforms may be disappointed.\n\nEmpowered by voters outraged over Republican attempts to chip away at the law\u2019s protections for the sick, Democrats owe much of their midterm takeback to health care issues. And Democratic leaders say they are ready to get back to work, this time training their sights on skyrocketing drug prices, among other policy conundrums, with a majority of House votes and a slate of new committee chairmanships in hand.\n\nIn a few weeks, House Democrats will meet to elect their leaders, including several committee chairs who will be responsible for the nation\u2019s health care policy and spending in the coming years. Hill denizens expect those currently serving as the top Democrat on most House committees to ascend to the chairmanships, with few if any members mounting serious challenges.\n\nThose basking in a post-\u201cblue wave\u201d glow would do well to temper their expectations, recalling that the Republican-controlled House had already voted 54 times to unravel some or all of the Affordable Care Act by its fourth birthday in 2014. In most cases, Democrats in the Senate and White House stopped those efforts in their tracks.\n\nWith the Senate (and the presidency) remaining under Republican control and even fewer moderate Republicans left in the House after this election, Democrats will struggle to move legislation without Republican support. What they can do is hold hearings, launch investigations and generally unnerve the pharmaceutical industry, among other likely adversaries.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a chance they could strike a deal with President Donald Trump, whose administration is moving to crack down on drug companies.\n\nWho are the members most likely to wield the gavels? And what will they do with that power? Here\u2019s a look at some of the major committees that influence health policy \u2014 and the people who may lead them.\n\nThe Committee on Energy and Commerce: Rep. Frank Pallone, New Jersey\n\nPallone, who has served in the House for 30 years, became the top Democrat on this influential committee in 2015. Should he become chairman, he would be responsible for the broadest health portfolio in the House, which includes Medicaid, public health, insurance and drug safety. This is the committee that marked up the Affordable Care Act in 2009 (when Pallone chaired the health subcommittee) and the House Republican repeal effort in 2017.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, Pallone has touted his stewardship of bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the fees charged to manufacturers to review the safety of prescription drugs and medical devices. He has also called for hearings on \u201cmega-mergers\u201d like the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna and worked with other Democrats to counter Republican attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnsurprisingly, his influence over health care issues has attracted a lot of money from pharmaceutical companies, health professionals, HMOs and other industry players. By mid-October, Pallone had received more than $945,000 in campaign contributions from the health sector for this election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. According to a KHN analysis, nearly $170,000 came from political action committees associated with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland\n\nCummings could prove the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s biggest headache come next year. Having served as the committee\u2019s ranking member since 2011 \u2014 a post that lacks the chairman\u2019s subpoena power \u2014 he has been champing at the bit to hold drugmakers accountable.\n\nCQ-Roll Call via Getty Images, FILE\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Cummings approached him about working together to lower the cost of prescription drugs (to no immediate avail), and he has partnered with other lawmakers to demand information from pharmaceutical companies about their drug pricing strategies. Previewing what a Cummings-led committee might look like, he has even launched his own investigations into drug costs, releasing reports with his findings.\n\nDrugmakers have wasted few campaign contributions on Cummings: He has received just $1,000 from their PACs this election, according to data analysis by KHN.\n\nIn a statement to Kaiser Health News, Cummings said Democrats would conduct \u201ccredible, responsible oversight\u201d of the Trump administration, adding: \u201cFor healthcare, that means investigating skyrocketing prescription drug prices, actions that would threaten protections for people with preexisting health conditions, and efforts to undermine the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nThe Committee on Ways and Means: Rep. Richard Neal, Massachusetts\n\nWays and Means oversees Medicare and influences health policy through its jurisdiction over taxes. Though Neal became the top Democrat on this committee in 2017, he has been involved in health care much longer, having played a part in the crafting of both the Affordable Care Act and the failed reform effort under the Clinton administration in 1993.\n\nFacing a primary challenger who touted her support for \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d in his deep-blue district, Neal denied that he opposes the progressive single-payer proposal. But he also said Democrats should focus on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, particularly its protections for those with preexisting conditions and caps on out-of-pocket expenses. (He won handily.)\n\nThe health sector was by far one of the top contributors to Neal\u2019s re-election campaign this year, giving more than $765,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Neal\u2019s district includes the headquarters of several health insurers and other medical companies, which makes him a prime target for campaign contributions.\n\nThe Committee on Appropriations: Rep. Nita Lowey, New York\n\nIf chosen, Lowey would become the first woman to chair the powerful House Committee on Appropriations, holding the nation\u2019s purse strings.\n\nLike Neal and Pallone, Lowey was first elected to Congress in 1988, and she became the committee\u2019s top Democrat in 2013. She has been a dedicated and effective advocate for investing in biomedical research into major diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s, as well as public health programs like pandemic preparedness.\n\nShe has also long championed women\u2019s health issues, proving a vocal critic of the Trump administration\u2019s proposed gag rule on Title X funding, among other policies. Watch for her to continue to push back on the administration\u2019s efforts to restrict access to abortion rights.\n\nAnd on the Senate side, the Committee on Finance: Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa?\n\nThe rumor mill favors Grassley, the Republican who has served most recently as the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, to replace retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nSenate Republican leaders have signaled that entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid could use trimming and, with Republicans emerging from the midterms with a slightly bigger majority, this committee could have its hands full.\n\nHatch proved a friend to the pharmaceutical industry, and his war chest reflected that, taking in more than $850,000 in campaign contributions from drugmaker PACs in the past decade alone, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis. But Grassley has taken a more adversarial approach to the industry, working with a Democratic colleague last summer to pressure drug companies to list their prices in direct-to-consumer ads, for instance.\n\nGrassley held the chairmanship from 2003 to 2006, leaving him two more years at the top, should he want it. (Senate Republican chairs may serve for only six years.) But he might choose to stay on as head of the Judiciary Committee, in which case the next chairman may be the next-most-senior Republican: Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Used with permission.\n\nChapter 9\n\nThese past two years have even amazed me as I have come to have a clearer understanding of what it means to stand for something in the middle of a storm. There is one thing I figured out along the way. Standing up for yourself is really not that hard, especially when you put it into context. However, what has happened on the job is a lot easier than other situations in my life. It is nothing compared to losing my mother after trying to \u201cwill her to live\u201d in her last six months of life. It is nothing compared to having meaningful family relationships that are so complex that love is all you have. What has happened is nothing compared to growing up Baltimore Strong. It is nothing compared to raising two daughters essentially by myself since their birth into their teens and young womanhood.\n\nMaybe people thought I would be weaker, that I would give in, but that\u2019s not how I was raised. My mother always said \u201cnever give up.\u201d In this case, I take her words as \u201cnever give in.\u201d When I face adversity, I come back strong. It might slow me down for a minute, I might have to catch my breath, but then I\u2019m back at it and there\u2019s no stopping me. That\u2019s where I am now. I do not have time for people trying to use their words to insult me or getting aggressive so that I won\u2019t have a follow-up question. While I might not feel comfortable being in the news, I\u2019m very comfortable with how I conduct myself on the job.\n\nWith all this under my belt, I am still blessed and honored to cover the White House daily and be considered an esteemed veteran at this job. Make no mistake about it, I have the greatest respect for the office of the president and the president himself. My respect for the office runs deep. It is more about those who are in the inner sanctum of the White House who have disdain for me. I understand that people are making the attacks, not the institution of the presidency.\n\nHowever, I still have faith in this country and the people of this great land. I am the example they want to set for the White House press corps. The administration\u2019s attack is not just on me, but the entire press. This is not a test, but the real thing, a challenge, and we will see if their attack is successful in the November 2018 midterm elections. For me, I plan to stay on the job, continuing to ask about all of America, especially Black America, because unfortunately the community does not get a fair shake. If the neo-Nazis and alt-right are upset, there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. I was there before they even thought of a man like Donald Trump for president. Who are we as a people if we can\u2019t allow for a difference of views and opinions without being in danger of physical harm, especially if I do not look like you or speak like you? Individual differences and opposing thought is what has made this country great. Yes, I said it. This country is great and has always been, but do we have blemishes, flaws, and warts? Oh, yes. Do we deal with them? Yes!\n\nI report daily in protest -- my job, which I have always enjoyed, is now my form of protest, my marching, and even my \u201ctaking a knee\u201d for other journalists of all races and genders. The protest is in the form of coming to work daily, asking questions, being professional, and not giving in to the taunts and sneers from the White House and other likeminded Trump minions. My protest is in your face, showing I am not dissuaded by the name-calling or minor juvenile attempts to hurt me. I am not thrown by attempts to offer career-ending lies about me. I have receipts to prove otherwise.\n\nPreviously, I never viewed my reporting as a form of protest but as something I was trained to do and continue to do until I choose to leave. It is my right to report and ask questions. But now this reporting has taken on a new meaning. My protest is active and goes against those who offer racist remarks as I continue to ask the same questions I have asked since day one. My protest is not silent. It puts that glaring spotlight on issues that would normally be swept under the rug. My protest is meant to offer truth and unbiased questioning. People always ask how I do it, how I go back.\n\nIt\u2019s simple. My truth is difficult, it\u2019s not easy, but it is empowering for me.

But not only myself, but my great team that we have in the elections division, the great partnership we have created with the county elections officials that actually run the Election Day today.\u201d\n\nBut Abrams' campaign criticized how the election was handled, including Kemp's declaration of victory before all the votes have been counted, and said Kemp's resignation came only after he oversaw the election.\n\n\"He decided to not resign. He decided to oversee his own election. That was not our choice. He owns this, and he owes the people of Georgia an explanation,\" Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said in a press conference Thursday.\n\nABC News has not yet projected a winner in the Kemp-Abrams race because ABC News does not project races that fall within a margin of 1 percentage point, due to concerns about errors in the vote tabulation or possible outstanding votes still to be counted. In Georgia, a winning candidate needs to clear 50 percent plus one to avoid a runoff.\n\nWhile Kemp leads Abrams 51 percent to 48 percent, he is not more than 1 percentage point away from breaking 50 percent -- which is required for victory in Georgia.\n\nKemp said he believes his lead is insurmountable. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has also recognized him as the winner of the election.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Deal appointed former Georgia Department of Human Services Commissioner Robyn A. Crittendon to fill Kemp's vacant seat. Crittendon is the first African-American woman to serve as a statewide constitutional officer in Georgia history, according to Deal's office. In the release, Deal referred to Kemp as \"Gov.-elect.\"\n\nAP, FILE\n\nAbrams is not conceding as she awaits a trove of provisional ballots to be counted and prepares legal action for a potential recount. Her campaign believes there are enough votes still outstanding to force a runoff. A runoff election is required under state law if no candidate achieves a clear majority of the vote.\n\nHer campaign's legal team laid out the strategy going forward at Thursday's press conference. The campaign also said they are filing a lawsuit in Dougherty County, which was hit by Hurricane Michael, claiming that voters were denied the opportunity to cast ballots by mail during the general election.\n\n\"All the votes haven't been counted. How can anybody claim a victory when there are enough votes that have not been counted that could cause a run-off here?\" asked John Chandler, a member of Abrams' legal team.\n\n\"We will litigate until we determine that every person's vote has been counted,\" Chandler said.\n\nStacey Abrams' legal team holds a press conference as Brian Kemp declares victory in governor's race. @ABC has not projected a winner. \"How can anybody claim a victory when there are enough votes that have not been counted that could cause a run-off?\" https://t.co/XNIWYv1jLy pic.twitter.com/AE4CcLScek \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 8, 2018\n\nThe campaign pointed to numerous irregularities and instances where they have been told that all early and provisional ballots have been counted, only to see more vote come in after the fact. They also say they are still receiving complaints and letters from voters and supporters claiming voting issues.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of State Brian Kemp owes voters an explanation. We need to see lists, we need to see counts of every single vote. We need to see all the military provisional numbers. They all need to be counted. We do not believe any of these numbers are credible,\" said Groh-Wargo.\n\nAllegra Lawrence-Hardy, a member of Abrams' legal team, thanked voters for fighting to get their ballots accepted.\n\n\"Stacey Abrams has been fighting for people her whole life and we are going to keep fighting for every voter,\" Lawrence-Hardy said.\n\nNEW: \"We are are going to keep fighting for every voter.\" Stacey Abrams' legal team announces they are filing litigation over absentee ballots as Brian Kemp declares victory in the governor's race. @ABC has not yet projected a winner in the race https://t.co/XNIWYv1jLy pic.twitter.com/XQPN1EGVtG \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 8, 2018\n\nBoth members of Abrams' legal team noted a particular push to count all the absentee and provisional ballots in the state. Lawrence-Hardy called for the secretary of state's office to \"release all the data, all the numbers, and they need to count every single vote.\"\n\nKemp, speaking at his press conference, said about 20,000 provisional ballots remain uncounted in the race -- a number that he said is not enough to put Abrams over the top.\n\nABC News' Johnny Verhovek and Steve Osunsami contributed to this report.", "Google is promising to be more forceful and open about its handling of sexual misconduct cases, a week after thousands of high-paid engineers and others walked out in protest over its male-dominated culture.\n\nGoogle bowed to one of the protesters' main demands by dropping mandatory arbitration of all sexual misconduct cases. That will now be optional, so workers can choose to sue in court and present their case in front of a jury. It mirrors a change made by ride-hailing service Uber after complaints from its female employees prompted an internal investigation. The probe concluded that its rank had been poisoned by rampant sexual harassment.\n\n\"Google's leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you've shared,\" CEO Sundar Pichai said in an email to Google employees. \"We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It's clear we need to make some changes.\" Thursday's email was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nLast week, the tech giant's workers left their cubicles in dozens of offices around the world to protest what they consider management's lax treatment of top executives and other male workers accused of sexual harassment and other misconduct. The protest's organizers estimated that about 20,000 workers participated.\n\nThe reforms are the latest fallout from a broader societal backlash against men's exploitation of their female subordinates in business, entertainment and politics \u2014 a movement that has spawned the \"MeToo\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nGoogle will provide more details about sexual misconduct cases in internal reports available to all employees. The breakdowns will include the number of cases that were substantiated within various company departments and list the types of punishment imposed, including firings, pay cuts and mandated counseling.\n\nThe company is also stepping up its training aimed at preventing misconduct. It's requiring all employees to go through the process annually instead of every other year. Those who fall behind in their training, including top executives, will be dinged in annual performance reviews, leaving a blemish that could lower their pay and make it more difficult to get promoted.\n\nBut Google didn't address protesters' demand for a commitment to pay women the same as men doing similar work. When previously confronted with accusations that it shortchanges women \u2014 made by the U.S. Labor Department and in lawsuits filed by female employees \u2014Google has maintained that its compensation system doesn't discriminate between men and women.\n\nThe changes didn't go far enough to satisfy Vicki Tardif Holland, a Google employee who helped organize and spoke at the protests near the company's Cambridge, Massachusetts, office last week.\n\n\"While Sundar's message was encouraging, important points around discrimination, inequity and representation were not addressed,\" Holland wrote in an email responding to an AP inquiry.\n\nNevertheless, employment experts predicted the generally positive outcome of Google's mass uprising is bound to have ripple effects across Silicon Valley and perhaps the rest of corporate America.\n\n\"These things can be contagious,\" said Thomas Kochan, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology management professor specializing in employment issues. \"I would expect to see other professionals taking action when they see something wrong.\"\n\nSome employers might even pre-emptively adopt some of Google's new policies, given its prestige, said Stephanie Creary, who specializes in workplace and diversity issues at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"When Google does something, other employers tend to copy it,\" she said.\n\nGoogle got caught in the crosshairs two weeks ago after The New York Times detailed allegations of sexual misconduct against the creator of Google's Android software, Andy Rubin. The newspaper said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded the accusations were credible. Rubin has denied the allegations.\n\nLike its Silicon Valley peers, Google has already acknowledged that its workforce is too heavily concentrated with white and Asian men, especially in the highest-paying executive and computer-programming jobs. Women account for 31 percent of Google's employees worldwide, and it's lower for leadership roles.\n\nCritics believe that gender imbalance has created a \"brogammer\" culture akin to a college fraternity house that treats women as sex objects. As part of its ongoing efforts, Google will now require at least one woman or a non-Asian ethnic minority to be included on the list of candidates for executive jobs.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Technology Writer Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this story.", "Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said Thursday that urgent efforts must be taken to prevent a new arms race.\n\nGorbachev, 87, told reporters that Moscow and Washington should focus on mending their rift and improving their relationship, one he described as the most important in the world.\n\nGorbachev said \"I hope that the arms race could be stopped and we could continue the nuclear disarmament\" that he and U.S. President Ronald Reagan initiated.\n\nHe was speaking after attending the Moscow premier of a film made by Werner Herzog based on their conversations.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced last month that he intends to pull out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty that Gorbachev and Reagan signed in 1987 over alleged Russian violations.\n\nGorbachev, who took the helm in 1985 and stepped down on Christmas Day 1991 as the Soviet Union broke up, has won broad international acclaim for his role in helping end the Cold War.\n\nBut he has been frequently criticized at home where many held him responsible for the Soviet demise and the misery and political turmoil that followed.\n\nIn a separate statement issued Thursday, Gorbachev voiced concern about \"attempts to take the world back into the past,\" warning that a new twist of the arms race poses the greatest danger.\n\nGorbachev said he was deeply worried that \"some talk about a nuclear war as something admissible, prepare for it and discuss its possible scenarios.\"\n\nHe noted that he and Reagan agreed that \"a nuclear war can't be won and must never be fought\" \u2014 a declaration that must be remembered today.", "Hackers impersonating journalists tried to intercept the communications of a prominent Saudi opposition figure in Washington, The Associated Press has found.\n\nOne attempt involved the fabrication of a fake BBC secretary and an elaborate television interview request; the other involved the impersonation of slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi to deliver a malicious link.\n\nMedia rights defenders denounced the hacking effort, which they said would make it harder for genuine reporters to do their jobs.\n\n\"It's incredibly dangerous to employ this kind of tactic,\" said Elodie Vialle, who heads the technology desk at Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. \"The chilling effect is that people are deterred from speaking to journalists. In the end, it undermines the freedom of information.\"\n\nThe most involved masquerade took place in February of this year, when someone posing as a BBC journalist called \"Tanya Stalin\" emailed Washington-based Saudi dissident Ali AlAhmed inviting him to a live broadcast about Saudi Arabia. Stalin engaged with AlAhmed over several days, sending him a list of proposed topics and talking him through the logistics of his purported television appearance.\n\nAlAhmed said he knew from the beginning that something was up.\n\nFor starters, Stalin said her position was \"Secretary to the Editor In Chief,\" a title that didn't correspond to a job typically done by producers or bookers. Odder still, the message came over Gmail rather than from an official BBC address.\n\nAnd then there was her eyebrow-raising last name.\n\n\"The Stalin business threw me off,\" AlAhmed said in a recent interview. \"I asked my wife, who is Russian, and she said: 'No one has this name.'\"\n\nAlAhmed was right. The BBC said it wasn't aware of anyone called \"Tanya Stalin\" working for the broadcaster and that the title she claimed to hold did not formally exist. An Associated Press analysis of her messages suggests the interview request was a sloppily executed trap, an attempt to get AlAhmed to click a malicious link and break into his inbox.\n\nAlAhmed believes Saudi Arabia is behind Stalin's emails, as well as dozens of other suspicious messages he has received over the past year. One November 2017 missive purportedly came from Khashoggi, whose killing last month on the grounds of the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has refocused international attention on the brutality of the Arab kingdom's leadership.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington did not return written questions from the AP.\n\nWashington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said the hackers' theft of Khashoggi's identity was \"contemptible.\"\n\nA researcher with internet watchdog Citizen Lab recently reviewed AlAhmed's emails and confirmed they were malicious \u2014 although he stopped short of drawing a link between the different messages or blaming anyone for the hacking campaign.\n\n\"This was a targeted operation designed to gain access to his accounts and private communications,\" said John Scott-Railton, whose group is based at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. \"This does appear to be closely linked to his political activities.\"\n\nSome of the messages \u2014 like a prompt to install a \"free security update\" called \"Ninja security\" \u2014 were generic phishing messages of the type used by criminals and spies the world over. But many of the 40-odd malicious messages recovered from AlAhmed's inbox were closely attuned to current events in the Gulf.\n\nMost troubling was a May 31 message dressed up to look like it came from an event photography service, complete with pictures of AlAhmed holding a microphone during a question and answer session featuring the Qatari foreign minister at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington.\n\nThe photos, which appear to have been pulled off a publicly available video of the event, suggest that the hackers or someone working with them had been tracking AlAhmed's whereabouts closely.\n\n\"That email was really when I felt fear,\" said AlAhmed, who says his work is largely self-funded. \"They are actually physically here. They're looking at me.\"\n\nScott-Railton said the persistence of the hackers \u2014 and the variety of different tactics they employed to try to pry open AlAhmed's inbox \u2014 pointed to a manpower-intensive effort to compromise the Saudi gadfly.\n\n\"Over an extended period of time, humans were tasked with getting into his computer and getting into his head,\" Scott-Railton said.\n\nAs a critic of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, AlAhmed has been a regular on Arabic and English-language cable news for more than a decade. He has long served Washington journalists as a source about the kingdom's problems, especially in relation to extremist propaganda in the country's school textbooks.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a known practitioner of cyberespionage. The country was exposed as a customer of notorious Italian surveillance firm Hacking Team in 2015 and a mysterious Saudi investor has since taken a minority stake in the company, according to a Motherboard report published this year.\n\nRecent reports by Citizen Lab and human rights group Amnesty International have also documented the use of Israeli-made spy software to break into the smartphones of Saudi human rights activists, including Canada-based Omar Abdulaziz, who was working with Khashoggi on several confidential projects before the columnist was killed.\n\nWhoever is behind the bogus Tanya Stalin persona or the fake Jamal Khashoggi emails, the messages give an idea of how the always-fraught overlap between espionage and journalism has evolved in the internet age, with government-backed hackers routinely impersonating journalists or news organizations to hunt their prey. Even the FBI has impersonated reporters to hack its targets, at one point pretending to be an AP journalist to locate a bomb threat hoaxer's computer.\n\nScott-Railton explained that masquerading as a journalist was a perfect way of getting someone to lower their guard and click a link or open an attachment.\n\n\"It ticks all kinds of boxes,\" he said. \"It explains messages out of the blue and as part of communications with journalists you'd expect to receive documents, like questions in advance.\"\n\nThe attempt to hack AlAhmed under Khashoggi's name involved a simple link sent by email , but the Tanya Stalin ruse was unusually involved.\n\nThe hackers created a fake LinkedIn profile with more than 500 connections to corroborate her identity and pass her off as a graduate of journalism schools at Columbia and Berkeley. The profile's picture consisted of a headshot of Souad Mekhennet, a real Washington Post journalist who writes about national security and the Middle East and has covered the aftermath of Khashoggi's death.\n\nIt's not clear why the hackers used Mekhennet's photo in the sham profile or whether they even tried particularly hard to make the \"Tanya Stalin\" persona credible. Stalin did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Neither did whoever was behind the fake Khashoggi email.\n\nBaron, the Washington Post's top editor, said in his statement Wednesday that he condemned the use of Mekhennet's image and Khashoggi's name.\n\n\"To be clear, neither of these distinguished journalists had any involvement whatsoever in these despicable schemes,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nRaphael Satter can be reached at: http://raphaelsatter.com\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA selection of the phishing emails sent to Ali AlAhmed: https://www.documentcloud.org/search/projectid:41381-Fake-Journalist-Hackers", "Google is promising to be more forceful and open about its handling of sexual misconduct cases, a week after high-paid engineers and others walked out in protest over its male-dominated culture.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai spelled out the concessions in an email sent Thursday to Google employees.

For 3 1/2 years, she has been almost completely absent from public life after an aneurysm left her debilitated and unable to speak, and little has been revealed of her condition since.\n\n\"You know, Joni has had a long and arduous recovery from a really major event,\" Taylor, one of Mitchell's oldest friends, told The Associated Press before the show. \"But she's doing so much better.\"\n\nMitchell needed help walking in and getting to her seat in a front corner. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation and spontaneous chorus of \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nThe crowd's love for Mitchell was matched by the artists themselves, especially the women, many of whom said Mitchell was much more than a musical influence.\n\n\"I want you to know how many times you have saved my life,\" Khan said to Mitchell from the stage before ripping into a sizzling take on Mitchell's \"Help Me,\" with backing from Wainwright and Seal, who like other performers spent much of the night sitting on couches on a stage that looked like a living room.\n\n\"Joni Mitchell is an inspiration to every girl who ever picked up a guitar,\" Emmylou Harris said after singing Mitchell's \"Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire.\" That inspiration apparently has its limits. Harris didn't play guitar on the song, saying with a laugh that the \"chords are too hard for me.\"\n\nThe songs were interspersed with photos of Mitchell and audio clips of her speaking throughout her career, allowing her to serve as the evening's narrator even as she remained silent.\n\nLater in the evening, film director and Mitchell mega-fan Cameron Crowe presented her with the Music Center's Excellence in the Performing Arts Award at a dinner gala whose guests included David Geffen, Lily Tomlin, Anjelica Huston and Tom Hanks.\n\nThe concert brought four decades of songs that showed the twisting career path of the onetime Canadian folkie who became the quintessential California singer-songwriter behind albums like \"Blue\" and \"Court and Spark\" and then took her music to places her soft-rock contemporaries would never dare go.\n\nDiana Krall showed the depth of Mitchell's jazz influence as she sat at the piano and sang \"Amelia\" from 1976. Kristofferson and Brandi Carlile showed that Mitchell could be a little bit country with their version of 1971's \"A Case of You\" and its memorable chorus, \"I could drink a case of you darling. Still I'd be on my feet.\"\n\nMitchell's \"Dreamland\" sounded like it was always meant to be a Latin tune when Los Lobos with La Marisoul played it. And James Taylor's solo acoustic \"Woodstock\" gave a necessary nod to Mitchell's simple hippie roots.\n\nThe only song not written by Mitchell was written for her. Graham Nash sang \"Our House,\" his 1970 song about life with Mitchell when the two were dating in their 20s.\n\nAs the show approached its end, the curtain fell and the crowd chanted for an encore.

Add Gun Control as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Gun Control news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSo far, there have been at least six mass shootings, resulting in 59 deaths.\n\nThe deadliest among them was the Parkland school shooting, when 17 students and staff members were killed.\n\nThe Thousand Oaks shooting Wednesday night left at least 12 people dead, and comes less than two weeks after 11 worshippers were killed in a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nAmong the other mass shootings this year include one at Sante Fe High School in Texas in May in which 10 students and teachers were shot dead.\n\nAnother shooting at a Waffle House in Nashville left four people dead. And a shooting at a newspaper office in Maryland left five journalists and staffers dead.\n\n\"Mass shootings are increasing in the U.S. They've been increasing over the past four years,\" said John Cohen, an ABC News consultant and former acting Homeland Security undersecretary. \"Many law enforcement officials agree that these shootings represent the most serious threat facing the United States today.\"\n\nThe true death toll of gun violence is unknown by looking only at mass shootings, which are generally defined using the FBI's criteria for mass murder. By that measure, four people have to be killed for it to be classified as a mass shooting.\n\nFor instance, the shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee last week left three dead. As a result, the incident was not technically considered a mass shooting.\n\nNeither was a shooting at a Maryland Rite Aid, where three people were killed in September.\n\n\"They can happen anywhere,\" Cohen said of mass shootings. \"They're happening more frequently, more people die and it is a problem that is not receiving adequate attention.\"\n\nWednesday night's shooting at the country bar does not qualify as one of the 10 deadliest shootings in modern U.S. history, as there have been at least 10 shootings in which 14 people or more were killed.\n\nOf the 10 deadliest shootings, five have taken place in the past three years, including the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017 when 58 were killed, the Pulse nightclub shooting in which 49 club-goers were killed in June 2016, and the Sutherland Springs church shooting, where 26 were killed in November 2017.", "Here's the challenge when something's as good as it gets: What comes next?\n\nCompanies across industries are in the midst of reporting another quarter of gargantuan profit growth, driven by lower tax bills and a growing economy. Amazon said its net income surged more than tenfold during the summer from a year earlier, for example.\n\nYet stock prices are not getting the boost that they usually do when companies report better-than-expected earnings. On the flip side, investors have punished stocks much more severely when companies have fallen short of profit expectations.\n\nAltogether the S&P 500 is still down about 4 percent since the start of October. That's despite the index being on track to deliver roughly 25 percent growth in earnings per share for the third straight quarter. As of Wednesday, more than four-fifths of companies in the index have reported results.\n\nThe reaction can be tied to the gnawing concern among investors that this may be the peak for corporate profit growth. Analysts say growth may slow to a roughly 15 percent rate in the last three months of the year. In conference calls with analysts following their earnings reports, CEOs have been citing several challenges including rising expenses, President Donald Trump's tariffs and slowing economic growth in countries around the world.\n\nWhen Amazon reported its results two weeks ago, it gave a forecast for revenue this quarter that fell short of analysts' expectations. Part of that was due to the expected effect of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which can dilute the value of sales made abroad. The weaker-than-expected revenue forecast helped sink Amazon's stock by 7.8 percent the day after its profit report, even though its net income far exceeded analysts' expectations.\n\nNext year, profit growth is likely to fall off even more sharply for Corporate America because companies will no longer be getting the big boost provided by a sharp drop in their income-tax rates. That is, unless Washington approves yet another tax cut, which is unlikely now that Democrats have gained control of the House of Representatives.\n\nEarnings growth may run at about 9 percent next year for S&P 500 companies. That would be a good showing during normal times, particularly about a decade into an economic expansion, but it would also be less than half this year's rate.\n\nThe growth expectations are key because stock prices tend to track corporate profits over the long term. When profits are surging, it gives investors more reason to pay high prices for stocks, and the S&P 500 index set a record on Sept. 20.\n\nMost professional investors say stocks look either fairly valued or still a bit expensive relative to how much profit they produce. The S&P 500 is trading at 16.1 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months, for example. That's a more expensive price-to-earnings ratio than its average of 14.7 over the last 15 years.\n\nFor stocks to look more attractive, either prices need to drop or earnings need to rise more. That's why investors are putting so much emphasis on what comes next.", "Jeff Sessions is out at the Department of Justice and Matthew Whitaker, his former chief of staff, is ascending to the role of acting attorney general. But until the president nominates a new attorney general, and that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, questions of authority atop the federal law enforcement department remain.\n\nFederal guidelines, known as the Vacancies Act, exist to account for a smooth transition of power in the event of cabinet-level departures.\n\nIf a Senate-confirmed position is left vacant, the act outlines who can temporarily fill it and for how long.

Add Interest\n\nAustralian telecommunications executive Robyn Denholm brings much-needed financial and auto industry expertise to her new role as Tesla's board chairwoman, but her biggest challenge is whether she can rein in a CEO with a proclivity for misbehavior.\n\nDenholm, who has been a Tesla board member for nearly five years, was named to the post late Wednesday, replacing Elon Musk as part of a securities fraud settlement with U.S. government regulators.\n\nCorporate governance experts say they would have preferred an outsider with manufacturing expertise be appointed to lead the board, now dominated by people with personal and financial ties to Musk, including his brother.\n\nThey aren't sure if Denholm was hired just to placate the Securities and Exchange Commission to comply with the settlement or whether she'll actually be able to corral the visionary but erratic Musk, who remains CEO.\n\n\"With all the crazy stuff going on, she was there,\" said Rohan Williamson, a finance professor who studies corporate governance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. \"She couldn't control him before. Is anything going to change?\"\n\nDenholm, 55, is chief financial officer and strategy head at Telstra Corp. Ltd., Australia's largest telecommunications company. Her new role at Tesla came largely because of the board's failure to control Musk, especially when he made a surprise announcement over in August that funding was secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share.\n\nThat drove up Tesla's stock price and hurt short-sellers, investors who bet against the company's success. Eventually it drew a lawsuit from the SEC alleging that Musk misled investors.\n\nDenholm will step down from Telstra after a six-month notice period. Then she'll work full-time at Tesla, where she has served on the board since 2014. Under the SEC settlement, Musk can't return as chairman for three years, and only with a shareholder vote.\n\nThe move vaults Denholm from relative obscurity into a high-profile position of trying to muzzle Musk and manage a company that is struggling to produce vehicles and make money.\n\nCharles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said Tesla should have brought in someone from outside. No matter how talented Denholm may be, and even though she appears to have fewer ties to Musk than other directors, she has a shadow over her of being on the board that did little as Musk misbehaved. \"You really have got to wonder,\" he said. \"No other CEO of any other public company would have survived this.\"\n\nMaking Denholm a full-time chair also creates governance problems because she could become a Tesla executive, blurring her role as an independent check on management, Elson said.\n\nEmail messages sent to Denholm Thursday were not immediately returned and Tesla declined comment beyond its statement announcing Denholm as chair.\n\nDenholm brings financial experience and other positives to the table for Tesla, said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.\n\nBefore Telstra, she worked in Silicon Valley as chief financial officer at Juniper Networks and head of corporate strategic planning at Sun Microsystems. She also was national finance manager at Toyota Motor Corp.'s operations in Australia, and she's a member of the board at Swiss robotics and industrial machinery maker ABB.\n\n\"She could bring some more financial discipline to Tesla,\" which has $10 billion in debt and must keep manufacturing a large number of lower-priced Model 3 sedans to service its large debt and pay the bills, Cusumano said. Tesla cars also are having reliability problems, he said.\n\nCusumano further notes that Denholm's track record as a Tesla board member is not necessarily an indication of how she'll be as a chairwoman.\n\n\"She's had a ringside seat to the chaos and she didn't or was not in a position to change anything,\" said Cusumano, who has served on corporate boards. \"All the information you are given comes from the CEO, COO, CFO,\" he said. \"It really is a restricted position. So I don't think we can say that, well, she was ineffective as a director, the whole board was ineffective, so she's likely to be ineffective as chairwoman.\"\n\nOn Twitter Thursday morning, Musk wrote that he has great respect for Denholm. \"Very much look forward to working together,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Denholm said she believes in Tesla and looks forward to helping Musk and the company \"achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nTesla earned a $311.5 million net profit during the third-quarter. It was only the third time that Tesla has posted a quarterly profit in its eight-year history as a public company and the first time in two years. Telsa has never reported an annual profit.\n\nUnder the settlement with the SEC, Tesla also is required to appoint two new independent directors, and it must review Musk's posts about the company on Twitter. Musk and Tesla each had to pay a $20 million penalty under the September deal with the SEC, and he cannot return as chairman for three years.\n\nBut controlling Musk will be a big job for Denholm. Even after the settlement was announced, Musk taunted the SEC, calling it the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission\" before snidely praising it for \"doing incredible work.\"", "The European Union's Brexit negotiator on Thursday said that gaps remain to be bridged in talks on the U.K.'s departure from the bloc as time runs out to secure a deal and have it endorsed.\n\nBritain leaves the EU on March 29, but a deal must be sealed in the coming weeks to leave enough time for the U.K. Parliament and European Parliament to sign off on it.\n\n\"We need much more work\" to clinch an agreement, Michel Barnier told The Associated Press on the sidelines of a gathering of center-right political parties in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe main obstacle to an agreement is how to keep goods flowing smoothly across the border between the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K. All parties have committed to avoid a \"hard border\" with costly, time-consuming border checks that would hamper business. Any new customs posts on the border could also re-ignite lingering sectarian tensions.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said, however, that major progress in Brexit talks was likely \"within a week,\" based on his discussions with several visiting EU leaders and European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs summits of the EU's 28 leaders.\n\n\"We're going through crucial days now. We're very close now,\" Sipila told reporters.\n\nEuropean leaders are awaiting Barnier's assessment as to whether sufficient progress has been made in the Brexit negotiations for an EU summit to be convened to announce a deal. Rumors are swirling that one might take place by the end of November, weeks ahead of a pre-planned EU summit in mid-December, but Barnier declined to say when or if that would happen.\n\nIn Paris, Britain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said Brexit negotiations are in \"the final phase\" and he is confident an agreement will be reached.\n\n\"Seven days is probably pushing it, but I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal,\" Hunt said, adding it is \"very, very difficult to resolve but I am confident that we can.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in Helsinki, said that British Prime Minister Theresa May \"is, as we are, decided to have the deal, and we will have a deal.\"\n\nLater, addressing leaders of the European People's Party group, Barnier warned of the threat that rising nationalism and populism pose to the EU ahead of European Parliament elections in May. He referred to Nigel Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader who helped convinced many Britons to vote for Brexit.\n\n\"This election will be tougher than those before,\" Barnier said. \"We will have to fight against those who want to demolish Europe \u2014 their fear, their populist deceit, their attacks against the European project. There is now a Farage in every country.\"\n\nThe European elections will be the first of the post-Brexit era.\n\nEurope's incapacity to manage migration has fueled far-right sentiment across the continent and many worry that nationalists might make more progress in May. The slow pace of Brexit talks and the standoff between the EU and Italy over the budget plans of the populist government in Rome are reminders of the kinds of upheavals that might occur if disenchanted European voters look to the right or far-right for answers.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDavid Keyton in Helsinki and John Leicester in Paris contributed to this report.", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

Karen Handel conceded. \"Absolutely nothing \u2014 no politician & no special interest \u2014 is more powerful than a mother on a mission.\"\n\nMcBath's son, Jordan Davis, was slain at a Jacksonville, Florida gas station in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the black teenager and his friends had been playing in their car.\n\nMichael Dunn used the \"stand-your-ground\" law in his defense, but was convicted and is serving a life sentence.\n\nAfter her son's slaying, McBath became active in gun control advocacy. John Feinblatt, who heads the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety, said McBath first came to them as a volunteer and eventually joined the staff and headed faith outreach efforts.\n\n\"We saw in Lucy a natural leader that people immediately started to look up to for her real devotion to honoring her son and ability to rally others,\" he said.\n\nOver the years she's testified before Congress and spoken at rallies, often wearing a button with her son's photo on it. In the 2016 presidential race, as a member of \"Mothers of the Movement,\" she endorsed Hillary Clinton. The Mothers group is a sisterhood of black women whose sons were shot to death by white men or police officers.\n\nMcBath decided to run for office after the February massacre at a south Florida high school, she said during a campaign rally. In running against Handel, McBath made gun control a key issue, sharing with voters her personal journey.\n\n\"I lost my son Jordan but I'm still his mother. And I still continue to mother him through making sure that I preserve the lives of other children like him,\" she said during a television ad.\n\nThe longtime Delta Airlines flight attendant also frequently mentioned her battle with breast cancer during the campaign as she attacked Handel on health care issues.\n\nHer neophyte campaign for the suburban Atlanta seat former House Speaker Newt Gingrich held got a big boost from Democrat Stacey Abrams' efforts to increase turnout in the governor's race. McBath appeared on stage with Abrams and former President Barack Obama during a campaign event last week.\n\nHandel conceded Thursday and offered McBath \"good thoughts and much prayer for the journey that lies ahead for her.\" McBath's victory extends Democrats' strength in suburban districts.\n\nIn 2016, Rep. Tom Price cruised to victory without a serious Democratic challenge. But his resignation to join President Donald Trump's Cabinet as health secretary set off a fierce special election battle featuring Handel against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Handel won, leaving the appearance that the district was still fundamentally Republican.\n\nBut getting any kind of gun control measures signed into law, as McBath hopes, will be difficult if not impossible in the next Congress.\n\nRepublicans expanded their Senate majority Tuesday, and Trump remains a favored ally of the National Rifle Association. In his midterm campaign sweep, the president frequently delighted his boisterous rallies with promises to \"protect the Second Amendment.\"\n\nAnother congressional race remained too close to call Thursday in the neighboring 7th District.

Francisco Franco.\n\nPolice say the 63-year-old former private security guard was arrested in the town of Terrassa in the Catalonia region on Sept. 19 after a brief investigation. He remains in custody and has not been charged.\n\nThe case was revealed Thursday by Spanish newspaper Publico.\n\nPolice said they found 16 firearms in the suspect's home, ranging from handguns to sniper rifles, but did not explain how he had managed to amass such an arsenal.\n\n\"This person had a clear intention and will to take actions against the prime minister,\" Catalan regional police spokesman Albert Oliva told journalists. He added that the suspect did not appear to have concrete plans, but had been asking for logistical support on a WhatsApp group chat.\n\nAccording to Oliva, the suspect wrote in one of the messages that he was \"willing to sacrifice (himself) for Spain\" and that he showed no concern over the legal consequences of carrying out an attack.\n\nPolice say the investigation was launched after an unidentified person who had read the suspect's messages alerted them.\n\nThe far-right VOX party, which opposes the exhumation of Franco, issued a statement Thursday saying one of its local coordinators informed police of the suspect's plans after reading them on a WhatsApp group chat. VOX said the suspect was not affiliated to the party.\n\nSpain's center-left government decided earlier this year to exhume Franco's remains from a self-aggrandizing mausoleum, but officials have struggled to find an appropriate new burial place.\n\nRelatives and supporters of the late dictator oppose the exhumation. If the government goes ahead, Franco's family wants his body reinterred under Madrid's cathedral \u2014 a move that could undermine efforts to rid the country of his long shadow.\n\nSanchez on Thursday thanked police for their work and said that he was grateful for the show of support he received.\n\nThe government played down the suspected plot, calling it an isolated incident.\n\n\"Every government has experienced incidents like this,\" government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting.", "Police in Thailand have arrested an HIV-infected soldier who allegedly blackmailed and raped more than 70 teenage boys.\n\nPolice said in a statement they received a complaint that the suspect was using fake social media profiles on and the gay dating app Blued to win the trust of his victims so they would send him nude photos before agreeing to meet him.

With the recent addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's embattled Supreme Court pick who faced sexual assault allegations during his nomination process, they are the minority on the court.\n\nThe president and first lady Melania Trump attended a pre-scheduled meet-and-greet with Supreme Court justices Thursday morning, followed by the investiture ceremony for Kavanaugh.\n\nThe Collection of the Supreme Court/MCT/Getty Images, FILE\n\nGinsburg has developed a reputation for her toughness and strength, both because of her rigorous personal training sessions in the Supreme Court exercise room, and because of the strides she's made for gender equality in the workplace.\n\nMagnolia Pictures via AP\n\nShe was one of nine women in her class at Harvard Law School, the first woman to be a tenured professor at Columbia University Law School and the co-founder of the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, a group she started in order to fight for equal treatment for both genders.\n\n\"The Project was so integral in establishing the principle of equal rights,\" said Mary Heen, who worked at the Women's Rights Project in the 1980s, in a tribute to the group by the ACLU.\n\nLeading this project, Ginsburg successfully argued six landmark cases before the Supreme Court. In 1980, she was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

She broke two ribs in June of 2012, when Ginsburg was 79, but continued to work after the incident.\n\nThe next date the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments is Nov. 26.\n\nRib fractures, a common but painful injury in the elderly community, generally heal in approximately eight to 10 weeks, according to Dr. David Forsh, the chief of orthopedic trauma for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York.\n\nThe injury can make it difficult to breathe, and can potentially lead to further complications like a collapsed lung or an increased risk of pneumonia, said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital, which is also in New York City.\n\nTreatment usually involves pain medication and keeping a watchful eye over symptoms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the White House lawn as the news of Ginsburg's fall broke, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway wished Ginsburg a \"full and speedy recovery.\"\n\n\"We are praying for her and we know how tough she is.

The sheriff said the gun normally holds 10 bullets and one in the chamber. He said it was unclear how many rounds the magazine held.\n\n\"We don't know if he reloaded his weapon or not,\" Dean said.\n\nColleen Long/Facebook\n\nDean said police had several minor run-ins with the alleged mass shooter, including an incident last April in which deputies were called to his home in Newbury Park on a report that he was acting erratically.

An opposition war monitor said the release was part of an exchange.\n\nSANA news agency said in its report that the operation occurred in the Hamima area east of the historic town of Palmyra. It said all IS fighters in the area where the hostages were held have been killed.\n\nThe Suwayda 24 activist collective quoted local officials as saying the women and children held by IS have all been freed.\n\n\"My happiness is huge,\" Nashaat Abu Ammar, whose wife, two sons and daughter are among those freed, told The Associated Press by telephone.\n\nThe 19 women and children were among 30 people kidnapped by IS in the southern province of Sweida on July 25 when militants of the extremist group ambushed residents and went on a killing spree that left at least 216 people dead.\n\nThe rare attacks in Sweida province, populated mainly by Syria's minority Druze, came amid a government offensive elsewhere in the country's south. The coordinated attacks across the province, which included several suicide bombings, shattered the calm of a region that had been largely spared from the worst of the violence of Syria's seven-year long civil war.\n\nA Syrian opposition war monitor contradicted the reports on state media, saying IS set free the hostages in return for the government's release of women related to IS fighters and commanders who were held by Syrian authorities as well as a monetary payment.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear how much money the government paid for the release of the hostages.\n\nState TV aired footage of the women, children and teenagers in a desert area standing with soldiers who gave them bread and water. The soldier then asked the women and children for their names and wrote them on a piece of paper. The TV later aired footage showing the former hostages having meals around a table.\n\n\"We are living the joy of victory in Syria,\" Druze cleric Sheikh Kameel Nasr told Syrian state TV.\n\nSince July, one woman died in IS custody while another was shot dead by the extremists. In August, a 19-year-old man was also killed in detention.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, were freed in an exchange with the government last month. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but after the talks failed, Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nThe July 25 attack on the southern city of Sweida and nearby villages was one of the deadliest by the extremists since they lost most of the land they once held in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"I am so happy they have been freed and I thank the Syrian army for that,\" Abu Ammar said. The man said he is getting ready to leave his village to the provincial capital of Sweida where the freed were expected to be brought later.\n\nBy sunset, scores of people gathered in the city of Sweida waiting for the return of the former hostages.\n\nElsewhere in Syria, opposition activists and paramedics reported that two blasts in rebel-held parts of northern Syria have inflicted casualties.\n\nThe Observatory said the first explosion occurred in the northern town of Azaz wounding six children while the opposition's Syrian Civil Defense said four were wounded including three children.\n\nThe observatory and other opposition activists reported another blast in the town of Jinderis saying a bomb went off outside an office of the Turkey-backed Failaq al-Sham rebel group killing three fighters and wounding seven.\n\nAzaz and Jeideris are controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters.

I would go to class and I would go act like I was going to the restroom, and then I would go write a song in Nashville\u2026 But the thing is, I got these amazing relationships with my teachers where they knew I was passionate about getting my degree, but I was also passionate about my true love for music.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's been a crazy ride, but it took all those moments\u2026 of being kind of naive to not know how tough the road was,\u201d Eldredge added. \u201cTo find out it's a beautiful road, it's tough but it's amazing and [you] just got to have no fear and, and go for it.\u201d\n\nJason Kempin/Getty Images\n\nBrett Young\n\n\u201cI was still down in Orange County\u2026 at that point I ... had stopped bartending because I had five different residencies a week as an artist.

We were just driving around the country in a van, a 15 passenger van, and there was six of us. No tour manager, no song guy, no lighting, uh and that's what we did. We put 100,000 miles on that thing in a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen years ago\u2026 I probably got my first publishing deal\u2026 which [I] would soon thereafter lose,\u201d TJ Osborne said. \u201cI was also working with a country artist named Phil Vasser at the time.

So it was a big deal though, you know, because no matter where you are on Broadway, there's fans from all over the world and people are interested in country music and looking for the next up and comer. And so I had a bar full of people that were really, really kind and clapped after I played my original songs that were terrible, and hung around for, you know, Garth Brooks' \u2018Friends In Low Places\u2019 for the beers afterwards.\u201d\n\nErika Goldring/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Georgia Line\n\n\u201cTen years ago, we were in college at Belmont\u2026. just about to meet,\u201d Tyler Hubbard said. \u201cIt was that summer where we moved in together, got a place, and started working together, started to write together.

Nurul Huda said in a televised address that all arrangements have been made to ensure the election will be peaceful. Candidates must file their applications on Nov. 19.\n\nHuda said all political parties would receive an equal opportunity and urged all to contest the election.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution. The opposition has demanded an independent caretaker administration, saying the election could be rigged under Hasina.\n\nHasina's arch rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges. It is uncertain whether her Bangladesh Nationalist Party will participate in the polls. The party and its partners boycotted the last election in 2014, when Hasina returned to power with a commanding majority.\n\nZia, 73, has been in jail since February, when she was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for alleged corruption in the establishment of an orphanage fund during her first term as prime minister in 1991-1996. Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia's party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nAlso last month, the Election Commission canceled the political registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the main partner of Zia's party, which prevents it from contesting the election. The court said the party's registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country's war of independence with Pakistan in 1971. The party is a fierce opponent of Hasina and is eager to regain its strength after the executions of its top leaders on charges of war crimes during the conflict.\n\nThe polls would be Bangladesh's 11th general election since it gained independence in the war.\n\nA newly formed opposition alliance quickly rejected the election schedule on Thursday and urged the Election Commission to push the date back. Zia's party is the main partner in the alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Zia was returned to a Dhaka jail from a hospital where she had been receiving treatment for multiple health problems.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest. A court last month sentenced him in absentia to life in prison in a 2004 grenade attack case.\n\nBangladesh has been a parliamentary democracy since 1991 after an autocratic government led by former military chief H.M. Ershad was toppled by mass protests. Hasina and Zia have since ruled the country under a complex political culture in which violence has often marred the electoral process.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that election official's name is K.M.

He was convicted of apostasy and sentenced to death in December 2014. An appeals court later reduced his punishment to two years imprisonment, which he has served. However, he has not yet been released.\n\nMore than 150 cases of arbitrary arrests of human rights defenders have been recorded by Amnesty International since 2014. Amnesty called on Mauritania's financial and technical partners to apply more pressure to end slavery in the country.\n\nEarly this year, The African Union ruled the West African nation has not enforced its own anti-slavery laws after it passed out a lenient sentence to slave owners.\n\nThe U.S. in its statement this month said Mauritania is not making sufficient progress toward combating forced labor, including slavery. As a result, it said it will end Mauritania's trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which permits some duty-free trade.\n\n\"Forced or compulsory labor practices like hereditary slavery have no place in the 21st century,\" said Deputy U.S. Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney. \"This action underscores this administration's commitment to ending modern slavery and enforcing labor provisions in our trade laws and trade agreements. We hope Mauritania will work with us to eradicate forced labor and hereditary slavery so that its AGOA eligibility may be restored in the future.\"\n\nMauritania was the last country to abolish slavery in 1981, though the practice remains. The 2018 Global Slavery Index indicates that 90,000 people still live as slaves in Mauritania.\n\nThe Mauritanian government, however, denies that slavery is widespread in the country.\n\n\"Mauritania has made great efforts to eradicate the aftermath of slavery and has achieved undoubtedly significant results in this regard,\" the government said in a statement.\n\nIt said the U.S. decision is motivated by misinformation, and that the government hopes that the Trump administration will reconsider its decision.\n\nU.S. imports from Mauritania of fish, fertilizers and mineral fuels were more than $61 million in 2017.\n\nFrancois Patuel, West Africa researcher for Amnesty International, said that while the group cannot take a position on sanctions, \"we encourage Mauritania's financial and technical partners to continue to raise the issues of the persistence of slavery, discrimination and reprisals against human rights defenders during political dialogues.\"\n\nHe called on technical and financial partners to call on Mauritania to bring suspected slave owners to justice and \"to create a safe and supportive environment for activists.\"\n\n\"Mauritania gets a lot of support because it is considered a key ally on the war on terror, both by the U.S. government and European governments,\" said Patuel. \"We've been telling them to make sure this isn't used as a carte blanche for authorities to do what they want without repercussions.\"\n\nHe said dialogue and pressure are needed to eradicate slavery. Patuel also warned: \"To be coherent, the U.S. should stop deporting individuals to Mauritania where they would face discrimination and arrests.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP reporter Ahmed Mohamed in Nouakchott, Mauritania contributed to this report.", "Two former presidents of Madagascar are neck and neck as votes are being counted in the presidential election that seeks to end years of political instability in this Indian Ocean island nation.\n\nAccording to partial results announced by the National Electoral Commission on Thursday, Andry Rajoelina had 45 percent of votes counted and Marc Ravalomanana had 40 percent, with results from 291 of the more than 24,000 polling stations.\n\nThe electoral commission said that about 48 percent of the 9.9 million registered voters cast their ballots in the election.\n\nRajoelina was appointed by the military to be president during the transitional period from 2009 to 2013 and Ravalomanana was president from 2002 to 2009. The former presidents waged assertive campaigns among the field of 36 candidates in the presidential election.", "The U.N.'s specially appointed researcher on human rights in Cambodia expressed concern Thursday over the country's use of pre-trial detention and its failure to conduct trials speedily.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the end of an 11-day mission, Rhona Smith specifically expressed concern about people arrested in politically linked cases, including Kem Sokha, the former leader of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party.\n\nKem Sokha was freed on bail in September after being jailed without trial for a year on a treason charge, but the conditions of his release amount to a form of house arrest.\n\nSmith said a judge denied her request to meet Kem Sokha, and she called for him to be quickly brought to trial or released.\n\n\"Access to justice also requires speedy trials and I am concerned at the time taken to conduct trials and the significant number of people in pre-trial detention,\" Smith said in a statement. \"I repeat my recommendations to use pre-trial detention only when absolutely necessary in accordance with Cambodia criminal procedure code; to carefully document the use of pre-trial detention; and to regularly review the ongoing need in each case.\"\n\nSmith's comments about Cambodia were unusually mild. U.N. human rights investigators are typically highly critical of Cambodia's restrictive political environment and harassment of critics and opponents. She told reporters that for her latest mission in Cambodia, she chose to focus on \"the localization of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,\" which means broadly addressing how human rights policies can contribute to a nation's overall social and economic development.\n\nCambodia was harshly criticized by many rights groups and Western nations for holding a general election in July that they judged unfair and undemocratic. The election extended the rule of Prime Minister Hun Sen into a fourth decade.\n\nThe only credible opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was disbanded last year by the courts in a move seen as politically motivated. The 19 other parties that contested the election were seen as either having trivial support or being promoted by the ruling party to foster the illusion of democratic choice.\n\nThe government had already cracked down on the opposition last year as the ruling party's prospects for the general election were looking shaky. The opposition had made a strong showing in 2017 local elections, building on its surprisingly strong challenge in the 2013 general election.\n\nKem Sokha was arrested in September last year on the basis of years-old videos showing him at a seminar where he spoke about receiving advice from U.S. pro-democracy groups. His party denied the treason allegation, calling it politically motivated.", "Four fishermen have been rescued after capsizing in the English Channel during a heavy storm.\n\nBritain's Maritime and Coastguard Agency said Thursday the men capsized east of Eastbourne late Wednesday afternoon.

The two men on the hull were in danger of being washed away because of high waves and strong winds until they were airlifted onto a search-and-rescue helicopter.\n\nThe men were treated for exposure.\n\nCoast guard controller Kaimes Beasley said a potential tragedy had been averted by the coordinated rescue effort.", "Transcript for Special Report: Shooting in Thousand Oaks, California\n\nacross -- another crash involving the truck and a bicycle. We interrupt report on southern California. It is horrific. At least 12 people have been killed in a mass shooting at a nightclub in Ventura county. This was in Thousand Oaks California at the borderline bar and grill. There was a college country night happening when a lone gunman came in and began shooting. Among the 12 people killed, we've learned, a Ventura county sheriff's sergeant. He was responding to the shots fired and walked in and was shot within seconds by the gunman. We learned that the gunman is dead. Once officers made their way in, they found him. They're not sure if it was self-inflicted. This is still a very active investigation. All of this played out on a college night. It was a popular night at the biggest bar in Ventura county. All of these young people, you see them, they are emotional after the shooting. They were having a good time and country line dancing at the time when the gunman entered. Witnesses say he may have set off smoke grenades and just opened fire. 11 people, probably a lot of young people are killed inside the bar. The sheriff's deputy and highway patrol officers responded within three minutes. In addition, between 10 to 15 people were injured. Some of the gunshot wounds and some injured trying to escape. We've been hearing from witnesses who say they had to break out the windows using chairs to try to get out of this nightclub to safety. This gunman reloaded his handgun at least once. Investigators at the scene say they have only so far recovered one handgun. It is unclear if there were other weapons. They haven't found any of this point. But they believe this was the act carried out by a lone gunman. Reporter: -- Actually, we will pause for that. But we do have some people who were inside of the building when the shooting started. Here's what they had to say. We were just dancing on the floor and we heard a couple shots. I told her to get down, all of my friends to get down and we went behind, we stayed behind the stage and got out through the kitchen and went to the back door and she got out. And I went in and got some more people to get out. And we just tried to get out and get behind a car or get behind something. We just try to take cover. All he did was sit there and wait. And we just waited until the sheriffs came out. We were just hoping to get out and look for all of our friends. Did you see him at all? We were dancing and I saw someone walk in, and after that, I just saw the shots go off and I got them. It was such a blur. There was smoke, he was shooting everything from the speakers to anything he saw. We just saw smoke and shots. We just try to get down as fast as we could and to get out of there. You were dancing anywhere the shots and you jumped to the ground? Yes. There was a line dance going on. We got out and I heard the shots and everyone got down and started freaking out and running around. I told her to get down and get out. I said let's move we need to get out before anything happens. We don't know where the shots are coming from. That is all we just try to do was get ourselves out safely. What did you think the noises were? I knew that they were gunshots. I am prior military. I knew what they sounded like. I think anyone had a good idea what they were because everyone jumped to the ground pretty quickly. Everyone just trembled out as quick as possible. They broke windows and got out the kitchen. We got at about -- we got at the back gate. I know that some people knocked out the window with the stool. People went up to the attic above the bar. They destroyed to find any kind of cover in any way at all. Was going through your mind when he heard the shot? Just to get my friends out safely. Just to get them out. I just wanted her to get out safely and I didn't care what happened after that. Do you know what kind of weapon it was? I don't know. All I know is it was a semi automatic. We heard 18 to 20 rounds at a time before we got out. Reporter: That is an insane amount, we want to thank you for talking to us and telling us. The sheriff called this a tragic situation, saying multiple calls came in around 11:20 pacific time and one of the sheriff deputies as well as California highway patrol where there within moments. They were nearby. Reporter: We just heard from the sheriff's office. -- 11 victims were shot inside. We have a sheriff's sergeant who was killed. They told us that he died at the hospital about one hour ago. And then they told us that the suspect was found inside dead. When asked if they believe it was self-inflicted, they said it appears to be that way, but they are not saying that at this time. We know that the sheriff's sergeant was hit multiple times and was one of the first to respond. He responded with a highway patrol officer. The two of them went inside. He was hit multiple times in the highway patrol officer pulled him out. The sergeant's name was Ron heal us. He is survived by his wife and son. It was very emotional. He died a hero. They are also telling us at this point they have no idea if there is a terrorism like. -- Link. Just an absolutely horrific -- the sheriff got choked up talking about the sheriff. He was his gym buddy. He said right now that the focus on the other victims. There were so many other victims who were killed, and they were very young. But sergeant was expecting to retire next year. 29 year veteran of the force. That was difficult to hear, but the sheriff Jeffrey Dean said it was an horrific scene. He described his colleague as a hard-working, dedicated man who died a hero. The sheriff's sergeant from moorpark. There was a press conference moments ago with the sheriff who was fighting back tears. There were multiple other victims of different levels of injury inside that were rescued from the scene and taken to local hospitals. In addition to the victims inside, the numbers are upwards of 10 to 12, additional victims with minor injuries fled the scene on their own and took themselves to local hospitals. The sergeant passed away at the hospital about one hour ago. I only mention it might be terrorists, there is no reason for it when we have this horrific death. I have nothing to lead me to believe or the FBI that there is any link to terrorism, but we certainly will look at the option. Losing Ron, we go to the gym and work out together, it's horrific and terrible and it saddens our heart, but there are parents of those 11 other victims and their whose hearts are ripped out tonight. And parents are wondering, was one of my children in there? Or was my sister or my brother? So there is no way to describe this. It saddens us all and tears at our hearts and emotions and if it doesn't, there is something wrong with us. There you have Jeff Dean speaking. He mentioned it is something that we have not become accustomed to, but it happens a lot. The Pittsburgh synagogue shooting was only 12 days ago. There was a shooting at a yoga studio that killed two people last weekend and several people were shot and now again, this has happened in America. In Ventura, Thousand Oaks California 40 miles from los Angeles. Investigators still have not identified the gunman, but it is something that they are working to do at this point. It was absolutely horrific and there are hundreds of people inside line dancing on the dance floor when this gunman came in. Let's hear from one of the witnesses. I was to the front door and talking to my stepdad, and I started hearing these pop sounds. There were three or four and I hit the ground. I looked up at the security guard was dead or I don't want to say dead, but he was shot and down. And the gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place. I saw him point to the back of the cash register. He just kept firing. I ran out the front door. I heard chairs being thrown out the window and people were trying to get out the windows. The gunman went behind the cash register, there were probably 12 shots before I got out the front door. And I go out and I come back in to see if my stepdad was okay and I heard him yelling and I ran, but the gunman had a beard and he looked, Middle Eastern or so, he wore a hat and black jacket. I think he had glasses, like prescription glasses. He had a big handgun, I mean, shots were just firing. I was closest, the security guard was closest to the front door, the two people behind the cash register were close and I was the next person closest to the front door. I thought it was a joke. When the shots started firing. And I just, I don't, I know people there. I don't know how I didn't get shot. You come here a lot? Yes. Here and there. It is a local spot. It is one of maybe three. Reporter: You knew more people inside? My friend that works behind the bar wasn't working tonight, but from what I've been told, there are still people inside and it is an active shooter. It is no longer an active shooter situation. The interview was from earlier. The gunman is now dead. Want to go on the line, you been talking some of these witnesses -- you've been talking to some of these witnesses, share some of these horrific stories you been hearing at the scene. It looks like the last group of people who were on scene are mostly, sadly, parents of loved ones who they have yet to hear from. That is just the next kind of got punch of this awful story, to learn who the 11 families are and find out what they are dealing with, knowing that whoever went to this bar tonight is not coming home. The interview that you just ran, that was the first person they encountered on the scene and I asked him if he was okay, he so clearly was not okay. His eyes were as red as I've ever seen anyone's, and he was clearly in shock. He was there with his father-in- law and at times during the interview with his father-in- law, he went over to console him. These people are coming out and reliving the experiences. How do you tell someone that just went through this that they are going to be dealing with this for so long? His father-in-law had survivor's guilt saying he could've done more. And we hear the toll it has taken, 12 are dead including the sheriff's deputy, the sheriff's sergeant. And you think of the dozen more injured, those who were jumping out windows and running out the back door or trampled. One girl said when everyone hit the floor, there was a pile of bodies trying to seek shelter however they could. This is an event that will live with a lot of people for a long time. I'm sure they did everything they could to try to get out and to safety, didn't they? Yes. Some people we talked to where by the front door and ran out immediately. Others were on the dance floor at the time and where simply lying on the ground. It provides no shelter, but someone yelled get down. Everyone got to the floor. Only when the gunman reloaded, there was a break in the gunfire and they were able to run out the back door, smash windows with chairs, we spoke to a young man who still had blood on his shirt who took a chair and threw it through a window so other people could escape and get out as fast as they could. I asked a couple people, they heard people panic and there weren't many screams, it was almost pretty quiet as they were going through this. And but there definitely was a sense of panic knowing exactly what it was. Everyone knew from the start what was happening, what the noise that they heard was. It was clearly gunfire. And just to do whatever they could to get out of there. Just random gunfire from eyewitnesses, it didn't appear to be a specific target. Investigators don't know the motive and have not identified the 11 people that were killed inside. They don't have an age range. But it is safe to presume that at least some of them were very young. It was an 18+ night. This was at the borderline bar at the college night. I know this is about 40 minutes from la. This is a town called Thousand Oaks and this bar is well known in the college circuit. There is a local college in town, but also kids were coming from further west into Ventura county and back east into la county, Santa Clarita as well. This was a bar that was, this is known by young people on a Wednesday night as a place to be, and the first we got from the sheriff's office was that there were hundreds inside. This was a well-known bar that was packed with people having fun, not expecting on a Wednesday night that their life would be turned upside down as it has been, and we do know that 11 attendees were shot and killed in the 12th was the sheriff's sergeant. A 29 year veteran of the department who was planning to retire in the next year. He ran into the building upon arriving on scene and hearing gunfire. He thought there something he could do and ran into danger and was immediately struck by several bullets. On entering the door, there was a California highway patrolman who entered with him and pulled his body out. He is the 12th victim of the shooting. Of course, the shooter is dead, so 13 in all as of now. The Ventura county sheriff said the sergeant died a hero because he went into save lives and he shared that with the sergeant's wife. We know that there are multiple agencies at the scene. FBI and ATF as well as local agencies. Tell us about the scene right now. It is tough. Some of the last few survivors that we saw were a pair of girls walking down the middle of the street in blankets. It is a cold night, not as cold as the east coast, but it has dipped down into the 40s which on the west coast is pretty chilly at night. So we have a lot of people in T- shirts and shorts looking for jackets or cover or whatever they could get and a mass of media in the middle of the roadway and just family and friends hoping upon hope that at this point, hours after the fact that they haven't heard from their loved one that maybe someone is in the hospital unable to respond or they've lost the phone or somersaulting. But for those who haven't heard from loved ones, they are running out of time, they just sense the emotion from the sheriff who was friends with the sergeant. His voice was breaking up a couple times when recounting what happened. And the relationship with his friend. And it is a tough night in Thousand Oaks.

Add Interest\n\nSay what you will about Nancy Pelosi -- and more than a few of her fellow Democrats would like to tell the once and probably-future House speaker to go away -- but she's quickly emerging as the most important Democrat on the national stage.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections demonstrated why. Before President Donald Trump hijacked his own news cycle by firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Trump and Pelosi offered dueling takes on the relationships that will define the new dynamics of a Democratic House digging in on a Republican White House.\n\nIf gridlock emerges out of congressional oversight efforts, the president warned, \"I would blame them.\"\n\nPelosi responded with a warning of her own -- of sorts -- directed at her own members, even though she hasn't locked down the speakership yet: \"I don't think we are going to have any scattershot freelancing.\"\n\nNicholas Kamm /AFP/Getty Images\n\nDemocrats are building a new majority. But with Pelosi, they don't have to do it from scratch: She's been there before, and has the standing to offer guardrails and reflect the diverse array of backgrounds populating the new Democratic caucus.\n\nHours later, with Sessions fired and Trump critics in meltdown mode, it became obvious that a Democratic House is about more than offering an opposing agenda. It will be about checks on a president -- checks that will require their own balancing acts.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders argued Wednesday that Democrats had plenty to be proud of in the wake of the midterm elections, including the fact that Democrats won the popular vote, flipped majority control of the House, elected a historically diverse set of candidates and picked up more than 300 state legislature seats as well.\n\nSanders, I-Vt., chalked up the loss of Senate seats to a difficult playing field this year and the fact that those Democratic candidates who lost ran were too centrist.\n\n\"Candidates who tried to become lite-Republicans did not do all that well,\" he told ABC News over the phone, but conceded that Andrew Gillium's defeat in Florida was a \"shot disappointment.\"\n\nAs for the looming question about another possible presidential run, Sanders said his team is still contemplating the possibility.\n\n\"We are going to take our time and think hard about who the best candidate is to beat Donald Trump and whether I am that candidate,\" he said. \"We are going to be thinking about it, but a decision has not been made.\"\n\nCharles Krupa/AP\n\nSanders said he would continue to consult with \"knowledgeable progressives around the country about who will be the strongest candidates ... who will have the best chance to win the primary and then to win the general election.\"\n\nHe posited that in his view almost any Democrat would be able to win most of the states Hillary Clinton won two years ago, but the real question for him, and the party, would be which candidate can do well in battleground states Trump won in 2016.\n\n\"That is an issue we have to study very, very carefully,\" he said.\n\nHe, of course, outperformed Clinton in traditionally redder states in the Midwest and heartland in the 2016 presidential primary.\n\nThe TIP with John Verhovek\n\nAs is often the case with most major events in the Trump era, the 2018 midterms left the country with almost as many questions as it did answers, and the biggest cliffhangers promise to provide plenty of electoral entertainment for those who weren't satisfied with Tuesday night's somewhat predictable outcome in the House and Senate.\n\nIn Florida, Sen. Bill Nelson still trailed Gov. Rick Scott by a margin of just 0.4 percent, and with a Saturday deadline to request a recount looming, Democrats are close to losing their fourth seat out of the 10 that Trump won in 2016 -- Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota being the others.\n\nJeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nIn Georgia, Stacey Abrams' campaign is pledging to fight on until every vote is counted in her epic battle against Republican Brian Kemp to become the nation's first female African-American governor.\n\nAnd even more uncertainty clouds the results in some key U.S. House races, many in the state of California. One to watch is in the 48th Congressional District, where GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher trails Democrat Harley Rouda, with votes still to be counted.\n\nControl of the House and Senate may be decided, but these races will rightly be watched intensely in the days -- and possibly weeks -- to come.\n\nTHE PLAYLIST\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" Podcast.

The orders allow authorities to seize assets from people suspected of corruption or links to organized crime until the owners account for how they were acquired.\n\nAt a court hearing this year, a lawyer for the National Crime Agency gave details of Hajiyeva's spending at Harrods, including 100,000 pounds in one day on Cartier jewelry, 150,000 pounds in another trip on goods from luxury brand Boucheron, and 1,800 pounds on wine.\n\nLast week the agency, which investigates cross-border and organized crime, seized 49 items of jewelry worth 400,000 pounds from Christie's auction house, where Hajiyeva's daughter had taken them to be valued.\n\nThe items included a Boucheron sapphire and ruby necklace worth up to 120,000 pounds and a Van Cleef & Arpels pearl necklace worth 20,000 pounds, which investigators say was originally bought by Hajiyeva's husband in St. Moritz, Switzerland, for more than 10 times that amount.\n\nHajiyeva denies wrongdoing and is fighting to overturn the order and hang on to her assets.\n\nHer lawyers have said the wealth order \"is part of an investigative process, not a criminal procedure, and it does not involve the finding of any criminal offense.\"\n\nBritish police arrested Hajiyeva for alleged embezzlement last week at the request of Azerbaijan.\n\nBen Keith, a lawyer for Azerbaijan's government, said during a British High Court hearing Thursday that Hajiyeva faced allegations of \"embezzling money from the International Bank of Azerbaijan.\"\n\nHe said there were \"substantial grounds to believe she would not surrender\" to the court if she was granted bail.\n\nBut judge Jeremy Baker ruled there were no \"substantial grounds\" to refuse bail.", "Minister Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, warned President Donald Trump not to pull \"the trigger of war in the Middle East . at the insistence of Israel,\" speaking Thursday while on a visit to Iran.\n\nThe 85-year-old Farrakhan, long known for provocative comments widely considered anti-Semitic, criticized the economic sanctions leveled by Trump against Iran after America's pullout from the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.\n\nFarrakhan told journalists in Tehran that he is \"begging our president and the government that supports him to be very, very careful.\"\n\n\"The war will trigger another kind of war which will bring China, Russia, all of the nations into a war,\" he said. \"The war will end America as you know it.\"\n\nFarrakhan leads the Nation of Islam, a black separatist religious movement. The Nation has been largely closed off to outsiders, making it impossible even for those who follow the movement closely to gauge its strength.\n\nFor Farrakhan, the height of his prominence came when he organized the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, a symbol of black pride and empowerment.\n\nEarlier on his trip to Iran, state television published a short video clip of Farrakhan trying to say \"Death to Israel\" in Farsi, a common chant at rallies in the decades after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He began to repeat it, but the crowd at Tehran University sitting at Farrakhan's event then substituted \"America\" for \"Israel,\" drawing laughter.\n\nAfter the video clip spread online, Farrakhan issued a statement saying: \"I never led a chant calling for death to America.\"\n\n\"I asked a question about how to pronounce the chant in Farsi during my meeting with Iranian students and an examination of the video shows just that,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Farrakhan reacted angrily to an Iranian state television's request to repeat the chant. However, he kept his harshest words for Trump.\n\n\"It is your policies that are eroding trust for you in the world, favor for you in the world, and now you are pulling apart, confused,\" Farrakhan said, addressing Trump. \"If you do this, you will bring about \u2014 not the Iranian chant \u2014 you will bring about the death of the greatest nation that has been on this Earth in the last 6,000 years.\"", "Walter Frankenstein was 14 years old when a police officer came to the Jewish orphanage he was living at in Berlin, urging all children to leave the building immediately because \"something bad will happen tonight.\"\n\nIt was early evening, November 9, 1938. Later that night, he climbed up on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.\n\n\"Then we knew: the synagogues were burning,\" he said. \"The next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\"\n\nFrankenstein, now 94, was describing Kristallnacht \u2014 the \"Night of Broken Glass\" \u2014 when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach'sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\"A few hours after the plain clothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, 'you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,'\" Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\"So instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\" Frankenstein said. \"They did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\" Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\"The men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\" he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \"Final Solution\" for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel's Yad Vashem's Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\"Until then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\" he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \"Before Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\"\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\"We had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\" he said, still feisty after all these years. \"So we went into hiding.\"\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis' Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved from Israel to Sweden where they settled for good.\n\nNowadays, Walter Frankenstein returns to Germany several times a year. He often talks to schoolchildren about his life and on Friday, the anniversary of November 9, 1938, he will be honored in an award-giving ceremony by Germany's Culture Minister Monika Gruetters.\n\nIn 2014, he received Germany's highest civil honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.\n\nEvery time Frankenstein travels to Berlin, he brings along the small blue case containing the cross. Inside the case's lid, he has attached the first \"mark\" he got from the Germans: The Yellow Badge, or Jewish Star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.\n\n\"The first one marked me, the second one honored me,\" he said as he slowly closed the lid.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDavid Rising contributed reporting from Berlin, Aron Heller from Jerusalem and Randy Herschaft from New York.\n\nFollow Kirsten Grieshaber at twitter.com/kugrieshaber", "A Polish court on Thursday overturned a Warsaw city ban on a march organized by far-right nationalist groups, justifying the decision on constitutional grounds of the freedom of assembly.\n\nThe decision by Judge Michal Jakubowski is the latest development surrounding contentious, confusing preparations for an Independence Day march on Sunday in the Polish capital to honor the country's 100 years of independence.\n\nFor the past decade, far-right nationalists have been organizing marches on the Nov. 11 Independence Day in Warsaw, and this year fears of open demonstrations of extremism and possible clashes with counter-protesters threatened to overshadow all other events on the nation's centenary calendar.\n\nLast year marchers carried xenophobic banners proclaiming the desire for a \"White Europe\" that drew international criticism, especially coming only a few months after a violent rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nPolish government officials had tried for months to persuade the nationalists to make the Warsaw march this year an inclusive affair involving state officials without any provocative banners but the two sides were unable to agree.\n\nOn Wednesday, Warsaw's city mayor stepped in and banned the march, citing security reasons. The president and prime minister then quickly announced that an inclusive state march would take place instead Sunday along the same route, led by President Andrzej Duda and including the prime minister, other top leaders and World War II veterans.\n\nAfter the court ruling, it wasn't immediately clear if both marches will go ahead separately, or as one.\n\nThe uncertainties about security had been heightened by a mass walk-out by police officers in recent days over pay, prompting the government to ask the Defense Ministry to help with security on Sunday. But late Thursday a police union announced it was ending the protest after agreeing upon a deal with the Interior Ministry.\n\nThe Warsaw court ruling follows a similar ruling in Wroclaw on a city ban on a nationalist march there for Sunday.\n\nCity authorities still have the right to appeal the rulings.\n\nWarsaw city spokesman Bartosz Milczarczyk said \"we respect the court's verdict.\" He said town hall officials were studying it before deciding whether to appeal.\n\nEarlier in the day, before the ruling, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said authorities would do everything in their power to crack down on any expressions of extremism at the march.\n\n\"We want the march to be peaceful and not provoke tensions,\" Morawiecki told reporters.\n\nHis comments come amid other signs that Poland's conservative ruling Law and Justice party is now seeking to take a firmer stance against ultra-nationalists after a period in which they seemed to be trying to appease them.\n\nExtremists from Hungary and elsewhere have in past years joined Poland's Nov. 11 march, which is meant to mark Poland's regaining of its independence at the end of World War I.\n\nSaying he expected up to 200,000 participants Sunday at the inclusive Warsaw march, Morawiecki acknowledged it could be hard to control them all, but said \"we will try to eliminate all banners which are extremist.\"\n\nHe also said there will be no tolerance for foreign neo-fascists or other agitators.\n\nMany other World War I centennial events are expected across the country on Sunday, with the most emotional expected to be the public singing of the national hymn at noon in hundreds of places.", "Interested in Iran?

Trump repeatedly has asked oil producers to pump more crude to lower prices.\n\nThe latest batch of U.S. sanctions severely impacts Iran's oil industry, the major source of the country's foreign revenue. Tehran worries OPEC and non-OPEC countries such as Russia will increase their production to fill the gap in response.\n\nOn Tuesday, Zanganeh, the oil minister, wrote a letter to the OPEC chief, asking that the so-called Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee \u2014 which consists of all OPEC and non-OPEC countries \u2014some members of the committee \"openly\" take side with the United States on the matter of sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe committee is due to hold a meeting next week in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, an ally of Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia.", "Augustin Trebuchon is buried beneath a white lie.\n\nHis tiny plot is almost on the front line where the guns finally fell silent at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, after a four-year war that had already killed millions.\n\nA simple white cross says: \"Died for France on Nov. 10, 1918.\"\n\nNot so.\n\nLike hundreds of others along the Western Front, Trebuchon was killed in combat on the morning of Nov. 11 \u2014 after the pre-dawn agreement between the Allies and Germany but before the armistice took effect six hours later.\n\nHis death at almost literally the eleventh hour only highlighted the folly of a war that had become ever more incomprehensible to many in nations drawn into the first global conflict.\n\nFor the French, who lost up to 1.4 million troops, it was perhaps too poignant \u2014 or too shameful \u2014 to denote that Trebuchon had been killed on the very last morning, just as victory finally prevailed.\n\n\"It was a lie, without a question,\" said historian Nicolas Chubak, even if he acknowledged it was meant \"to somewhat ease the mourning of families.\"\n\nThere were many reasons why men kept falling until the call of the bugler at 11 a.m.: fear that the enemy would not abide by the armistice, a sheer hatred after four years of unprecedented slaughter, the ambition of commanders craving a last victory, bad communications, the inane joy of killing.\n\nThe reasons trumped the lives of soldiers, many of whom were convinced they were on the brink of survival.\n\nHistorian Joseph Persico estimated the total dead, wounded and missing on all sides on the final day was 10,900.\n\nU.S. Gen.

He was given the rank of sergeant, but he later was demoted when he wrote a letter home critical of the conditions in the war.\n\nSoon after, he was thrown into the biggest U.S. battle of the war, the Meuse-Argonne offensive in northeastern France.\n\nThere were reports he was still brooding over his demotion right on Nov. 11. When he emerged from a thick fog in the valley around Chaumont-devant-Damvillers, he and his comrades faced a German machine gun nest on the hillside.\n\nIndications are that the Germans fired one salvo over his head as a warning, knowing the war was almost over. But he still charged onward.\n\n\"His time of death was 10:59 a.m., which is just so haunting,\" Bennett said. Gunther was recognized by Pershing as the last American to die on the battlefield.\n\nQuestions remain whether it was a suicide run, an attempt at redemption or an act of true devotion.\n\n\"It is just as puzzling now as it was 100 years ago,\" Bennett said, adding that one thing is clear: \"Gunther's act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war.\"\n\nBut there was one more cruel twist for his family: They were unaware he had been killed.\n\nUpon his expected return \"they went to the train station to meet Henry \u2014 not there!\" said Bruce Malone, superintendent of Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery, the final resting place for 100 Americans who died Nov. 11.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"A NEED TO KILL ONE LAST TIME\"\n\nThere was no mystery surrounding the death of Price, the Canadian. It was an utterly senseless loss of life.\n\nHe was a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history plucked him off the land in October 1917 as the Allies sought ever more manpower for the Western Front.\n\nThe summer after he was drafted, he was part of the surge of victories that seized villages and cities right up to Nov. 11. By that time, Canadians were retaking Mons in southern Belgium, where soldiers from the British Commonwealth had their very first battle with the Germans in August 1914.\n\nIt was especially sweet for the Commonwealth commanders to retake the city, bringing the war full circle where they lost their first soldier, English Pvt. John Parr, on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nPrice decided to check out homes along the canals while civilians in the center of Mons had already broken out the wine and whiskey they had hidden for years from the Germans to celebrate with the Canadians.\n\nSuddenly, a shot rang out and Price collapsed.\n\n\"It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\" said Belgian historian Corentin Rousman.\n\nThe final minutes counted not just for the casualties but also for the killers.\n\n\"There are rules in war,\" Rousman said. \"There is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That's the difference.\"\n\nAt the St. Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth soldier killed in the war, lies a stone's throw from Parr, the first.\n\n\"He is not forgotten,\" Rousman said of Price. \"It's a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"PART OF THIS GREAT PATRIOTIC MOMENTUM\"\n\nTrebuchon's grave stands out because of the date, underscoring the random fortunes of war.\n\nHe was a shepherd from France's Massif Central and could have avoided the war as a family breadwinner at age 36.\n\n\"But he was part of this great patriotic momentum,\" said Jean-Christophe Chanot, the mayor of Vrigne-Meuse, where he died.\n\nTrebuchon knew misery as part of France's most brutal battles \u2014 Marne, Somme, Verdun. He survived right up to his last order \u2014 to tell soldiers where to gather after the armistice.\n\nInstead, his body was found with a bullet wound to the head. He was recognized as \"the last French soldier killed during the last French attack against the Germans,\" Chanot said.\n\nThe date on his grave \u2014 Nov. 10, 1918 \u2014 remains controversial, even if it was meant to soothe a family's sorrow.\n\n\"It was a lie, without a question,\" said Czubak, the French historian.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPhotojournalist Virginia Mayo and video journalist Mark Carlson contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

Italy's public debt burden stands at around 130 percent of the annual GDP, second in the eurozone behind Greece, which only emerged from its eight-year bailout era in the summer.\n\nThe Commission said it expects the Italian economy, the eurozone's third-largest, to grow by only 1.2 percent in 2019, below the 1.5 percent projected by the government. And in 2020, the Commission forecasts Italian growth of only 1.3 percent, again 0.3 percentage point-lower than the projection from Rome.\n\nAs a result, the Commission expects higher budget deficits for Italy, notably for next year. Rather than the 2.4 percent of GDP predicted by Italy, the Commission expects 2.9 percent, a level that would not bring down Italy's overall debt stock.\n\n\"There are no grounds for questioning the foundation and sustainability of our forecasts,\" said Conte, adding that Italy expects the debt load to decrease to 126.7 percent of GDP by 2021.\n\nThe Commission doesn't appear to be in a mood to haggle.\n\n\"There cannot be a sort of negotiation on this,\" said Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner responsible for economic matters.\n\nCountries that use the euro have to seek approval from the Commission for their budgets as part of a coordination exercise designed to prevent a repeat of the debt crisis that afflicted the region over the past decade. The Commission could sanctions Italy if it does not revise its plans by Tuesday.\n\nThe Italian government argues that the economy needs a stimulus so it can turn around after stagnating for years. Boosting growth, it argues, will help control debt levels and eventually solidify the country's place within the single currency bloc.\n\nAs part of those ambitions, the Italian government is raising spending to fund, among other things, a minimum income scheme for jobseekers and restore early retirement for eligible workers, doing away with an unpopular reform.\n\nLorenzo Codogno, a former Italian Treasury official who runs LC Macro Advisors, said the Commission's deficit forecasts were perhaps a bit \"pessimistic\" given the likely delays in the implementation of policy measures.\n\nThe Commission, he added, looked like it was setting the stage to sanction Italy and that any \"possible tweaks the government may be considering to introduce by the Nov. 13 deadline will do little to narrow this huge gap.\"\n\nBond market investors are already fretting, having marked up interest rates on Italian debt significantly over the past few months.\n\nItaly's economy comes amid a broader slowdown in the eurozone as a whole, which the Commission expects to slow amid global uncertainties, trade tensions, and higher oil prices.\n\nOverall eurozone growth is forecast to moderate to 2.1 percent this year from a decade-high rate of 2.4 percent in 2017. It expects a further easing to 1.9 percent in 2019 and 1.7 percent in 2020.\n\nAnd Brexit could yet hurt growth even further, especially if Britain crashes out of the EU in March with no deal on future relations.

A preliminary investigation of alleged criminal terrorist association opened on Tuesday, the day of their arrest.\n\nThe official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the allegations, said the alleged plot appeared to be incomplete, but violent.

He also used a smoke bomb, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe dead included a man who had survived last year's massacre in Las Vegas, a veteran sheriff's deputy who rushed in to confront the gunman, a 22-year-old man who planned to join the Army, a freshman at nearby Pepperdine University and a recent Cal Lutheran graduate.\n\n\"It's a horrific scene in there,\" Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said in the parking lot. \"There's blood everywhere.\"\n\nSurvivors of the rampage \u2014 mostly young people who had gone out for college night at the Borderline, a hangout popular with students from nearby California Lutheran University and other schools \u2014 seemed to know what to do, having come of age in an era of active-shooter drills and deadly rampages happening with terrifying frequency.\n\nFor some it was not a new experience. Survivors and their relatives said several people who were at the bar Thursday had been at the outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas last year where a gunman in a high-rise hotel killed 58 people.\n\n\"I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts,\" said Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, whose son Telemachus Orfanos survived the Vegas shooting only to die less than 10 minutes from his home. \"I want those bastards in Congress \u2014 they need to pass gun control so no one else has a child that doesn't come home.\"\n\nMany of the estimated 150 patrons at the Borderline dived under tables, ran for exits, broke through windows or hid in the attic and bathrooms, authorities and witnesses said.\n\n\"Unfortunately our young people, people at nightclubs, have learned that this may happen, and they think about that,\" the sheriff said. \"Fortunately it helped save a lot of lives that they fled the scene so rapidly.\"\n\nMatt Wennerstrom said he instinctively pulled people behind a pool table, and he and friends shielded women with their bodies after hearing the shots. When the gunman paused to reload, Wennerstrom said, he and others shattered windows with barstools and helped about 30 people escape. He heard another volley of shots once he was safely outside.\n\n\"All I wanted to do was get as many people out of there as possible,\" he told KABC-TV. \"I know where I'm going if I die, so I was not worried.\"\n\nA video posted on Instagram after the shooting by one of the patrons shows an empty dance floor with the sound of windows shattering in the background. As a silhouetted figure comes through a doorway, the camera turns erratically and 10 gunshots ring out.\n\n\"I looked him in his eyes while he killed my friends,\" Dallas Knapp wrote on his post. \"I hope he rots in hell for eternity.\"\n\nThe tragedy left a community that is annually listed as one of the safest cities in America reeling. Shootings of any kind are extremely rare in Thousand Oaks, a city of about 130,000 people about 40 miles (64 kilometers) from Los Angeles, just across the county line.\n\nMourners gathered for a vigil on Wednesday evening as smoke from a fast-moving, nearby wildfire billowed over them.\n\nEarlier, people stood in line for hours to give blood. All morning, people looking for missing friends and relatives arrived at a community center where authorities and counselors were informing the next-of-kin of those who died. Many people walked past TV cameras with blank stares or tears in their eyes. In the parking lot, some comforted each other with hugs or a pat on the back.\n\nJason Coffman received the news that his son Cody, 22, who was about to join the Army, was dead. Coffman broke down as he told reporters how his last words to his son as he went out that night were not to drink and drive and that he loved him.\n\n\"Oh, Cody, I love you, son,\" Coffman sobbed.\n\nIt was the nation's deadliest such attack since 17 students and teachers were killed at a Parkland, Florida, high school nine months ago. It also came less than two weeks after a gunman massacred 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, in his first public appearance since winning office on Tuesday, lamented the violence that has returned to California.\n\n\"It's a gun culture,\" he said. \"You can't go to a bar or nightclub? You can't go to church or synagogue? It's insane is the only way to describe it. The normalization, that's the only way I can describe it. It's become normalized.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump praised police for their \"great bravery\" in the attack and ordered flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims.\n\nAuthorities searched Long's home in Newbury Park, about 5 miles from the Borderline bar, for clues to what set him off.\n\n\"There's no indication that he targeted the employees. We haven't found any correlation,\" the sheriff said. \"Maybe there was a motive for this particular night, but we have no information leading to that at all.\"\n\nLong was in the Marines from 2008 to 2013, rose to the rank of corporal and served in Afghanistan in 2010-11 before he was honorably discharged, the military said. Court records show he married in 2009 and was divorced in 2013.\n\nAuthorities said he had no criminal record, but in April officers were called to his home, where deputies found him angry and acting irrationally. The sheriff said officers were told he might have PTSD because of his military service. A mental health specialist met with him and didn't feel he needed to be hospitalized.\n\nTom Hanson, 70, who lives next door to Long and his mother, said he called the police about six months ago when he heard \"heavy-duty banging\" and shouting coming from the Longs' home.\n\n\"Somebody has missed something here,\" his wife, Julie Hanson, said. \"This woman has to know that this child needed help.\"\n\nLong was armed with a Glock 21, a .45-caliber pistol designed to hold 10 rounds plus one in the chamber, according to the sheriff. But it had an extended magazine \u2014 one capable of holding more ammunition \u2014 that is illegal in California, Dean said.\n\nSheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus and a passing highway patrolman arrived at the club around 11:20 p.m. in response to several 911 calls, heard gunfire and went inside, the sheriff said. Helus was shot immediately, Dean said.\n\nThe highway patrolman pulled Helus out, then waited as a SWAT team and other officers arrived. Helus died at a hospital.\n\nBy the time officers entered the bar again \u2014 about 15 to 20 minutes later, according to the sheriff's office \u2014 the gunfire had stopped. They found 12 people dead inside, including the gunman, who was discovered in an office, the sheriff said.\n\n\"There's no doubt that they saved lives by going in there and engaging with the suspect,\" said Dean, who was set to retire Friday. He praised the slain officer \u2014 a close friend \u2014 as a hero: \"He went in there to save people and paid the ultimate price.\"\n\nOne other person was wounded by gunfire, and as many as 15 others suffered minor injuries from jumping out windows or diving under tables, authorities said.\n\nFive off-duty police officers who were at the bar also helped people escape, authorities said.\n\nFor several hours after the violence, survivors gathered in the dark, some sobbing and hugging as they awaited word on the fate of friends as ambulances idled nearby. Several men were bare-chested after using their shirts to plug wounds and tie tourniquets.\n\nAround midday, the body of the slain sheriff's officer was taken by motorcade from the hospital to the coroner's office. Thousands of people stood along the route or pulled over in their vehicles to watch the hearse pass.\n\nHelus was a 29-year veteran of the force with a wife and son and planned to retire in the coming year, said the sheriff, choking back tears.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP journalists Andrew Dalton, Amanda Lee Myers, John Antczak and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Michelle A.

He's helped a couple of the employees in there get hired as deputies.\"\n\nAlso among the dead is 22-year-old Cody Coffman, his father, Jason Coffman, overcome with emotion, told reporters.\n\n\"I talked to him last night before he headed out the door,\" Jason Coffman said. \"First thing I said was, 'Please don't drink and drive.' Last thing I said was, 'Son, I love you.'\"\n\n\"I am speechless and heartbroken,\" he said. \"I cannot believe that it's happened to my family.\"\n\n\"I just want him to know that he is going to be missed,\" Jason Coffman said of his oldest child in between tears.\n\nCourtesy Jason Coffman\n\nAnother victim was Pepperdine University student Alaina Housley, niece of Adam Housley and \"Sister, Sister\" actress Tamera Mowry-Housley.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" Adam Housley and Tamera Mowry-Housley said in a statement. \"Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner.\"\n\n\"We offer our deepest condolences to the Housley family and ask that our community join us in keeping Alaina\u2019s family, friends, and loved ones in their prayers during this incredibly difficult time,\" Pepperdine University added in a statement.\n\nMarine Corps veteran Dan Manrique, died in the shooting, Jacklyn Pieper, athletic director for the Ventura County Chapter of Team Red White & Blue, told ABC News. Manrique was the chapter captain for the organization.\n\nCourtesy Jacklyn Pieper\n\nTelemachus Orfanos also died in the shooting, his mother told San Francisco ABC station KGO. Orfanos was in attendance at the country music festival in Las Vegas where 59 people were killed last October.\n\n\"My son was in Las Vegas with a lot of his friends and he came home,\" Susan Orfanos said. \"He didn't come home last night, and I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts. I want gun control, and I hope to God nobody sends me anymore prayers. I want gun control. No more guns.\"\n\nJustin Meek, 23, also died, according to Thousand Oaks' California Lutheran University, from which he had recently graduated.\n\n\"Meek heroically saved lives\" during the massacre, the university said.\n\n\"Cal Lutheran wraps its arms around the Meek family and other families, and around every member of this community,\" the university said.\n\nMark J. Terrill/AP\n\nNoel Sparks and Blake Dingman, both 21, were also victims of the shooting, ABC News confirmed.\n\nThe bar was packed when police responded to the country western bar in Thousand Oaks, about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, late Wednesday night.\n\nAmong those inside were six off-duty police officers, who reportedly \"stood in front of my daughter\" to protect her after the gunfire rang out, one parent told the sheriff.\n\nTeylor Whittler was celebrating a friend's birthday at the bar's college night when she heard gunshots.\n\n\"A bunch of people dog-piled on top of each other,\" she told \"Good Morning America.\" \"Everyone just yelled, 'Run, he's coming!'\"\n\nMark J. Terrill/AP\n\n\"There were at least 50 people that all tried getting up at once and running out the back door. I ended up getting caught in the ground and stumbled over by multiple people,\" Whittler said. \"I got hit in the head by a stool that was being picked up to throw through a window, until some guy came up behind me and grabbed me and said, 'Get up, we have to go!'\"\n\nShe said multiple men around her blocked the group with their bodies, \"ready to take a bullet for every single one of us.\"\n\nWhittler's friend, Sarah Rose DeSon, told \"GMA\" she was hiding behind a table when she saw a spark and smoke.\n\n\"As soon as we all saw that, we jumped up,\" she said. \"I ran out the front door, down some stairs, face-planted in the parking lot but I was lucky enough to get out alive.\"\n\nThirteen people with gunshot wounds or lacerations were treated and released from local hospitals.\n\nRMG News via AP\n\nAs the sun rose Thursday, women as young as 18 years old emerged from the area surrounding the bar. Many were dressed in cowboy boots and flannels and draped in pink blankets given to them by authorities.\n\nThey clung to each other, desperate to find missing friends.\n\nMark J. Terrill/AP\n\nTerrified parents also descended on the area. One mother was so frantic that she jumped out of the passenger side of a still-moving car to race toward the crime scene.\n\nAs parents waited outside, they \"pinged\" their children's phones, some of which were left buzzing inside the bar.\n\n\"We're just praying for our friends that we haven't heard from,\" DeSon told \"GMA.\" \"You never think it's going to be you until it happens.

The rising cost of raw materials also eroded earnings, he said.\n\nTariffs on steel, aluminum and other raw materials announced by President Donald Trump have had some negative effect, but they were only a small part of the overall rising cost of raw materials, which dented profitability, Karube said.\n\nThe effect of some unfavorable currency exchange rates in emerging markets also hurt earnings, according to Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama. Cost-cutting efforts were going well, but research spending was on the rise, it said.\n\nKarube was asked repeatedly about his views on the U.S. midterm elections and what that meant for trade and other policies affecting Nissan, but he acknowledged he had no idea.\n\n\"It just happened yesterday, and it is today,\" he said. \"It is still unclear how the situation may change.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "Tesla's board has named one of its own as chairman to replace Elon Musk, complying with terms of a fraud settlement with U.S. securities regulators.\n\nThe electric car and solar panel company's board on Thursday named Australian telecommunications executive Robyn Denholm as chairman, effective immediately.\n\nDenholm will step down as chief financial officer and strategy head at Telstra, Australia's largest telecommunications company, after a six-month notice period. She'll work full-time at Tesla, where she has served on the board since 2014.\n\nMusk will remain as Tesla's chief executive as part of the settlement deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The U.S. agency filed a lawsuit alleging that Musk duped investors in August with misleading statements on about securing the funding to take Tesla private.\n\nThe move vaults Denholm, 55, from relative obscurity into a high-profile position of trying to rein in Musk and manage a company that is struggling to produce vehicles and make money as it attempts to shift the world from fueling transportation with oil to battery-powered electric vehicles.\n\n\"I believe in this company. I believe in its mission and I look forward to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value,\" Denholm said in a statement.\n\nCritics of Tesla's board have said members lack independence and are too closely allied with Musk, many through financial deals. Musk's brother, Kimbal, is one of the members.\n\nAlthough Denholm appears to have fewer ties to Musk than other directors, she still was on the board through numerous cases of bizarre behavior by Musk, including his surprise tweet to take Tesla private, smoking what looked like marijuana during a YouTube interview, and labeling a British diver a pedophile in a dispute over the rescue of Thai youth soccer players who were trapped in a cave.\n\nA corporate governance expert questioned whether Denholm is the right person for the job, given that she was a member of Tesla's board for four years yet failed to rein in the visionary yet erratic Musk.\n\n\"She was there while all of this was going on,\" said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. \"Do you ask the person who helped get you lost in the woods to help drive you out of the woods?\"\n\nElson said the company should have brought in someone from outside to be chairman, and that no matter how talented Denholm may be, she has a shadow over her of being on the board that did little as Musk misbehaved. \"You really have got to wonder,\" he said. \"No other CEO of any other public company would have survived this.\"\n\nMaking Denholm a full-time chair also creates governance problems because she could become a Tesla executive, blurring her role as an independent check on management, Elson said.\n\nEmail messages sent to Denholm Thursday were not immediately returned.\n\nThere was little reaction to the appointment from the markets Thursday. Tesla shares rose slightly to $349.34 in premarket trading.\n\nUnder the settlement, Tesla also is required to appoint two new independent directors, and it must review the sometimes-erratic Musk's posts about the company on Twitter. Musk and Tesla each had to pay a $20 million penalty under the September deal with the SEC, and he cannot return as chairman for three years.\n\nDenholm has auto sector and Silicon Valley experience. She was chief financial and operations officer at Juniper Networks for nine years, and worked at Sun Microsystems. She also has held financial management posts at Toyota Motor Corp. in Australia. Telstra is the largest telecommunications company in Australia.\n\nOn Twitter Thursday morning Musk wrote that he has great respect for Denholm. \"Very much look forward to working together,\" he wrote. \"She has made significant contributions as a Tesla board member over the past four years in helping us become a profitable company,\" Musk said in a company statement.\n\nTesla earned a $311.5 million net profit during the third-quarter, delivering the first step of a promise from Musk to post sustainable profits. It was only the third time that Tesla has posted a quarterly profit in its eight-year history as a public company and the first time in two years. Telsa has never reported an annual profit.\n\nA big jump in Tesla's output of its mass-market Model 3 car powered the breakthrough. The manufacturing increase and moneymaking quarter are two things that Musk promised would happen.\n\nApart from appointing a new chairman under the settlement, Tesla was required to appoint two new independent members to its board. The aim is to provide stronger oversight to match Tesla's growing stature and market value.\n\nMusk, whose name is virtually inseparable from Tesla, has an impulsive streak that caused trouble when he tweeted in August that he had \"funding secured\" for taking Tesla private at $420 per share when no such deal had been worked out.\n\nThat drew attention from the SEC because the tweet pushed up Tesla's stock price and harmed short-sellers who bet that the share price would fall.\n\nAs part of Musk's settlement with the SEC, Tesla also is supposed to monitor Twitter posts that he makes if they are related to developments at the company. But even after the settlement was announced, Musk taunted the agency, calling it the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission\" before snidely praising it for \"doing incredible work.\"", "If a tree falls in the Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary, it doesn't matter if there's no one around. You can hear it anyway.\n\nThat's because researchers have hidden dozens of wireless sensor nodes, microphones and cameras among the cattails and cedars of this Plymouth, Massachusetts nature preserve. Sounds picked up from the marsh and nearby woodland feed into an artificial intelligence system that can identify frogs or crickets, ducks or a passing airplane.\n\nOne goal is to help scientists better understand changing climates and improve wildlife restoration techniques. Beyond that, though, researchers want to use the collected data to help power an online virtual reality world \u2014 a kind of alternate universe modeled on live conditions in the marsh, but populated with fanciful creatures invented in a computer science lab.\n\nCould this be the future of the nature walk?\n\nAs wireless sensors get cheaper, longer-lasting and more sophisticated, they're increasingly turning up everywhere. We're already seeing them in \"smart\" homes and cities, pulling in data that can be analyzed in real time to smooth traffic flows, save energy, monitor pollution or respond to crime. But what happens when you apply such an internet-connected network to nature?\n\nA research team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been trying it out at Tidmarsh, a former cranberry bog converting back to natural wetlands just a few miles from where the Pilgrims landed in 1620.\n\nRemotely spying on nature isn't new, but the project goes far beyond simple webcams fixed on a hawk's nest or sea lions' favorite pier \u2014 or even the more sophisticated acoustic sensors designed to detect animal poachers.\n\nThe team's goals for what they call the Living Observatory include supporting wildlife restoration efforts. The sensors measure temperature, moisture and other environmental conditions.\n\nBut a broader mission is to offer people \u2014 including children \u2014 a deeper understanding of nature using their laptops, phones or headsets. They can do so remotely or in person while walking a nature trail, said the project's visionary, Glorianna Davenport, a retired professor and co-founder of the MIT Media Lab.\n\n\"It's gorgeous to walk in the woods and not be fiddling with a cell phone,\" Davenport said. On the other hand, she added, what if you can learn more about the microbial environment, or the return of an endangered species, from a well-crafted smartphone app or a virtual reality game?\n\nIf it works here, Davenport said, researchers are already envisioning more ambitious projects deep in the Amazon rainforest \u2014 or on the moon.\n\nThe idea has skeptics who are worried about the intrusion of technology and constant surveillance into the world's last places without it . The Massachusetts Audubon Society manages the 480-acre sanctuary and took some time before it agreed to outfit it with live-streaming cameras and microphones. It was assured that human voices would be scrambled.\n\nEducators have also asked Davenport why she would want to encourage kids to carry around their smartphones instead of just appreciating nature without them.\n\n\"And I went, 'Why not?' That's how they learn. That is their mechanism of interacting,\" she said.\n\nThe sanctuary is beginning to flourish as it changes from a heavily-fertilized industrial cranberry farm into a wetland full of insects, birds and native plants. The base camp for MIT scholars is also Davenport's home, which she built in 1999 after first visiting the property in the early 1980s. As landowners, she and her husband partnered with Audubon to transform the land into what it might have looked like before it was carved into manmade bogs in the 19th century.\n\nThe research projects reflect the diverse interests of multimedia scholars. Davenport is a documentary filmmaker. Others are computer scientists or musicians.\n\nOne project creates soundtracks driven by sensor readings \u2014 such as higher pitches that indicate warmer temperatures.\n\nAnother resembles a more ethereal version of the Pokemon Go augmented reality game, but with elk-like phantoms galloping around a virtual world modeled on the marsh. If the sensors pick up a rainstorm at the real-life Tidmarsh, the animated creatures appear to get wet. If there's a loud, sudden sound, they become startled.\n\nYet another experiment involves strapping on a special headset while walking through the sanctuary. On a hot afternoon in late summer, MIT researcher Gershon Dublon and his colleagues tromped around the preserve in chest-high waders to show how the sensors can amplify a human's observation of nature.\n\n\"The forest is a lot more active than you would think, because wildlife is quieter when you're nearby,\" Dublon said.\n\nThe headset endows its users with a kind of supersensory power. Tap one ear and you can zoom your hearing toward a nearby pond where ducks are swimming. Gaze in another direction, tap again and listen in on a secluded spot beneath a canopy of trees.\n\nIt's a chance to hear elusive animals that scurry away long before humans get anywhere near them.\n\nYou can also travel in time, as MIT Media Lab professor Joseph Paradiso did last week \u2014 transporting himself out of the sleepy November landscape by tapping into sounds picked up from the same place six months earlier.\n\n\"We played the spring, and to me, that was a revelation,\" he said. \"Hearing a dead landscape come alive as if you're there.\"", "An oil tanker rammed a Norwegian navy frigate Thursday in a harbor on the country's western coast, tearing a large hole in its side, the military said. The frigate's 137 crew members were evacuated amid fears that it may sink.\n\nEight people on the KNM Helge Instad were injured in the 4 a.m. collision in Sture, north of Bergen, said Rear Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, the head of Norway's navy. Two of them were taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe ship, which had recently taken part in the vast Trident Juncture NATO military drill in Norway, is \"strongly listing,\" Stensoenes told a news conference Thursday afternoon. The frigate was lying in the water almost on its side with its stern under the water.\n\nThe 134-meter (442-foot) long frigate, built in Spain in 2009, is part of a NATO fleet in the Atlantic. The alliance has been informed of the accident, he said.\n\nThe Maltese-flagged oil tanker, Sola TS, was not damaged and its 23-man crew remained on board. The shipping site Sysla reported the tanker had been loaded with crude oil and was on its way to Britain.\n\nStensoenes said the cause of the accident was not clear and the Navy would wait for the findings of Norway's Accident Investigation Board. Earlier reports had said a towboat was also involved in the collision, but Stensoenes denied that report.\n\nHe said the frigate had been pushed by towboats into shallow water where it could not sink fully.\n\n\"We are in a security phase for the time being,\" he said. He declined to comment on what would happen to the weapons on board the ship.\n\nSome 10,000 liters of helicopter fuel from the frigate has leaked into the sea, said Johan Marius Ly of the Norwegian Coast Guard. The fuel was expected to evaporate quickly.\n\nNorway's largest oil and gas company, Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, said its non-emergency activities at the Sture terminal where the collision occurred were shut down as a precaution for many hours but were gradually starting up again late Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board said because the tanker is Maltese-registered, the Marine Safety Investigation Unit (MSIU) of Malta will participate in the investigation.", "The Federal Reserve appears on track to raise interest rates once more this year but will likely hold off on any action when its latest policy meeting ends Thursday.\n\nStill, investors will be parsing the statement the Fed will issue after its meeting for any sign that it might be rethinking its probable pace of credit tightening in the coming months. So far this year, the central bank has raised rates three times.\n\nAt their most recent meeting in late September, Fed officials collectively projected that they would end up raising their key short-term rate four times this year and three times in 2019. The Fed's benchmark rate affects many consumer and business loans, and when it raises it, borrowing can become more expensive for many.\n\nIn recent weeks, financial markets have been gripped by worry and volatility, and some analysts think that in its statement Thursday the Fed may take note of that anxiety as a potential risk to economic growth.\n\nAs it happens, this week's meeting will be the last that will not include a news conference by the Fed chairman. Beginning in 2019, Chairman Jerome Powell has said he will hold a news conference after each of the Fed's eight meetings each year, rather than only at every other meeting.\n\nIn its statement, the Fed is all but sure to announce that it will keep its key rate unchanged in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent, the level it reached in September when the Fed raised it for the third time this year.\n\nBeginning in late 2015, the central bank has gradually raised its key rate from a record low near zero, where it had held it since the 2008 financial crisis to try to stabilize the financial system and stimulate growth. With the economy growing briskly and in its 10th year of expansion \u2014 the second-longest stretch on record \u2014 the Fed is aiming to keep future inflation under control.\n\nSome analysts say they think the fundamental message from the Fed on Thursday will be that with a strong economy and unemployment at a near five-decade low of 3.7 percent, steady if modest rate hikes should remain in place for now. Last week, the government said that employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October and that average pay grew 3.1 percent over the previous 12 months \u2014 the best year-over-year gain in a decade.\n\n\"Look for the statement following the meeting to highlight the recent and welcome pickup in wages and the further drop in the unemployment rate,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n\nThe quickened pace of economic growth \u2014 a 3.5 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, after a 4.2 percent rate the previous quarter \u2014 has raised the risk that inflation could begin accelerating. So far, though, inflation has remained around the Fed's 2 percent target for annual price increases.\n\nIn its most recent forecast, the Fed projected that it would raise rates three additional times in 2019 but private economists are split. Some believe there will be four hikes in 2019 as the Fed responds to continued strong growth while some see only one or two hikes next year as the boost from the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts passed last year begins to fade.\n\nPowell has stressed that the Fed is determined to follow a centrist approach: Keep gradually nudging up rates to control inflation but avoid tightening too aggressively and perhaps triggering a recession.\n\nBut President Donald Trump has sharply disagreed, and since the stock market started tumbling last month, he has attacked the Fed's rate hikes as well as Powell's leadership.\n\nTrump's public criticism has aroused concern that he is intruding on the political independence the Fed needs to assure markets that it will make tough choices when needed to keep inflation under control.\n\nWhile Trump has called the Fed's rate hikes his \"biggest threat,\" Powell, who was Trump's hand-picked choice to lead the Fed, has avoided responding directly to the criticism. He has instead expressed determination to pursue the Fed's mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices without regard to political considerations.", "The wave of sound builds from the bottom of the lower bowl to the very top of MetLife Stadium. Every seat is filled, and the place rocks with energy and anticipation.\n\nIndeed, it couldn't be any louder if the Giants or Jets were playing in a Super Bowl there.\n\nExcept there's no game about to kick off. It's one of 14 NFL and 19 overall stadium stops for Kenny Chesney on his five-month, 42-show \"Trip Around The Sun\" tour earlier this year. And the musical magic about to be created rivals anything the place has ever seen.\n\nFor country music's biggest star \u2014 Chesney is the only country act in Billboard's Top 10 touring artists of the last quarter-century \u2014 and a nominee for a ninth Entertainer of the Year honor at next week's CMA awards show, the marriage of music and sports is a natural.\n\n\"When I was growing up, I had two passions: sports and music,\" Chesney says. \"They were things that made you feel even more alive, and they lifted you up. It was almost hard to separate the way playing made you feel from how being at a great concert was. Music is such a primal force: it's inside us, without thinking.\n\n\"I think playing sports is the same way. How you feel when you're on the field, that immediate rush is the ultimate high. When I started playing for tips and burritos at Quarterback's, it was the same thing \u2014 only less intense, because there were so many variables. But as time went on, as I learned about writing songs, really dialing in on life and performing so I know I'm reaching people at the back of the room, that intensity of how it feels when it's right became the same thing. When the drum kicks, the lights start and you can hear the crowd even before the curtain falls, it's like that first play of the night. ... It's on, and there's nowhere in the world you'd rather be.\"\n\nChesney spends up to three hours on the stage performing a collection of hits pretty much unequaled among contemporaries in any music genre. It's an exhausting trip for virtually everyone: band members, stagehands, crew and, of course, the audience. And it's worth every second.\n\nNFL games generally last about that long and can create the same aura.\n\n\"If we do it right, hopefully we wring every spec of energy out of the fans,\" Chesney explains. \"Sometimes you can feel a slight ebb during the last song. But what's more likely to happen, the energy feeds itself, so by the end, they're hitting a whole other plateau. They may sleep til 2 the next day, but they're bringing it hard, and they're not quitting.\n\n\"Honestly, it's part of how the band and I can also build our energy: No Shoes Nation feeds us. We go out to give them absolutely everything, but I always say, they give us more than we give them.\"\n\nRobert Kraft would agree. The owner of the New England Patriots is a certified member of No Shoes Nation. He has had a special relationship with Chesney since 2005, when the first of 19 concerts at Gillette Stadium took place.\n\n\"Kenny's music is truly one of a kind. It has this unique and special quality to it that takes people to a place where they can forget the day-to-day worries of life and enjoy the moment, whether in the car listening to the radio or in stadium full of people singing along. When you see Kenny live in concert, his personal energy and charisma is like no one else,\" Kraft said. \"He brings you into the melody and the moment, and it takes those feelings to an entirely different level. After 14 years and 19 shows at Gillette Stadium, I continue to be blown away by the way Kenny and his music affects people. It truly is one of my favorite scenes, seeing 60,000 happy, glowing faces taking in the timeless greatness that is Kenny Chesney.\"\n\nChesney is the biggest ticket seller for any musical genre at MetLife Stadium, where Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift have been regulars. The Trip Around The Sun show at MetLife Stadium in August was delayed by a severe thunderstorm before one of the accompanying bands, Old Dominion, took the stage. That also pushed back the set by Thomas Rhett and Chesney, who played and sang beyond midnight.\n\nYet, just as they would for a big game involving the Giants or Jets, the fans remained, their enthusiasm only whetted, not wetted down.\n\n\"There are two things,\" says Chesney, whose most recent chart-topping album, \"Songs For The Saints,\" is a tribute to the Virgin Islands that were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year. Chesney had a home on St. John. \"One, I think sports and music are the two things people are truly passionate about, so there's always going to be similarities in the response. I know plenty of football fans are out there; heck, there's a lot of players, the coaching staff, people affiliated with the teams at the shows.\n\n\"But just as importantly, there's that sense of pride in what No Shoes Nation stands for. For the fans who are just music people, they have the same connection to how the songs we sing hold their lives as sports fans have about their team kind of representing the best of who they are. You know, there's no thrill greater than high school football, and seeing your team rush out on the field, and I think that carries over to the NFL for adults, and just people who remember when.\"\n\nThose folks tend to remember when they witnessed a particularly memorable game. They definitely recall attending \u2014 and being such a large part of \u2014 a Chesney concert.\n\n\"I don't think anything surpasses the excitement of seeing your favorite team play,\" he says, \"but I do think people who come to these stadiums really bring their most passionate selves. When they come to these places \u2014 Levi Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium, Raymond James Stadium \u2014 they come to throw everything they have at their team.\n\n\"And I think they bring that mindset when they walk in the door for our shows, too.\"\n\nChesney has not committed to another stadium tour. In 2019, he is planning a more intimate series of concerts. But perhaps the unforgettable vibes from the previous concerts will lead to another Trip Around the Sun.\n\nRegardless, Chesney and No Shoes Nation have proven the bond between music and sports is unbreakable.\n\n\"I love football, and the discipline that goes into playing it,\" he says. \"I've been lucky to be friends with Sean Payton, the Manning family, Drew Brees, a lot of those guys, not to mention so many people a casual fan might not know. I've been to practice; I've been to games.

Poland's annual consumption of gas is almost 16 billion cubic meters, 25 percent of which is covered from Poland's own deposits.\n\nWozniak said the deal would also provide a safety net to protect neighboring Ukraine, a transit route for Russian gas, from unexpected breaks in Russian gas deliveries. PGNiG is planning two more deals for U.S. gas deliveries, he said.\n\nPoland and Ukraine feel especially concerned about their level of dependence on Russia energy supplies, which Moscow has used as political leverage in the past.\n\nTheir anxieties have increased because of a German-Russian project to build Nord Stream 2, a second pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would deliver gas directly from St. Petersburg to Germany, and to other European countries, while bypassing Poland and the route through Ukraine.\n\nPerry said the U.S. opposes Nord Stream 2 because it thinks the pipeline project would increase the region's dependence on Russian gas.\n\nThe gas will be delivered by ship from terminals in Louisiana and Texas to a liquefied natural gas terminal in Swinoujscie, in the northwest, on Poland's Baltic coast.\n\nIn October, PGNiG signed a separate long-term contract for the purchase of some 40 million tons, or over 50 billion cubic meters, of liquefied natural gas from Louisiana-based Venture Global Calcasieu Pass and Venture Global Plaquemines LNG.\n\nThe deal, the first of its kind in central and eastern Europe, was meant to replace an expiring deal with Russia's Gazprom that Poland said cost too much.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed to this report.", "Growth in Chinese exports to the United States ticked up in October as traders rushed to beat a new tariff hike in a battle over Beijing's technology policy.\n\nShipments to the U.S. market rose 13.3 percent over a year earlier to $42.7 billion, up from September's 13 percent growth, customs data showed Thursday.

Doctors Without Borders, meanwhile, said it was treating two dozen wounded from the latest offensive.\n\nThe push against the Iran-backed rebels also known as Houthis who are holding Hodeida began anew this month, shortly after the United States called for a cease-fire by the end of the month.\n\nApparently in a rush to try to take Hodeida before then, coalition artillery, helicopter gunships and airstrikes have pounded the rebels, with dozens killed on both sides. The rebels admit they are outnumbered but have vowed to fight on.\n\nCease-fires in Yemen's civil war have rarely held, and peace talks have repeatedly broken down in the past.\n\nAmnesty urged the warring sides to protect civilians. It said that the coalition, which relies heavily on air power, has killed scores of civilians in recent airstrikes, and rebels are responding with mortars in residential neighborhoods that cause indiscriminate casualties.\n\n\"The presence of Houthi fighters on the hospital's roof violates international humanitarian law,\" said Amnesty's Samah Hadid, adding that \"this violation does not make the hospital and the patients and medical staff lawful targets\" for the coalition.\n\nHadid said the hospital was full of wounded \"civilians who have nowhere else to go for lifesaving medical care. Anyone attacking a hospital under these conditions risks responsibility for war crimes.\"\n\nThe conflict in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis who toppled the internationally recognized government. The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels since 2015, in an attempt to restore that government to power.\n\nIn recent days, fighting intensified with troops trained by the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member, advanced in eastern Hodeida, pushing toward the city's port and key Red Sea facilities, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.\n\nIn their statement, CARE and 34 other groups urged the international community to \"secure an immediate cessation of hostilities\" and \"suspend the supply of arms at risk of being used in Yemen.\" The United States sells most of the weapons used by the coalition, while the rebels largely use local stocks. The Houthis have also been accused of firing Iran-made missiles into Saudi Arabia and at coalition ships.\n\nDoctors Without Borders reported an influx of wounded civilians in recent days, with 24 wounded, including women and children from Hodeida, with mostly blast and gunshot injuries.\n\nThe aid group, known under its French acronym MSF, said civilians were reported leaving Hodeida over the weekend but that it was difficult to assess how many remained trapped inside.\n\nThe Saudi-backed Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi appointed a new defense minister to fill a role that had been empty for several years, naming Mohammed al-Maqdishi for the post, according to the state SABA news agency late Wednesday.

Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn't safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\n\"This is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,\" Benitez said as the group arrived at the U.N. office.\n\nThe plan was that when the migrant delegation returned to the stadium, roughly a three-hour walk from the U.N. office, the migrants would gather in an assembly to decide when they would leave Mexico City and what route they would take to the U.S. border. But the meeting with U.N. officials was continuing into the evening Thursday, representatives of the U.N. and the caravan confirmed.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.\n\nThe Mexican government has said most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\"California is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\" border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants.\n\nThere have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost.\n\nHowever, the U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known.\n\nMexico City is itself more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nActivists and officials explained the options available to migrants in Mexico, which has offered them refuge, asylum or work visas. The government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nThursday's meeting with U.N. representatives comes two days after U.S. midterm elections in which President Donald Trump had converted the migrants into a campaign issue, portraying them as a major threat.\n\nMarlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, was waiting in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home.\n\n\"It is not fair that the good ones pay for the sinners,\" Mendez said of fears that gang members are coming with the caravan.\n\nChristopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there are perhaps another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization's tent asking about how they can return home.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nIn the stadium, hundreds of Mexico City employees and even more volunteers helped sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics.

That measurement of small particulate matter in the air is 20 times higher than what's considered safe by the World Health Organization and could seriously aggravate heart or lung diseases.\n\nThe government blamed the toxic stew on a combination of burning of stubble in agricultural fields and firecrackers.

They say she was smart and even trotted up when you called her name.\n\nTo his shock, Toro discovered the horse's skin and dismembered bones hidden among trees in the corner pasture of the sprawling campus in the central Venezuelan city of Maracay. Thieves overnight had hopped the fence, slaughtered the horse and made off with her meat \u2014 either to sell or to feed their hungry families.\n\n\"I burst into tears,\" said Toro, who delivered the grim news to other students. \"We came here, and together we all cried.\"\n\nThe slaughter isn't an isolated incident. Across Venezuela, as the once-wealthy oil nation's economy collapses and sky-high inflation leaves residents struggling to afford scarce food, crimes of hunger and desperation are soaring.\n\nRanchers across the country complain their livestock herds are meeting the same fate. There are media reports of small groups of men caught smuggling stolen horse meat \u2014 accompanied by gory pictures of dismembered horses.\n\nProfessors on campus at Central University of Venezuela in Maracay complain that thieves have walked off with air conditioners and electrical wires, forcing them to teach in dark classrooms with sweat running down their backs.\n\nBut in a new low, bandits have turned their attention to slaughtering horses and cattle vital to training the South American nation's next generation of veterinarians.\n\nThe meat from a full-grown horse could fetch roughly $1,400 at market, based on the equivalent prices of Venezuelan beef, making it a lucrative venture in a country where a worker's monthly minimum wage is under $10 at the widely-used black market rate.\n\nMonths before Miss Congeniality's demise, crooks slaughtered two horses donated to the university and that were temporarily quarantined at a nearby pasture, Toro said. Since late 2016, seven cows \u2014 including a prized bull at the center of the school's breeding program \u2014 have fallen prey to overnight bandits sneaking onto campus.\n\n\"A loss like that is pretty expensive,\" said professor Daniel Vargas, who oversees the university's cattle program.\n\nVenezuelans have traditionally been repulsed by the thought of eating horse meat, making recent developments here especially puzzling, say professors, who suspect customers are buying horse meat at their local butcher thinking it is beef.\n\nThe faculty reports each case, but police have yet to arrest any suspects. The school's budget has been frozen for over a decade, leading security guards to walk off the job and leave the campus an open target, university officials said.\n\n\"It could be an inside job, or someone from outside,\" said Isis Vivas, dean of the veterinary school. \"Anything is possible.\"\n\nToro, a lifelong animal lover who plans to graduate next year, believes Miss Congeniality was singled out from the small heard of five horses.

When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, \"That's enough!\" and a female White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement accusing Acosta of \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\" calling it \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe interaction between Acosta and the intern was brief, and Acosta appeared to brush her arm as she reached for the microphone and he tried to hold onto it. \"Pardon me, ma'am,\" he told her.\n\nAcosta tweeted that Sanders' statement that he put his hands on the aide was \"a lie.\"\n\nCNN said in a statement that the White House revoked Acosta's press pass out of \"retaliation for his challenging questions\" Wednesday, and the network accused Sanders of lying about Acosta's actions.\n\n\"(Sanders) provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened.

He said, \"I can do something fantastic, and they make it look not good.\"\n\nHis exchanges with CNN's Acosta and NBC News' Peter Alexander turned bitterly personal, unusual even for a forum where the nature of their jobs often put presidents and the press at odds.\n\n\"I came in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions, and I had people jumping out of their seats screaming questions at me,\" said Trump, who talked for nearly 90 minutes despite the run-ins with reporters.\n\nAcosta asked Trump why the caravan of migrants was emphasized as an issue in the just-concluded midterm races, and he questioned Trump's reference to the caravan as an invasion.\n\n\"You should let me run the country,\" Trump said. \"You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\"\n\nAfter Acosta asked about the investigation of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, Trump tried to turn to Alexander, but Acosta continued to ask questions.\n\n\"CNN should be ashamed of itself having you work for them,\" the president said to Acosta. \"You are a rude, terrible person.

The glacier, which is thought to be about 18,000 years old, once served as the site of Bolivia's only ski resort before it melted a decade ago.\n\nInitially, the station was launched as a cosmic ray observatory in the mid-1940s, when just hauling up heavy scientific instruments on the back of llamas was a feat in itself. But Chacaltaya's altitude and location near the Amazon region \u2014 and its proximity to Bolivia's capital city \u2014 eventually led scientists to obtain information about the pollution released from the burning of forests, coal, oil and gas.\n\nIn 2012, the site became an atmospheric station used to measure greenhouse gases, reactive gases and particles that can spread all the way to the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles away. Its altitude is only rivaled by a station recently built by China on the Quinhai-Tibet plateau near Mt. Everest which sits at 17,060 feet (5,200 meters).\n\nChacaltaya, which means 'Cold Road' in Aymara, is jointly funded and managed by groups from the United States and Europe, and the initiative is led by Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz.\n\nJames Butler, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's global monitoring division, said the samples taken and observations made in \"are not influenced by local emissions or similar influences.\"\n\n\"Upward looking observations from a mountaintop also provide a much better picture of changes in the stratosphere than do observations from lower elevations, because interference in the signal is greatly reduced,\" he said.\n\nFernando Velarde, a physicist who works at the observatory, said the data is shared with the international community.\n\n\"As scientists we take a problem, study its effects and try to give answers to society,\" he said. \"But the final decisions are in the hands of governments and politicians.\"", "If you can do a downward-facing dog, you're among the increasing numbers of Americans doing yoga.\n\nA new report says more adults \u2014 and even kids \u2014 are practicing yoga and meditation.\n\nA government survey conducted last year found 14 percent of adults said they had recently done yoga, and the same percentage had recently meditated.

He is trying to placate the Muslim extremists who have threatened to topple his government, while keeping the 54-year-old mother of five safe from a lynch mob and also finding a way to allow her to leave Pakistan without bringing rioters into the streets.\n\nBibi has been offered asylum by the European Parliament, which championed her case after she was convicted in 2010 under Pakistan's harsh blasphemy law. There has been sharp worldwide criticism of the law, which remains popular in the Muslim majority country and carries the death penalty for insulting Islam but also has been used as a way to settle scores and pressure minorities.\n\nBibi was with her family under heavy security after being transferred to the Pakistani capital overnight from her detention facility in southern Punjab, triggering expectations of an imminent departure from the country.\n\nFor the moment, Bibi remained in Pakistan, according to two people close to her who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to endanger her. That was confirmed later Thursday by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry.\n\nFollowing her Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan's Supreme Court, the hard-line Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party forced a nationwide shutdown as its supporters filled the streets for three days to protest the ruling. The rallies only dispersed after Khan's government promised that a court would review a motion to challenge the acquittal and deny Bibi permission to leave Pakistan.\n\nKhan, who came to power after elections last summer in part on an Islamist agenda, was immediately accused by critics of giving in to the extremists.\n\nBibi's release, high-security transfer to Islamabad and her likely departure raised the possibility that Khan's promises to the Islamists could have been an effort to buy time. The government, however, has not openly declared that Bibi was free to leave.\n\nTehreek-e-Labbaik, in a video message that was circulated widely Thursday, said it received government assurances following Bibi's relocation to Islamabad that she wouldn't leave the country until the review petition was heard.\n\nKhan, a former cricket star and playboy who has embraced religious conservatism before he ran for prime minister, is hamstrung by contradictions within his own government, according to Zahid Hussain, who has written two books on the rise of militancy in Pakistan.\n\n\"There are some within the party, senior members of the party, who are pampering religious extremists for the sake of votes, and some believe in the same kind of world view,\" Hussain said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nBibi's ordeal began on a blistering hot day in 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe two women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nWhile her conviction was appealed, her case gained worldwide attention and focused international criticism on the blasphemy law. In announcing her acquittal last week, a three-judge panel of the Supreme Court upheld the law itself but said prosecutors had failed to prove Bibi had violated it.\n\nEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani invited Bibi and her family to Europe. In a letter, a copy of which was seen by the AP, Tajani told Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih that the parliament is \"extremely concerned for your safety as well as your family's, due to the violence by extremist elements in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe letter added to expectations that she and her family would leave for Europe, though their destination has not been confirmed. Spain and France have offered her asylum.\n\nSpeaking to the AP earlier this week in the Punjab capital of Lahore, Masih said he hasn't slept much since his wife's acquittal and the subsequent outrage by extremists. His initial joy quickly turned to sadness when he realized the ordeal was not over.\n\nHe said that he is consumed by fear every time his phone rings and haunted by the shouts of \"Hang her!\"\n\n\"Sometimes I pace on the rooftop, sometimes I walk on the road outside our home,\" he said. \"I look at the faces around me and I wonder if anyone is waiting to hurt us.\"\n\nEven the mere suggestion of blasphemy can whip mobs into a lynching frenzy in Pakistan. In 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities and a Christian, was shot and killed.\n\nFor Bibi's husband, leaving Pakistan is painful but remains a matter of life and death.\n\n\"We have no other choice but to leave,\" he said. \"I love Pakistan but I can't live here.\"\n\nEven in Bibi's home village of Aitta Wali \u2014 an impoverished farming community where animals and residents share tiny, sunbaked mud houses \u2014 there is still outrage over her acquittal, and its remaining three Christian families have fled.\n\n\"Our entire village swore on the Quran that she insulted the prophet but no one believes us and everyone believes her,\" said Aman Ali, one of the villagers. \"Before this, we liked the Christian families. We always got along. But now there is only anger.\"\n\nSome of that anger was directed at a visiting AP reporter, who was told by one resident: \"Go. Just get out. Go.\"\n\nMuhammad Afzal Qadri, a leader in the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party and a religious scholar, said he doesn't regret calling for the deaths of the three judges who acquitted Bibi, or for calling on his followers to overthrow Khan's government.\n\nAt his sprawling madrassa in the Punjab city of Gujrat, Qadri told the AP this week that he had the religious authority to declare a fatwa, or edict, demanding the judges be killed.\n\nPakistan is bound by Islamic injunctions, he said, adding that he was qualified to decide such matters. The West only seeks to undermine Pakistan's Islamic traditions and culture, Qadri said.\n\nHussain, the author on Pakistani militancy, said the demonstrations over Bibi's acquittal were an attempt to regain positions the extremists had lost in the July elections.\n\nAnother rally Thursday in the southern city of Karachi drew thousands. One religious leader, Fazlur Rehman, whose party was routed in the elections, said the \"court of the masses\" has rejected Bibi's acquittal.\n\nThe Tehreek-e-Taliban insurgent group warned anyone who would commit blasphemy that \"our daggers will cut your throat.\"\n\nHussain said the extremists \"are trying to mobilize people on this issue, creating more extremism. They have created a sense of fear in society, for anyone who disagrees with their view of Islam.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Munir Ahmed in Islamabad, Asim Tanvir in Multan, Pakistan, Mohammad Farooq in Karachi, Pakistan, and Ishtiaq Mahsud, in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, contributed.", "South Korea's foreign minister said Thursday that U.S. officials told Seoul that it was North Korea that canceled nuclear talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official.\n\nForeign Minister Kang Kyung-wha provided no reason, aside from \"busy schedules,\" for why North Korea canceled the meeting set for Thursday in New York that was meant to discuss ridding the North of its nuclear weapons and setting up a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nBut some analysts say a last-minute cancellation \u2014 a familiar North Korean tactic \u2014 could be aimed at pressuring the United States to agree to a quick Trump-Kim summit because the North thinks it can win major concessions from Trump that lower-level U.S. officials might try to block. The U.S. president has recently appeared to be slowing the pace of diplomacy with North Korea amid signs that Kim is lagging behind in his supposed promise to denuclearize.\n\nBefore this week's cancellation, Trump said he wouldn't play a \"time game\" with the North over a denuclearization deal, while his national security director, John Bolton, said a second Kim-Trump summit won't happen until 2019.\n\nNorth Korea has yet to comment on the cancellation.\n\nTrump and Kim held a highly choreographed summit in June in Singapore, where they announced aspirational goals for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing how and when it would occur.\n\nBut North Korea has since insisted that U.S.-led sanctions against it should be lifted before there will be any progress in nuclear negotiations. This has fueled doubts about whether Kim will ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. Washington says the sanctions will remain until North Korea takes concrete steps toward irreversibly and verifiably relinquishing its nuclear weapons.\n\nMany officials in the U.S. administration want to take time in setting up a summit because they're trying to get something more substantial after widespread criticism that Trump made large concessions to Kim in the first summit without getting much in return, said Park Hyeong-jung, an analyst from the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.\n\nThis would require that the U.S. and North Korea hammer out details in lower-level talks about what can be exchanged at the next summit, but the cancellation of the meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol indicates that the two sides remain far apart, Park said.\n\nCritics say Trump's decision to start off his North Korean diplomacy with a leaders' summit, instead of building upward from lower-level talks, bestowed legitimacy on the North before it took any meaningful steps toward denuclearization. After his June meeting with Kim, Trump raised security jitters in Seoul by abruptly canceling major U.S. military exercises with South Korea which North Korea had termed invasion rehearsals.\n\n\"For North Korea, there has never been a U.S. president like Trump,\" Park said. \"He doesn't ask too many questions or dig too much into details. The North simply got what it wanted the last time.\"\n\nForeign Minister Kang told lawmakers she planned to discuss the matter with Pompeo over the phone. South Korea's presidential office earlier said that the meeting's postponement wouldn't affect the momentum of talks between the U.S. and North Korea.\n\n\"We were notified by the United States that North Korea explained that (the meeting) should be postponed because both sides have busy schedules,\" Kang said. \"I think it would be excessive to read too much into the postponement of the meeting.\"\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House that the United States is \"in no rush\" and that the meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol would be rescheduled.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said the postponement was \"purely a scheduling issue\" but refused to elaborate. He did not provide a straightforward answer when asked whether the discord over sanctions has made it more difficult to set up meetings.\n\n\"Timing, timing,\" Palladino said. \"This has to do with timing as a matter \u2014 we're talking about scheduling. And I'll leave it at that.\"\n\nSeoul has worked hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea that has reduced war fears among South Koreans following a provocative run in North Korean weapons tests and Trump's threats of military action last year.\n\nKim Jong Un shifted to diplomacy early this year and has held three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

The parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts \u2014 its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade \u2014 will keep its title, as well.\n\nThe organization already has started admitting girls into the Cub Scouts, and Scouts BSA begins accepting girls next year.\n\nThe Girls Scouts claim it has already been damaged by the name change announcement, saying that \"throughout the country, families, schools and communities have been told that GSUSA and BSA have merged, or even that GSUSA no longer exists.\"\n\n\"Parents interested in signing up for Girl Scouts programs have instead mistakenly signed up for the new girls' programs offered by BSA,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction against trademark breaches and monetary damages.", "Republican candidate Denver Riggleman, who was once labeled as a \"Bigfoot erotica\" devotee by his Democratic opponent, was elected Virginia's 5th district representative in Congress on Tuesday.\n\nIn July, Leslie Cockburn, accused her opponent in a tweet with a crudely-sketched image of the mythical creature \u2014 its genitalia veiled \u2014 saying, \"My opponent Denver Riggleman, running mate of Corey Stewart, was caught on camera campaigning with a white supremacist.

It supports jobs, it helps us to increase living standards,\" she said.\n\nPayne's meeting with Wang was seen indicating an improvement in ties between the key economic partners after months of tension over accusations of Chinese interference in Australian politics, media and academia. That threatened to upset political ties as well as economic relations with China, which buys about one-third of Australia's exports.\n\n\"I think the most important outcome of this dialogue is that we have reaffirmed the course of this relationship,\" Wang said after the meeting, which ran an hour longer than scheduled.\n\nAustralia has banned Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE Corp. from new telecommunications projects, and an Australian security think tank has raised concerns about increasing collaboration between Australian universities and China's People's Liberation Army scientists on research programs such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology.\n\nChina took particular offense at a new law passed after allegations of Chinese meddling in Australian politics and media exposes about the Communist Party's dealings with Chinese university students and the expatriate Chinese community in Australia.\n\nChina has denounced all accusations of interference as prejudiced \"Cold War thinking\" and alleges that Australia's longstanding military alliance with the U.S. is intended to contain China's growing influence. Australia backs the U.S. in challenging China's territorial claims to virtually the entire the South China Sea by flying and sailing near Beijing-held islands.\n\nWhile seeking to improve ties with its biggest trading partner, Australia is also taking steps to shore up its presence in the Asia-Pacific, where China has sought to extend its economic, political and military influence.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday outlined plans to increase investments in infrastructure in the South Pacific and for greater military and diplomatic engagement with Australia's island neighbors, who are increasing looking to China for aid through Beijing's \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure program.\n\nAustralia has also announced it will invest in redeveloping a naval base in Papua New Guinea.\n\nResponding to a question on those moves, Wang said South Pacific island nations were entitled to make their own decisions about their foreign relations, but that China was willing to respond to their needs and \"engage in cooperation based on equality and for win-win outcomes.\"\n\n\"China and Australia have our respective strengths when it comes to cooperation with Pacific island countries and in this regard, China and Australia are not competitors, not rivals, but cooperation partners,\" Wang said.\n\nHe and Payne agreed that \"China's development poses no threat to Australia, but represents opportunities,\" Wang said, adding that the meeting constituted \"an important engagement after the ups and downs this relationship went through.\"\n\nPayne said the ministers also discussed events in the northwestern Chinese region of Xinjiang, where the authorities have detained up to 1 million members of Muslim minority groups in camps in what Beijing calls a move to stamp out extremism.

Sports first reported details of the NCAA investigation on Tuesday night.\n\nFederal prosecutors have released only a portion of their evidence to the NCAA. There are additional federal criminal trials involving alleged college basketball corruption scheduled in February and April.\n\nIn the email Dawkins sent to his business partner Munish Sood, he detailed payment plans for players at Alabama, Arizona, Cincinnati, Kentucky, Louisville, LSU, Miami, Mississippi State, Oregon, USC and Xavier, some of which were to begin in September 2017.\n\nDawkins was among 10 men arrested by federal authorities on Sept. 26, 2017. There is no evidence that any of the payments were actually made before his arrest or that any of the players had knowledge of the pay-for-play schemes.\n\nESPN attempted to contact each of the players included in the business plan through their respective agents, schools or other contacts.\n\nIn the email, which was included in the evidentiary files from the corruption trial, Dawkins detailed his blueprint for his fledgling sports management agency Loyd Inc., which was an acronym for Living Out Your Dreams. It included an ambitious plan to provide cash and other improper benefits to a wide network of players still in college and high school.\n\n\"We want to be a one stop shop for everything,\" Dawkins wrote in the email. \"We will take a majority interest in a Sports Agency, where we partner with certified agents, who we will then have our players sign to. The certified agency will essentially be our sister company. This way we can charge 3% on the team contract, 20% on the marketing, 5% on accounting and 5% on investment return. If we have a player on a [$]50 million deal for 4 years who's also making $500,000 a year in marketing, we should generate [$2 million] over those 4 years off of one player.\"\n\nIn the email, Dawkins advised his partners that he had deals in place with three players who had recently turned pro -- Clemson's Jaron Blossomgame, Creighton's Justin Patton and Xavier's Edmond Sumner.\n\nDawkins also listed 19 \"prospective players\" who were either in college or high school. Among them were Alabama's Collin Sexton, Mississippi State's Lamar Peters, Oregon's Troy Brown Jr., Arizona's Rawle Alkins, Cincinnati's Jacob Evans, Louisville's Ray Spalding and V.J. King, Miami's Dewan Huell (now Hernandez), LSU's Brandon Sampson, USC's De'Anthony Melton, Xavier's Trevon Bluiett and Kentucky's Jarred Vanderbilt.\n\nThe business plan included intricate payment details for several of the players and their families, and it revealed myriad people who might have had financial stakes in their potential NBA careers. As part of the proposed deals, Dawkins had apparently offered or was prepared to offer employment with Loyd Inc. to mentors, coaches, siblings, cousins and other associates of the players.\n\nHe'd already settled on five people to work as managers for Loyd Inc., including Kendall Patton, Justin Patton's twin brother; Andrew Mitchell, a former Xavier walk-on and Sumner's roommate; Anthony Brown, Oregon star Troy Brown's mentor; and Rodney Labossiere, Alkins' cousin.\n\nAccording to the business plan, Dawkins proposed making the following payments to players and/or their families:\n\n\u2022 Providing Alabama star Collin Sexton $1,500 each month from September 2017 until April 2018, plus $23,000 in travel expenses for his family. His brother, Jordan Sexton, was also going to receive a four-year contract from the company worth a total of $170,000.\n\nSexton spent one season with the Crimson Tide before the Cleveland Cavaliers selected him with the eighth pick in June's NBA draft.\n\n\"We will receive 3% on team contract, 20% on marketing deals, 5% on accounting work, 5% of investment work,\" Dawkins wrote in the email. \"For example if in year 5 he is making $15,000,000 on the court, $1,000,000 of [sic] the court, and has $5,000,000 saved - LOYD Inc. will gross $750,000.\"\n\nDawkins' phone records from May 3, 2017, to July 2, 2017, which were also released by federal prosecutors, included 15 calls to a number belonging to the Sexton family.\n\n\u2022 According to the email, Dawkins planned to give Vanderbilt's family $30,000 in travel expenses to watch him play for the Wildcats last season, plus his father was going to get a $25,000 signing bonus when his son turned pro.\n\n\"Brother Jamal and dad will also be a part of the deal, and receive 25% of our income on all sides,\" Dawkins wrote.\n\nDawkins proposed giving Vanderbilt a $100,000 line of credit and $25,000 advance on his marketing revenue if he was projected as a lottery pick at the end of the 2017-18 season.\n\nVanderbilt played in only 14 games for the Wildcats because of a foot injury and was a second-round pick of the Magic.\n\n\u2022 Troy Brown, who played one season at Oregon and was the No. 15 pick by the Wizards this year, wasn't going to receive monthly payments, according to Dawkins' proposal. But Dawkins did request $5,000 to purchase Floyd Mayweather fight tickets for Brown.\n\nDawkins also planned to hire Brown's mentor, Anthony Brown (no relation), a club director for the Las Vegas Prospects, as one of Loyd Inc.'s managers.\n\nDawkins' phone records from May 3, 2017 to July 2, 2017 included 30 calls to a number belonging to Anthony Brown.\n\n\"His advisor upon signing will sign on to work with us,\" Dawkins wrote. \"He will want to receive a signing bonus for the kid signing and 50% of all revenue we will make off the kid going forward, as well as other players moving forward. If player is a Top 5 pick, advisor wants $100,000 signing bonus. If top 10 pick, $75,000. If top 15 pick, $60,000. If top 20 pick, $50,000 ...\"\n\nAnthony Brown didn't respond to voice messages and emails from ESPN.\n\n\u2022 Dawkins proposed paying Lamar Peters, now a junior guard at Mississippi State, monthly payments of $2,500 from September 2017 until April 2018, and also noted that \"if he stays in school a 2nd year we will have to continue to pay.\"\n\nDawkins also wrote that Peters' advisor, New Orleans Elite director Greg Holmes, had signed to work with Loyd Inc.\n\n\"[His] advisor will get 25% of net income we generate off of Lamar and any player he brings in moving forward,\" Dawkins wrote. \"In advisor agreement, he will receive a signing bonus for delivering a first round pick of $10,000, $2,000 for a second round pick.\"\n\nHolmes told ESPN that he'd signed an agreement with Dawkins to manage NBA players but wasn't interested in recruiting high school or college players to the firm. He said he'd arranged a meeting between Dawkins and Peters in 2017 but discouraged Peters from agreeing to accept money from Dawkins.\n\n\"I didn't have any interest in recruiting players or bringing anybody in,\" Holmes said. \"I was going to be part of his management team, not recruiting high school kids to come to his firm. That's why it never materialized. Thank God it didn't.\"\n\n\u2022 Dawkins wrote that he planned to pay Arizona's Rawle Alkins $2,500 per month from September 2017 through April 2018, plus $30,000 in travel expenses for his family. He also wanted to give his cousin, Rodney Labossiere, a four-year deal to work as a manager.\n\n\"Rodney will get 25% of net income we generate from Rawle as well as additional players he brings in moving forward,\" Dawkins wrote.\n\n\"Rodney has a bonus structure in his contract as well for delivering players at [$]10,000 for a first round pick. $2,000 for a second round pick.\"\n\nDawkins' phone records show that there were 33 calls made to a number belonging to Labossiere from May 7, 2017, through July 2, 2017.\n\nWhen reached by ESPN on Wednesday, Labossiere declined to comment. A payment schedule included in the business plan indicated Dawkins planned to make a $30,000 payment for \"Rawle Alkins/Rodney Labossiere family travel to games\" on Sept. 15, 2017.\n\n\u2022 Dawkins proposed paying Louisville forward Spalding $2,000 per month from October 2017 to December 2017, then $3,000 per month until April 2018. He also planned to pay King $2,000 per month from October 2017 until April 2018, although he noted it \"will be a messy situation in my opinion.\"\n\nSpalding left for the NBA draft following the 2017-18 season and was a second-round pick of the 76ers.\n\n\"Our university continually reviews the eligibility of all of its student-athletes,\" a Louisville spokesman told ESPN. \"We have reviewed information recently presented at the trial in New York and do not believe it affects any of our current student-athletes. We will continue to monitor any new information that becomes available.\"\n\n\u2022 Dawkins planned to pay Miami's Huell (now Hernandez) $500 per month from September 2017 through January 2018, then $1,000 per month until April 2018. If Hernandez left Miami after the 2017-18 season, he wouldn't have to pay the money back, according to the email. But if Hernandez elected to return to the Hurricanes for an additional season, the payments would be converted to a loan, according to the plan.\n\nHernandez returned to Miami after averaging 11.4 points and 6.7 rebounds last season.\n\nThere were similar payment plans for Cincinnati's Evans ($1,500 per month), LSU's Sampson ($500 per month until December 2017, then $1,000 per month until April 2018) and Xavier's Bluiett ($700 per month from September 2017 until April 2018).\n\n\u2022 Melton was suspended by USC last season after the school determined that a close family friend received an extra benefit. Dawkins wrote that he wanted to give Melton $5,000 per month from September 2017 through April 2018 and a $20,000 signing bonus to his uncle in April 2018.\n\n\"Let's try to stall on this deal after this next upcoming month,\" Dawkins wrote in the email. \"That is a lot of resources for one guy, when we have other elite players who won't cost that much.\"\n\n\u2022 Dawkins indicated that Mitchell, whom he identified as Sumner's godbrother and roommate, was recruiting Darius Bazley of Cincinnati, the No. 13 prospect in the 2018 ESPN 100.

He also planned to recruit many of the country's best high school prospects, including center James Wiseman of Memphis, the No. 1 prospect in the 2019 ESPN 100.\n\nDawkins recommended paying Wiseman $3,000 per month from October 2018 until October 2019, then $4,000 per month from October 2019 until April 2020.\n\nDawkins also planned to recruit 2019 point guard prospect Ashton Hagans of Cartersville, Georgia, who reclassified to the 2018 class and is a freshman at Kentucky. According to the email, Dawkins wanted to pay Hagans $2,000 per month from October 2017 to October 2018, then $3,000 monthly through April 2020.\n\n\u2022 Dawkins endorsed even higher payments for a pair of 2020 point guard prospects: R.J. Hampton of Little Elm, Texas, and Jalen Suggs of Minneapolis.\n\nHe described Hampton as a \"potential superstar, gamechanger\" and wanted to pay him $4,000 monthly from September 2017 through September 2018, then $5,000 per month from September 2018 to September 2020.\n\nHampton's father, Roderick Hampton, said he has never met Dawkins.\n\n\"I heard his name a lot, but I've never met him,\" Hampton said. \"I'm taking my ass to work everyday to make ends meet. I haven't found the land of milk and honey yet, and I probably won't find it anytime soon.\"\n\nDawkins proposed the same payments for Suggs, whose father, Larry, couldn't be reached for comment.\n\n\"If we have these two guys in the same year, we will control the [sneaker] market, which would give us upwards of ($)2 million a year in additional revenue by this time,\" Dawkins wrote.\n\nDawkins' attorney, Steven Haney, argued during the corruption trial that his client was only doing what he'd been taught to do as a runner for ASM Sports -- and made some of the payments at the request of college coaches.\n\n\"Runners like Christian Dawkins were relationship guys, they were the go-betweens, taught and trained that their job was to take care of these families and provide them with the financial resources they needed, for the purpose of building relationships, trust and loyalty,\" Haney told the jury.", "Transcript for Photos released of stolen SUV used to abduct teen\n\nNext, to the urgent search for a 13-year-old girl.

Authorities have not revealed a motive. Carter said the couple's 6-year-old daughter is living with relatives.\n\nIn an official statement, Cuba's government said the extradition was \"based on Cuba's full compliance with its international legal obligations, the existing bilateral agreements on law enforcement between Cuba and the United States and the cooperation engaged by both governments in that front.\"\n\nAlthough cooperation between Cuban and U.S. authorities is unusual in many fields, the process of returning wanted persons has been laid out in recent years amid the rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, which resumed diplomatic relations in 2014. The Trump administration has toughened its policies against Cuba, straining relations, but hasn't broken ties.\n\nWhile Cuba has refused to return to the U.S. fugitives to whom it gave political asylum in past decades and who have ties to black militant groups or other causes, its government has cooperated with the U.S. more recently in cases of Cubans who committed crimes in the United States then fled to the island.\n\nCuba's statement said it had received a red alert on Ray from Interpol, the international police agency.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP writer Danica Coto contributed to this report from San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Ecuador's top court ordered former President Rafael Correa on Wednesday to stand trial for his alleged role in the 2012 botched kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker.\n\nCorrea was charged in September by prosecutors of orchestrating Fernando Balda's kidnapping in Bogota after he fled to Colombia's capital to escape what he considered persecution by Correa.\n\nA supreme court justice decided that the accusations against Correa, his top intelligence chief and two others merited a trial. Judge Daniel Camacho also formally declared Correa a \"fugitive\" after he flouted for months an order to appear before the court every 15 days as part of the ongoing probe. For his defiance, Ecuadorean authorities had previously requested Correa's arrest and extradition from Belgium, where he has been living since leaving office last year.\n\nCorrea has long denied the charges, considering them part of a political witch hunt headed by his hand-picked successor turned arch-critic, President Lenin Moreno. Late Wednesday, before the judge's ruling, he called the charges a \"farce\" but said he was more worried about Ecuador's future than his own legal troubles.\n\n\"We expected something like this because for weeks we've been witnesses to the uncontrolled political pressure being applied to the judge,\" Caupolican Ochoa, Correa's attorney, said outside the court where a small group of Correa supporters had gathered.\n\nBalda said he took no pleasure in the legal victory because \"we can't celebrate the fact that these criminal acts were ordered by a president.\"\n\nCorrea, a firebrand who governed Ecuador with an iron fist for a decade, garnered legions of supporters by promoting generous health and social programs aimed at reducing inequality. Supporters credit him with providing Ecuador political and economic stability after a tumultuous period in the nation's history.\n\nBut the combative leader also feuded with the media, business community, indigenous groups and environmentalists by pushing through measures that consolidated executive power. And his record has increasingly come under scrutiny since leaving power.\n\nIn addition to the kidnapping case, several top aides, including his former Vice President Jorge Glas, have either been jailed or are under investigation for corruption.\n\nBalda was abducted but quickly escaped harm after nearby taxi drivers alerted police, who stopped the vehicle in which he was being taken away. Colombian authorities later determined that three intelligence agents with Ecuador's police had contracted the kidnappers to abduct Balda.\n\nProceedings against Correa are unlikely to begin anytime soon because he can only be tried once in Ecuador.

Children play on a parallel stretch of railroad that hasn't been in regular use since before they were born. Behind a solitary guard stands a sign saying it's 68 kilometers (40 miles) to Sokcho, a town just across the DMZ in South Korea.\n\nAt the height of South Korea's policy of engagement with the North, the \"Diamond Mountain Resort\" area was a symbol of cooperation. More than 2 million South Korean tourists came to visit and some of the South's biggest corporations poured more than a billion dollars into what they hoped would be a world-class travel destination.\n\nToday it's almost deserted.\n\nA decade after the North-South experiment in cooperation on Kumgang ended in bitter failure, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in want to give it another try. By the end of the year they hope to begin working on opening this stretch of road and rail.\n\nThe push to jointly develop Kumgang is a direct challenge to Washington's policy of maintaining sanctions and \"maximum pressure\" until Pyongyang gives up its nuclear arsenal.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChrystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling of the Kumgangsan Hotel, where a handful of North Korean tourists in Adidas sweatsuits gathers to catch a bus up the mountain. Elaborate murals of mountain scenery cover the walls of its second floor. In the cavernous lobby, there's a souvenir shop, a white concert piano on a stage beside billiard and pingpong tables and a well-stocked bar. There's a theater and a karaoke room.\n\nThe hotel is eerily silent, the quiet broken only by the occasional laughter of the local tourists and some scattered Chinese groups.\n\nBuilt in the 1990s with hundreds of millions of dollars of South Korean investment, mostly from a branch of the Hyundai Group, the resort was in its heyday an oasis of luxury, with conga lines and Filipino lounge bands. Its 10 hotels featured opulent fixtures and oil paintings framed in gold. Guests had the run of an 18-hole golf course, now closed, and a hot springs spa, which remains open and popular with North Koreans. Today, the resort's main role is to be the official venue for reunions of families divided by the 1950-53 Korean War.\n\nThe Kumgang project was troubled from its outset, when it opened to South Koreans in 1998.\n\nVisitors from the South were allowed only day trips or visits of a few days. Initially they were brought in by ferry to minimize chances to see the North's countryside or interact with its people. Later, they were allowed in on buses through the DMZ, with the curtains drawn until they had arrived.\n\nThe resort drew only a fraction of the 500,000 tourists projected to come annually. Within a few years of its opening, it was hemorrhaging money.\n\nIts fate was sealed in July 2008, when a North Korean soldier shot dead tourist Park Wang-ja, a 53-year-old housewife from Seoul, after she allegedly wandered into a restricted area on a beach on the resort's fringes. Seoul quickly suspended all travel to Kumgang. In 2011, the North announced it was seizing all assets and taking back control of all real estate rights.\n\nThe Hyundai affiliate is believed to have lost more than a billion dollars. Its Kumgang office sits padlocked and unoccupied near an arena that once housed a circus.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFrom their first summit in April, reopening the road and railway across the DMZ to Kumgang has been a top priority for Moon and Kim.\n\nMoon has helped bring Kim out of the cold. He wants to expand economic ties with the North to build trust and defuse tensions, creating conditions for Kim to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. He also hopes to reopen another \"Sunshine\" era symbol, the jointly operated Kaesong industrial complex on the North's side of the DMZ.\n\nAt their third summit, in September, Kim and Moon formalized Mount Kumgang's role as the reunion venue, agreeing to \"promptly restore the facility toward this end.\" Their joint statement included plans for a ground-breaking ceremony for work to reopen cross-border railways and roads, including the ones near Kumgang, by the year's end and to \"normalize\" the Kaesong industrial complex and Mount Kumgang tourism projects when the time is ripe.\n\nMoon's seeming readiness to scale back sanctions even before Pyongyang takes major steps to denuclearize is raising red flags in Washington. Such concerns spiked when South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha suggested Seoul might lift unilateral sanctions it imposed after an 2010 attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors.\n\nTrump's response was quick and, to many Koreans, deeply insulting.\n\n\"They won't do that without our approval,\" he said. \"They do nothing without our approval.\"\n\nLim Soo-ho of the Seoul-based Institute for National Security said it's all but impossible for South Korea to resume joint tours to Kumgang, operations at the Kaesong joint factory park or any other form of economic cooperation under the current international sanctions, which have strengthened significantly since 2016. Washington's own sanctions against Pyongyang restrict an even broader range of economic activities and target a larger list of companies and individuals.\n\nSouth Korea will never abandon the Kumgang joint tours or Kaesong factory park because they are such powerful symbols of inter-Korean cooperation, Lim said. But a less risky business environment for southern companies is needed, perhaps with a free trade agreement that would bring inter-Korean economic activities closer to global standards.\n\nFor now, ground-breaking ceremonies for projects not yet started are the best Seoul and Pyongyang can manage.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA special permit is required to get to the beach from the base of the mountains.\n\nWinding through freshly harvested farmland, the rice still spread out on the roadsides to dry, travelers come to an imposing checkpoint manned by armed soldiers. A tall, electrified fence marks the entrance into the DMZ.\n\nPae Un Sim was a child during Kumgang's boom years.\n\nLeading the way down a gravel path to the rugged beach where the South Korean housewife was killed, she recalls meeting a tourist who said he once told everyone Yosemite National Park in the United States was the most beautiful mountain scenery in the world. He had to revise that after seeing the Alps, and again after seeing Kumgang.\n\nThe sun is setting. Lights along the North-South demarcation line can be seen flickering in the hills.\n\nPae stops to point to the ocean.\n\n\"If you look between those two little islands, you can see the South,\" she said. \"There used to be so many tourists. It was very lively.\"\n\nAsked about her impressions of the South Koreans who came to visit or her hopes for the future, she hesitated. Those topics are still perhaps too sensitive and too political to discuss freely. After some thought she voiced a commonly heard refrain.\n\n\"We Koreans are one people,\" she said. \"It is our common wish to be reunited.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP reporter Tong-hyung Kim contributed to this story from Seoul.

Thanks to you, tomorrow will be a new day in America. Reporter: Today, the president extending an olive branch to Nancy Pelosi, who will likely become the next speaker of the house. You know, she loves this country, and she's a very smart woman. She's done a very good job. Reporter: Pelosi and the president are pledging to work together, but trump knows full well house Democrats have something else in mind, too. They want to hold his administration accountable, now armed with the power to sub Bina, Democrats are poised to launch an onslaught of investigations. The president says if that happens, he'll go after them, with help from the republican-led senate. They can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States senate. And all you're going to do is end up in back and forth and back and forth and two years is going to go up and we won't have done a thing. Reporter: The president says he's willing to work with Democrats on issues like health care and infrastructure, but any bipartisanship would grind to a halt if they investigate him. Can you compartmentalize that and still continue to work with them for the benefit of the rest of the country? Or are all belts off? No. No. If they do that, all of it is a war-like posture. Pelosi today unfazed. They do note intent to abandon our relinquish our responsibiliies for accountability, for oversight and the rest. Mary Bruce with us live from the hill tonight. And Mary, Nancy Pelosi poised to become speaker again, we'll see. She was asked today if house Democrats will move to get the president's tax returns. Reporter: Yeah, and David, leader Pelosi said if they go down this path, the Democrats, quote, are going to know what we're doing and do it right. Democrats are already preparing to ask the irs and the trump administration to turn over these documents. They do not need a subpoena for this, but the president, asked about this again today, gave no indication that he's going to just hand over his tax returns any time soon. David?

From this downtown Nashville hotel. A report of a guest feeling sick. Cardiac or respiratory arrest on bravo four. Reporter: By 10:00 A.M. -- Looks like we're going to be transporting this one, chest pressure. Reporter: More than a dozen people treated, at least five take on the the hospital. Authorities say the leak originated on the hotel's third floor, where the pool and gym are located. And the carbon monoxide levels were through the roof. A Normal reading for a safe level is 35 parts per million. At that point, our readings were at 500 parts per million, which is the highest that our tools can actually measure. Reporter: Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless and poisonous. Symptoms can range from headaches to loss of consciousness and ultimately, death. Had this happened overnight and possibly had it happened in an area where people were sleeping, it could've been a much different outcome. Reporter: There were no core ban monoxide detectors on the third floor, but they're actually not required by state law, because it only houses the gym and poom. No guest rooms.

But while they\u2019re meant for carrying everything we might need, too often, we include things we don\u2019t. Over time, the strain caused by these items can lead to problems with the spine, and a new study illustrates just how easily it can happen.\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem with a heavy backpack?\n\nCarrying excessive weight in a backpack can cause wear-and-tear on the joints, ligaments, and muscles across the entire back and in the hips. Oftentimes, these body parts work to compensate for the extra weight, but because they cannot sustain that strength for an extended period of time, they begin to degenerate, which can cause stiffness, a loss of range of motion and pain. These effects can spread to other parts of the body as other muscles work to compensate for the strain.\n\nThis gradual degeneration can lead to chronic back pain, compressed discs in the spine (herniated discs), neck pain, an altered posture and gait and even pain in the feet, according to Dr. Kenneth Hansraj, lead author of the study and a spinal and orthopedic surgeon at the New York Spine Surgery and Rehabilitation Medicine Center.\n\n\u201cPeople everywhere have struggled to assess the impact of objects in a backpack to the body in general, and the spine in particular,\u201d Hansraj said in a press release.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nHow heavy can it really be?\n\nHansraj\u2019s study used a computer model to determine the amount of stress that\u2019s put on a spine when it\u2019s made to carry a backpack ranging in weight from 1 to 100 pounds \u2014 a range the study noted can include everything from school books to hiking gear.\n\nBased on the model, Hansraj and his colleagues found that the amount of force placed on a spine in a neutral position is about 7.2 times the weight of the backpack. If the spine is slumped forward about 20 degrees, the amount of force increases to 11.6 times the weight of the bag.\n\nThe reason the backpack causes so much strain? Even in a neutral position, the spine is not totally straight \u2014 it\u2019s somewhat S-shaped if you look at it sideways. So, even though from the outside the backpack may seem like it only pulls downward, inside the spine, the weight causes different pressure forces depending on where on the spine it\u2019s hitting.\n\nThe study was based on a \u201cphysiologically accurate\u201d simulation of the human spine, so it\u2019s unclear how much of the data can be applied to actual people. However, based on the analysis, a 50-pound child who is carrying a 5 pound backpack would be putting about 36 pounds of pressure on their spine if it was in a neutral position. If they were slumped forward 20 degrees, the bag would put more pressure on their spine than they weighed \u2014 58 pounds.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent these problems?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics notes that children should never carry a backpack weighing more than 10 to 20 percent of their body weight. In the press release, Hansraj goes further, citing previous studies, to say that for young adults, backpacks shouldn\u2019t be over 13 to 15 percent of their body weight and for college-aged adults, 15 to 20 percent of their body weight.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nWhile the above might be the best way to prevent injuries and longer-term musculoskeletal problems, here are some other easy ways to carry your bag safely:\n\n\u2022 Pay attention to proper posture: Keep your ears above your shoulder, your shoulders back, your chest open, and make sure your back stays straight.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Lift your bag up from the ground by bending your knee. Don\u2019t just bend over, as this will put more strain on the lower back.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Pack only what is necessary.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Wear and tighten both straps of the backpack to distribute weight evenly.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Use a waist or chest strap if your backpack has one.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Pack heavier items closer to the center of the back.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Use digital textbooks if your school has them.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Use lockers or available storage space at work or school to avoid carrying everything at once.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Make multiple trips if you have to carry several heavy objects.\n\n\n\nIf you are already experiencing pain and you think it\u2019s from carrying a heavy backpack, see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh completed pediatrics residency at Brown University, and is currently an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "Transcript for FAA warns airlines about sensor issue in Boeing's fastest-selling jet\n\nthe new warning from the FAA tonight, issuing an emergency derekive after that deadly crash in Indonesia. ABC's David Kerley on this again tonight. Reporter: That emergency FAA directive tonight, warning airlines about a sensor in Boeing's fastest selling jet ever. The 737 max-8. Indonesian investigators say the lion air jet that crashed 13 minutes into its flight, killing all 189 onboard, had a sensor malfunction, which could have sent the jet into an aggressive nose dive. That sensor aimed at preventing a dangerous stall had been replaced two fights earlier, but the problems per sipsed. Still, experts say this apparent first-ever occurrence in the popular plane should not cause a crash. It's extremely rare, but crews are trained to be able to handle it. And so, one of the questions that comes in, if that was what was involved in lion air, did the crew respond incorrectly? Reporter: The FAA order requires airlines make sure pilots are aware of procedures in the jet's manual on how to disengage the safety system.

And a midterm election\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Jeff Sessions forced to resign from US attorney general post\n\nAnd it did not take long. Just hours after the results of the midterm elections and that split victory for president trump, today, the president demanded his attorney general, Jeff sessions, resign. Sessions submitting this letter, beginning by writing, \"At your request, I am submitting my resignation.\" And these images just a short time ago. Jeff sessions leaving the justice department for the last time. Growing emotional. This has been a very turbulent relationship between the A.G. And the president. The president furious from the start that sessions recused himself in the Russia investigation. Tonight, the president's move shifts the focus immediately from the midterms to the Mueller investigation. Is it in danger? ABC's Jonathan Karl tonight on the phone call to sessions and the message from the president. Reporter: This morning, just before president trump's post-election news conference, chief of staff John Kelly called attorney general Jeff sessions with a message from the president -- resign today. Sessions has been on thin ice for nearly two years. One of trump's earliest and staunchest supporters, he infuriated the president shortly after becoming A.G. By recusing himself from the Russia investigation. I am disappointed in the attorney general. He should not have recused himself. Reporter: The attorney general's decision ultimately led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump never forgave him. If he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else. Reporter: For months, the president publicly humiliated the attorney general. Well, it's kind of hurtful, but the president of the united States is a strong leader. Reporter: Tonight, sessions applauded as he walked out of the justice department building for the last time. The president quickly named sessions' chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, as the acting attorney general, tweeting, \"He will serve our country well.\" Whitaker is now the ultimate authority over the special counsel investigation. In the past, president trump has suggested he wants an attorney general who will protect him. And in Whitaker, he has picked someone who has talked openly about reining in Robert Mueller. Last year, when the president said Mueller would be crossing a red line if he investigated the trump family business and finances, Whitaker, then a CNN contributor, wrote, \"The president is absolutely correct. That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\" And in a television appearance, Whitaker defended the infamous trump tower meeting. Donald Trump Jr., Paul manafort and Jared Kushner sitting down with a Russian lawyer they were told had dirt on Hillary Clinton. You would always have somebody from the campaign take the meeting and hear that person out. Reporter: Whitaker also openly about how an acting attorney general could effectively put an end to the Russia investigation. I could see a scenario where Jeff sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to a halt. And Jon Karl with us live tonight from the white house. Jon and I on the air until the wee hours of the morning covering the midterm. Jon, you're back at it at the white house. Democrats are already calling on the new attorney general Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Even some Republicans sounding concerned? Reporter: Democrats are warning of a constitutional crisis, if Whitaker doesn't recuse himself and interferes in any way with the investigation. And some Republicans are expressing concerns, as well, including Susan Collins and senator-elect Mitt Romney, who today warned, saying that it was imperative that the investigation proceeds to its conclusion unimpaled. David? Jon Karl, thank you. Another major question about this tonight, does this president pressure on Robert Mueller to wrap this up, to issue his findings. With Democrats and some Republicans concerned about whether this investigation will be proexticketed. Let's get to Pierre Thomas tonight. How soon could we see Mueller's report? Reporter: Yes, this does create pressure for Mueller to complete the job. Whitaker has said that if Mueller investigates the president's finances, the investigation could look like a mere whit hunt. That said, Mueller's not someone to buckle to pressure. He'll end this investigation when he sees fit. Some of my sources are hoping Mueller will wrap up by the end of the year, with more indictments potentially coming sooner, possibly in weeks or days. David? Pierre Thomas, thank you.

It is a sign of health for American democracy.\n\nDistrustful of untrammeled majorities, the authors of the Constitution favored checks and balances, including, crucially, the check that the legislative branch might place upon the executive. Over the past two years, the Republican majorities in the House and Senate have failed to exercise reasonable oversight. Now the constitutional system has a fresh chance to work as intended.\n\nThe Democratic victory is also a sign of political health, to the extent it is a form of pushback against the excesses, rhetorical and in terms of policy, committed by the Trump administration and propounded by President Trump during this fall's campaign. Turning against the dominant party in Washington even in a moment of economic prosperity, voters from Key West to Kansas refused to accept the continued degradation of their nation's political culture. Republicans retained control of the Senate, where the map this year favored their defense. But voters nationwide refused Mr. Trump's invitation to vote on the basis of fear of immigrants; they did not respond to his depiction of his opposition as dangerous enemies.\n\nNow the House will be in a position to investigate any number of potential administration transgressions and demand accountability: the awful separation of migrant children from their parents; the dubious decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census; the president's harassment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation.\n\nThe new majority also has an opportunity to offer a positive legislative agenda. The Democrats achieved their victory Tuesday night in large part by promising to protect health-care coverage, especially for Americans with preexisting conditions. Though effective in winning over moderate voters, the campaign did not establish a clear mandate for much beyond that \u2014 eminently valid \u2014 objective. And of course, even if the Democrats set forth a list of specific proposals for the House, before or after Election Day, the Senate and Mr. Trump's veto pen could block it.\n\nStill, the party can outline an alternative policy direction for the country. It can begin with measures to shore up the Affordable Care Act but then move to reforms of federal gun laws. Where the Republican majority has denied science, the Democrats can offer an approach to climate change. They can propose relief to the \"dreamers\" and, ideally, other undocumented immigrants, along with generous but not unlimited opportunities for future legal immigration. They should propose to restore the United States to its rightful place as a welcomer of refugees; to end the disgraceful denial of congressional representation to citizens in the District of Columbia; to repeal the most egregious giveaways to the rich in the 2017 tax bill.\n\nTuesday was a good day for Democrats. It may also be a good day for Republicans, if they take the lessons of their House defeat to heart and reconsider the devil's bargain they have made with Mr. Trump. Indeed, if the results help lead to a reemergence of that party's better angels, then it will have been good day for America as a whole.\n\nOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNov. 5\n\nThe Telegraph on reinstated sanctions on Iran:\n\n...Although the EU, including Britain, is sticking to the nuclear deal unilaterally repudiated by President Trump, without America's backing it is pretty much a dead duck. Since European companies that continue trading with Iran risk being hit by secondary US sanctions, they are unlikely to keep doing so, despite promises of legal protection from Brussels.\n\nMr Trump made no secret of his intention to tear up the agreement while campaigning for the White House and a steady succession of EU leaders have made their way to Washington in an effort to change his mind, but to no avail. ...\n\nWhen the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran deal was called, was agreed, there was always a need for caution. It was hailed as a triumph of enlightened diplomacy that made the world a safer place. Yet the Iranians, bolstered by greater oil revenues after sanctions were eased, have shown every sign of making the Middle East more dangerous, even if they have stuck to the specific agreement on nuclear arms development, which is questionable.\n\nThe collapse in the international common front on Iran is regrettable. But instead of trying to force a U-turn on Mr Trump, the other signatories need to consider ways in which to respond to his - and Israel's - objections to the deal.\n\nWhat is often overlooked by those whose dislike of Mr Trump is an all-consuming obsession is that many Iranians welcome his stand because they are desperate to see the end of the regime in Tehran. The deal was supposed to foster stability in the Middle East, help the people of Iran and encourage moderate forces in the country - but it has done none of this. The money released from the ending of sanctions has been poured into supporting militia groups fighting proxy wars, such as the Houthis in Yemen and Hizbollah in Syria.\n\nThe new sanctions target banks and the Iranian military, whose influence may persuade the ayatollahs running the country to return to the negotiating table. Everyone needs to realise that this is now the only way forward.\n\nOnline: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNov. 7\n\nDallas Morning News says Texas is not turning purple:\n\nThe question is on more than a few minds now. Did Beto O'Rourke prove the once-unthinkable \u2014 that the near future of Texas is as a purple state?\n\nThose who hold out hope that, in fact, O'Rourke showed it is possible to repaint this red state will point to several factors. The congressman went from little-known El Paso figure to a national sensation overnight and raised $70 million in the process. He forced Sen. Ted Cruz, a national figure on the right with a dedicated core of supporters, to run hard to win. And he appeared to be in a very competitive position in a series of polls over the course of the campaign.\n\nPolitical prognosticators might also point to other factors. Texas is a rapidly changing state attracting a wide swath of new voters. And just as rapid growth helped fuel a Republican takeover of Texas, such growth can change the political trajectory of a state. Colorado and Virginia are examples of states that are competitive today in part because, over time, the influx of residents can flip voting patterns. In Texas, this appears to take on added significance because of the growing number of Hispanic residents. It is presumed that in the coming years, they will break in favor of Democrats.\n\nAll of these things are true, but color us skeptical that they add up to a purple future for the state of Texas in the near term. Consider that Republicans who war with other Republicans tend to underperform. And Cruz spent the first few years of his term mixing up with members of his own party in Washington, then made a name for himself challenging his party on its principles as he ran for president. And, although anecdotal, we have met a lot of staunch Republicans who didn't vote for Cruz because they just don't like him.\n\nAll of that adds up to the fact that Cruz had work to do to win a second term. But there is more evidence to suggest this year's results are peculiar to the circumstances. We'll start with President Donald Trump's leadership style. To the extent that this election cycle was a referendum on the president, the results broke against Republicans generally. That is especially true in our suburbs. One reason Pete Sessions won't be returning to Congress is that he was a Republican running in the suburbs this year.\n\nDespite all of this, however, Democrats still failed to win a statewide race. They weren't able to defeat Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who became synonymous with divisive politics. The party of Beto also failed to unseat Ken Paxton, the state's attorney general who is under indictment. In the end, O'Rourke outperformed Lupe Valdez, who ran a lackluster campaign for governor, by just five points in a year that was supposed to be a wave election against the president's party.\n\nTo us, what all of this shows is that there is a hunger among voters for candidates who offer a mix of optimism and who work against those who would divide us. Republicans are just as capable of offering that message. Indeed, it is the message that enabled George W. Bush to turn the state red in 1994. It's the message Ronald Reagan used to endear himself to a generation on the right. And, we suspect, it is a message candidates will rediscover as they consider what it will take to remain competitive in the years ahead.\n\nOnline: https://www.dallasnews.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on privately funded litigators working in state attorneys general offices:\n\nWith the courts and Trump Administration rolling back federal climate regulation, green activists have turned to the states. But there's a troubling ethical twist: Instead of merely lobbying, activists are placing employees in Attorneys General offices in dubious private-public condominiums.\n\nConsider a remarkable arrangement brokered by the NYU Law School's State Energy and Environmental Impact Center to fund legal services for state AGs. The group was launched in August 2017 to advance a liberal climate and energy agenda, courtesy of a $6 million grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies, which also financed the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign.\n\nIn August 2017 the NYU outfit emailed then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office, offering to cover the salary and benefits of \"special assistant attorneys general,\" pending an application from the office that demonstrated how the new attorneys would be used. These privately funded staffers would work out of an AG's office for two years and deliver quarterly progress reports to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.\n\nThose progress reports would explain \"the contribution that the legal fellow has made to the clean energy, climate change, and environmental initiatives\" within the attorney general's office, according to a December 2017 draft of an agreement between the Center and the New York AG obtained by Chris Horner of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nAttorneys General do sometimes bring on legal fellows or outside help to handle unique cases. But subject-matter experts aren't in-house or chosen with specific intent to promote specific policies, according to Randy Pepple, who was chief of staff for former Washington Republican AG Rob McKenna. In the New York case, a special interest is funding staffers who could wield state law-enforcement power to punish opponents.\n\nThe State Energy and Environmental Impact Center made clear that state AG offices would only qualify for special assistant AGs if they \"demonstrate a need and commitment to defending environmental values and advancing progressive clean energy, climate change, and environmental legal positions,\" according to the August 2017 email to numerous AGs. Mr. Schneiderman's office suggested in its application for the fellows that it \"needs additional attorney resources to assist\" in extracting compensation from fossil-fuel emitters.\n\nThat's exactly what's happening. The New York AG currently has two NYU fellows on staff, according to the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. ...\n\nA lack of government transparency makes this arrangement especially troubling. The New York AG's office, now run by Acting AG Barbara Underwood, declined to comment. ...\n\nThe State Energy and Environmental Impact Center said in a statement that the state offices it works with \"has the authority consistent with applicable law and regulations to accept a Legal Fellow whose salary and benefits are provided by an outside funding source.\" It added that it places workers with AGs who already have a long history of advancing the center's energy priorities. \"The work that NYU law fellows perform is directed by those AGs and not by the Center,\" the Center said.\n\nAt least six state AG offices have already brought on board a special assistant attorney general, according to an August report by Mr. Horner. Besides New York, the jurisdictions include Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. In September, Mr. Horner learned that Illinois and New Mexico have brought on special assistant AGs as well, which was confirmed by the NYU outfit.\n\nThe ethical problems here should be obvious. Private interests are leveraging the police powers of the state to pursue their political agenda, while a government official is letting private interests appear to influence enforcement decisions. None of this is reassuring about the fair administration of justice.\n\nOnline: https://www.wsj.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Denver Post on Colorado electing the country's first openly gay man as governor:\n\nCongressman Jared Polis quietly made history Tuesday night. Early results indicate Colorado voters have made him the first openly gay governor to win election in America.\n\nPolis' sexual orientation was such a non-issue during the campaign that it would be easy to forget that in 2012 the question of whether same-sex couples could be joined by civil unions brought the Colorado General Assembly to a political meltdown. That six years later Polis, his partner Marlon Reis, and their two children are poised to become the first-family of Colorado is remarkable.\n\nWe went from a state where our elected officials struggled to provide even basic rights to same-sex couples to a state where a gay man ran for governor and his sexual orientation wasn't discussed as a political liability. Faith in humanity should be temporarily restored.\n\nDenver Post reporter Nic Garcia documented the decades of ground work it took to get to this point in his late-September analysis: \"From 'Hate State' to Jared Polis: How Colorado led the way for gay, transgender candidates to run for office \u2014 and win.\"\n\nThe story was a remarkable retrospective on how advocates responded to the 1992 passage of Amendment 2, which was a disgusting attempt to make it illegal to protect the LGBT community from discrimination. Garcia told the story of Equality Colorado, the Gay and Lesbian Fund, and One Colorado, rising up and fighting for civil rights in Colorado. And while ultimately it was the U.S. Supreme Court that legalized same-sex marriage across the nation, the grassroots work in Colorado was instrumental in fighting against the hardest thing of all to change: the hearts and minds of the 53 percent of voters who supported Amendment 2.\n\nBut as far as this state and this nation has come, it's important that we take a moment to note the historic significance of a Polis victory because there's much left to be done on the equality front in this nation.\n\nJust before the midterm elections, President Donald Trump's administration proposed rolling back policies put in place under President Barack Obama that provided protections for transgender individuals across many aspects of government. The rules in place ensured that transgender individuals would not face discrimination in gender-related programs like those in health care, schools or other benefits. There's not a single documented case of those new rules causing anyone harm, and yet the rules have been targeted for removal.\n\nSuch political maneuvers reinforce what we already know and simultaneously fear: it is popular and easy for politicians to turn their backs on minority populations who need the protection of the law the most.\n\nIt's a reminder too of the unresolved issues in Colorado. The U.S. Supreme Court punted on the question of whether a small business owner can be compelled by anti-discrimination laws to serve all customers equally even if it violates his or her religious beliefs. That is a true point of conflict that remains unresolved for the owner and customers of Masterpiece Cake Shop in Lakewood.\n\nOnline: https://www.denverpost.com/\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNov. 6\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune on North Ogden, Utah, Mayor Brent Taylor, the Army National Guard major killed in Afghanistan:\n\n\"I am the mayor of a small city with an $18 million budget. Our city council spends two full days in budget workshops and then many hours in subsequent meetings, as they meticulously review each individual line item and make modifications. In contrast, the full UTA Board spent only two total hours on this massive $600 million budget, did not review line item details, and basically rubber-stamped management's proposals.\"\n\n\u2014 North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor in a Jan. 5 commentary in The Salt Lake Tribune\n\nBefore he was killed in an attack in Afghanistan last week, Brent Taylor fought the battle of Utah Transit Authority.\n\nThe North Ogden mayor \u2014 who wore the hats of father, soldier and politician \u2014 couldn't seem to do anything halfheartedly. When Taylor was chosen to represent Weber and Box Elder counties on the UTA board last year, the old guard at the transit agency was so unnerved they tried to deny him the appointment. They claimed it violated nepotism rules because his father was a FrontRunner train operator, and it took a ruling from State Auditor John Dougall to force the board to seat him.\n\nOnce he was on the board, Taylor did something other board members almost never did. He started questioning management's financial decisions. He challenged UTA's plan to borrow $88 million when it was already $2 billion in debt. He questioned why UTA drastically discounted passes for Utah Valley University and Brigham Young University students.\n\nUltimately, he fought to dismantle the board and replace it with a more functional system, and the Utah Legislature did exactly that while he was overseas.\n\nTaylor's tenacity in the face of so much bureaucratic inertia says mountains about a man who was taken too soon from his wife, his seven children, his fellow North Ogdenites and the entire state of Utah.\n\nPolitics for Taylor was about problem solving, not building fiefdoms or protecting turf. It's that attitude that led the Republican to join with Oscar Mata, a former executive director of Weber County Democrats, to form \"Weber County Forward.\" As with UTA, Taylor and Mata were looking to replace the county's three-commissioner government with a better system of checks and balances.\n\nUtah will never know how far Taylor's star would have risen. Three days after his commentary ran in The Tribune in January, he announced that he was taking a yearlong leave from being mayor to serve in Afghanistan. \"Service is really what leadership is all about,\" Taylor said in his Facebook announcement.\n\nTrue enough, but leadership is also about courage. Brent Taylor was never afraid to do what is right.\n\nThe angels better be ready.

Asked if her decision to emigrate had anything to do with the U.S. elections, the answer was a simple, \"No.\"\n\nFor her, the caravan was merely a safety measure. \"If I had come alone with just my daughter, maybe I wouldn't have even made it this far because it is so dangerous,\" she said.\n\nGilberta Raula, 38, from Samala, Guatemala, joined the caravan at the Mexican border because it seemed her best chance to get her 15-year-old daughter out of the country. She left six other children behind, but wants to give her daughter an opportunity to study and work.\n\nShe had only the vaguest idea of the issues surrounding Tuesday's U.S. midterms.\n\nWhat she did know, she said, was that \"the U.S. president has acted badly.\"\n\n\"The way we hear it, he doesn't like anybody,\" she said of Trump. Told that Trump's Republican party had lost control of the U.S. House of Representatives she said, \"Ah, good.\" She, like others, expressed hope that somehow it might help their chances of finding refuge.\n\nFranklin Martinez, a 46-year-old farmworker from La Esperanza, Honduras, said Wednesday he'd probably stay in Mexico City for a while before setting off again northward, to see if things changed following the U.S. elections.\n\n\"Because now it's an anti-immigrant wave,\" Martinez said. \"They're not well-received at the border.\"\n\nExperts agree that the formation of this latest caravan and the others that have set off for the U.S. border before it have far more to do with politics in Central America and current conditions in Mexico, where drug gangs frequently kidnap migrants to demand ransom from their families in the U.S.\n\n\"The first concern is collective security, there is safety in numbers,\" said Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope. \"There is a political logic to this, but it's not exactly aimed at influencing the U.S. elections.\"\n\n\"It brings pressure on the authorities of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador more than anything else,\" he said. \"This sends a message that there is a human rights crisis in the Northern Triangle of Central America.\"\n\nThat view was shared by former Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes, who helped formed the caravan of just a few hundred migrants that set out from Honduras on Oct. 13, before growing to as many as 7,000 at its peak. Fuentes told a news conference at the Mexico City stadium where the migrants are staying that the caravan embarrasses the Honduran government \"because now the world is seeing the tragedy we live with.\"\n\nRaul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the Republican losses in the House suggest that Trump tried to use the migrants \"politically, to depict the caravan as an invasion, and it didn't work.\"\n\nBenitez said the caravan has put as much pressure on Mexico as the United States. After the migrants entered, Mexico came under pressure to accelerate the refugee and asylum process for Central Americans.\n\n\"The caravan shows that Mexico could give more humanitarian treatment to these people,\" said Benitez, \"that Mexico should treat these people the way Mexico wants the U.S. to treat migrants.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Christopher Gascon, the Mexico representative for the International Organization for Migration, estimated there were about 6,000 migrants at the sports complex and maybe another 4,000 in caravans that are working their way through southern Mexico.\n\nBut some migrants had been visiting the organization's tent asking about how they can return home.\n\n\"They perhaps didn't have a very clear idea of what they faced,\" Gascon said. He said the first bus leaving Mexico City to take migrants back to their countries was scheduled to depart Wednesday night with 40 to 50 people.\n\nMeanwhile, other migrants were focusing on the daunting task of reaching the U.S. border and presenting asylum requests there. The U.S. elections occupied only a small part of their thoughts.\n\nNora Torres, a 53-year-old Honduran, anxiously asked a reporter: \"How did he (Trump) do? Did he do well or poorly?\"\n\nTorres had run a small restaurant but closed it because gangs were demanding too much protection money.\n\nFor her, Trump's threats to make attaining asylum even more difficult, of detaining applicants in tent cities and of sending as many as 15,000 U.S. troops to the southern border were hard to understand.\n\n\"The United States needs Hispanic labor, because it is cheaper,\" she said. \"So why do they discriminate against us?\"", "A day after Republicans expanded their Senate majority, the Trump administration on Wednesday finalized a policy change that allows some employers with religious or moral objections to opt out of providing no-cost birth control for female workers.\n\nThe new regulations from several federal agencies apply mainly to religious organizations, nonprofits and small businesses.

Accommodating religious objections has been a sticking point for years.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has broadened narrower exemptions and workarounds that Obama permitted, moves favored by social conservatives who are staunch supporters of the president.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the administration proposed tighter rules on \"Obamacare\" plans that cover abortion.

A trained veterinarian, he ended up selling tamales cooked by his landlady, and it wasn't nearly enough to support his family.\n\nMexican authorities say some 3,230 migrants from the caravan have requested refuge. Alba used to be one of them. But shut in at an immigration center and unable to communicate with his children \u2014 he had no money or cell phone \u2014 he dropped his application and agreed to return to Honduras. Some 480 others have done the same, according to the Mexican government.\n\nHe intends to try again in March \u2014 only this time he will bring his kids.\n\nAccording to data from Mexico's National Immigration Institute, on average 136 Honduran migrants per day have been returned to their country this year. Women and children are taken directly to a shelter in San Pedro Sula. Men go by bus to the Caribbean coastal city of Omoa, and from there are transferred to the San Pedro terminal.\n\nSome days they're met at the bus station by government officials sitting behind a plastic table offering \"solidarity bags\" of basic goods such as rice and dried spaghetti, along with a photo of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and a note saying it comes from his government.\n\nJorge Marquez said they were taking returnees' information to \"follow up with them\" and allow them to benefit from aid that Hernandez has promised in response to the caravan, which at its peak numbered more than 7,000 people.\n\nBut such vows largely ring hollow in this deeply troubled and politically unstable country. In interviews with The Associated Press, most returnees said they faced only a bleak future if they remained in Honduras.\n\nHowever, some, like Gerardo Castillo, a 35-year-old mason, did find encouragement in promises by Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, to give special visas to Central Americans to work in his country.\n\nCastillo, who left two children back home in Olancho and has two more in the United States, complained that immigration agents under the current Mexican administration were detaining migrants who separated from the main caravan, as happened to him. In Lopez Obrador, he sees a possible future in Mexico.\n\n\"On Dec. 1, I will be in Tecun Uman,\" Castillo said, referring to the Guatemalan city across the river border from Mexico.\n\nOlvin Fernando Murillo, 20, made it almost 200 miles (300 kilometers) north of that crossing to the town of Arriaga \u2014 still far from Phoenix, Arizona, where a brother lives.\n\nThat's when his 16-year-old girlfriend got sick.

It requires voters show proof of a residential street address but many voters on the mostly rural reservations only had post office box addresses.\n\nTribal leaders accused the state of trying to suppress Native American votes, with all four tribes banding together after the Supreme Court\u2019s action to put out a statement condemning the \u201csuppressive\u201d voter ID law. Activists said the push for tighter voter ID laws came from a desire to block Native Americans, who largely back Democrats, from casting ballots.\n\nIn the weeks following the court's decision, tribes rushed to print new IDs and create addresses for voters. Since the Supreme Court\u2019s action on Oct. 9th, North Dakota\u2019s four largest tribes printed more than 3,500 new IDs.\n\nThe Spirit Lake Tribe sued the Secretary of State's office for emergency court action to block the law\u2019s implementation on and near reservations after the office repeatedly offered varied and often non-committal answers about whether the new IDs would be accepted at the polls.

Both Carlson and Ingraham did appear.\n\nWhen Hannity and Fox colleague Jeanine Pirro were called to the stage and talked during President Trump's final rally before the elections in Missouri, it was an embarrassment to the network. Fox said on Tuesday that it did not condone such campaign appearances, and called it a distraction from the work of its journalists covering the election.

Add Interest\n\nThe United States is warning other countries not to allow Iranian oil tankers into their territorial waters or ports, saying such access may run afoul of U.S. sanctions and not only incur penalties, but also result in catastrophic economic and environmental damage should an accident occur.\n\nThe State Department reminded the global shipping and insurance industries Wednesday that as part of the Trump administration's \"maximum pressure campaign\" to get Iran to change its behavior, insuring Iranian tankers will now incur penalties under U.S. sanctions reinstated this week.\n\nBrian Hook, the special U.S. representative for Iran, said that as major insurers withdraw coverage from Iranian vessels, Iran will likely turn to domestic insurance companies that will not be able to cover losses for maritime accidents that could run into the billions of dollars.\n\n\"From the Suez Canal to the Strait of Malacca and all choke points in between, Iranian tankers are now a floating liability,\" Hook told reporters. \"Countries, ports and canal operators and private firms should know they will be likely responsible for the costs of an accident involving a self-insured Iranian tanker.\"\n\nThe U.S. \"sincerely hopes\" accidents do not occur, he said, but he noted that an Iranian tanker was involved in an accident in the East China Sea in January that resulted in the loss of the ship and a massive oil spill. He said the U.S. has evidence that Iranian vessels are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by disabling location transponders used to prevent collisions.\n\n\"This tactic is a maritime security threat,\" Hook said. \"These transponders are designed to maximize visibility at sea and turning them off only increases risk of accidents and injuries. Self-insured Iranian tankers engaging in unsafe behavior, with many tons of crude oil on board, is courting environmental and financial disaster.\"\n\nThe sanctions that came into force Monday target Iran's energy, financial and shipping sectors and mark the end of U.S. participation in the 2015 nuclear deal that President Donald Trump withdrew from in May.\n\nThe sanctions aim to further isolate Iran by choking off its main source of revenue \u2014 oil exports \u2014 by imposing sanctions on countries and companies that do not end their imports.\n\nHowever, some trade is still allowed, as the administration has granted waivers for eight major importers to continue buying Iranian petroleum products without penalty for another six months.", "This weekend, more than 100 Disney VoluntEARS laced up their shoes to support City of Hope at this year\u2019s Walk for Hope 2K/5K, raising funds and spirits in the fight against women\u2019s cancers. Disney has a strong legacy of supporting hospitals like City of Hope, providing financial support, hospital visits from our characters, VoluntEARS support, and more. This year, our support took on a whole new dimension, as Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products Chairman Bob Chapek had the honor of serving as Chair of the Walk for Hope.\n\n\u201cWe all know someone who has been impacted by cancer\u2014and some of us are fortunate enough to have had City of Hope in our family\u2019s corner during that fight,\u201d said Bob. \u201cCity of Hope saves lives, brings people together, and gives hope to thousands, and I was thrilled by the opportunity to support them in this meaningful way.\u201d\n\nSupporting the communities we call home is a top priority\u2014and we are committed to building on Walt Disney\u2019s legacy.

That such a brief moment should arouse such curiosity \u2014 and not, say, anything else in the two-plus hours of historical-epic savagery in the 1300s-set film \u2014 was for Pine a sad but telling commentary.\n\n\"The fact that visions of nudity, genitalia, making love are somehow the main attraction,\" said an exasperated Pine in an interview alongside Mackenzie. \"All of us go 'Oo oo!' like fifth graders. Literally, it's like talking to a bunch of 14 year-olds, whereas beheadings and all that kind of violence we're so inured to that we don't even question it.\"\n\nThe irony is that Pine's Bruce \u2014 like his supporting role in Patty Jenkins' \"Wonder Woman\" \u2014 is a negotiation with traditional gender roles, even amid all the blood and guts. Pine plays the 14th century King of Scots, who won Scottish independence from England, not as a one-dimensional warrior but a man riven with internal conflict. Scenes with his wife (played by Florence Pugh) are sensitive and tender.\n\nWhen it's pointed out that his performance \u2014 and even that flash of nudity \u2014 seems intended to deconstruct traditional masculine archetypes, Pine immediately brightens.\n\n\"I've been dying to talk about this stuff all day and we've gotten just myriad, mind-numbing questions about nonsense,\" Pine replies. \"I do think there needs to be a rebalancing of the world. The underlying bass note that we should be hearing is: That is precisely what we're all used to and isn't it kind of interesting that it's so skewed that way, that any notions of tenderness or lovemaking on screen becomes uncomfortable? I think that's probably the masculine and the feminine out of whack in this big, wide universe.\"\n\n\"Outlaw King,\" which debuts on Netflix and in select theaters Friday, is the streaming service's first big swing at that classic big-screen thing: the historical epic. It reunites Pine with Mackenzie two years after \"Hell or High Water,\" a high-water mark for both the Scottish filmmaker and for Pine, who calls the Oscar-nominated neo-Western \"one of my most cherished experiences making anything.\"\n\nWhile they were still making the publicity rounds on \"Hell or High Water,\" Mackenzie slipped Pine the screenplay. When the two sat down in London to talk about it, Pine acknowledges he had some issues with the script but that they quickly found common ground in the desire to make a film not overwhelmed by Scottish nationalism but about, as Pine says, \"a rich man who decides to throw it all away to do something selfless.\"\n\n\"I mean, I pretty much wanted to do it the moment he said 'historical epic,'\" Pine adds.\n\nPine, with his shining blue eyes and a filmography littered with blockbusters, might not be the first actor one would think of for a bloodied, mud-caked Robert the Bruce. But Mackenzie saw something of Bruce in Pine's desperate bank robber in \"Hell or High Water,\" a performance that seemed to unlock Pine's full power as a movie star.\n\n\"There's something about both characters: people struggling, people dealing with uncertainty and not sure whether or not to act,\" Mackenzie says. \"One thing Chris brings brilliantly to the work he does is the capacity to handle that uncertainty and a character who's working his way through things.\"\n\nAfter \"Outlaw King\" premiered to largely poor reviews in Toronto, Mackenzie cut about 20 minutes from the film, which he had rushed to ready for opening night at TIFF. The 52-year-old filmmaker co-wrote and produced the film, which follows a pair of acclaimed releases from the director \u2014 the father-son prison drama \"Starred Up\" and \"Hell or High Water\" \u2014 that likewise analyzed masculinity.\n\n\"It needs to be deconstructed, doesn't it?\" Mackenzie says. \"At this point in time, it feels like masculinity is coming under a lot of questions and it seems appropriate, as males, to be dealing with the subject of masculinity, try to find some nuance in there, try not to demonize or heroize.\"\n\nIn the 65-day shoot in Scotland, Mackenzie and Pine hoped to recapture some of the freewheeling spirit of their quicker, lower-budget production in West Texas. That Bruce was a contemporary of William Wallace has led to frequent comparisons to Mel Gibson's \"Braveheart,\" though Pine says they were seeking to make a very different sort of Scottish epic.\n\n\"How do you make the anti-'Braveheart'? How do you make the movie that hits all the tropes of the genre without \u2014 and I say this with all due respect \u2014 being manipulative?\" Pine says. \"'Braveheart,' I love. But how do you make the non-movie movie?\"\n\nPine saw Bruce \"nebulous\" and \"opaque\" \u2014 someone who could be politician and warrior, hero and coward. \"You cannot pin the guy down,\" he says. Before departing to shake off the day's questions, Pine repeatedly mentioned Yuval Noah Harari's \"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\" as a source of inspiration.\n\n\"To me, the primal aspects of the film are almost like men and women of the mud and of the dirt. It's almost like you see them in this amoebic form. The earth that we come from,\" says Pine. \"We as humans are these dualistic creatures. We're both aggressive and pacifist. We are feminine and masculine.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP", "Bystanders helped save a man's life on Tuesday as he waited to vote in the midterm elections in northwest Washington D.C.\n\nThe 75-year-old man, a custodian at his designated poll site, Barnard Elementary School, was about to enter a voting booth when he experienced cardiac arrest and collapsed, according to Doug Buchanan, chief communications officer of the DC Fire and EMS Department.\n\n\u201cFour bystanders jumped in and said he was having difficulty breathing.

All afternoon I'm David feel good. David thank you we're gonna continue easy she uses coverage right now here I'm John San Suu Kyi alongside Katherine folders on our Washington bureau we thought we maybe have a quiet afternoon capture every presidential marathon not a press conference but you know the nerve of us for thinking that attorney general Jeff Sessions is announcing that he is resigning. At the request of the president summoned we've been tracking for quite some time. A relationship between these two men deadly fraying over the last two years it began when the attorney general announcing he was recusing himself from supervising the Russian investigation of course that is the probe that the president has called a witch hunt for over the last year and it continues to this day we know that after the election sources have been telling ABC news that there's been a party more action. By Bob Mahler and his team of prosecutors looking at many associates of the president his close friend and former political advisor Roger Stone I do wanna go to EBC's Jonathan Karl our chief White House correspondent John you know we even talking others are quite some time. We know this relationship between these two men. I'm has been fraying. But you know as much as we thought this is gonna come right after the election. I don't mean any of us thought it was gonna come just the very next day. I'm a little surprise that it came just after the that the post election press conference indeed but but we we knew this was coming and this has been. An extraordinary series of developments. The refusal which so angered the president really I think he warned single events since he was sworn in angered him more than anything else. The fact that sessions instead of protecting him from a Russian investigation. Was recusing himself and washing his hands on it. Now you we've seen the present and publicly lambasted. The attorney general he's at one point he said I don't even have an attorney general. But I spoke recently John somebody familiar with sessions thinking. Who said that it throughout all of this. The president never wants it directly took those attacks two sessions himself. And he never. Fired sessions he never asked sessions to resign. And what this person told me is that. Through walk out all of it. Session's view was that he was doing the president's agenda pre if winning the president's agenda at the department of justice and if the president ever wanted him to go. During all this year and half almost two years. Of public attacks that all he had to do is call home often ask him to resign and he wouldn't honored in a minute and that's what's happened here are sort of let's be clear. About one thing this is a resignation. He was fired. He was asked to resign Jeff Sessions was fired. And and Johnny just talk about that go. The way this relationship I guess now on the book and that I mean you know is as well as I'd hear from covering this campaign Jeff Sessions was the first on the US senator let alone very big member of the Republican Party to come out and endorsed candidate Donald Trump during the election. Look look John McCain and you know this as well as anybody I I think that you could make a a compelling case. The Donald Trump is not president if not for Jeff Sessions. He was not simply the first. Could mean a first senator do endorsed Donald Trump. He was. Arguably the single most sought after endorsement in a Republican primary I mean. Ted Cruz practically begged for the endorsement and BB before it happened. Because sessions. Represented that wing of the of the Republican Party that was hard line and immigration. And there were you know its crews was going after that vote hard others wears well particularly Cruz. And Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions took sides and it was a critical boost four. Four trump one other thing I I had very important. Going forward about what happens you've you've talked about I'm Matt would occur will now be the acting. Attorney general it's been noted that he is not recused himself from the Russian investigation. But I do not think it is a given John that Matt Whitaker will be the person overseeing the Russian investigation. Whitaker. Before he became the chief of staff says. Senate number of things. Critical. Of the Mueller investigation including one point he or she wrote an op Ed when he was a contributor to CNN. Saying he entirely agreed with the president. That if Bob Muller started investigating the president's finances that would cross a red line rise so so there will be. Some significant questions raised raised now by the newly empowered. A majority in in the house but also by the same Justice Department ethics lawyers that. They did it told sessions that he really had no choice on refusal. Did that that didn't that would occur wolf there's a lot of pressure to recuse themselves as well. Let's get morphin department justice CBC's a cheap White House correspondent Jonathan Karl thank you sir let's go to our Chief Justice correspondent. Pierre Thomas has Pierre I mean as much is what our heads are spinning over here I'm sure a lot more heads are spinning over the Department of Justice right now. They are but they knew this was coming it's just stark when it actually does take place. The attorney general has been under fire from the president for many many months but I had some indication that. The president would either fire Jeff Sessions or that he would resign relatively soon there after the mid terms you saw senator Lindsey Graham. Couple weeks ago several weeks ago so that indicated. Indicating that the president has the right to have the attorney general that he he wanted and also with the senate. Increasing in the number Republicans. This is clearly gave the president a sense of more latitude to feel like he could get an attorney general at some point. Confirmed. But again the Justice Department we'll we'll deal with this a rod was a sign I still think there is there's a bit of a question here. As to whether. Well this time will relinquish overseeing the mall investigation. However in doing some more reporting on the phone on that in the next couple hours. To get some clarity on that but this is a critical moment. In the Mona investigation we do expect more indictments to come and we do expect to this investigation maybe we reaching its and perhaps by the end of the year. And and pier before we let you go and I know you in nineteen all of us here gonna get back to work before world news a talk a little bit about the person that now is leading the Justice Department that would occur he is a former US attorney I believe in the midwest. And he slides into this role as part of the vacancies act where he can be in this position for about 210 days until the president actually appoints and has a new replacement confirmed. That's right he you know he is. Have been a former US attorneys a person who knows there's the rules and regulations of the Justice Department well. As the sexes chief of staff is a person who would be involved in every aspect. The Justice Department's daily activities so this is a person who well versed in law enforcement laurel. Versed in the tradition of the Justice Department so but as Jonathan mentioned some of the past comments he made. Particularly about the special counsel will be looked at very closely and may impact whatever role he has in that regard. Our Chief Justice correspondent Pierre Thomas nineteen tracking it all here and are gonna have much more world news tonight. We'll be watching it there thank you very much sir we appreciate it coming back over to the bureau with Kaplan folders now you know you you what I've been working and in hand on everything. Involving. The vein at present existence and that is Bob Mueller stroke we know it's going on. Talk about a couple of the areas we know other pending right now the biggest one that we know the -- team has been teaming up over the last couple months is the investigation into Iraq. Yourself it's the investigation into Roger Stone who has a you know put out multiple statements on residents to Graham account not saying. And he's done nothing wrong but obviously they're looking into. And the coronation with WikiLeaks and of course the president's statements as it relates to about so you have Roger Stone is an associate. The president he's been by his side for sometime along with them palm can afford his former campaign chairman. Muller's team has been asking arm. Manna for according to our sources specifically about stone as well also it seems like it's only a matter of time for that Ted and another. Even just to investigations here in Washington Catherine's also. The investigations that have grown out of Bob Mueller as investigations up in the southern district of New York. Right exactly so obviously enormous farmed out a lot of these investigations. And in there's a list of them right you know some Michael Collins for example. And I think we'll be seeing more of those out of that relates to trump and an honestly it you see what's going on with with sessions in and Whitaker who won out over see this investigation in a waits to keep some of those aspects of it safe and. It's going to be a really interesting a couple of days we are going to be tracking at all purity ABC news but you know just before we leave you we do want for that we got back again because Jon Karl said. Even though asking for resignation is a fire in this is what the president said we're pleased to announce.

During the campaign Jack someone who went all in for trump for when the first ever to congress. To back the president. Really got under his skin with that surprise decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department any tweeted this he said we are pleased to point Matt winter credits the chief of staff. To be the acting attorney general we wish Jeff Sessions well the president says some will be named soon. We've sort of expected this to come but I don't think anybody was ready for the big bombshell that happened after that. Branded and directed given that this could split outcome. People. Wonder whether the president would wait a little bit there be cooling off period and you might come in the days and and perhaps weeks ahead. But the the president was asked about say the press conference he's he's pretty much dodged a question but there you have it. And religions already on the journalist break this down there's so much you'd into the sort of take it piece by piece. First thing here Justin you saw do you letter from the attorney general they put that out very quickly Jeff Sessions. The loyalists to the end. Yes I think I think that the saving grace for obsessions that didn't happen. In some terribly embarrassing way I mean it was expected he. It's are denied that it was gonna happen today in that press conference and everybody knew Jeff was on the on the chopping block I mean. It that in this this is this isn't it look he's had worse tweets. About. About. I'm getting rid of cabinet members and this is obviously a statement from Jeff Sessions his resignation letter today I think he was. It'll do it the best terms possible concerns are that's right I asked one of Jess Jeff Sessions is closest aides say a few weeks in Dorset if and when the attorney general leaves will he. Will he go more like an Omer assessment with guns a blazing tapes are dropping or will he be. More of a loyalist and is it sessions aide told me he is going to be quiet loyalists to the and we saw no matter Jack. But the big question now is who's gonna oversee the Russian investigation. So it. Right now there appears met Whitaker the acting attorney general will oversee the probe he has the authority to do so he's viewed it appears that he's going to be taking over in the areas that would occur to us and our network he's strictly he's been serving as the chief of staff for the attorney general. He previously served as US attorney in Iowa. He's former tight end for the university Iowa. And he's well liked the Justice Department at the White House has an excellent reputation as a prosecutor. And he's a guy charged him. In just and he is going to be subject this is some pretty intense scrutiny. Right even in his position as acting director which the president convenient to he has been critical publicly of the Muller probe in the past effect a year ago on CNN hero. How bad Graham to run out and saying that once they get into the financials. It has gone too far so these are even out there. Sort of criticizing this investigation which some could say hey look here. You eat you're not supposed to be doing that and Democrats are warning about that take a look at the surprised by senate to a democratic leader Chuck Schumer when he heard the news today. Your vote. Hope. Well I'd say this I've just heard the news. But I'd say this. Protecting. Mueller. And his investigation. Is Paramount. It would create a constitutional crisis if this were pre loot. To ending or greatly limiting. The Mahler. Investigation. Any attorney general whether this one or another one. Should not be able to interfere with the Mahler investigation in any way but we would hope. If there's a constitutional crisis. That. Our Republican colleagues would join us in thwarting the president from creating a crisis. Democrats are already talking about whether or not this is a sign that changes afoot at the Russia probe which is gone on now for over a year. And just moments before the president dropped the news was at the Justice Department here's what he had to say. But what he could do to them Russian investigation the next few weeks take a listen. From. The fact that. People Paris to jobs. From the fact that they have very good friends on the other side like really good friends like Coby. Who by the way lie and leaked. And was a leak classified information nothing happened there. It might perhaps maybe something's happening that I don't know that I stay away from it but you know and I do. I let me just go line. There wasting a lot of money but I let it go on. Because. I wanna do that but you're right I could end it right now I could say that investigation. Is over here. But it's it's really. It's a disgrace frankly and it's an embarrassment to our country. I so Jack what's your bottom line I'm what we know so far will the Russian investigation be changed any way affected any way by this. Shift came right now you know special counsels and commenting on the dismissal of obsessions or or of the new he's particular unlawful special special counsels can continue doing its work. And your words Nancy Howe plays out to see if the justice promulgate more heavy handed about it management of the probe it's expected that that. Global prepped go on through the you know perhaps the end of the year we might see report. And in some sort of loose ends tied up in that probes may be nearing. Completion anyway. And so this interim period may get us two. A report for a conclusion or something that submitted. And we know the president is contemplating some written responses to Bob Mueller we know they're trying to move that's all along meanwhile though the president was revel in a good bit today. In the political outcome of last night he quickly is something big spin on this let's take a little bit of who listen to the president earlier in case you missed. It's more than an hour long press conference after last since mid terms. He told me the other day that you are an open book so I think I am an open. So point blank Democrats. Go after your tax returns will you try to blocked outerwear you. Along I. As I've told you there are under they have been for a long time they're extremely complex people wouldn't understand it's very. Complex instrument and I think that. People wouldn't understand it but if I were finished with the audit. I would have an open mind to it I would say that but an order doing during the audit and and really no lawyer. Even from the other side they say often violence. When you're under you don't have you don't subject it. To that you get it done and then you release it. So when that happens if that happens I would certainly have an open mind to such levies if the audit is still on you'll not. Turn over the tax return elect went under and I nobody would nobody turns over return when it's under. Our program the president drawing a line in the sand. Ahead of what is going to be an onslaught just saying democratic investigations. Sort of got a little bit of flavor them yeah we've heard that one before that that then they're under audit the new rules and you answer today is people want understand the risks are all too complicated at all and it was also unclear to me that he understands what subpoena power actually is what what what is headed his way I'm these committees I think he does and I think he. I look plans saying this morning I think he knows they're coming after his taxes he knew everything he can defining I think we're gonna see. Unparalleled. Sort of you know enough for an unparalleled affront to congressional oversight of this presidency. There's some question about whether or not he can control. Whether the taxes are handover and if he has any way to avoid that from happening he's going to use it and he's going to fight. And one of the people that will determine just how far Democrats go in digging into Trump's personal finances is Nancy Pelosi she sort of be presumed. Front runner if you need they. Democrats speaker of the house yours with the president had to say about her. After he received a call from the democratic leader last night Nicholas. Perhaps. It looks like I would think speaker. Nancy Pelosi. And and I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard and she's worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished. Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering. For the American people. And just as soon as the president stepped off the stage here's what Nancy Pelosi had to say about that same conversation. Last night I had that conversation with president on about how we could work together on the issues that came up was part of that was of people in ten. Building infrastructure of America and I hope that we can achieve that he talked about it during his campaign. And really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office but. That issue has not been part of an issue and congress of the United States over the years we've been able to work together. Regionally. Let's bring our political director Rick Klein who has been following this story all night long let the rest of us Rick great to heavier selling New York election headquarters. Isn't it nice we have little glimmers of bipartisanship. Today for one day how long do you think that's. Alas it already ended guys instant check your watch I mean I think it was never gonna happen in all seriousness though I do think they'll be opportunities for president crumple like the scrambled and act. He's using I don't know where we're talking Nancy case we maybe I'll find something a one off here as when he's not gonna attack her. Again the next day fight those very choosing to me and policies comments today how restrained she was she. Was making clear that she is not gonna send Democrats out on a bunch of fishing expedition she wants the rain in the investigations. Let the evidence. Dictate where they go she's already camping down any talk about impeachment. I she's made clear to her members they wanna see what Mueller produces before they have any kind of action around the Russian peace because there's a lot of Democrats who just want to move in move fast we know there are. Dozens and maybe more than fifty or sixty subpoenas ready to fly from committee chairs they'll be installed in January Nancy Pelosi is gonna have to restrain that if she is indeed the house speaker. She's gonna try to restrain it but they'd no doubt she's going to be pressed from the left wing of her party. And here's how well she answered our Mary Bruce. Rick on just what that could mean with respect to cooperating with the president Nicholas. He made clear that if Democrats launched investigations that any hopes for bipartisanship. Is off do you have any concerns that these investigations could jeopardize your opportunities to legislate. They do not intend to abandon. Relinquish our responsibility. As article one the first batch of governance in our responsibility. For accountability. For oversight and the rest. That this doesn't mean they go looking for five but it means that we see. Up the need to go forward we've now. So Rick what are the top list of investigations he you've been hearing are coming down the pike. And India how how much you think it's an upset the president. Weldon the trump tax returns are are kind of that is victory gold pot sitting there somewhere that's that they've had they're all manner of reasons that you could see committees want to get at that. A lot of talk about the so all the monuments clause which prohibits the president. From making any money off of off of any kind of a foreign nation a lot of talk about what those states are trump hotels are like. Any kind of action around in the business relationship of the president and his family. We're and in any potential enrichment that they may gain from official actions is going to be an assured me talk about even that the location of the new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington. Bid potentially making only dozens of different directions any. Of the other than the scandals the kind of fly by ass regarding cabinet members all of that is potentially on the table once you've got the subpoena power in the US congress and I think you guys are right to the president. Doesn't seem to fully comprehend this on his responses on Carl what it means that subpoena power he may never had a boss before. Who could tell it what to do. And now he's gonna have an independent branch of government that's gonna have an actual say in and in compel him under penalty of legal action to produce documents for members of his administration to appear before congress in sworn testimony. That makes this a new date whatever is said about any battleground districts and where's the president's party did well in senate races gubernatorial races. Fixed fact that Democrats control the house come January that is a sea change in American politics the president of hasn't even begun. To adjust to. It sure is Rick and before we let you go give us your top winds from the night we know all the results are laid out. In the note to an ABC news that com we were just seen some of the graphics there on the house side did net gain at least a 28 seats for Democrats so far. Big night for Republicans in the senate. Yeah I can't think of a more perfect way to distill the divisions of this nations and the talk about. Be divided message that was satin you had of voters in very red parts of the country including a much a senate races and some governors races say you know what. We like trumpets of we like what that means and that means that they're going to be more Republican senators by the way to confirm. A replacement for Jeff Sessions a little more flexibility for the president as a result of that patted Republican majority at the scene time. It was a Republican wiped out in the suburbs you can travel from outside new York and Washington DC and Richmond in Miami and Chicago and Dallas and Houston Salt Lake City in Los Angeles. And all of those places you had a Republican representative who no longer make may have a job as a result of this election. Though democratic blue wave hitting those folks and and sending unmistakable message to those parts of the country that their preferences no longer have Republican leadership because they're a long time for to Republicans. To recover those so called country club Republican districts as a direct result evolved from. All right a new chapter in Washington we know you're headed back this way Rick thank you so much for that and we'll see a very shortly down here back in the briefing room. Justin there are number of historic races that are still out. Right now those two governors' races we've been following really interesting right you've been tracking this very closely eight inbound and in Florida Illinois attorney Gil and curriculum is this is Florida. Stacey Abrams in Georgia two very close races as you know in fact potentially going to recounts in both places that bring in Victor can go down in Florida he's. Off following that close senate race and governor's race Victor thanks so much for joining us it's pretty incredible down there were doing could be headed for recounts again. Well floor will always keeps it interesting guys less than an hour ago senator bill Wilson's campaign tweeted Jing. Looks like we're headed for a recount. All this is a razor thin margin we're talking about here less than half a percentage point you know we are headed for that recounts are here's what's gonna happen next. All Ford is 67 counties we'll be checking their tallies. The Nelson campaign has team members all throughout the state at this point in there is a deadline for this November 10 at noon so there they give a few days for this recount here. Senator Nelson was going force fourth term meanwhile the Rick Scott campaign not mincing any words about this. A spokesman for Rick Scott said the race is over it's a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career. He is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exist. The Nelson campaign meanwhile saying that the small difference in the overall vote here was despite being the huge discrepancy here in the amount that each camp spent. Rick Scott spent some 68 point eight million dollars to Nelson's 27 point nine million these candidates are so different everything to gun control to health care. Rick Scott was president Trump's guy but just this afternoon president. Trump said that. Wilson was not easy to beat that he basically declared Rick's. The winner this a mean that we have Republican senator Marco Rubio Republican senator Rick Scott and of course now. Governor rod sent us. Have picked her bit of a red wave hit Florida last night fascinating results thank you so much for your reporting there and it looked like Justin from days have also older voters in Florida. We're the ones that decided. Those two key race is very skittish of change and Republicans were effective in branding their Democrats Medicare policies picture I think so many Americans can relate to this is that you watching these these numbers come back and you're just. Amazed by how Ashley down the middle. How close you can have eight million people voting and it's just separated from a couple doesn't play truly divided. And and and an incredibly close and race was a big factor in both of those governors races as well it was something I heard on the ground both in Georgia and in Florida court the past few weeks and before that Victor ago. One more time to you Victor what it what did you see. The impact of race is being in that tight governor's race and where things stand right now back count. Well that was another nailed by a here and being a very very contentious and heated race here between Desantis and Tallahassee mayor injured guilin. Of course Desantis was Trump's guy all along we've all seen that campaign. Where Rhonda six assists playing around this kids having them build a fake wall and he was reading them presidential vote. The art of the deal president trump of course campaigning for Desantis right here Florida. And going so far Astor called kill them. They still cold feet. And a of radical socialist. This is a very close case like Gil did concede even before ABC news was able to call this race he spoke to be heartbroken crowd there in Tallahassee. But he did vow to continue fighting saying quote I can guarantee you this I am not going anywhere that's. All right he's a fighter potentially a candidate for higher profits on the lines certainly a rising star on the left Victor can know in Florida forced into so much for that and we should say that the Georgia governor's rates as we follow very closely here and ABC news live is also razor thin 85000 votes mentioned did are between Stacy Abrams and Brian camp we know that Abrams team thinks they can do it within the margin it's enforcer run off. In the next few days we see the numbers here now on that would. Mean voters in Georgia could have to go back to the polls again you know the president called it today though he said he was out there battling Oprah and he won and you know he gave him off. He gave himself a lot of my and its predecessor Barack Obama always actually well. Well there was no shortage of celebrations last night on both sides of the aisle a lot of shining moments for Republicans and for Democrats and many of these key states. We put together a little highlights real four AF will leave you with that we'll see you next time here. Other than serving our nation in uniform. The opportunity to serve as the 46. Governor of the great state of art out. Is the greatest professional honor my life. We recognize that you know. We didn't waste and I am we didn't win his. But I want Jonathan just did and it's. That's what we believe me still hold true today cars. Part hearing hours. Things and aren't giving me your. Farm is inspired him. I'm is hopeful. As I've ever been. In my life and tonight's loss. Does nothing to diminish the way that I feel about taxes for this country. Paul was what you do you. I'm me. It's important. And we have proven that every single day Jordan.

When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, \"That's enough!\" and a female White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement accusing Acosta of \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\" calling it \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nThe interaction between Acosta and the intern was brief, and Acosta appeared to brush her arm as she reached for the microphone and he tried to hold onto it. \"Pardon me, ma'am,\" he told her.\n\nAcosta tweeted that Sanders' statement that he put his hands on the aide was \"a lie.\"\n\nCNN said in a statement that the White House revoked Acosta's press pass out of \"retaliation for his challenging questions\" Wednesday, and the network accused Sanders of lying about Acosta's actions.\n\n\"(Sanders) provided fraudulent accusations and cited an incident that never happened. This unprecedented decision is a threat to our democracy and the country deserves better,\" CNN said. \"Jim Acosta has our full support.\"\n\nJournalists assigned to cover the White House apply for passes that allow them daily access to press areas in the West Wing. White House staffers decide whether journalists are eligible, though the Secret Service determines whether their applications are approved.\n\nThe post-midterm election news conference marked a new low in the president's relationship with journalists.\n\n\"It's such a hostile media,\" Trump said after ordering reporter April Ryan of the American Urban Radio Networks to sit down when she tried to ask him a question.\n\nThe president complained that the media did not cover the humming economy and was responsible for much of the country's divided politics. He said, \"I can do something fantastic, and they make it look not good.\"\n\nHis exchanges with CNN's Acosta and NBC News' Peter Alexander turned bitterly personal, unusual even for a forum where the nature of their jobs often put presidents and the press at odds.\n\n\"I came in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions, and I had people jumping out of their seats screaming questions at me,\" said Trump, who talked for nearly 90 minutes despite the run-ins with reporters.\n\nAcosta asked Trump why the caravan of migrants was emphasized as an issue in the just-concluded midterm races, and he questioned Trump's reference to the caravan as an invasion.\n\n\"You should let me run the country,\" Trump said. \"You run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\"\n\nAfter Acosta asked about the investigation of Russia's involvement in the 2016 election, Trump tried to turn to Alexander, but Acosta continued to ask questions.\n\n\"CNN should be ashamed of itself having you work for them,\" the president said to Acosta. \"You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN. The way you treat Sarah Sanders is horrible. The way you treat other people is horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.\"\n\nAlexander came to his colleague's defense. \"I've traveled with him and watched him,\" Alexander said. \"He's a diligent reporter who busts his butt like the rest of us.\"\n\n\"I'm not a big fan of yours, either,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"I understand,\" Alexander said, attempting to ask a question. Acosta stood back up and noted the explosive devices that were recently sent to CNN and some of the president's political opponents.\n\n\"Just sit down,\" Trump said. \"When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.\"\n\nCNN said Trump's attacks on the press have gone too far.\n\n\"They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American,\" CNN tweeted after the exchange. \"While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.\"\n\nIn announcing Acosta's suspension, Sanders said, \"The fact that CNN is proud of the way their employee behaved is not only disgusting, it is an example of their outrageous disregard for everyone, including young women, who work in this administration.\"\n\nThe White House Correspondents Association released a statement Wednesday saying it \"strongly objects to the Trump Administration's decision to use U.S. Secret Service security credentials as a tool to punish a reporter with whom it has a difficult relationship. Revoking access to the White House complex is a reaction out of line to the purported offense and is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe WHCA called on the White House to \"immediately reverse this weak and misguided action.\"\n\nDuring the news conference, Trump also turned on reporter Yamiche Alcindor of PBS' \"NewsHour.\" She said that \"on the campaign trail, you called yourself a nationalist. Some people saw that as emboldening white nationalists.\" Trump interrupted her, calling it a racist question.\n\nAlcindor pressed on: \"There are some people who say the Republican Party is seen as supporting white nationalists because of your rhetoric. What do you say to that?\"\n\n\"What you said is so insulting to me,\" he said. \"It's a very terrible thing you said to me.\"\n\nAlcindor moved on to a different topic. Later, via Twitter, she said that she has interviewed white nationalists who say they are more excited by Trump than they have been about other presidents. \"Even if President Trump doesn't intend it, some see him as directly appealing to the racists,\" she wrote.\n\nTrump told Ryan, of American Urban Radio Networks, repeatedly to sit down when she attempted to ask Trump about accusations of voter suppression.

Trump's outsider bid continued to build momentum in the weeks leading up to the endorsement as the real estate mogul captured primary and caucus victories in three of the first four contests.\n\n\u201cI told Donald Trump, this isn\u2019t a campaign, this is a movement,\u201d Sessions said in a speech in Alabama announcing the endorsement.\n\nMar. 3, 2016 -- Sessions named chair of Trump's national security advisory council\n\nTrump appointed Sessions to an official position on his campaign team, naming the Alabama senator the head of his national security advisory council.\n\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to recommend and facilitate discussions among exceptional and experienced American military and diplomatic leaders to share insight and advice with Donald Trump, regardless of their political views,\" Sessions said in a release announcing the appointment.\n\nApril 27, 2016 -- Sessions and Russian ambassador attend Trump speech\n\nIn a moment that would later be heavily scrutinized, Sessions attended a foreign policy address given by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. Also in attendance -- Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. This year, as Kislyak's interactions with members of the administration -- including Sessions and national security adviser Michael Flynn -- became public, the White House pushed back on suggestions Kislyak met with Trump at the speech.\n\n\"To state they met or that a meeting took place is disingenuous and absurd,\" a senior White House official said in March 2017.\n\nJuly 18, 2016, and Sept. 8, 2016 -- Sessions meets with Kislyak\n\nSessions met with Kislyak on at least two occasions last year. The first came during an event at the Republican National Convention hosted by the Heritage Foundation where the Russian ambassador was among a small group of diplomats with whom the Alabama senator spoke. The second was a meeting in Sessions' Washington, D.C., office that was also attended by staff members.\n\nThough the Department of Justice would later categorize the meetings as routine, given Sessions' responsibilities as a senator, the encounters would play a role in Sessions' recusal as attorney general from all investigations related to Russian interference in the presidential election.\n\nNov. 18, 2016 -- Trump nominates Sessions to be attorney general\n\nTo the displeasure of some Democrats who questioned Sessions' record on civil rights and failed 1986 nomination to serve as a U.S. district court judge, Trump tapped Sessions to serve as his attorney general.\n\nJan. 10, 2017 -- Confirmation hearing comments\n\nAlex Brandon/AP Photo\n\nSessions was questioned by Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., about what he would do as attorney general if evidence emerged that members of the Trump campaign communicated with Russia.\n\n\"Sen. Franken, I'm not aware of any of those activities,\" Sessions said. \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn't have -- did not have communications with the Russians, and I'm unable to comment on it.\"\n\nMar. 2, 2017 -- Recusal from campaign-related investigations\n\nAfter Sessions' meetings with Kislyak became public, he maintained that he did not answer Franken dishonestly because the discussions came in his capacity as a senator and not as a representative of the campaign.\n\nTrump himself later said in a statement that Sessions \"could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\"\n\nAs pressure built, however, Sessions announced that he would not participate in any ongoing or future inquiries into matters related to the presidential election.\n\n\"Let me be clear: I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,\" Sessions told reporters. \"And the idea that I was part of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries to the Russian government are false.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump said he had \"total\" confidence in Sessions and didn't believe the attorney general should recuse himself. On March 3, Trump reiterated his earlier sentiments about Sessions' intentions and said that the \"narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win.\"\n\nJune 5, 2017 -- Travel ban frustration\n\nTrump's frustration over his stalled plan to limit travel and immigration from a number of Middle Eastern and African countries boiled over as he unleashed a series of tweets seemingly blaming the Justice Department -- charged with defending the ban in court -- with the revised order's \"watering down.\"\n\nThe Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nThe Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017\n\nJune 6, 2017 -- Sources say Sessions recently offered to resign\n\nABC News learns that Sessions had recently offered to resign as Trump continued to express frustration with the attorney general's decision to recuse himself from the election-tampering investigation.\n\nDuring the day's White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer, in response to questioning on whether Trump had confidence in Sessions, said, \"I have not had that discussion with [President Trump].\"\n\nJune 13, 2017 -- Sessions testifies in front of Senate committee\n\nMichael Reynolds/EPA\n\nSessions testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and issued a sweeping denial of any personal involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"I have never met with, or had any conversation with, any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States,\" Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump, apparently, was pleased with his performance. Principal deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the president \"wasn\u2019t able to watch much of [Sessions' testimony] ... but what he did see, what he heard, he thought that Attorney General Sessions did a very good job, and in particular, was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nJuly 19, 2017 -- Trump slams Sessions in interview\n\nTrump had a sit-down interview with The New York Times, during which he launched into a blistering rebuke of Sessions and his decision to recuse himself from anything relating to any presidential campaigns, including, most notably, the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else,\" Trump said in the interview.\n\nWhen asked whether Sessions gave the president a \"heads up\" before the recusal, Trump said: \"Zero.\"\n\n\"So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have \u2014 which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, \u201cThanks, Jeff, but I can\u2019t, you know, I\u2019m not going to take you.\u201d It\u2019s extremely unfair, and that\u2019s a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who\u2019s a deputy,\" Trump said, referring to Rod Rosenstein.\n\nJuly 20, 2017 -- Sessions responds, says he's staying\n\nAsked today for his reaction to Trump's comments, Sessions maintained that he will remain at his position \"as long as that is appropriate.\"\n\n\"We in this Department of Justice will continue every single day to work hard to serve the national interest, and we wholeheartedly join in the priorities of President Trump,\" he said at a news conference today.\n\n\"I have the honor of serving as Attorney General, it's something that goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself,\u201d he added. \u201cWe love this job, we love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201d\n\nJuly 24, 2017 -- Trump calls Sessions \"beleaguered\"\n\nTrump posted a tweet that included an apparent slight against Sessions, writing: \"So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\"\n\nSo why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017\n\nSessions did not immediately respond to the tweet.\n\nJuly 25, 2017 -- Trump slams Sessions again on Twitter\n\nFor the second day in a row, the president aired his frustration with his attorney general and took aim again at his Democratic rival.\n\n\"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!\" Trump wrote in a tweet.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017\n\nSessions did not immediately respond to the tweet.\n\nLater that day, during a joint news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Trump said that he is \"disappointed\" with Sessions.\n\nTrump said that he wants Sessions \"to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before at a very important level.\"\n\n\"We will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell,\" he added.\n\nJuly 26, 2017 -- A meeting at the White House, but without Trump\n\nSessions went to a meeting at the White House that the president did not attend. In a morning tweet Trump slammed his attorney general for not replacing the acting FBI director.\n\n\"Why didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!\" Trump wrote in two tweets.\n\nWhy didn't A.G.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017\n\nThat meeting came shortly after a U.S. official told ABC News that Sessions' chief of staff, Jody Hunt, recently informed White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that Sessions has no plans to resign from his post, despite growing pressure from Trump.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP, FILE\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders later told reporters that Trump has \"been very clear\" about his feelings on Sessions.\n\n\"He's obviously disappointed but also wants the attorney general to continue to focus on the things that the attorney general does. He wants him to lead the Department of Justice. He wants to do that strongly. He wants him to focus on things like immigration, leaks and a number of other issues,\" Sanders said.\n\nShe went on, \"You can be disappointed in someone but still want them to continue to do their job and that's where they are.\"\n\nNov. 7, 2018 -- Sessions resigns at Trump's request\n\nSessions submitted his resignation letter to Trump after the president asked him to do so.\n\n\"Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Jusitce every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\" Sessions wrote. \"I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.\"", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the front-runner to become Speaker of the House in the 116th Congress following Tuesday\u2019s midterm election victory, said she is confident she will win her caucus\u2019s support.\n\n\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

It means if we see the need to go forward, we will. That's the work of our committees.

The fact is we like to work together so our legislation will be bipartisan.\u201d\n\nWhile President Trump indicated today that he does not want to release his tax returns because he claims they are under continuous audit, Pelosi said it\u2019ll be up to the committees to chart a course of oversight and when to use subpoena power.\n\n\u201cI'm a believer in the committee system.

Add Interest\n\nSessions was frequently in the spotlight throughout the turbulent first several months of Donald Trump's presidency, from a hotly contested confirmation hearing to his recusal from the Russia investigation in March 2017.\n\nHis resignation was announced one day after the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Sessions:\n\nName: Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III\n\nAge: 70 (born Dec. 24, 1946)\n\nHometown: Selma, Alabama, which had a notable role in the civil rights movement. Earlier this year, Sessions reflected on the historic nature of his birthplace. \"Certainly I feel like I should have stepped forward more,\" he said, reflecting on the civil rights struggle.\n\nFamily: He has three children and six grandchildren. He was born to Abbie and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions. His father owned a general store in Hybart, Alabama, and a farm equipment dealership.\n\nWhat he used to do:\n\nSessions was a senator from Alabama was first elected in 1996 and served as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. From 1975 to 1977 he was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama and from 1981 to 1993 was the U.S. attorney for the district. In 1994 he was elected Alabama's 44th attorney general.\n\nHe supported President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cut packages, the war in Iraq and a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He has opposed most major Democratic legislation, including the stimulus bill, the Affordable Care Act and the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\n\nIn August 2016, he told CNN's Alisyn Camerota he thinks the Clinton Foundation should be fully investigated because he thinks Hillary Clinton used her position as secretary of state to garner funds for the foundation. During his Senate hearing last month, he vowed that if he's confirmed as attorney general, he will recuse himself from any matters related to her.\n\nWhat you might not know about him:\n\nHe was ranked by The National Journal in 2007 as the fifth-most-conservative U.S. senator.\n\nHe worked as a lawyer in Russellville and Mobile, where he still lives. He was a captain for the Army Reserve in the 1970s.\n\nAs an Eagle Scout, Sessions was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. The Scouts' motto, \"Be prepared,\" is on his desk in his Senate office.\n\nKey life and career moments:\n\nSessions earned a B.A. from Huntingdon College in Montgomery in 1969 and a J.D. from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1973.\n\nHe was one of only three senators to vote against additional funding for the Veterans Affairs medical system. He opposed the bill because of cost concerns and indicated that Congress should instead focus on \"reforms and solutions that improve the quality of service and the effectiveness that is delivered.\"\n\nHe has taken a strong stance against any immigration reform and believes in the need for a stronger controls on the border with Mexico.\n\nHe is anti-abortion, is a major opponent of same-sex marriage and is known for the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act, which would reauthorize funding through 2018 to help victims of child abuse. Sessions said, \"There is no higher duty than protecting our nation's children.\"\n\nAbout his 1986 confirmation hearing:\n\nIn 1986, Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions to be a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.\n\nHe was not confirmed. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10-8 against recommending Sessions to the whole Senate.\n\nFour lawyers who had worked with Sessions said he had made racist comments. One said he had called the NAACP \"un-American\" and \"communist-inspired.\" Another said Sessions had called him \"boy\" and told him to be \"careful what you say to white folks.\" Sessions denied the allegations.\n\nOne lawyer said Sessions told him he thought the KKK was \"OK until I found out they smoked pot.\" Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized.\n\nIn his Senate confirmation hearings last month, Sessions said, \"This caricature of me in 1986 was not correct. I conducted myself honorably and properly at that time ... I did not harbor the animosities ... that I was accused of. I did not.\"\n\nAbout his 2017 confirmation hearing:\n\nJeff Sessions was sworn in at the White House in early February as the U.S. attorney general.\n\nThe Senate approved Trump's nominee by a largely party-line vote of 52-47. One Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, joined Republicans in confirming Sessions.\n\nSessions' nomination as the head of the Department of Justice drew significant criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups. Critics cited concerns about past allegations of racism, his record on civil rights and immigration and his 1986 hearing during his highly contentious confirmation hearings in January.\n\nHis relationship with Trump:\n\nSessions was the first sitting senator to endorse then\u2013presidential candidate Trump, in February 2016, before Super Tuesday and the Alabama primary.\n\n\"I told Donald Trump this isn't a campaign. This is a movement,\" Sessions said at a rally in Madison, Alabama. Sessions said that \"we don't get everything we want\" in a candidate but that \"at this time, in my best judgment, at this time in America's history, we need to make America great again.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images, FILE\n\nTrump named Sessions the head of his national security advisory council during the campaign, and shortly after winning the presidency in November, nominated him to be attorney general.\n\nThough Trump said he had confidence in Sessions just days before he recused himself from the Russia investigation, he criticized the department in June over changes to his travel ban, blaming the department for the \u201cwatering down\u201d of the revised version.\n\nThe relationship between the two men is said to have deteriorated since Sessions' recusal and ABC News learned on June 6 that Sessions recently offered to resign.\n\nHis involvement in the Russia investigation:\n\nSessions attended a foreign policy address given by Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. in April 2016 during the campaign. Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak was also at the address, but the Justice Department has denied that Sessions spoke privately with the Ambassador that day.\n\nSessions did, however, meet with Kislyak on two separate occasions in 2016 -- once in July and once in September -- which the Department of Justice later categorized as routine meetings for Sessions in his role as a senator.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January 2017, Sessions told Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, that he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d When it became public that he had met with Kislyak, he said the meetings were a part of his duties as a senator and not related to the campaign.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images,FILE\n\nAfter pressure mounted over his meetings with Kislyak, Sessions recused himself from any ongoing or future investigations into matters related to the presidential election.\n\n\"Let me be clear: I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign,\" said Sessions to reporters in early March. \"And the idea that I was part of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries to the Russian government are false.\"\n\nWhen former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June, he told the committee that the FBI had information in February that would have made it \u201cproblematic\u201d for Sessions to continue leading the investigation into Russian influence over the 2016 election.\n\nHis resignation\n\nSessions announced he was resigning in an undated letter to the president.\n\n\"At your request, I am submitting my resignation,\" he wrote to Trump.\n\n\"Since the day I was honored to be sworn in as Attorney General of the United States, I came to work at the Department of Jusitce every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\" Sessions wrote. \"I have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.\"\n\nTrump tweeted that Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, would serve as acting attorney general.\n\nSessions Resignation Letter by ABC News Politics on Scribd\n\nPreviously, Trump would not say whether Sessions -- who he has repeatedly criticized throughout his tenure -- would be safe in his job after the midterm elections.\n\n\"I just would love to have him do a great job,\" Trump told Bloomberg News on Aug. 30.", "A 21-year-old New York man was arrested on hate crime charges tied to the repeated theft of LGBT rainbow flags from in front of a church, a series of crimes that the openly gay pastor called \"unnerving\" for him and his congregation.\n\nThe suspected thief, Ronald Tyler Witt, was arrested around 8:05 p.m. Tuesday at his home in Sayville, New York, less than four blocks from the Sayville Congregational United Church of Christ, according to the Suffolk County Police Department.\n\nWitt was arrested on suspicion of six counts of petit larceny as a hate crime and is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday at the First District Court in Central Islip, on New York's Long Island, police said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Witt had hired an attorney.\n\nRev.

Sometimes there just a dumb thing that people do, but repeated over and over it begins to feel like there's a targeting going on here and there's a message.\"\n\nHe said the stolen flags were displayed on the church lawn next to an American flag and a prisoner of war flag, which were not touched.\n\nThe pastor said that after the second flag was stolen, he put up a sign in front of the church reading, \"You destroyed our welcoming Rainbow Flag twice. It WAS an act of fear. It IS an act of hate. Do you realize that? IT WAS NOT KIND. IT IS HURTFUL. Instead of doing it again, talk with us. We will talk with you.

His energetic campaign fueled speculation for months that O'Rourke could use an upset win, or even a close loss, to launch a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nSuch suggestions will surely intensify, no small feat considering he already has been the subject of dozens of glowing national media profiles labeling O'Rourke as \"Kennedy-esque\" and comparing him favorably to a young Barack Obama.\n\nHis bio includes roots as a punk rock guitarist with enough current street cred to pull off such stunts as skateboarding across a Whataburger parking lot.\n\n\"There already had been Democrats in Washington talking about him as a presidential candidate, and there is more talk about it today because what we saw last night was so impressive,\" Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said Wednesday. \"He made it clear last night that we will be hearing from him again.\"\n\nO'Rourke insists he's not interested in seeking any other political office for now and plans to return to his remote hometown of desert mountain vistas and mouthwatering tacos on the Texas-Mexico border. Asked at the start of his campaign what his post-politics life might look like, O'Rourke said he could perhaps get a certificate to teach English or \"try and write something.\"\n\nStill, his concession speech Tuesday night made him sound like a political star who is still rising.\n\nHe dropped a joyously defiant expletive on national television and promised to make \"sure that whatever we have created ... leads to something far greater than we have today and that all of us, every single one of us, continue to believe and make possible the greatness of the United States of America.\"\n\n\"We will see you down the road,\" he told thousands gathered at a minor league baseball stadium, drawing thunderous cheers and cries of \"Beto! Beto! Beto!\"\n\nRepublican strategist Joe Brettell said a losing Senate race isn't typically a springboard for a presidential run, but that O'Rourke would be a natural fit for a position like Democratic National Committee chairman. Such a perch would allow him to continue to interact with his considerable donor base while building his national profile.\n\n\"The Democrats nationally have a huge problem: They are old, they are largely uninspiring or retreads,\" Brettell said. \"And they suddenly have a fresh face who has ignited passion, but also action, at a rate we haven't seen in years.\"\n\nTexas still hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, the nation's longest streak of futility by a political party. But, in his victory speech in Houston, even Cruz saluted O'Rourke, saying that the Democrat \"worked tirelessly\" and that millions across the state were \"inspired by his campaign.\"\n\nDespite internal polling suggesting he'd win by 7-plus points, Cruz edged O'Rourke by about a third of that \u2014 and only after President Donald Trump took the once unthinkable step of traveling to the country's largest conservative state and embracing a former bitter rival just two weeks before Election Day.\n\nCruz campaign manager Jeff Roe said O'Rourke's calls for gun control, universal health care and impeaching Trump were too liberal for Texas, but added, \"I respect him and his team and what they did\" and \"honor the campaign that they ran.\"\n\nO'Rourke visited all 254 Texas counties, drawing larger-than-expected crowds even in fiercely conservative, rural areas that Democrats abandoned decades ago. He said he wanted to appeal to Democrats and Republicans alike, Trump supporters, first-time voters and independents \u2014 but also refused to soften deeply liberal positions on social issues.\n\nThe hard-fought Senate race helped prompt 8.3-plus million Texans to cast ballots \u2014 the state's highest ever midterm turnout \u2014 and O'Rourke raised more money than any Senate candidate in history. He also provided considerable coattails around the state, helping Democrats win seats in the Texas Legislature and key judicial races.\n\n\"I think he lost because of political entrenchment to be honest,\" said supporter Esteban Escobar, who attended O'Rourke's Tuesday night event. \"I really wish the voters of Texas would have been more open to the unifying message that he had.\"\n\nIn the campaign's final weeks, as questions mounted about a future presidential run, O'Rourke said it was a \"definite no.\" But Bannon said he got close enough to Cruz that his name on a future Democratic presidential ticket could potentially put Texas in play while making \"a real impression on a lot of Democratic activists around the country.\"\n\nBannon said O'Rourke will soon be urged to visit Iowa and New Hampshire, which kick off early presidential voting.\n\n\"I'd be willing to bet serious money that happens,\" Bannon said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEds: Associated Press writers John L.

The passengers were forced to return to Europe and more than 250 later died in the Holocaust.\n\nTrudeau called the apology long overdue.\n\nHitler \"watched on as we refused their visas, ignored their letters and denied them entry,\" Trudeau said in Parliament.\n\n\"There is little doubt that our silence permitted the Nazis to come up with their own, 'final solution' to the so-called Jewish problem.\"\n\nHe said lawmakers at the time used Canadian laws to mask anti-Semitism.\n\n\"We let anti-Semitism take hold in our communities and become our official policy,\" Trudeau said. \"To harbor such hatred and indifference toward the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths.\"\n\nIn the run-up to World War II and the ensuing Holocaust, the government heeded anti-Semitic sentiment and severely restricted Jewish immigration. From 1933 to 1945, only about 5,000 Jewish refugees were accepted.\n\nThe ship arrived in Canada more than six months after the Nazis in Germany attacked Jewish homes and businesses, burned 250 synagogues and killed at least 91 people, on a night which came to be known as Kristallnacht, \"The Night of Broken Glass.\"\n\nBefore the apology, Trudeau met with Ana Maria Gordon, a St. Louis passenger who lives in Canada, to talk about how the country could fight anti-Semitism.", "The fallout at the University of Maryland following the death of Jordan McNair continued with the dismissal of two trainers involved in the player's treatment after he collapsed on the practice field in late May.\n\nHead coach DJ Durkin was fired last week after being reinstated from paid administrative leave for one day.\n\nMaryland has not formally announced the firing of the two trainers who were on paid leave, and has never released their names. However, a person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press in August that athletic trainer Wes Robinson and director of athletic training Steve Nordwall had been placed on leave following McNair's death.\n\nAthletic department spokesman Dustin Semonavick said Wednesday, \"The trainers that were previously on administrative leave are no longer employed at the university.\"\n\nRobinson and Nordwall were put on leave while the school launched an external investigation into the death of McNair, an offensive lineman who was overcome by heat and exhaustion on May 29 and died on June 13.\n\nRick Court, the head of strength and conditioning, resigned in August.\n\nSince McNair's death, the school has had several embarrassing missteps in efforts to address mistakes that were made.\n\nThe university launched independent investigations into his treatment on the scene and the culture of the program. The report on the handling of McNair determined that he was not provided the necessary aid and that the trainers waited too long to contact emergency medical personnel.\n\nDr. Rod Walters, a former college athletic trainer and sports medicine consultant who led the investigation, said more than an hour and a half elapsed between the time McNair collapsed and the departure of the ambulance from the campus.\n\nMaryland athletic director Damon Evans acknowledged in August that the training staff failed to provide the proper treatment to McNair, a 19-year-old sophomore. University President Wallace Loh visited McNair's parents to offer a personal apology for how the situation was handled.\n\nDurkin was placed on leave in August. The attorney for McNair's parents in August called for Durkin to be fired, and reiterated that assertion during a news conference that started a couple of hours after the board's announcement.\n\nHassan Murphy, of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy, said the decision to retain Durkin was \"callous and indefensible,\" and could be a part of future legal actions.\n\nA series of personnel moves have recently transpired.\n\nBased on a report on the culture of the program, the University System of Maryland board of regents recommended the reinstatement of the coach. Durkin returned to the job on Oct. 31, but rapid backlash from students, players and state politicians prompted Loh to fire Durkin just over 24 hours after his return. A day after Durkin was fired, board chairman James Brady resigned . McNair's parents are considering taking legal action against the school.\n\nInterim coach Matt Canada has been running the team this season, though his long-term future is unclear.

Now reports didn't beat New York. Good afternoon everyone I'm David to a from ABC news headquarters here a New York we are erupting regularly scheduled programming to bring you breaking news at this hour. Attorney general Jeff Sessions has now resigned at the request of the president it takes effect immediately. President trump wasting no time beginning to reorganize his cabin after yesterday's midterm election. As you know his relationship with attorney general sessions has been contentious for quite some time the president never forgiving him for recusing himself in the Russian investigation. It was just a short time ago we were carrying the news conference president from turning of weight questions about whether he would replace sessions. But he has now tweeted the news announcing that Matthew Witter current chief of staff. To sessions will actually become the new acting attorney general. I want to get right to our chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl because this came swift after this news conference where he would not take questions obsessions. It sure did David and I am told that this was directly in response to requests from the president asking for that letter of resignation. Asking him to resign I'm told it will take place effective immediately. The president had been furious at his attorney general really for about a year and a half ever since he recused himself. After he became attorney general I. Had a at a rather extensive conversation with somebody familiar with sessions thinking on all of this. Who said that throughout the last year and a half while the president's. Many times and a very public ways. This are rated him in and that move of of of recusing himself a from the Russian investigation. That the president never directly what brought those concerns up with sessions never once called sessions to complain about it and over all of this time. He never asked sessions to resign so the request. Finally came after the mid term elections and sessions responded immediately to resign its interest thing David in the letter of resignation that sessions. Turned into the White House to the president. He said in part. He talked about his his legacy as attorney general. To implementing the president's agenda but they said most importantly in my times' attorney general we have restored. And upheld the rule of law. A glorious tradition that each of us has a responsibility to safeguard and I am told by against somebody. Familiar with sessions thinking that he never wants. Had any second thoughts about his decision to recuse himself from the Russian investigation or how we handled it. He simply believed. Did in terms of rule of law. He was somebody that was in the leadership of the trump campaign they would be entirely inappropriate for him to have anything to do with supervising. An investigation into that campaigns are. Or is never any second thoughts to recusing himself Jon Karl thanks to you and in fact in a letter that John sites their moments ago read the very top he said dear Mr. President. At your request I am submitting my resignation there you see litter on your screen. I want to show viewers at home between from the president that just a came in a short time ago saying we are pleased to announce that. Matthew Whitaker chief of staff attorney general Jeff Sessions of the Department of Justice will become our new acting attorney general. Here in the US he will serve our country well the president tweets. But again just coming in moments ago I do want to bring in George Stephanopoulos because obviously George the bigger question here. What does this mean for deputy attorney general rob rose and Stein what does it mean for the Moeller investigation. Chrysler right now the rubber in the senate until over team. The more investigate new. Acting attorney general has not been confirmed by this that he can't over and can't take over the investigation right now but we also know that. The president was very unhappy guitar rock it looked like just speak speak. Before the election that he was on his way out is well and I cheated and reporting it go let us talk his resignation the president put that on all of them want to do anything. Wooden turtle creek the president prepared to make a move on that now what's amazing is how long it kept out for the president to push. Jeff Sessions that she said the original temperature sessions in the park this march was accusing himself from the rush investigation was not kicking each. The range of that investigation what we saw. Over the last year and a helpless and extraordinary never seen book or public feud. Between the president and his own attorney general but mr. O sporting action Jeff Sessions. Working for the department preserving traditions. Administering to the Department of Justice. I would standing that a soft and not lead paint on his own huge out now Boller still hard at work. George course you and I were on the air into the wee hours of the morning and and the exit polls showing waning support from the American people when it comes to the Muller investigation that could also reflect the sheer amount of time. That this investigations been underway and we haven't heard from Robert Moeller yet any expectation that we would hear in the coming weeks what Robert Mueller has discovered. Well it seems like he he abided by this. Just department Mormon not acting in district two day window. Of an election we know his grand jury has been we don't you take a hard look at one of the president's oldest friends & Associates Roger Stone and we know he's been repair preparing a report. On the president's activities. As well there's been a back in port several months the president and his team or whether the president would answer questions about possible charge of justice in collusion with Russia I would expect he would she. She Sharman actions firm Robert Mueller relatively soon perhaps before the end of the year but as you know. He doesn't say anything to anyone out I think he's not one single. George Stephanopoulos on the swift move from president trump today just a day after the mid terms asking for the resignation of his attorney general Jeff Sessions. AG sessions now saying he will in fact. Resign at the request of the president let's bring in our Chief Justice correspondent Pierre Thomas who joined us from Washington as well they're clearly reacting to this at the Justice Department. Yes they are I can tell you. That this had been anticipated the expectation was that sessions would be you resign or be fired. He makes it very clear in this letter that this quote is at your request I'm submitting. My resignation letter is to the president of the United States. And again session had been under complete and utter fire from the president of constant. Under constant attack in terms or ridicule and sources and people. Close to him say that he. Did what he had to do in terms the refusal because department guidelines said that he had to do it. And it's always many at the Justice Department were surprised that the president continued to attack and win simply the guidelines. Mandated that sessions had to recuse themselves. Now suddenly presents recorder are saying basically that. He and the president said openly that he was upset that sessions took the job knowing that this potential was there that he might have to recuse himself. But right now the Justice Department is in the very unusual situation of such is stepping down deputy attorney general who's overseeing the Muller investigation. On thin ice as well and again goes a lot of uncertainly at the Justice Department but the people will attempt to do their jobs even under these difficult circumstances. Here stick with this hero to bring in former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who's also with us all night long covering the mid term elections and now with a son. AG Jeff Sessions now resigning moments ago in and Governor Christie what does this mean for rod Rosen Steiner deputy attorney general who of course is overseeing the Moeller investigation. What's his future look like. Well you could best be determined. If your birthday. I really believe that the president Wu eve. Locked in place to continue to oversee similar investigation. But don't think that'll make the change in our record at least gotten a but in terms of our long term you know is also barred -- position but it looked so that he the president certainly after the Scotts. I'm and that kind of natural at it determines you know. How about who you breakneck kind of assessment but I think today. Is really doubt Jeff Sessions and the breakdown of the relationship. Between the president and the attorney general and I don't believe that the day has any direct impact Barbara's part. Governor Christie. You know that your name has been floated as an idea potential. The suggestion for attorney general inside this trump White House would you take the call. You're didn't let her sit all along there's been lots of different offers for me. To join the administration. Since the beginning of the administration which which are currently separate are but I always say that. You know it president calls you or anything like he could corrections and asking to cheer your your commission put him. I'll know I agree to do that. A yoga stick call from the president no matter which party. And you learn and you listen to have to say but I'm as you know. We're all you really speak number person that I have going not so it's got out of control work period. Let me ask you don't worry Oakley busy yeah I don't want to put you on the spot as far as whether or not he would take the job but if you were to get the phone call what would you advise the president. He has listened your advice before what would you advise about. A protecting the Moeller investigation and rob rose and stuff. Aura materialistic you're turning you're really walloped. And foremost so that we avoid in the future. On the type of really difficult conflict. That went on between senior attorney general assertions which is not good for the current marker or the department. And so mark. Debris. Take your breath sort of wants to be a general for the next two years. And get that done first then. In conjunction with whoever your new attorney general could it would be. But then this is the coordinator grounds you know who worked with the part right but I'd ranking certain that the market action is something that. It seems everyone in our rep I'm in this group is coming to conclusion. Ensue yet. Yup I'm in a row you hear just grabbed the battle of via cellphone reception we got most of what you said their governor Christine we should point out that this. Acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker is not part cues from the Russia probe so.

Add Health Care Overhaul as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Health Care Overhaul news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nCalifornians on Tuesday elected a governor who campaigned for a complete overhaul of how people get their health coverage \u2014 but they shouldn\u2019t hold their breath.\n\nRather, as Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom and the Democratic-controlled legislature take steps to provide more people with health insurance, they\u2019ll likely approach it piecemeal over several years.\n\nNewsom himself is already tempering expectations about California\u2019s move to a single-payer system, saying it will take more than the will of one person to realize.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hesitate to be bold on this issue, and I also want to set expectations,\u201d Newsom told reporters last week at a campaign stop in Sacramento. \u201cIt\u2019s a multiyear process.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic lieutenant governor easily routed Republican John Cox in the governor\u2019s race Tuesday, with Newsom vowing to stand up to President Donald Trump and restore the \u201cCalifornia Dream\u201d by addressing affordable housing, health care and income inequality in the nation\u2019s most populous state.\n\nFrederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNewsom\u2019s views are in stark contrast to Cox\u2019s, who maintained that government should largely stay out of health care. The free-market businessman said single-payer would send health care costs soaring while diminishing quality, and warned that it \u201cis a sure way to destroy the California economy.\u201d\n\nLike many Democrats, Newsom has described health care as a right and vowed to defend the Affordable Care Act as governor. He also criticized the legislature last year when it held up a single-payer bill that would have created one government-run public insurance program for all Californians.\n\nHe won the endorsement from the politically powerful California Nurses Association for vigorously advocating single-payer. Going slow on single-payer could test his relationship with the union, which launched a brutal attack against the Democratic state Assembly speaker when he shelved the measure last year.\n\nIt could also upset progressive Democrats and donors who are counting on action.\n\n\u201cThis is the governor who has the best shot to get this done,\u201d said Stephanie Roberson, the union\u2019s director of government relations. \u201cIt takes political will and courage, and I\u2019m going to cash in on what he said to my association.\u201d\n\nNow Newsom\u2019s attitude is cautious \u2014 many say realistic \u2014 even in a state that aims to set national trends and relishes its role at the forefront of the resistance to the Trump administration.\n\nLast week, Newsom called single-payer the most \u201ceffective and efficient\u201d strategy to achieve universal coverage, but he questioned whether it could be achieved at the state level, given the Trump administration\u2019s opposition to the concept.\n\nTrump\u2019s top Medicare and Medicaid official, Seema Verma, last summer firmly rejected the idea that the federal government would grant the essential exemptions from federal rules to try single-payer, which she called \u201cunaffordable\u201d and \u201csomething that\u2019s not going to work.\u201d The exemptions, or waivers, are necessary because the state relies heavily on federal health care dollars that would be needed to pay single-payer costs.\n\nUndaunted, the California Nurses Association said it intends to bring another single-payer bill before the legislature next year and has launched a national campaign to pass single-payer in other states and convince Congress of its merits.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely that a single-payer bill will make it to Newsom\u2019s desk next year, in part due to the price tag: A single-payer system could cost an estimated $400 billion annually. Lawmakers earlier this year directed a council to study the feasibility of a publicly funded health insurance plan, and its findings aren\u2019t due until 2021 \u2014 giving the new governor and lawmakers time to punt on the issue.\n\nDavid McNew/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStill, Democrats who head the key legislative health committees see Newsom as a partner who will be more engaged on health care than fellow Democrat Gov. Jerry Brown has been these past eight years.\n\n\u201cHealth care has not been one of the issues that he\u2019s been particularly focused on,\u201d Assemblyman Jim Wood, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, said of Brown. \u201cI think we\u2019ve missed some opportunities to really move forward on some policies that would be good for all Californians.\u201d\n\nBrown this year blocked measures that would have expanded health care coverage to some low-income unauthorized immigrants \u2014 not because he philosophically opposed the idea, lawmakers say, but because it would have required new state spending.\n\nHe also raised cost concerns about bills that would have provided state-funded tax credits and subsidies to people who buy coverage through Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange.\n\nWith a new governor, those proposals are back on the table. Newsom was, after all, the San Francisco mayor who signed off on the nation\u2019s first universal health care program for city residents without insurance, including undocumented immigrants. And, as he has reminded reporters, he did it during a recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of what do you value, what you prioritize,\u201d he said last week when asked how the state could afford both universal health care and his call for universal preschool.\n\nNewsom\u2019s campaign did not respond to questions about how he would expand coverage absent single-payer. But, earlier this year, his spokesman told California Healthline that proposals to give coverage to undocumented immigrants and earmarking state dollars to help consumers buy insurance coverage were \u201ctwo major parts\u201d of his plan to deliver health coverage to all state residents. The state\u2019s estimated 1.8 million unauthorized immigrants, for example, make up roughly 59 percent of the state\u2019s remaining uninsured residents, according to Covered California.\n\nThe Democratic-dominated legislature would have to approve these moves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at a variety of ways that we might be able to get everyone covered,\u201d Wood said. But, he added, \u201cit will be significantly expensive to do that.\u201d\n\nWood and state Sen. Richard Pan, chair of the Senate Health Committee, said lawmakers should look at the structural issues in health care \u2014 how prices for services and pharmaceuticals are regulated and how efficiencies, improved access and curbs on costly care of chronic diseases might be achieved.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear the health care landscape is a focal point for the California legislature,\u201d said Erin Trish, associate director of health policy at University of Southern California\u2019s Schaeffer Center. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to push for a single-payer system to push for expanded coverage.\u201d\n\nExpanding health care coverage would require more state spending, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean a hit to the state economy, experts said.\n\nAfter California implemented the Affordable Care Act (albeit with significant federal assistance), the state\u2019s economy continued to grow and the number of uninsured residents fell to 7.2 percent in 2017, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expanded coverage and our economy has continued to flourish,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Bindman, a primary care physician who is also a professor at the Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California-San Francisco, who helped draft the federal health care law. \u201cThese things are achievable, and I think California is a model of that.\u201d\n\nPan, the chair of the Senate Health Committee, said he looks forward to engaging Newsom, someone who proved he could move beyond rhetoric by signing the San Francisco measure that offered more city residents health coverage.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we have an opportunity to get something done,\u201d Pan said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Maxine Waters' time.\n\nWith Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, the California representative is expected to become chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the nation's banking system and its regulators.\n\nWaters is no friend to the nation's biggest banks and Wall Street, and has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. The congresswoman from California has called for more regulation of banks, and has opposed Trump's political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.\n\nFor example, Waters, along with several other Democrats, were \"no\" votes on a banking industry bill that rolled back several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed under President Barack Obama that more tightly regulated banks after the financial crisis. In the Senate, the bill was supported by several Democrats and was signed into law this summer by Trump.\n\nWith a Republican-controlled Senate and Trump in the White House, it is unlikely Waters' proposed regulations on banks will make it into law. However, it's also much less likely that any substantial new deregulatory bills get through, either.\n\nWhere Waters and Democrats will likely have the most power will be in her subpoena and investigatory powers that come as head of the committee.\n\nOne particular target for Waters will likely be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since Republicans took over the watchdog agency last year, the CFPB has made many about-faces on rules and regulations that it wrote under the Obama.\n\nThe CFPB has not faced much congressional oversight since Mick Mulvaney, Trump's budget director and acting director of the CFPB, took over. Trump has nominated Kathy Kraninger, who worked under Mulvaney in the Office of Management and Budget, to be the next permanent director of the Bureau. If she is confirmed, which is likely since Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate and extended their gains in Tuesday's election, any moves she and the bureau make will likely come under increased scrutiny of Waters' committee.\n\nIndeed, Waters indicated in a statement Wednesday that a priority will be \"ensuring that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can be allowed to resume its essential role of protecting consumers from harmful practices without interference from the Trump Administration.\"\n\nBanks and their executives also are more likely to be called to testify in front of Congress. Democrats both in the House and Senate have been increasingly vocal about bringing scandal-plagued Wells Fargo in front of Congress again to discuss some of the bank's more recent missteps.\n\nThere's also likely to be more scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, which had been the primary financier of Trump's business entities since before he became president.\n\nBanking groups have said in interviews that they are eager to work on banking issues both parties can agree on. That could include student loans and other minor tweaks to laws on the books that govern how much capital banks are required to carry.\n\nBut there are things that will be outside of the control of Waters and congressional Democrats. Most banking laws give the regulators who oversee the industry \u2014 the Federal Reserve, CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others \u2014 wide authority to tailor regulations as needed. Nearly all of the positions at those regulators are now filled by Trump appointees.\n\nDemocrats could investigate and scrutinize any regulators' changes. To do anything more substantial, like using the Congressional Review Act as Republicans did last year, would require cooperation from the Republican-controlled Senate and Trump's signature.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKen Sweet covers banks and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for The Associated Press. Follow him on twitter at @kensweet.", "For the past few years, the smartphone industry has been searching for a breakthrough to revive a market mired in an innovation lull and a sales slump. A potential catalyst is on the horizon in the form of flexible screens that can be folded in half without breaking.\n\nSamsung and several rivals are preparing to roll out such screens to make devices more versatile for work and pleasure. The foldable screens could increase display space to the size of a mini-tablet, but fold like a wallet so they revert to the size of regular phones. But there are questions about price and durability.\n\nIf the new phones fulfill their makers' ambitions, they will become a leap ahead for an industry whose origins can be traced to the old flip phones that consumers once embraced as cool and convenient. Foldable-screen phones, though, won't need hinges because they have continuous displays that can bend.\n\nIn an indication of how difficult it is to make a flexible screen that's also durable, Samsung first announced plans to build a folding-screen phone five years ago. It wasn't until Wednesday, though, that Samsung finally provided a glimpse at what it's been working on.\n\n\"We have been living in a world where the size of a screen could only be as large as the device itself,\" said Justin Denison, Samsung's senior vice president of mobile product marketing. \"We have just entered a new dimension.\"\n\nExcept for a fleeting look at a device he held in a hand, Denison provided scant information about the phone. Samsung says it will be ready to hit the market at some point next year.\n\nSmartphone makers are looking for something to excite consumers as they replace phones less often because new models are pricey and aren't that much different from their predecessors beyond slightly better cameras and batteries.\n\nThat's the main reason worldwide smartphone sales have fallen from the previous year for four consecutive quarters, according to IDC. Add it all up, and smartphone sales declined by 4 percent during 12 months ending in September. Samsung, the world's leading seller of smartphones, suffered a 7 percent decline in shipments during that period, based on IDC's calculations.\n\nBut it's not clear whether flexible-screen phones will have mass appeal, especially when the bendy devices are expected to cost more than $1,000. Royole Corp., a small Silicon Valley company, is hoping to sell early versions of its FlexPai foldable-screen phone for $1,300 to $1,500 once it comes to the U.S. \u2014 something that won't happen until next year, at the earliest. For now, it will be available in China starting next month, at a price equivalent to about $1,300.\n\nWhile the idea of a device being able to bend into different shapes may sound good, IDC analyst Ramon Llamas is skeptical about how practical and durable they will be. One of the biggest questions is whether the quality of the screens will degrade as they get repeatedly folded. \"Are people really going to want to watch a Netflix show on these devices if there is a crease down the middle of it?\" Llamas said.\n\nRoyole said its FlexPai can be bent more than 200,000 times without deteriorating.\n\nOther foldable-screen phones running Google's Android software are expected to be available, too. Huawei confirmed last month that it is working on a phone with a flexible screen. LG Electronics is widely expected to unveil one at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas in January. LG didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Everyone has been thinking about the same question: 'What's next? Is there nothing more from a smartphone?'\" Royole CEO Bill Liu said.", "When Gabi Wilson is H.E.R. \u2014 her R&B singer stage name \u2014 she is usually rocking big hair and big sunglasses, rarely showing her full face to her fans.\n\nThe point is to give the public one simple thing to focus on: the music.\n\nBut other days, her hair is pulled into a ponytail or a bun and her face is clear, like the time she was being driven in an Uber with a friend and \"Best Part,\" her Top 5 R&B hit, came on the radio.\n\n\"I love that song 'Best Part,'\" H.E.R. recalled the driver saying, adding that he was in his late '60s. \"It reminds me of my wife.\"\n\n\"I wanted to cry,\" she added. \"It was so special.\"\n\nThat anonymity proved two things for the singer: Her choice to release music without giving too much detail about her life worked, and her fanbase is not just made up of teenagers who mainly consume music through streaming \u2014 R&B purists love her, too.\n\nSince Sony's RCA Records announced H.E.R. mysteriously in 2016, she has become a rising R&B star, achieving success on the road, on streaming services, the charts and even at awards shows.\n\nSongs like \"Best Part,\" ''Focus\" and \"Losing\" perfectly blend the alternative R&B sound that's popular today with the traditional R&B sound that some feel is missing from the contemporary music scene.\n\nHer first two EPs \u2014 \"H.E.R., Vol. 1\" and \"H.E.R., Vol. 2\" \u2014 gave her an immediate fan base thanks to the songs' honest lyrics and vibey melodies, as she sang about complicated relationships and love lapses. Most people wouldn't think she just turned 21 months ago.\n\n\"The way that I released the music did exactly what I wanted it to, which was make people just listen to the music,\" said H.E.R., which stands for \"Having Everything Revealed.\" ''(And) just listen to the message for what it is because we tend to listen with our eyes sometimes. Sometimes it's all about hype, and I didn't want hype. ...I don't want people to love my music because of what I look like or who I know or whatever.\"\n\n\"I feel like maybe some people wouldn't have accepted the music if they knew I was 19,\" said H.E.R., who was that age when her first EP dropped. \"Some people, they make these assumptions before they even listen to the music.\"\n\n\"Vol. 1,\" her seven-song set, was named iTunes' R&B album of 2016. She earned a nomination for best new artist at the 2017 Soul Train Awards. And she opened on tour for Bryson Tiller and completed her first headlining tour.\n\nBut this year, she reached the Top 10 of the R&B charts with \"Could've Been,\" the gold-selling \"Focus\" and the platinum hit \"Best Part,\" a duet with Daniel Caesar. She earned a whopping seven nominations at the upcoming Soul Train Awards, making her the most nominated act. And she opened on the road for Chris Brown and will launch her second headlining tour on Saturday in Atlanta.\n\nShe is Apple Music's latest \"Up Next\" artist and ranks sixth among R&B acts on the streaming platform. Her success has been so major that a male singer has copied her likeness and released songs under the name H.I.M.\n\n\"I don't like to acknowledge it,\" she said of the copycat.\n\nH.E.R. grew up in the San Francisco Bay area to a black father and Filipino mother. She was originally introduced to the public as a piano prodigy at age 10, appearing on the \"Today\" show and covering Alicia Keys' music. She was signed to Sony at 14 and said though she wanted to release music at times \u2014 she did try with the song \"Something to Prove\" in 2014 under Gabi Wilson \u2014 she appreciates the time she had to develop as an artist and work on songwriting and grow as a pianist, drummer and guitar (she plays electric, acoustic and bass guitar).\n\nKeys, who met H.E.R. over a decade ago, had similar beginnings: She was originally signed as a teenager and didn't release her first song, the No. 1 hit \"Fallin',\" until she was 20 in 2001.\n\n\"I was signed when I was 14 and then had been developing all the way up to the first album and probably a lot like H.E.R.,\" Keys said. \"You feel super anxious because you have all of this music you've been working on for years. You have your dreams and you have your wishes and of course you find yourself hoping that it's going to all work out. Sometimes you've got to sit for a minute and wait for that right moment. That's hard \u2014 that discipline is almost just as hard.\"\n\n\"I saw H.E.R. developing as an artist, and she really had this thing about her that was so exciting because it was such serious musicianship,\" added Keys. \"And then fast forwarding now, X amount years later, to where she is now and seeing that all come together, I think the beauty of that is the fact that she was really able to take her time and be an artist and develop and be a young girl. Her eyes and her destiny have always been on this place and needed to land in this world. And it's only going to get brighter, bigger and better.\"\n\nThis year H.E.R. released her second pair of EPs, titled \"I Used to Know Her\" parts 1 and 2, taking on new sounds and moods in comparisons to her earlier projects. A full album is expected next year.\n\nShe's even revealing more of herself: In the music video for \"Could've Been,\" released last week, you can even see her face.\n\n\"I think everything will be revealed in its proper time and slowly, like the developing of a polaroid \u2014 that's kind of what you see and what her reveal is,\" said manager Jeff Robinson, who signed both H.E.R. and Keys to his MBK Entertainment company when they were teens (he no longer manages Keys).\n\n\"There was never any hiding \u2014 just a concentration on the music,\" he added.\n\nFor H.E.R., she's just happy to have connected with fans of all ages in an organic way.\n\n\"I'm so thankful that at this point, even if you see my face or know who I am, it doesn't matter, because you already love the music,\" she said. \"You've already accepted it.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://everythingrevealed.her-official.com/", "President Donald Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday, replacing the head of the Department of Justice with his chief of staff Matthew G.

It has been a privilege to work under his leadership. He is a man of integrity who has served this nation well.\"\n\nSessions left the Justice Department Wednesday afternoon after meeting with staff. About 150 people, including many longtime career attorneys, clapped as he walked out, gave him a thumbs up, and shook hands.\n\nDuring a lengthy press conference Wednesday morning, Trump declined to say what staff changes he had planned, but said it was \"no great secret\" that \"a lot of administrations make changes after midterms.\" Trump was specifically asked by a reporter about chief of staff John Kelly.\n\n\"I will say that for the most part, I'm very, very happy with this cabinet,\" Trump said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wished Sessions well after learning of his resignation Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"I thank Jeff Sessions for his dedicated service as Attorney General.

Whitaker has publicly criticized the probe in the past, including in an August 2017 op-ed for CNN.\n\n\"I've prosecuted several financial crimes at the federal level and I've also defended plenty in my private practice. From this unique vantage point, I can understand how a motivated prosecutor, in a broad investigation into the financial affairs of high-profile individuals, can become overzealous toward the targets of such probes -- with calamitous results,\" Whitaker wrote at the time. \"While no one is above the law, in situations such as this, any seasoned prosecutor must use discretion both judiciously and expertly.\"\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein, who is the acting attorney general for the purposes of this investigation, to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\" Whitaker added.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nFollowing Sessions' resignation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Whitaker to recuse himself from the probe.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nSchumer later tweeted that: \"Clearly, the President has something to hide.\"\n\nClearly, the President has something to hide. https://t.co/m1sQV9oBwl \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) November 7, 2018\n\nPreviously, Trump would not say whether Sessions -- who he has repeatedly criticized throughout his tenure -- would be safe in his job after the midterm elections.\n\n\"I just would love to have him do a great job,\" Trump told Bloomberg News on Aug. 30.\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images,FILE\n\n\"I\u2019d love to have him look at the other side,\" Trump added, underscoring his demand for Sessions to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton and the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\nEarlier in August, in an interview with Fox News, Trump lashed out at Sessions, saying he failed to take control of the Department of Justice.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP, FILE\n\nIn his most forceful public rebuke to date, Sessions hit back shortly after, saying he \"will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\"\n\nSen.

President Trump wants as much as $5 billion to fund the southern border wall, but senior House Democratic advisers have told ABC News that Democrats, with a newly-reclaimed majority - will be loathe to provide one cent for that kind of funding.\n\nAnd while McConnell said he would \u201cwork hard\u201d to realize the President\u2019s priorities on the wall, he would only say any effort to cut middle-class taxes would have to be done \u201con a bipartisan basis.\"", "Palestinian officials say a fisherman has been shot dead by Egyptian naval forces off the coast of the Gaza Strip.\n\nNizzar Ayyash of the fishermen's union says that 32-year-old Mustafa Abu Ouda had been fishing alone in his boat off the coast of the southern border town of Rafah on Wednesday.\n\nAyyash says at least three fishermen have been killed by Egyptian fire in recent years.\n\nEgypt has been battling an Islamic insurgency in the neighboring Sinai peninsula since 2013. Its army has imposed a buffer zone along the Gaza border and beefed up maritime security.\n\nEgypt and Israel have also maintained a blockade on Hamas-controlled Gaza since the Islamic group took power in 2007.\n\nHamas called on Egypt to investigate Wednesday's shooting.", "Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar joined \u201cThe View\u201d on Wednesday to talk about her journey making history as the first Somali-American to win a seat in U.S. Congress.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

After fleeing the country\u2019s civil war, she spent four years in a refugee camp before coming to the U.S. when she was 14.\n\nShe says her message of hope \u201cis that if you work hard and you believe in creating positive change within your community, you can achieve anything.\u201d", "The outcome of the midterm elections was good for the stock market in general, mostly because it didn't produce any big surprises, but it was especially good for the health care industry and several other companies.\n\nHealth insurers rose sharply Wednesday as investors anticipated that any prospects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded health insurance to millions of Americans, diminished greatly now that Democrats control the House of Representatives.\n\nMarijuana companies soared after several states voted to partly legalize pot, oil and gas companies benefited from the defeat of a ballot measure in Colorado that might have restricted drilling, and a dialysis services company rocketed higher after California voters rejected a measure that would have capped the profits of dialysis clinics.\n\nHere's a look at industries and companies that were affected in various ways by the outcome of the election.\n\nHEALTH CARE: Health insurers, hospital operators and companies that run Medicaid health programs all jumped. Democrats' victory in the House means Republicans won't be able to pass legislation repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a goal for the party ever since the law was passed during President Barack Obama's first term. The bill expanded health insurance coverage, and the election results mean more stability for insurers and more reimbursement for hospitals.\n\nVoters in Idaho and Nebraska approved expansions of the federal-state Medicaid program, which provides benefits to poor and disabled people. Winning gubernatorial candidates in Maine and Kansas also support expanding Medicaid benefits to more people.\n\nThe largest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth added 4.2 percent to $274.63 and Anthem rose 6.6 percent to $289.94. The largest hospital company, HCA, gained 4.7 percent to $141.65. Medicaid services company Molina jumped 10.5 percent to $137.32.\n\nMARIJUANA STOCKS: Voters in Michigan passed a ballot measure to legalize marijuana while a similar measure in North Dakota was defeated. Missouri became the 31st state to approve marijuana for medical use, while Utah also voted on a medical marijuana proposition. A marijuana legalization measure in North Dakota was defeated.\n\nThe stocks built on their gains in the afternoon following the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and Sessions had promoted more aggressive enforcement of those laws. Tilray soared 30.6 percent to $139.60 and Canopy Growth climbed 8.2 percent to $46.07.\n\nDIALYSIS DETAILS: Dialysis services company DaVita surged after California voters rejected a ballot measure that would have capped dialysis clinics' profits in an effort to improve patient care. Proposition 8 would have limited profits for dialysis clinics that provide vital treatment for people whose kidneys don't work properly. Dialysis companies contributed $111 million to oppose the bill, while proponents said it would stop companies from cutting corners to make more money and would force them to spend more of their money on caring for patients.\n\nDaVita gained 9.9 percent to $76.08.\n\nFRACKING FALLOUT: Oil drillers Anadarko Petroleum and Noble Energy rallied after Colorado voters rejected a measure that could have sharply reduced oil and gas drilling, including the method known as fracking, by requiring new oil and gas wells to be farther from occupied buildings than allowed under current law.\n\nAnadarko gained 5.7 percent to $57.89 and Noble picked up 4.2 percent to $28.16.\n\nGROWTH: Big tech and retail companies made huge gains. The stocks aren't expected to benefit from any specific vote or change in policy, but with the elections over, investors were willing to take bigger risks and bet that the global economy will keep growing. Amazon jumped 6.9 percent to $1,755.49 and Microsoft climbed 3.9 percent to $111.96.\n\nSafer, steadier stocks generally rose, but they didn't do as well as the rest of the market. Those stocks had surged in October as the rest of the market struggled, but on Wednesday, utility company AES fell 2.6 percent to $15.60. Shopping mall operator Simon Property Group rose 2 percent to $187.27, but consumer products maker Church & Dwight lost 2.6 percent to $66.11.", "When Amazon officials visited New York's Long Island City as a potential second headquarters, they were impressed with its \"Seattle\"-like neighborhood vibe and the \"scale and infrastructure\" it had to offer.\n\nInterested in Amazon? Add Amazon as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Amazon news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nLong Island City is a residential and industrial neighborhood in western Queens that has been transformed into a hipster enclave. MoMA's PS1 contemporary art space and the iconic Silvercup Studios anchor the creative scene, accompanied by craft beer and cocktail bars. High-rise apartment buildings have altered the skyline, as younger New Yorkers opt for a view of, instead of from, Manhattan.\n\n\"Long Island City made a real impression. It\u2019s an actual neighborhood. It looks a little like Seattle, with bars and restaurants. It\u2019s clearly what the company is looking for,\" a source familiar with the negotiations told ABC News.\n\nAlthough no deal has been inked, an announcement is expected soon, possibly as early as this week. After a competitive nationwide search, the company is reportedly choosing two cities as its new headquarters.\n\nThe dual HQ2 is in line with what Amazon has been saying all along: one urban campus, one suburban. Very few places can supply the talent pool Amazon requires for these new 50,000 jobs, according to the source. It's also assumed that those jobs will be split evenly between the two selected cities.\n\nAnd \"the scale and infrastructure is huge\" in New York, Newmark Global Strategy managing principal Robert Hess, who consulted for the city on the Amazon bid, told ABC News. \"There are very few places on earth who can absorb this kind of project.\"\n\nThe news of a dual-city headquarters was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, which also named Crystal City in Virginia and Dallas as contenders. A subsequent report in the The New York Times doubled down on Crystal City and Long Island City.\n\nHess, who also consulted on the search for the revamped Nike campus in Portland, Oregon, in 2013, said that splitting the headquarters makes sense from a risk management point of view, in case one of the venues encountered unexpected problems or adjustments.\n\nSTOCK/Getty Images\n\nAmazon declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nFrom 20 to 3\n\nLike other municipalities, New York City and the state of New York have rolled out the red carpet to woo Amazon and the $5 billion the new headquarters is expected to bring. The city already hosts over half a dozen Amazon facilities across three NYC boroughs, including a fulfillment center, a distribution center and its new 4-Star Store in SoHo.\n\nBeginning in October 2017, New York City submitted a proposal featuring four locations: Long Island City, Manhattan's Midtown West/Hudson Yards, downtown Manhattan and the Brooklyn Tech Triangle.\n\nIn January, the company narrowed its list of potential cities to 20.\n\nOn the first visit to New York, Amazon execs toured two locations: Hudson Yards and Long Island City. The problem with Hudson Yards was that it wasn't a real neighborhood yet despite its development potential, the source said.\n\nIn July, Amazon officials came back for a second visit but only saw Long Island City. Company representatives took a ferry tour at sunset, a Citi Bike tour and met with Andy Byford, the CEO of the New York City Transit Authority. Byford reassured the company about the reliability of the subway system, particularly the problem-ridden 7 train, the source said.\n\nAt separate appearances on Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo both said they were unaware if Amazon had made a final decision.\n\nLast week, de Blasio announced a $180 million incentive package to improve the Long Island City's infrastructure, including a new school, sewer upgrades, and revamped public spaces.\n\nBut not everyone is happy about the idea of Amazon moving into Long Island City.\n\nNew York City Council Member Van Bramer wrote in a statement to ABC News: \u201cHQ2 has to work for Queens, not just Amazon. We already have an infrastructure deficit in LIC. We must ask how such a complex would impact the people who live in the surrounding neighborhoods. This isn\u2019t a done deal. The local community must be heard here.\u201d\n\nCrystal City, a Washington, D.C., suburb, has long been considered a front-runner for the retailer. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has a house in Washington, D.C., and owns The Washington Post. In addition, northern Virginia is an established tech corridor and houses several government agencies -- with potential lucrative contracts for major tech companies.\n\nArlington County officials declined to comment.\n\nThe midterms\n\nIn line with Amazon's reputation for secrecy, everything involving HQ2 was locked down for over a year. But stories started leaking right before the midterm elections.\n\nAfter The Washington Post published a story about Crystal City closing the gap on the deal, Amazon's director of economic development, Mike Grella, whose Twitter bio lists his location as \"New York, Seattle, DC,\" tweeted: \u201cMemo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection.

Until a few years ago, experts believed Europe was where our ancestors started drawing animals and other figures.\n\nBut the age of the drawing reported Wednesday in the journal Nature, along with previous discoveries in Southeast Asia, suggest that figurative drawing appeared in both continents about the same time.\n\nThe new findings fuel discussions about whether historical or evolutionary events prompted this near-simultaneous \"burst of human creativity,\" said lead author Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist and geochemist at Griffith University in Australia.\n\nThe remote limestones caves on Borneo have been known to contain prehistoric drawings since the 1990s. To reach them, Aubert and his team used machetes to hack through thick jungle in a verdant corner of the island.\n\nStrapping on miners' helmets to illuminate the darkness, they walked and crawled through miles of caves decorated with hundreds of ancient designs, looking for artwork that could be dated. They needed to find specific mineral deposits on the drawings to determine their age with technology that measures decay of the element uranium.\n\n\"Most of the paintings we actually can't sample,\" said Aubert.\n\nAubert and his fellow researchers reported in 2014 on cave art from the neighboring Indonesian island of Sulawesi. They dated hand stencils, created by blowing red dye through a tube to capture the outline of a hand pressed against rock, to almost 40,000 years ago.\n\nNow, with the Borneo cave art, the scientists are able to construct a rough timeline of how art developed in the area. In addition to the bull, which is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, they dated red- and purple-colored hand stencils and cave paintings of human scenes.\n\nAfter large animal drawings and stencils, \"It seems the focus shifted to showing the human world,\" Aubert said.\n\nAround 14,000 years ago, the cave-dwellers began to regularly sketch human figures doing things like dancing and hunting, often wearing large headdresses. A similar transition in rock art subjects happened in the caves of Europe.\n\n\"That's very cool, from a human point of view,\" said Peter Veth, an archaeologist at the University of Western Australia, who was not involved in the study. \"People adopted similar strategies in different environments as they became more modern.\"\n\nThe island of Borneo was still connected to mainland Southeast Asia when the first figurative drawings were made about 40,000 years ago \u2014 which is also about the time that the first modern humans arrived in Europe. The earliest drawings of animals in the French cave of Chauvet have been dated to about 33,500 to 37,000 years ago.\n\nWhether new waves of people migrating from Africa brought the skills of figurative cave painting with them, or whether these arts emerged later, remains unclear. Scientists have only a partial record of global rock art. The earliest cave etchings have been found in Africa and include abstract designs, like crosshatches, dating to around 73,000 years ago.\n\nThe next stage of research in Indonesia will include excavations to learn more about the people who made these paintings.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHealth care proved important but apparently not pivotal in the 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday as voters gave Democrats control of the U.S. House, left Republicans in charge in the Senate and appeared to order an expansion of Medicaid in at least three states long controlled by Republicans.\n\nIn taking over the House, Democrats are unlikely to be able to advance many initiatives when it comes to health policy, given the GOP\u2019s control of the Senate and White House. But they will be able to deliver an effective veto to Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, convert the Medicaid health care system for low-income people into a block grant program and make major changes to Medicare.\n\nOne likely development is an expansion of Medicaid in several of the 18 states that had so far not offered coverage made available by the Affordable Care Act. Voters in Idaho and Nebraska easily approved ballot measures calling for expansion. A similar measure was leading in incomplete returns in Utah.\n\nIn Montana, voters are deciding if the existing expansion should be continued and the state\u2019s expenses covered by raising tobacco taxes. In preliminary results, opponents outnumbered supporters but key counties were not expected to release their tallies until Wednesday.\n\nMedicaid might also be expanded in Kansas, where Democratic gubernatorial candidate Laura Kelly defeated GOP Secretary of State Kris Kobach. The Kansas legislature had previously passed Medicaid expansion, but it was vetoed in 2017 by former GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. Kobach had not supported the ACA expansion.\n\nAnd in Maine, where voters approved Medicaid expansion in 2017 but GOP Gov. Paul LePage refused to implement it, Democrat Janet Mills was victorious. She has promised to follow the voters\u2019 wishes. LePage was not running. In exit polling, as in many earlier surveys in 2018, voters said that health care, particularly preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions, was their top issue. But health care remained more important to Democrats than to Republicans.\n\nThose who urged Democrats to emphasize health care this year took credit for the congressional successes. \u201cThe race for the House was a referendum on the Republican war on health care. You know it, I know it, and the Republican incumbents who shamefully tried to cover up their real record on health care and lost their seats know it,\u201d said Brad Woodhouse of the advocacy group Protect Our Care.\n\nBut the issue was not enough to save some of the Senate Democrats in states won by President Donald Trump in 2016. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) was defeated by GOP Attorney General Josh Hawley, who is a plaintiff in a key lawsuit seeking to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who also campaigned hard on health care, were defeated.\n\nNonetheless, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) beat Republican Patrick Morrisey, the state\u2019s attorney general who is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit seeking to upend the ACA.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the leader of the House Democrats who would be first in line to take over as speaker, told supporters gathered in Washington for a victory celebration that her caucus would make health care a key legislative issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about stopping the GOP and [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell\u2019s assault on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and the health care of 130 million Americans living with preexisting medical conditions,\u201d she said. She pledged that Democrats would take \u201cvery, very strong legislative action\u201d to lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nAmong the many new faces in the House is at least one with some significant experience in health policy.

Nouy's term expires at the end of the year.\n\nEnria is chair of the London-based European Banking Authority, responsible for drawing up rules for European banks.

There is so much villainy and yet precious few villains here.\n\nHugh Jackman plays Hart as a policy wonk with his head in the clouds, flustered that anyone would be crass enough to ask who he shares his bed with. Hart, as suave throwing an ax as he is citing Tolstoy, built a wall between personal and private but now that divider was crashing down. When asked \u2014 point-blank \u2014 whether he had committed adultery, he waffles: \"I guess I don't think that a fair question.\" Wait, what's that smell? It's Hart becoming toast.\n\nBut don't expect journalists to come off like white knights. Reitman perfectly captures the nervousness that the scandal makes news executives feel, the sickness some feel covering it, the crushing rivalry between newspapers and the bickering about whether to take a high or a low road (Hint: there is no longer a high road.) The off-hour chumminess between reporters and the pitch-black joking of Fourth Estate members is well handled \u2014 and accurate. Not even Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post (played with knowing cynicism by Alfred Molina) is too heroic.\n\nWhere the film seems to widen its subject \u2014 and makes itself relevant in the midst of the #MeToo movement \u2014 is the way it captures the twin pain of the women Hart has hurt \u2014 his wife, played beautifully by Vera Farmiga, and his mistress, Donna Rice, portrayed with sweetness and vulnerability by Sara Paxton. Farmiga is the definition of long-suffering but gets to unleash her rage in a scene where she tells her husband to own their pain. \"You carry it so I don't have to,\" she tells him.\n\nHart campaign workers \u2014 led by the gruff Bill Dixon (a terrific J.K. Simmons) \u2014 are left shell-shocked. One staffer, played by the excellent Molly Ephraim, is assigned to take care of Rice and the two have some fabulous scenes exploring the role of women in this man's world and the expectations they face. It is bracingly relevant. Paxton shows Rice as both aware of her beauty but also desperate not to be seen as what she became \u2014 a late-night talk show shorthand for bimbo. There's a scene in which she tearfully hopes her parents won't find out about her dalliance. That was never in the cards.\n\nTo write the screenplay, Reitman leaned on Matt Bai, a journalist who wrote about Hart in his book \"All The Truth Is Out.\" It has a \"West Wing\" feel, with plenty of cross-talk and decisions being made on the fly. Reitman also seems to have had fun returning to 1987, with references to \"Miami Vice,\" a snippet of Expose's \"Point of No Return\" and reporters struggling in a pre-internet world with payphones and dot matrix printers. Reitman's focus is on the places and discussions behind the scenes, and so he wisely avoids lazily duplicating the famous shot aboard the boat Monkey Business that doomed Hart or showing anything steamy between Hart and Rice.\n\nThere is a moment at the end of the three weeks when Hart seems to turn a political corner, weathering the sex scandal storm, but it proves a false dawn. (\"It's gossip. It'll blow over,\" he insists.) The filmmakers don't really explain why Hart finally pulled the plug but it leads to a wonderful final scene of just Gary Hart with his wife, still and quiet and in silhouette after so much noise. (They're watching, naturally, Gary Hart's speech ending his campaign).\n\n\"The Front Runner\" is appropriately paced like a thriller, as everyone involved gets pulled down into the drain, helplessly. Those three weeks in 1987 may not answer all our questions about how nasty our politics and journalism has become since then, but it is clear that everyone involved was a little guilty.\n\n\"The Front Runner,\" a Columbia Pictures release, is rated R for \"language, including some sexual references.\" Running time: 113 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMPAA Definition of R: Restricted.

And and of course in Texas where bets or roar can be ignited the liberal base. They all fell short. And it was seen as a repudiation of president front meanwhile if you look. Throughout the nation suburbs you can go outside of right here in New York or Chicago or Philadelphia. Or Miami or Dallas or Houston or Los Angeles. In all of those places you saw places that kind of country club Republicans middle of the road Republicans. And they ousted their Republican member of congress they went with a Democrat instead so.

Yeah I think I think we now the president added he's not gonna read it is any kind of a statement on him.

That\u2019s 49 percent of the total population eligible to vote, a record for a midterm election in the U.S.\n\n2. 38 percent Democrats, 32 percent Republicans, 30 independents\n\nDemocrats account for 38 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results so far, while Republicans made up 32 percent and 30 percent responded as independent. This compares with 36-37-27 percent in 2014 and 37-33-29 in 2016.\n\n3. 33 flipped seats\n\nAccording to ABC News\u2019 projections, 30 House seats have changed color so far, with Democrats flipping 29 Republican-held seats blue and Republicans flipping one Democrat-held seat.\n\nFourteen of those seats came from districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Of 25 Republicans running in Hillary's districts, only three have been able to defend their seats so far, and eight seats in California and Washington are still too close to determine.\n\nAP\n\nRepublicans have managed to pick up at least three seats in the Senate, including in Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri. Three races in Montana, Florida and Arizona have not been called yet, but Republicans are leading in all three. A runoff will be held in Mississippi.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s party\u2019s strong reaffirmation of the Senate control, the voter count shows that Democrats lead the Senate popular vote by more than 9 million as of early Wednesday morning, with many more still outstanding in California and Washington, where both candidates are Democrats.\n\nThis again brings up a growing government-reform movement within some Democratic party circles to re-design the Senate to be more proportionally representative, a call that resurfaced following the Kavanaugh vote, in which senators opposing confirmation represented a larger portion of the U.S. population.\n\nIn statewide elections, Democrats flipped at least seven governorships from red to blue Tuesday night.\n\n4. 110 female winners\n\nIt was a historic night for female candidates, with a record number of women elected to Congress.\n\nAccording to ABC News\u2019 projections, at least 98 women will join the House of Representatives, with 84 Democrats and 14 Republicans, and 12 will join the Senate, 10 of whom will be Democrats and two are Republicans.\n\nTuesday\u2019s big win for women comes as an unprecedented number of women ran and won for the first time.\n\nDon Emmert/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOf the 98 female winners in the lower chamber, 42 were non-white women, including Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar, who will be the first Muslin-American women in Congress. In the upper chamber, Hawaii Democrat Mazie Hirono was the only non-white woman of the 12 female winners.\n\n5. $5.2 billion spent\n\nThe historic election came with record-breaking spending in the election cycle.\n\nAccording to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data by the Center for Responsive Politics, the total amount of money spent on federal races in this election cycle is expected to reach $5.2 billion, a 35 percent increase from the 2014 midterms.\n\nThis includes spending from candidate campaigns party committees and more than 3,200 outside groups, including super PACs and political nonprofits, which have reported spending at least $1.3 billion, a 60 percent increase from 2014.\n\nReuters, FILE\n\nA straggler Senate race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Rick Scott in Floria, still too close to be called, turned out to be the most expensive congressional race this election, bringing in more than $181 million from candidate campaigns and outside groups.\n\nThe most expensive House race came from a California district with high percentage of immigrant population. A race still too close to call, candidates, including Democrat Gil Cisneros and Republican Young Kim, have spent $21 million throughout the election cycle, and outside groups have $14 million.\n\nABC News' John Verhovek, Adam Kelsey, MaryAlice Parks and Imtiyaz Delawala contributed to this report.", "Transcript for US elections, World War remembrances in London and Moscow: World in Photos\n\nI.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Investigators in North Carolina have released new surveillance footage showing a man they'd like to speak to in connection with the search for kidnapped 13-year-old Hania Noelia Aguilar as the reward for information increases.\n\nSurveillance video released Thursday shows a man wearing light-colored shoes, a light-colored shirt and a hoodie walking south on Lambath Road before making a left on Highway 41 toward the trailer park Monday morning, FBI Supervisor Andy de la Rocha told reporters Thursday afternoon.\n\nTwo more videos were released by authorities on Friday showing separate camera views.\n\nThe man was the only person seen walking in the neighborhood in that part of the day, De la Rocha said.\n\nSeveral cars were seen in the video driving past the man, De la Rocha said, asking anyone who may have seen the man to call the tip line at 910-272-5871.\n\nThe man in the footage is not considered a suspect or person of interest at this time, De la Rocha said.

Trump threatened to go after House Democrats who try to investigate him, while Rep. Nancy Pelosi said her party would be \"a check and balance\" against the White House.\n\nThe day after midterm elections reset Washington, Trump took a victory lap at a raucous news conference, celebrating Republican Senate wins but distancing himself from the GOP's loss of the House. He said he was interested in working with House Democrats but was ready to respond if he felt he was being ill-treated.\n\nAs long as Republicans have controlled both houses of Congress, Democrats have been hampered in pursuing any significant probes of Trump and his administration, and he made it clear he expects the Senate to follow that course.\n\n\"They can play that game,\" he said of possible House Democratic investigations, \"but we can play it better, because we have a thing called the United States Senate.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats must decide how much \"harassment\" they want to pursue against Trump, while suggesting there could be limited opportunities to work across the aisle. And Pelosi, who is expected to run for a second stint as speaker when Democrats take the House majority in January, said the party has \"a responsibility to seek common ground where we can.\" But she added, \"Where we cannot, we must stand our ground.\"\n\nAfter midterm elections that served as a referendum on Trump's divisive presidency, Congress and the White House reckoned Wednesday with expected Republican gains in the Senate and a Democratic flip of the House. The early positioning provided the first glimpse of how all parties will balance calls for bipartisanship with an appetite for anger going into the next two years.\n\nBy turns combative and conciliatory, Trump said Democrats and Republicans should set aside partisanship to work together. On legislative prospects, Trump said he could potentially work with Democrats on issues such as taxes, infrastructure and health care, saying it \"really could be a beautiful, bipartisan type of situation.\"\n\nAnd Pelosi, during a news conference that was delayed because of Trump's lengthy remarks, said she had worked productively with President George W. Bush when she was speaker a decade ago on taxes and other issues, and she welcomed the chance to do so again with Trump.\n\n\"We'd like to work together so our legislation will be bipartisan,\" she said.\n\nStill, Pelosi said Democrats weren't elected to be \"a rubber stamp\" for Trump.\n\nSome House Democrats have threatened to use the subpoena power they will gain in January to investigate Trump and administration actions. But, he warned, he will respond in kind and government will suffer.\n\nPlus, he said, Democrats have \"nothing, zero,\" on him. Of the special counsel's Russia investigation that has shadowed his administration for more than 18 months, Trump said, \"I could end it right now\" but \"I let it go on.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, however, it was announced that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been forced out. His departure followed 18 months of criticism and insults from Trump, who had appointed him but objected to Sessions' stepping aside from the Russia probe rather than guiding. It.\n\nOn the potential for House investigations, Pelosi said Democrats will have a \"responsibility for oversight\" when they take charge in January and she will leave final decisions to committees. She wouldn't answer a question about whether Democrats will seek Trump's tax filings, but said committee requests for documents and hearings won't be \"scattershot.\"\n\nDemocrats are expected to investigate Trump's business dealings, his Cabinet's conduct and his campaign's possible ties to Russia, among other issues.\n\n\"We'll know what we are doing and we'll do it right,\" she said.\n\nPelosi spoke with Trump and McConnell after the Democrats' victory. McConnell said Wednesday that the two had discussed how they might \"find a way forward\" in a divided Congress.\n\nHe and Pelosi, the Kentucky senator said, are \"not unfamiliar\" with one another as longtime leaders and colleagues.\n\nAs for congressional action the rest of this year, he said he could not imagine taking up immigration and acknowledged that the Democratic House and Republican Senate were likely to go their separate ways when it comes to the legislative agenda\n\n\"Areas for legislative agreement will be more limited,\" he said.\n\n\"The one issue that Leader Pelosi and I discussed this morning where there could be a possible bipartisan agreement would be something on infrastructure, but there could be a lot of other things,\" he said.\n\nMcConnell also echoed Trumps' warnings on investigations, saying: \"The Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP writer Eric Tucker contributed.", "The driver who was charged in a fatal crash in Brooklyn last March has been found dead from an apparent suicide, according to police.\n\nDorothy Bruns, 45, had been charged with manslaughter in the crash that killed two small children in Park Slope.

In 2006, he was convicted in Russia for treason.\n\nDylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nIn 2010, however, Skripal took refuge in the United Kingdom after being part of a high-profile prisoner exchange program with the United States.\n\nSkripal\u2019s daughter, Yulia, was in Salisbury visiting him in March when the two became exposed to the nerve agent, which was also found in his home door and in other areas of Salisbury.\n\nChris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images, FILE\n\nSimilarities in the Skripals poisoning to that of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 raised suspicion that the Kremlin was behind the attack.\n\n\u201c \u201d I had to come down. I was glad to support them.\n\nBack in September, British police named two Russian nationals they believed were behind the poisoning, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, saying the two were Russian intelligence agents operating under those aliases when they visited Salisbury from Moscow in March.\n\nLater, the investigation group Bellingcat identified the two suspects as members of the GRU, colonel Anatoliy Chepiga and Dr. Alexander Mishkin.\n\nRussia, however, has denied allegations of involvement in the poisoning.\n\nZizzi was forced to close in March after the Skripals were poisoned, when authorities found traces of the nerve agent inside the restaurant.\n\nHowever, the place was given back to its owner after the national Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs did an extensive cleaning of the place to remove any traces of Novichok last September, according to The Independent newspaper.\n\nFor its grand reopening, a sign outside the door of Zizzi read: \u201ctoday all food is on us.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, guests were asked to pay what they felt and the restaurant would donate the money to two local charities that worked with the youth of Salisbury.\n\nMargaret Kittle, who was spending a week in London on a visit from Canada, heard the news a day before the restaurant\u2019s grand reopening. She booked a train ticket to Salisbury just to attend the opening.\n\n\u201cI had to come down,\u201d Kittle told ABC News. \u201cI was glad to support them.\u201d", "The Kremlin said Wednesday that Russia and the United States have agreed not to hold a summit in Paris to avoid diverting attention from weekend commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of World War I's end.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump expect to see each other briefly but won't have a full-scale meeting during the centenary Armistice Day events, Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said.\n\nUshakov said France conveyed concern that a Putin-Trump summit would steal the limelight from the Paris observances. Officials from the U.S. and Russia decided to delay the meeting until the end of the month, when both leaders expect to attend a Group of 20 summit in Argentina.\n\nTrump said Monday he \"probably\" would not be meeting with Putin in Paris, but will meet with him during the G-20.\n\nWhen U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton visited Moscow last month, he and Russian officials also talked about the presidents visiting each other's countries, according to Ushakov.\n\n\"A possible exchange of visits to Moscow and Washington was discussed, but there was no specific talk about the issue yet,\" he added.\n\nBolton said last month that Putin was invited to visit Washington next year, but a date had not been set.", "Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson has received one of Britain's highest awards from Prince William \u2014 and thought about giving him a kiss at the Buckingham Palace ceremony.\n\nThompson received a damehood on Wednesday in recognition for her splendid career, an event made special by the fact that it was given to her by William, a longtime friend.\n\n\"I love Prince William. I've known him since he was little, and we just sniggered at each other,\" she says. \"I said, 'I can't kiss you, can I?' And he said, 'No don't'!\"\n\nThompson was named for the female equivalent of a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honors List in June.\n\nShe plans to use the honor to focus attention on the plight of poor children who don't get adequate food during school holidays.", "Washington will focus on pressuring Iran financially and contesting its activities in Syria, Iraq and Yemen where the Persian nation enjoys broad influence, the U.S. envoy to Syria said Wednesday, adding that Tehran should eventually withdraw all Iran-commanded forces from Syria.\n\nAmbassador James Jeffrey told a group of journalists via a telephone conference that Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that President Donald Trump pulled America out of in May had a bad effect on Iran's behavior that \"accelerated its activities.\"\n\nIran enjoys influence in several countries in the region where it backs well-armed militias that are deployed in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Speaking about Iran's future in Syria, Jeffrey said: \"Iranians are part of the problem not part of the solution.\"\n\nJeffrey said the Trump administration is now focusing on putting financial pressure on Iran and \"secondly contesting more actively Iran's activities particularly in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\"\n\nWashington this week imposed a new list of sanctions against Iran's vital oil exports, banking and transport industries.\n\nJeffrey expressed concerns about Russia's delivery last month to Syria of the sophisticated S-300 air defense systems, weeks after the downing of a Russian plane by Syria forces responding to an Israeli air strike, a friendly fire incident that stoked regional tensions.\n\n\"We are concerned very much about the S-300 system being deployed to Syria. The issue is at the detail level. Who will control it? what role will it play?\" Jeffrey said.\n\n\"In the past, Russia has been permissive in consultations with the Israelis about Israeli strikes against Iranian targets inside Syria,\" he said. \"We certainly hope that that permissive approach will continue.\"\n\nJeffrey said Israel has an \"existential interest in blocking Iran from deploying long-range power projection systems such as surface-to-surface missiles\" and drones aimed at and used against Israel.\n\nIsrael rarely acknowledges attacks inside Syria but has said it would use military action to prevent weapons transfers to its enemies.\n\nIn September, an Israeli military official said the Jewish state has struck over 200 Iranian targets in Syria over the past 18 months. Since the delivery of the S-300 there has been no reports of Israeli airstrikes in Syria.\n\nJeffrey said that recent retreats by U.S.-backed fighters in eastern Syria against members of the Islamic State group besieged in a pocket near the Iraq border was \"a tactical reverse.\" He said \"it's nothing serious. The Daesh or ISIS forces there basically are still surrounded and reinforcements are coming in,\" he said using terms to refer to IS.\n\nIS launched several counteroffensives in recent weeks against the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces who have been trying to take the area from the extremists since early September killing scores of them and capturing others. The counterattacks were carried out during sandstorms in the mostly desert area.\n\n\"One other reason for the reverse there was unusually bad and sustained weather that limited our use of air power which is very important for our fight against Daesh,\" he said. \"As the weather changes and as additional troops are introduced, I expect the situation will change and we'll see advances against Daesh.\"\n\nHe added that after IS is defeated, concerns about the group as an insurgent force will remain \"and also ISIS's ability to infiltrate back into areas as a terrorist force both in Iraq and in Syria in particular.\"\n\nJeffrey said that when American officials say that U.S. troops will stay in Syria, \"we say until the enduring defeat of ISIS,\" which means to establish the conditions so that local forces, local populations and local governments can deal with IS as a terrorist or as an insurgent movement.\n\n\"We're not there yet,\" he said.", "Americans take out roughly $50 billion in payday loans a year, each racking up hundreds of dollars in fees and interest. But a small and growing service that allows its users to take an advance on their paycheck might be giving the payday loan industry a run for its money.\n\nSan Francisco-based financial technology company Even made headlines late last year when Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced it would start offering Even's service as part of its employee benefits package. Along with providing tools that allow employees to track their spending and save money, Even features Instapay, which allows users to advance some of their next paycheck up to 13 days before payday. Because the Even user is tapping into his or her already accumulated hours, Even doesn't charge the employee interest on the advance.\n\nEven is one of a handful of technology companies have popped up in recent years looking to get wages to employees faster and on demand. Companies like FlexWage Solutions and Instant Financial offer on-demand pay, but those services are often tied to a debit card issued by the company instead of an employee's primary bank account.\n\nEven founder Jon Schlossberg has said publicly that part of the company's mission is to put the payday loan industry out of business, claiming it exploits the financially vulnerable. He shared internal usage data exclusively with The Associated Press that shows, at least preliminarily, that Even users are less likely to tap the payday loan market once they sign up for the company's services.\n\n\"You have this entire industry of financial institutions taking advantage of Americans struggling to live paycheck to paycheck, and payday lenders are really the most predatory,\" Schlossberg said.\n\nPayday lenders say they provide a necessary service, with many Americans unable to come up with cash to cover an unexpected financial emergency. They also say they lend to the country's most desperate, who are often the highest risk for not paying back the loan. But critics say the rates and fees are exorbitant and can trap the borrower in a cycle of debt that can last months. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under the Obama administration, was trying to regulate the payday lending industry nationwide, but under the Trump administration the bureau has begun the process of reversing those regulations.\n\nEven's data show that roughly 28 percent of its users took out a payday loan in the months before signing up for the service. Four months after signing up for Even, that figure drops to less than 20 percent. Even calculated the figure by studying usage behavior of its members from December 2017 until September 2018.\n\nEven is able to tell which users are still using payday loans because Even users link their bank accounts to the app. The company is then able to tell what types of transactions a user is making, and whether they bear the characteristics of a payday loan transaction or name a payday lender as the other party.\n\nSchlossberg admits that Even could be missing some payday loan transactions, particularly ones where a check is used instead of a direct debit from a borrower's account. The data is also limited by the fact that Walmart, by far its biggest customer, only started using the product on December 15, 2017. Schlossberg said the company is working with academic researchers on the efficacy of Even's Instapay product versus payday loan usage, with the goal of publishing sometime in 2019.\n\nWalmart is the only company that publicly says it uses Even, but an Even spokesman says it has \"more than\" 10 companies signed up currently, with 400,000 active subscribers. Even does charge Walmart employees a $6 monthly fee to use its premium features, which includes Instapay.\n\nConsumer advocates, who have long targeted the payday lending industry, said they were glad to see alternatives to payday loans available but urged caution about their usage.\n\n\"The decrease is interesting and potentially promising but too soon to draw any conclusions,\" said Scott Astrada, director of federal advocacy at the left-leaning Center for Responsible Lending.", "Missy Elliott, one of rap's greatest voices and also a songwriter and producer who has crafted songs for Beyonce and Whitney Houston, is one of the nominees for the 2019 Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nElliott is the first female rapper nominated for the prestigious prize and could also become the third rapper to enter the organization following recent inductees Jay-Z and Jermaine Dupri.\n\nThe Songwriters Hall gave The Associated Press the list of nominees Wednesday, a day ahead of its official announcement.\n\nJoining Elliott as performing nominees are Mariah Carey, Chrissie Hynde, Vince Gill, Mike Love, Jimmy Cliff, Jeff Lynne, Cat Stevens, John Prine, Lloyd Price, Tommy James and the Eurythmics (Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart).\n\nNon-performing nominees are Jack Tempchin, Dean Dillon, Jerry Fuller, Tom T.

Eligible members can vote for three non-performing songwriters and three performing songwriters until Dec. 17.\n\nElliott, often praised for her wild, colorful style and playful lyricism, has been one of pop music's most sought producers and songwriters, in addition to creating her own well-known hits, from \"Get Ur Freak On\" to \"Work It\" to \"Lose Control.\"\n\nR&B singers and girl groups heavily benefited from her songwriting work in the '90s and '00s. Elliott churned out hits like \"Where My Girls At,\" which reached No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart and Monica's \"So Gone,\" a No. 1 R&B hit and Top 10 pop success. Though it sampled LaBelle's mid-'70s hit \"Lady Maramlade,\" Elliott re-worked the song into a modern classic in 2001, starring Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim and Mya. It went on to win a Grammy and top the Hot 100 chart for five weeks.\n\nElliott, who came on the music scene alongside mega-producer Timbaland, also worked on multiple songs for the late icon Aaliyah as well as Carey, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige, Destiny's Child, Fantasia, Jazmine Sullivan, SWV, Total, Tweet and others.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline: http://www.songhall.org", "The U.N. and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent on Wednesday completed a desperately needed aid delivery to displaced Syrians in a remote desert camp near the border with Jordan.\n\nFadwa Abed Rabbou Baroud, of the U.N. Office of the Resident Coordinator, said the delivery to the Rukban camp included a month's worth of food, as well as medicine, clothes and vaccinations.\n\nNearly 50,000 people are stranded in the desert and had received no aid since January. At least four people have died in the past month due to malnutrition and extremely limited access to medical care.\n\nThe Syrian government and its ally Russia have blamed U.S. troops stationed nearby for failing to provide security for aid shipments, allegations denied by the Americans. Jordan closed the border over security concerns.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a Palestinian official said Syrian President Bashar Assad has instructed the government to start taking measures for the return of civilians to the refugee camp of Yarmouk in the capital Damascus.\n\nYarmouk, the largest refugee camp and once a home to tens of thousands, suffered massive destruction during the seven-year conflict and hardly a building is not damaged in the sprawling camp south of Damascus. Until earlier this year, large parts of it were controlled by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida-linked fighters.\n\nKhaled Abdul-Majid, secretary of the follow-up committee of the Damascus-based allied Palestinian factions, told The Associated Press that the decision reflects the Syrian government's commitment to support the Palestinian cause.\n\nAbdul-Majid said that he was informed of the decision on Monday, noting that there were around 200,000 Palestinians in the camp before the crisis, in addition to around 1 million Syrians who were settling in and around the camp.\n\nHe said the reconstruction process would be fulfilled by the Syrian government, the Palestinian Authority, other Palestinian groups and Palestinian businessmen.\n\nAbdul-Majid stressed that several neighborhoods in the camp, about 40 percent of it, are still habitable, adding that around 40 percent of the camp needs to be restored and 20 percent is totally destroyed.\n\nHe indicated that around 160,000 Palestinians left Syria during the crisis out of 650,000, who were residing in camps nationwide.", "When small business owners want to take on partners, the selection process needs to be carried out thoughtfully and deliberately. The wrong choice can doom not only the partnership, but the company.\n\nSome things to consider before entering into a partnership:\n\n\u2014 When picking a partner, use the kind of vetting process used to hire an employee. That means some intense conversations with a lot of questions about qualifications, expectations, short-term and long-term goals, even philosophies about doing business. Owners shouldn't take shortcuts \u2014 even if a potential partner is a friend of a friend, that's no guarantee they'll be a good fit for a company. Owners should ask a prospect's co-workers or business associates about their professional strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u2014 Look for a partner whose knowledge and skills complement yours. Don't automatically choose a partner who knows as much as you do, or whose knowledge matches yours. \"There's no benefit to the partnership if you're not learning anything new,\" says Michael Howard, a management professor at Texas A&M University's Mays Business School says. At the same time, some overlap is needed so you and your partner \"are speaking the same language,\" he says.\n\n\u2014 Partnerships are more likely to succeed if all the partners are making some kind of investment \u2014 either money or equipment or another form of property \u2014 in the company, says Sandy Jap, a marketing professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School who has done research into partner selection.\n\n\"That way, you have people who are dedicated and who are working on making this partnership work,\" Jap says. \"They'll do what's best and they'll stay with the partnership.\"\n\n\u2014 Have an attorney with expertise in partnerships draw up the agreement that will not only form the partnership, but also govern how it will be unwound.\n\n\u2014 When the partnership is up and running, remember that there are going to be disagreements, and that they can help a company grow in the long run.\n\n\"Even the best of partnerships, and especially long-term partnerships, are not without friction,\" Jap says.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

A month into the partnership, something was wrong.\n\nJackson's partner was supposed to handle half the company's workload, but that didn't happen. So, Jackson began taking on more of the responsibilities. When Jackson tried to discuss the division of work, \"she was a little defensive at first, and asked me to be patient.\" The situation didn't improve, and they agreed to part at the end of last year, just three months after the partnership began. But under their partnership agreement, drawn up without an attorney, dividing the company's assets would have weakened it financially. The partners decided to close, and Jackson lost her company.\n\nThe failure of a partnership often brings hard lessons for company owners. Problems often start when prospective partners don't think through all the ramifications of what they're doing \u2014 including whether they'll be a good fit. They may not be clear on their expectations for each other, and how they'll resolve conflicts. And they may not consider the legal consequences of how they set up their partnership, and how difficult it might be to unwind it; rather than hire an attorney, they write their own agreement that can be problematic when the relationship turns sour.\n\nJackson's experience taught her that she needed to be more strategic in her business decisions. And in choosing a partner \u2014 Jackson had met hers through a mutual acquaintance,\n\n\"You need to make sure you know the person well enough to know what their strengths are and their weaknesses,\" says Jackson, who lost her enthusiasm for retailing after the company closed. She now is the sole owner of an information technology company in Tampa, Florida.\n\nOwners are so caught up in the idea of finding a partner to get investment money, help and expertise that they don't do the kind of due diligence they would do before hiring an employee, says Michael Howard, a management professor at Texas A&M University's Mays Business School.\n\n\"What will happen when you grow? What's your process for resolving problems? How should we manage this project? If you ask these kind of questions, it could reveal a lot of problems in advance,\" Howard says.\n\nWhile partnering with strangers has potential pitfalls, so does going into business with friends.\n\n\"It's important to have trust and strong social ties, but if maintaining them comes at the loss of business success, that's not really appropriate,\" Howard says.\n\nPartners also need to be sure they share the same goals for the business, or at least understand what their differences are.\n\n\"You need to talk up front about what your expectations are, for long term, short term, two-year and five-year picture,\" says Sandy Jap, a marketing professor at Emory University's Goizueta Business School who has done research into partner selection. She suggests owners talk to other people who have worked with their prospective partners, in much the same way they'd check a job candidate's references.\n\nLisa Shepherd needed cash to help her marketing business grow, so she gave three employees equity stakes. Within two years, the deal went bad as the four owners argued over whether to reinvest earnings into the business or distribute the profits among the partners. They also disagreed about workloads \u2014 \"each person thought that he or she was working incredibly hard, while the others weren't,\" says Shepherd, owner of The Mezzanine Group, based in Toronto.\n\nOne point of contention came as the partners who did the day-to-day work accused Shepherd of going out for lunch too often rather than working although those meetings led to new business.\n\n\"My work was outside the company, networking, opening doors,\" Shepherd says. They thought, 'she's having a grand old time and not doing any work.'\"\n\nShepherd did have an attorney draw up a partnership agreement at the start, ultimately the \"best business decision ever, worth its weight in gold,\" because it took just two months to end the partnership. Since she held a 55 percent stake, Shepherd was able to buy her partners out and retain ownership. Still, she says, \"it was emotionally devastating. I had thought that everything would go well and having partners in the business would be utopia.\"\n\nToday Shepherd is a sole proprietor. She has a profit-sharing plan for her general manager but doesn't plan to bring on another partner.\n\nEven when a partnership is long-lived, there can be hard lessons \u2014 among them, facing the fact that the partnership doesn't work anymore.\n\n\"You need to get good at saying goodbye when the value in the relationship does end,\" says Jap, the Emory professor. A breakup may be necessary even if the company is successful.\n\nAntonio Argibay's partnership lasted more than 30 years, but during its last decade, the partners no longer agreed about the direction the architectural firm should take. But breaking up was difficult.\n\n\"It was always, things are too tough, there's a downturn, or things are going great. It was never the right time,\" says Argibay, now the sole proprietor of New York-based Meridian Design Associates.\n\nFinally, in 2013, they decided Argibay should buy his partner out, but it still took six months for them and their attorneys to work out the details. One problem was the fact the partners had a 50-50 split. \"There's no way to break a tie. Someone has to withdraw, win or lose,\" Agibay says.\n\nHis takeaway from his partnership: \"Without a clear, shared vision, the business was not going to survive.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nThe cancellation comes amid North Korean threats to restart its nuclear development unless the U.S. begins to remove sanctions -- a step the administration says it will not take until North Korea meaningfully moves to denuclearize, which it so far has not done.\n\nThe meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, the former spy chief and now top nuclear negotiator, \"will now take place at a later date ... when our respective schedules permit,\" the U.S. side said just after midnight on Wednesday, hours before Pompeo was supposed to travel to New York.\n\nIt did not specify why the meetings were postponed or at which side's request.\n\nKorean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP\n\nBut it comes amid renewed doubts about the Trump administration's efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief. That effort has stalled, with North Korea refusing to declare the details of its nuclear capabilities or, so far, allow international inspectors into the country to verify claims that is has dismantled certain sites.\n\nThe State Department had been touting an agreement signed by Pompeo during the last U.S.-North Korean meetings in Pyongyang in early October. Then, North Korea agreed to allow inspectors to visit its missile engine test site and nuclear test site. Pompeo said on October 8 that those inspectors would visit North Korea \"as soon as we get it logistically worked out.\"\n\nThey still have not visited. Instead of following through on that, in recent days North Korea has been criticizing the U.S. over its sanctions, threatening last Friday to bring back its \"byongjin\" policy -- advancing its nuclear arsenal and economic development at the same time. On Sunday, Pompeo dismissed that as posturing ahead of negotiations this week.\n\nThe statement did not threaten to end nuclear negotiations, however, and the North Koreans are said to still be pursuing a second summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. One of the main goals of this week's planned meeting was to ensure that the summit was productive, according to Pompeo, by preparing some agreements for the two leaders to sign.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the cancellation, South Korea tried to quell concerns Wednesday, with presidential spokesperson Kim Eui-kyeom telling reporters, \"We don't believe that the delay means the North Korea-U.S. summit won't happen or momentum for the summit has been lost,\" according to Reuters.\n\nBut the growing divide between the U.S. and South Korea also has many concerned, as liberal President Moon Jae-in pushes for closer Korean ties including demilitarizing the border and increasing economic cooperation. That has put him at odds at times with the Trump administration, including when requesting sanctions exemptions for joint economic projects with the North.\n\nPompeo was reportedly incensed in September at a military agreement between the two Korea's, with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha saying Pompeo called her twice in one day to express his displeasure because he felt he had not been adequately briefed.\n\nTo that end, the U.S. and South Korea announced last week the creation of a new working group to \"strengthen our close coordination,\" including on \"sanctions implementation and inter-Korean cooperation that comply with the United Nations sanctions,\" according to State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino.", "Imagine Dragons, \"Origins\" (Interscope/KIDinaKORNER)\n\nDo Imagine Dragons ever sleep? Not apparently.\n\nLess than a year and a half after releasing the double-platinum album \"Evolve\" and crisscrossing the globe on a 100-date tour, the band is back with a dozen new songs. Whew.\n\n\"Origins\" is supposed to be a sister companion to last year's monster \"Evolve\" and it's an intriguing follow-up, offering more textures and sonic experiments. If \"Evolve\" was the band stalking around as an arena powerhouse, \"Origins\" is their quirky little sister, making cool stuff in her bedroom.\n\nDon't let the first single, \"Natural,\" fool you. That slice of bombastic, fist-pumping bravado seems to indicate more of the same on \"Origins,\" but they drift into other areas, like the blissed-out summer jam \"Cool Out\" that could be on a DNCE album, and the gloriously anarchic, disruptive \"Digital,\" which plays with dub step and chops itself into pieces.\n\nThe album sees the Dragons again reteaming with producers Alex da Kid and Mattman & Robin \u2014 folks who have delivered some of the band's biggest hits \u2014 but, to everyone's credit, not doing more of the same.\n\n\"Bullet in a Gun\" is fresh with unpredictable electronic flourishes, and the club-ready \"Only\" has interesting temp shifts and unexpected layered parts, as if the Dragons are fighting monotony this time. \"West Coast\" is basically a folky tune that could happily sit in a Lumineers album \u2014 how's that for predictable?\n\nLyrically, \"Origins\" dwells on modern-day alienation and the band's own uncomfortable relationship to its own fame. On \"Zero,\" lead singer Dan Reynolds reminds everyone he once felt empty and unreal. On the moody \"Bullet in a Gun,\" he notes sadly: \"To make a name you pay the price\" and later the words \"sellout, sellout, sellout!\" are heard.\n\nThe Dragons also explore a dehumanizing digital world, like in their plea for \"Love,\" where Reynolds notes everyone tones out shocking news: \"We put on our headphones.\" Elsewhere, he screams: \"I'm not a part of your machine/I am the machine.\"\n\nThe new album extends the band's flirtation with Charles Darwin \u2014 taking its name from \"On the Origin of Species\" and coming right after \"Evolve.\" In some ways, the names should be reversed: \"Origins\" shows their sound really evolving.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "Transcript for News headlines today: Nov. 7, 2018\n\nDemocrats fled the house Republicans hold on Dylan gain seats in this senate.

He was to attend a demonstration by Macedonian special forces in the capital, Skopje.\n\nThe country's government has proposed changing the country's name to North Macedonia to end a longstanding dispute with Greece that has blocked NATO accession.\n\nShepro said Macedonia has made \"substantial progress\" toward NATO membership.

Jay Inslee voted Tuesday to recommend a three- to five-year moratorium on viewing southern resident killer whales by all boats in Puget Sound.\n\nDisturbances and noise from boats can interfere with the whale's ability to find food or communicate, and supporters said it would protect the whales. Critics said it doesn't address the larger issue of dwindling food supply and it would be devastating for the industry.\n\nThe proposed moratorium would not apply to boats viewing other whales in the region, including gray or transient whales.\n\nThe endangered orcas struggle from pollution, boat noise and lack of chinook salmon, which have been declining because of dams, habitat loss and overfishing.\n\nThe task force plans to forward its recommendations to the governor next week. He'll consider the ideas as he proposes a budget and potential legislation that will also go before the Legislature.\n\nAmong the more contentious ideas, the task force is recommending that the state set up a stakeholder process to address issues related to the possible breaching or removal of the four Snake River dams in eastern Washington.\n\nSome argue the best way to get more salmon to the starving whales is to tear down four dams on the lower Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, to help migrating fish.\n\nCritics say doing so would hurt the livelihood of many who depend on those dams for navigation, recreation and hydropower.\n\nThe group also recommended spilling more water over Columbia and Snake river dams when juvenile salmon are migrating so they can avoid harm going through the turbines.\n\nOther recommendations include supporting legislation before Congress that would make it easier for Washington, Idaho, Oregon and tribes to kill more sea lions and seals in the lower Columbia River.\n\nOther proposals being forwarded: Establishing an emergency rescue tug to response to potential oil spills off San Juan Island; protect habitat for chinook salmon and the smaller forage fish that they eat; and boost production of hatchery chinook salmon preferred by the orcas.\n\nBrian Goodremont, representing the Pacific Whale Watch Association, told others on the task force Tuesday that a moratorium on watching the endangered orcas would be devastating financially to the industry, cost jobs and hurt a lot of people.\n\n\"Talking about prohibitions is the nuclear option for us,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that the proposed moratorium would apply only to boats watching the critically endangered population of orcas.", "Transcript for NYC subway terror bombing suspect found guilty\n\nThe man convicted in a botched bombing beneath the Port Authority bus terminal says he did it because he was angry at president from jurors found not try it all up.

Some are waiting to see how President Donald Trump will now confront a hostile Democrat Congress that has pledged to block his most radical actions and launch fresh probes into possible collusion with Russia by members of his campaign.\n\n\u201cTrump will have to act a lot more carefully,\u201d Konstantin Kosachev, who heads Russia\u2019s senate foreign affairs committee, said on the state TV channel Russia 24.\n\nRussian officials and state media also raised the question of impeachment though they noted Republican control of the Senate would likely neuter any attempt by Democrats to move against Trump.\n\nSome said they believed the investigation into possible Russian collusion around Trump would receive fresh impetus under a Democratic House. Kosachev said he thought Democrats might seek to trip Trump into committing perjury by making him testify before them under oath, thereby giving them grounds for impeachment.\n\n\u201cIn this sense, Trump is facing unpleasant trials,\u201d said Kosachev. \u201cAt a minimum emotionally, at the most politically.\u201d\n\nRussian officials have largely retained some hope that Trump may yet follow through on promises to seek better relations with Moscow. Russian officials are bracing themselves for a new round of U.S. sanctions that the State Department has said will have to be imposed over Russia's use of a nerve agent in Britain last March.\n\nU.S. security officials and social media companies had warned that Russian operatives were again seeking to influence the midterm election as they had in 2016. In October, the Department of Justice indicted a Russian woman it accused of overseeing a campaign targeting the midterms that was being conducted by the same so-called \u201ctroll factory\u201d based in St. Petersburg that spread hundreds of thousands of divisive posts on American social media during 2016.\n\nKyle Grillot/Reuters\n\nThe day before the vote, Facebook released a statement saying it had blocked 30 Facebook and 85 Instagram accounts after U.S. law enforcement alerted the company that the accounts seemed to be fake and operating on behalf of foreign entities. Facebook said it was still investigating who the accounts belonged to, noting some had been posting in Russian and French. It said it would inform the public once it had more information, including whether the accounts were connected to the so-called Internet Research Agency, another name for the company behind the St. Petersburg \"troll factory\" that has been linked to a businessman close to Putin.\n\nOn Wednesday, Peskov repeated Russia\u2019s denial that it has ever sought to meddle in American elections.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, despite those phobias which exist in the United States, Russia has not interfered, is not interfering and does not intend to interfere in the electoral processes of a single country in the world, including the U.S.,\u201d Peskov said.", "Have you ever bottle-fed Irish sheep?

Big-name technology and consumer and health care companies soared as the S&P 500 index closed at its highest level in four weeks.\n\nDemocrats won control of the House of Representatives while Republicans kept a majority in the Senate, as most polls had suggested. It's not clear how the divided Congress will work with Republican President Donald Trump, but if the possibilities for compromise and big agenda items seem limited, Wall Street is fine with that because it means politics is that much less likely to crowd out the performance of the strong U.S. economy.\n\n\"The market likes when what it expects to happen happens,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief markets strategist for TD Ameritrade. \"We haven't had that happen in a little while, when you think about major events like Brexit or the presidential election.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 index climbed 58.44 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,813.89. The index has risen six out of the last seven days to recover most of the losses it suffered in October.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 545.29 points, or 2.1 percent, o 26,180.30. The Nasdaq composite climbed 194.79 points, or 2.6 percent, to 7,570.75. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 26.06 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,582.16. Three-fourths of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded higher.\n\nHistorically markets have performed well after midterm elections and with split control of Congress.\n\nStocks are off to a strong start in November, and the S&P 500 is up 3.8 percent so far this month. That follows a swoon in October that knocked the S&P 500 down nearly 7 percent as investors worried about rising interest rates and the U.S.-China trade dispute.\n\nHigh-growth stocks took an especially brutal beating last month. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said it will be worth watching to see if investors are willing to buy those stocks again or if they continue to prefer slower-growing, more \"defensive\" companies like utilities and household goods makers.\n\nOn Wednesday investors bet on growth. Amazon jumped 6.9 percent to $1,755.49 and Microsoft gained 3.9 percent to $111.96, while Google's parent company, Alphabet, picked up 3.6 percent to $1,108.24.\n\nSteady, \"defensive\" stocks lagged the rest of the stock market. Those companies, which include utilities and household goods makers, tend to do well when stocks are in turmoil, but they're less appealing when investors are betting on economic growth.\n\nIndustrial companies made strong gains, but they didn't do as well as the rest of the market. While some investors hope that Trump and Congressional leadership will pass an infrastructure stimulus bill, they've had those hopes dashed more than once since he took office.\n\nIt's not clear how the elections will affect the Trump policy Wall Street might be most concerned about: the trade dispute with China. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports and threatened additional tariffs on top of those. Beijing has responded with tariffs on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nA primary concern in Asia is the potential for trade tensions to hobble growth for export-reliant economies.\n\nEconomists at S&P Global, Oxford Economics and the Bank of America all agreed that government gridlock will likely result from the Democrats winning control of the House. But they don't think a stalemate will automatically hinder economic growth.\n\nIt's more likely that government will play less of a role in spurring economic growth in 2019 and 2020. As a result, the health of the global economy, interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and spending by U.S. consumers and companies will have a bigger impact on determining the pace of growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also meeting Wednesday and Thursday. It's not expected to raise interest rates this month, but investors believe it will do so in December.\n\nBanks also didn't rise as much other stocks. Republicans had discussed a new round of tax cuts if they maintained full control over Congress, which would have expanded the government's deficits further and required it to issue more debt. Government bond yields spiked overnight after a batch of strong early results for some GOP candidates, but then headed lower as Democrats' fortunes improved, making a new tax cut package unlikely.\n\nDemocrats' victory in the House also means that Rep. Maxine Waters will likely become chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the nation's banking system and its regulators. Waters has called for more regulation of banks, and has been vocal about Trump political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly, to 3.22 percent. It spiked as high as 3.25 percent Tuesday night.\n\nThe U.S. dollar also weakened. The ICE US dollar index fell 0.2 percent. The U.S. currency fell to 113.34 yen from 113.40 yen, and the euro climbed to $1.1455 from $1.1413.\n\nMajor indexes in Europe climbed. The French CAC 40 jumped 1.2 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 1.1 percent. The DAX in Germany rose 0.8 percent.\n\nOctober is historically a rough month for stocks, though markets usually rise after midterm elections regardless of how the political landscape may change because Wall Street is glad to have more certainty.\n\nDemocrats' win in the House means Republicans won't be able to take another shot at repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. Voters in Idaho and Nebraska all voted to expand Medicaid, and the winning gubernatorial candidates in Maine and Kansas also favor expanding Medicaid benefits. Voting on a Medicaid expansion proposition in Utah was too close to call.\n\nHealth insurers, hospital operators and Medicaid program operators all jumped. UnitedHealth gained 4.2 percent to $274.63 and hospital company HCA added 4.7 percent to $141.65. Molina, a provider of Medicaid-related services, surged 10.5 percent to $137.32.\n\nMarijuana stocks jumped after Michigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana and Utah and Missouri voters approved medical marijuana measures. The stocks rose even further after the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who promoted more aggressive enforcement of those laws. Tilray vaulted 30.6 percent to $139.60 and Canopy Growth rose 8.2 percent to $46.07.\n\nOil prices continued to fall. U.S. crude lost 0.9 percent to $61.67, and Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, dipped 0.1 percent to $72.07 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline lost 2.8 percent to $1.65 a gallon and heating oil rose 2.2 percent to $2.24 a gallon. Natural gas was unchanged at $3.56 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose 0.2 percent to $1,228.70 an ounce. Silver picked up 0.5 percent to $14.57 an ounce. Copper added 0.8 percent to $2.75 a pound.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent higher.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP\n\nKen Sweet in New York, Josh Boak in Washington, Pan Pylas in London and Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.", "The Latest on independence commemorations planned in Poland (all times local):\n\n6:15 p.m.\n\nA Polish official says the president and the prime minister are organizing a march at which all Poles can join together Sunday to mark the centennial of Polish Independence.\n\nThe announcement of the state event comes after the Warsaw city mayor earlier in the day banned a march by radical nationalists that has marred Poland's international reputation in the past and proven deeply divisive at home.\n\nBlazej Spychalski, a spokesman for President Andrzej Duda, said the president and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki decided to hold the march after consulting with war veterans.\n\nHe invited all Poles to march with the national flags Sunday to show that \"we are one white-and-red team,\" a reference to the national colors.\n\nPoland became independent on Nov. 11, 1918, at the end of World War I.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:25 p.m.\n\nThe mayor of Warsaw is banning a march that radical Polish nationalists had planned for Sunday to coincide with Poland's Independence Day.\n\nMayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said Wednesday her decision is meant to end the \"aggressive nationalism\" that has been a feature of far-right events for the past decade on the November 11 national holiday.\n\nA similar move was taken in the western Polish city of Wroclaw on Tuesday.\n\nThe bans come amid signals that radical far-right groups planned to travel to Poland for the day and as police have staged mass walk-outs that raised security concerns.\n\nThis year, Poland is celebrating the centenary of its independence, gained in 1918 at the end of World War I.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nA monument to the late President Lech Kaczynski has been installed in a central Warsaw square ahead of its unveiling as part of celebrations marking Poland's 100 years of independence.\n\nKaczynski, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia, was the twin brother of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the current ruling party, Law and Justice.\n\nPlans for the statue have been a point of political contention, with the city authorities \u2014 in the hands of the political opposition \u2014 opposed to the statue, and the provincial authorities in favor.\n\nThe bronze statue will be unveiled Saturday evening ahead of centennial commemorations on Sunday.

But soon after, the press conference took a turn, and while standing at the podium the president quarreled with Democrats, the press, and even members of his own party.\n\nThe president fired off what rang out like warning shots for Republicans who hesitated to embrace Trumpism and House Democrats who have threatened a flurry of investigations. The president also tangled with reporters in pugnacious exchanges about his rhetoric on the campaign trail and messaging towards the migrant caravan which some critics say was racist. Still buoyed by what he viewed as successful midterm results, Trump scoffed at the potential for a legally messy year with Democrats controlling the House.\n\nMandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president said he would not be able to work with Democrats in Congress on legislation if they used the subpoena power and opened up investigations into him.\n\n\"No, if they do that then all it is is a war-like posture,\" Trump said.\n\n\u201cI hear about investigations \u2013 fatigue. They\u2019ve been giving us this investigation fatigue. It\u2019s been a long time. They\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey can play that game but we can play it better. It\u2019s called the U.S. Senate,\u201d the president said.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nDemocrats say they hope to subpoena the president for his still unreleased tax returns.\n\nBut when asked to say point blank whether or not he would turn over his taxes, the president said he would consider if he still weren\u2019t under audit.\n\n\u201cIf I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it,\u201d Trump said in response to a question for ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl. Trump said he will wait until after the audit is completed.\n\nThe president expressed frustration with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and said he could end the probe \"right now.\"\n\n\"I could fire everybody right now. But I don't want to stop it. Because politically, I don't like stopping it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has frequently said he is disappointed in Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said he would answer a question about firing Sessions and potential Cabinet changes at a \u201cdifferent time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a hot country. This is a hot White House,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are a White House that people want to work with.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the president called CNN's Jim Acosta, who asked about the inflammatory campaign ad about undocumented migrants that was pulled by major television networks, a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\n\"I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN,\u201d the president retorted. Visibly angered by being repeatedly asked about the caravan -- he told Acosta to \u201cput down the mic.\u201d\n\nPBS NewsHour reporter Yamiche Alcindo, who is African American, asked the president if his embrace of the term \"nationalist\" embolded white nationalism.\n\n\"That's such a racist question. Honestly, I know you have it written down, that's a racist question,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I love our country. I do. You have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world and I don't mind helping the world but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems excuse me but to say that what you said is so insulting to me. It's a very terrible thing that you said.\"\n\nThat fiery tone was questioned by reporters in the room who cited the divided nation. The president said he would like to have a better tone, but pointed his finger at the media.\n\n\u201cI'd be very good at a low tone, but when things are done not correctly about you,\u201d Trump said, \"you have to defend yourself. It\u2019s much easier than what I have to do. Going around is much easier than facing someone when you\u2019re being treated unfairly. You know what, when you have to fight \u2013 all the time fight \u2013 you really can\u2019t do lower.\u201d\n\nThe president has credited his constant campaigning and endorsements to the success of election night Republican wins. In the final days of the midterm election, Trump crisscrossed the country stumping for the GOP. He said one of the reasons Republican seats flipped to Democrats was that he could not campaign everywhere.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama campaigned very hard in Georgia. Oprah Winfrey campaigned very, very hard all over the television. I said that this is going to be tough. I only had me. I did not have anybody else,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHowever, Vice President Pence, his son Donald Trump Jr., and Republican surrogates, including Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, campaigned.\n\nIn a shocking political moment standing at the podium from the East Room, the president mocked Republicans who did not embrace him and lost.\n\n\u201cThey did very badly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should be happy or sad.\u201d\n\nHe then called out losing Republican members by name for rejecting his support.\n\n\u201cMia Love gave me no love and she lost. Sorry Mia,\u201d Trump said. He also called out Republicans in swing districts like Barbara Comstock in Virginia and Peter Roskam in Illinois.\n\nDespite losing the House, the president said he thought the election proved he was popular.\n\n\u201cI think people like me, I think people like the job I'm doing,\" Trump said.\n\n\u201cIt was a big day yesterday, an incredible day and last night the Republican party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the\u201d midterm year, Trump said. \u201cI thought it was very close to complete victory.\u201d\n\nTrump earlier took to Twitter to congratulate Republican winners, to bid adieu to Republican losers who didn't embrace him and to say that now he has a clear path toward \"foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals.\"\n\n\"Those that worked with me ... did very well,\" the president tweeted. \"Those that did not, say goodbye!\" As was widely expected, Democrats took back the House and Republicans maintained their Senate dominance. Americans elected the first Muslim and Native American women among a record 110 women projected to join Congress.\n\nThere are many potential takeaways from Election Day 2018. Here are a few of the president's from Wednesday morning:\n\nReceived so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done! \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nThose that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2018\n\nWhen the new Congress begins in early January, it will look quite a bit different to the president.\n\n\"President Trump has been eroding the foundations of our democracy,\" Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D-Md., the ranking mMember of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in a statement released Wednesday. \"He has been degrading the vision of our Founding Fathers -- from attacking the right to vote to undermining the freedom of the press.\n\n\"Yesterday, the American people voted to change that. They voted for transparency and accountability. They voted to make sure our government works effectively and efficiently for the American people. And they voted to bring integrity back to government. As part of that mandate, I plan to shine a light on waste, fraud, and abuse in the Trump Administration. I want to probe senior Administration officials across the government who have abused their positions of power and wasted taxpayer money, as well as President Trump's decisions to act in his own financial self-interest rather than the best interests of the American people.\"", "Troops from a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition pounded Houthi rebel positions in Yemen's Hodeida with airstrikes and a ground assault on Wednesday and now control a major road leading into the city, military officials and witnesses on both sides of the front line said.\n\nAn Emirati-trained force known as the Giants, backed by Apache attack helicopters, secured an urban area along 50th Street, which leads to the city's key Red Sea port facilities some 5 kilometers (3 miles) away, they added.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals or lack of authorization to brief journalists, they said that the Iran-backed Shiite rebels had been firing mainly from elevated and rooftop sniper positions, and have now resorted to burning tires to obscure the gunships' view. Most civilians have fled the area, they said.\n\nDozens of fighters have been killed and hundreds wounded from both sides since a renewed coalition offensive on the city began five days ago, following calls by the Trump administration for a cease-fire by late November.\n\nThe fighting has left dead bodies lying on the ground and inside burnt-out vehicles at the city's edge, according to witnesses. They said several civilians have been killed by shelling in residential areas.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which seeks to restore to power the internationally recognized Yemeni government, has been at war with the Houthis since March 2015. The stalemated conflict has generated the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nHodeida, the main portal for humanitarian aid to the suffering population, has become the epicenter of the conflict.\n\nA Save the Children supported health facility in Hodeida came under attack on Tuesday morning, damaging one of the pharmacies that supply life-saving medicines, the charity said in a statement.\n\nThe group said shelling has also hit residential areas in Hodeida, where the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, roughly half of them children, are in danger.\n\nThe charity did not elaborate on which group attacked the facility.\n\nThe head of the U.N.'s food and agriculture agency and other groups say the conflict has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, underlining how the international community is failing to end hunger.\n\n\"We are watching before our eyes an unprecedented human tragedy,\" Food and Agriculture Organization chief Jose Graziano da Silva told a high-level briefing on food insecurity at the U.N. in New York.\n\n\"Yemen is living proof of an apocalyptical equation: conflicts and food security go hand in hand, and when there is an overlap of climate change and conflict, famine is already on the horizon,\" he said.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders said it was closing its humanitarian project in the southern Dhale province due to security concerns amid the fighting there.\n\nBesides Dhale, other active fronts in Yemen include the provinces of Bayda, to the south, and the Houthis' northern strongholds of Hajjah and Saada.\n\nThe United States has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\nIn a statement, rebel leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi described the U.S. cease-fire call as hypocritical, given that fresh fighting erupted almost immediately after it was delivered.\n\n\"The Americans have always sought to escalate, putting out statements of peace while preparing for war,\" he said in comments carried by rebel media channels, saying the new offensive was expected. \"The American role is central and essential in the military operation against our people.\"\n\nThe rebels, who brandish \"Death to America and Israel\" slogans similar to that of the Iranian leadership, accuse the coalition of being stooges of masters in Washington and Israel.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRohan reported from Cairo.", "Rejecting any hint of a setback, President Donald Trump on Wednesday mocked members of his own party who were defeated in the midterm elections after distancing themselves from him and suggested that the Republicans' loss of a House majority could turn out to be \"extremely good\" for him politically.\n\nTrump dissected the elections in a combative White House news conference that stretched to nearly 90 minutes as he put a defiantly glossy sheen on the mixed midterm results and stressed his party's victories in the Senate.\n\n\"I thought it was very close to complete victory,\" Trump said, adding that he would \"almost have to think about\" whether he would have preferred Republicans to retain a slim majority in the House instead of their outright loss. Candidates who embraced his message \"excelled,\" and those who didn't faltered, the president added, ticking off a selective list of defeated Republicans to support his point.\n\nThe president's post-election readout showed his determination to put a positive spin on midterms that will bring an end to GOP control of Congress and open him to Democratic-led investigations in the House. And it made clear the extent to which Trump has remade his party to his own specifications, as he suggested that those who survived were indebted to him, a president who prizes loyalty above all else.\n\nThe results, Trump argued, were proof of his ability to turn out voters. But his message also appeared to alienate well-educated voters \u2014 especially women \u2014 in the suburbs. Democrats surged to their new House majority by picking up seats in more affluent and highly educated suburban districts\n\nBetween his sharp jabs at the press, Trump took credit for Republican wins in the Senate, claiming his \"vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave\" that never fully materialize. He was quick to distance himself from losing GOP House members who had been critical of his heated rhetoric, citing Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo and Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, among others.\n\n\"Too bad, Mike,\" Trump said of Coffman, before turning on Utah's Mia Love, whose race remained too close to call.\n\n\"Mia Love gave me no love and she lost,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's claim that those who backed him were successful was not without exceptions. Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, for example was defeated although he had embraced Trump, with both highlighting their desire to get more of the president's judicial nominees confirmed, a top priority for many social conservatives.\n\nThe president also suggested that, somehow, losing a House majority could be beneficial to his agenda because Democrats will want to work with him.\n\n\"I can see it being extremely good politically,\" he said.\n\nThe president's rebuke was felt on Capitol Hill. Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican from Pennsylvania who announced his retirement earlier this year, tweeted his displeasure: \"To deal w harassment & filth spewed at GOP MOC's in tough seats every day for 2 yrs, bc of POTUS; to bite ur lip more times you'd care to; to disagree & separate from POTUS on principle & civility in ur campaign; to lose bc of POTUS & have him piss on u. Angers me to my core.\"\n\nTrump, who had spent months demonizing Democrats as lawless \"mobs\" and telling his rally crowds that their ascendancy would tank the economy and plunge the nation into crime-ridden chaos, said Wednesday it was time for bipartisan co-operation. He claimed that Democrats \u2014 who made opposing him a centerpiece to their campaign \u2014 would, in fact, be eager to work with him on issues like infrastructure. But the olive branch he extended was studded with thorns as he declared that he would retaliate if Democrats use their control of the House to issue subpoenas to seek his tax returns and investigate his business dealings, his Cabinet's conduct and his campaign's ties to Russia, as expected.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said. \"If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing and government would come to a halt and we're going to blame them.\"\n\nThe White House news conference was punctuated by Trump's escalating attacks on the media. The president repeatedly flashed his temper as he insulted several reporters by name, interrupted their questions, ordered some to sit down and deemed one inquiry about his embrace of the description \"nationalist\" to be \"racist.\"\n\nHis back-and-forth with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over Trump's hard-line immigration rhetoric grew especially heated, with Trump labeling the reporter a \"very rude person\" and saying the outlet \"should be ashamed of itself\" for employing him.\n\nTrump, as he did throughout the campaign, also blamed the media for sowing division in the country and insisted they were to blame for the scene unfolding in the East Room.\n\n\"I come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions and I have people jumping out of their seats shouting questions at me,\" he complained.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Darlene Superville and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Interested in Airlines?

The 2-month-old plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, which the pilots were able to recover from. They decided to fly on to Jakarta at a lower-than-normal altitude.\n\nThe next day, during the deadly crash, the plane hit the water at very high speed just 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Its flight crew had requested permission to return to the airport several minutes after taking off.\n\n\"The point is that after the AOA (sensor) is replaced, the problem is not solved but the problem might even increase. Is this fatal? NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee) wants to explore this,\" he said.\n\nEven if an angle of attack sensor on a jet is faulty, there's generally a backup system in place for the critical component, and pilots are trained to handle a plane safely if those sensors fail, airline safety experts said.\n\nThere are audio signals and physical warnings that can alert the pilot to malfunctioning equipment or other dangers, said Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.\n\n\"They should have been completely engaged in what was going on inside that cockpit, and any kind of warning that came up, they would have been wise to pay attention to it,\" Curtis said.\n\nInvestigators are likely focused on how a single sensor's failure resulted in a faulty command that didn't take into account information from a second sensor, said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.\n\n\"We don't know what the crew knew and didn't know yet,\" Cox said. \"We will.\"\n\nBoeing, which manufactured the Lion Air plane, issues safety-related bulletins, and had previously circulated instructions about what flight crews should do if sensors fail.\n\nIndonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee said it had agreed with Boeing on procedures that the airplane manufacturer should distribute globally on how flight crews can deal with \"angle of attack\" sensor problems.\n\nBut a Boeing statement said a safety bulletin, sent to airlines on Tuesday, directs flight crews to existing guidelines on how they should respond to erroneous \"angle of attack\" data. It wasn't immediately clear if it plans an update, though comments from Indonesian officials indicate they expect one.\n\nIndonesian investigators said their flight procedure recommendations to Boeing were based on how the flight crew responded to problems on the Bali-to-Jakarta flight.\n\n\"The draft of what will be conveyed by Boeing this morning has been presented to us,\" said air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\n\"There are some things that we ask for explanation and some that we ask to be removed, and there has been an agreement between the NTSC and Boeing to release a new procedure to all Boeing 737 MAX users in the world,\" he said.\n\nIndonesia's search and rescue agency on Wednesday extended the search effort for a second time, saying it will continue until Sunday. Body parts are still being recovered and searchers continue to hunt for the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations. It has been expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, a fast-growing region of more than 600 million people.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBusiness Writer Cathy Bussewitz contributed to this report from New York.", "Interested in Germany?

They prayed in Hebrew and German and lit six white candles to commemorate the synagogues that were burned down, as well as the 6 million people who perished in the Holocaust.\n\n\"I lost a big part of my family ... my great-grandparents, their siblings, and therefore it is all very special for me,\" said 15-year-old student Clara Eljaschewitsch. \"It is sad ... I think a lot about it.\"\n\nKristallnacht \u2014 which got its name for the shattered glass from Jewish-owned store windows that covered German streets \u2014 is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. Still it would be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \"Final Solution\" for the Jews of Europe, which would evolve into a policy of mass murder.\n\nTeichtal also condemned the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh last month in which 11 people were gunned down in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\n\n\"It's a terrible shock ... for the Jewish community worldwide. And it shows once again that the ugly head of anti-Semitism can show itself anywhere in the world and we have to actively combat it,\" he said.\n\nBerlin's top security official took a step in this direction on Wednesday, banning a far-right protest planned for Friday, the exact anniversary of Kristallnacht.\n\nIn explaining his decision, state interior minister Andreas Geisel said such a demonstration would \"in a blatant way negate the moral and ethical significance of this memorial day,\" the German news agency dpa reported.", "British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Council President Donald Tusk spoke by phone Wednesday amid signs of movement in deadlocked Brexit talks.\n\nTusk tweeted that the pair spoke \"to take stock of progress in #brexit talks and discuss way ahead.\" Tusk has said he is willing to call a special EU summit if there are new proposals from Britain to unblock talks.\n\nMay's Cabinet has been inching closer to agreeing a common stance on the key issue \u2014 maintaining an open border between EU member Ireland and the U.K.'s Northern Ireland after Britain leaves the EU. The emerging plan involves keeping the U.K. in a customs union with the EU until a permanent trade treaty is worked out, to remove the need for border checks.\n\nBut some pro-Brexit Cabinet ministers want to see legal advice drawn up by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox before they agree to anything. They fear Britain being locked permanently into a customs union with the EU, which would limit the U.K.'s ability to strike new trade deals around the world.\n\nOpposition Labour Party spokesman Keir Starmer also said the legal advice should be published, because \"the public have the right to know precisely what the Cabinet has signed up to and what the implications are for the future.\"\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but divorce negotiations have been hamstrung by divisions within May's Conservative government over how close an economic relationship to seek with the bloc.\n\nSome ministers, including Treasury chief Philip Hammond, want to keep closely aligned with EU rules to avoid barriers to business with Britain's biggest trading partner. Pro-Brexit Cabinet members want a cleaner break so that the U.K. can set its own trade policies and sign new deals around the world.\n\nA document leaked to the BBC suggests the government hopes to bridge the Cabinet divide and strike a deal this month, which would then be put to lawmakers for approval.\n\nThe memo describes how May would try to win parliamentary and public support for an agreement before urging lawmakers to \"put the country's interests first\" and back the deal in Parliament.\n\nThe document appears to consist of notes rather than a finished proposal. May's office did not deny it was genuine but said the document's \"childish language\" and misspellings made clear it \"doesn't represent the government's thinking.\"", "Voters have agreed to fund improved security at a suburban Indianapolis school district where a 13-year-old girl and a teacher were shot in May .\n\nUnofficial results show about 58 percent backed the measure Tuesday to collect an additional $50 million over eight years for Noblesville Schools.

The school acknowledged in August that it has been reducing female applicants' entrance exam scores for years to keep the numbers of female students low.

Angela Merkel plans a pilgrimage in the name of peace. Two German chancellors, with opposite aims and the same destination: a train car in a French forest.\n\nHitler tried literally to rewrite history in 1940 when the Nazi leader commandeered the dining coach to serve France the same humiliation Germany suffered there on the last day of World War I.\n\nThis time, Merkel will have the French president by her side as she visits what remains of the Wagon of Compiegne, the carriage-turned-office where the Allies and Germany signed the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nAn unusual journey took Wagons-Lits Co. carriage 2419D from serving sauteed veal and boeuf bourguignon to passengers in the seaside town of Deauville to serving as a crucible for world peace while stopped in the middle of a forest in Compiegne.\n\nPuzzled tourists often ask Bernard Letemps, the curator of the Armistice Museum, why the Allies signed the cease-fire agreement that ended the atrocities of the Western Front in that humble setting instead of a grand military building or a glittering palace.\n\nAt the time, the official headquarters in Senlis of the Allied commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, would have been the expected place to sign a cease-fire.\n\nBut the town had endured a brutal German assault. Its inhabitants were taken hostage and its mayor shot in September 1914, before the first Battle of the Marne. How the bruised townspeople would react to the presence of a German delegation, even one coming with the goal of peace, was a serious concern.\n\n\"It was out of the question to receive the plenipotentiary Germans in (such a) town,\" Letemps said.\n\nA moveable train carriage in the nearby Compiegne forest was deemed ideal: The isolated location would deter intruders and the calm and secrecy offered a measure of respect to the defeated Germans.\n\nAs it happened, Foch had fitted out a mobile office just the month before \u2014 a dining car chosen at random from the French passenger train fleet. And so 2419D became known as the \"Wagon of Compiegne.\"\n\nThe Armistice was signed just after 5 a.m., but officials held out six hours to put it into effect out of a sense of poetry \u2014 the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. That delay, rather unpoetically, cost lives on both sides at the end of a war that had already left 17 million dead.\n\n\"The train car represents the end of fighting. The end, when people found peace,\" Letemps said.\n\nHe added, smiling: \"It fulfilled its role of dining car before becoming famous.\"\n\nThe Armistice Museum lays on the train tracks on the site of the signing in the middle of forest.\n\nFoch was immortalized in statues ubiquitous across France and gave his name to one of the broad, leafy avenues radiating out from the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe same reception was not reserved for the losing side: One of the Germans to sign the document, Matthias Erzberger, was vilified for his role in the surrender. He was assassinated in 1921.\n\nThe story of dining car 2419D and Compiegne didn't end with the war.\n\nFor throngs of French mourners in the post-war years, the dining car became a shrine to peace and catharsis.\n\nThe car was taken to Paris for display in the courtyard of the Invalides, the final resting place of Napoleon, before it went back to Compiegne in 1927 to sit in a specially-made memorial constructed on the site of today's museum.\n\nLetemps said the wagon received over 190,000 visitors in one year alone in the 1930s as it became a focus for mourning France's 1.4 million fallen soldiers.\n\nFor Hitler in those same years, it became a rallying cry during his ascent to power as he exploited the German public's contempt for the punitive terms of surrender.\n\nThe Nazi leader visited the site in 1940 when his armies conquered France.\n\nThe Fuhrer ordered the dining car brought out of the memorial and returned to the tracks in the spot in the forest it occupied in 1918.\n\nWhat ensued was Hitler's surreal theatrical restaging of the 1918 armistice, one of history's most famous events, with literally the tables' turned.\n\nThe 1940 Armistice was dictated in that train \u2014 with Germany the victor and France the loser.\n\n\"General (Wilhelm) Keitel read the conditions for the Armistice in the car, with Chancellor Hitler sitting in the place of Marshal Foch,\" Letemps said.\n\nHitler then ordered the car to be hauled to Germany and displayed, like a notorious prisoner of war, at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nThe dining car was destroyed at the end of World War II, though how that happened has been lost to time. Some accounts blame members of the Nazi SS, others a random airstrike.\n\nIn 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum \u2014 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. It is parked beside the display of the original car remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.\n\nOn Saturday, Merkel becomes the first German chancellor in 78 years to visit the forest clearing where the end of the globe's first conflict was written.\n\nShe will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron in a scene reminiscent of 1984 when Chancellor Helmut Kohl poignantly held President Francois Mitterrand's hand at an ossuary near Verdun.\n\nOn the centenary of the conflict's end, this visit will make for soul-searing images of its own.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamson\u2014K\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFull coverage of WWI commemoration events at: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\"World War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition\" is available now exclusively on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U", "Thailand's Supreme Court on Wednesday restored a 37-year prison term given to a gunman convicted of shooting four people during 2014 political violence.\n\nVivat Yodprasert was dubbed the \"Popcorn Gunman\" because he opened fire with an assault rifle concealed in a sack with the word \"POPCORN\" emblazoned on it. He was part of a mob that sought to disrupt preparations for an election during unrest that led to a May 2014 military takeover.\n\nThe court ruling overturned an appellate court's dismissal of the conviction, confirming him guilty of attempted murder, possession of guns and ammunition without a license and related charges. One of the people he wounded was a 72-year-old man who was left paralyzed and died seven months after the shooting.\n\nThe appellate court ruled last year that there was not enough evidence to convict Vivat in the shootings, which were carried out by a man wearing a balaclava to conceal his identity. In his original trial, Vivat received a 37-year, 4-month sentence, partly on the basis of a confession to police, but also because the shooting was carried out in front of hundreds of people and was captured in many photos and videos that served as evidence. However, he recanted his confession in court, claiming he had been tortured.\n\nThe shooter was believed to have fired his weapon from inside the sack in order to catch the used bullet casings so they could not be gathered as evidence.\n\nVivat has already spent around four years in detention, having been denied bail and kept in prison while his earlier acquittal was under appeal.\n\nHe displayed no emotion as Wednesday's verdict was delivered and had a brief exchange with relatives and his lawyer before officials sent him back to Bang Kwang prison.\n\nHis lawyer, Puangthip Boonsanong, said she respected the court's decision even though she had expected Vivat's acquittal to stand. She said she would now begin the process of requesting a royal pardon.\n\nThe February 2014 confrontation was one of several bloody incidents in months of unrest stirred up by opponents of then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra's government, who called themselves the People's Democratic Reform Committee.

He is despised for his complicity in the Holocaust.\n\n\"I pardon nothing, but I erase nothing of our history,\" Macron added.\n\nThe French presidency later said that only the five top military chiefs who are interred in the Invalides will be individually honored and have their names cited in the ceremony \u2014not including Petain.\n\nMacron will not attend the military ceremony.\n\nThe 40-year-old French president, sliding in polls, is gaining a reputation for making awkward or shocking statements. In September he told a young out-of-work gardener that he need only \"cross the street\" to find a job.\n\nBut Wednesday's remarks struck a deep chord in a nation that has lived through two world wars and only in recent decades has acknowledged its collaborationist past.\n\nFormer President Jacques Chirac admitted in 1995 that Petain's Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis, was the French state. Chirac spoke at the Vel' d'Hiv cycling stadium in Paris, known for a 1942 roundup of French Jews that saw 13,000 people deported to Nazi concentration camps, a third of them children.\n\nFrance's leading Jewish organization, known by the initials CRIF, issued a searing criticism of Macron's stance.\n\n\"I am shocked by this statement by Macron,\" CRIF president Francis Kalifat told The Associated Press. \"Petain was the person who allowed the deportation of 76,000 French Jews to death camps. Petain signed the (law on) the status of Jews that meant Jews were excluded from public functions, education and forced to wear the Jewish star.\"\n\nFrench politicians voiced outrage and a sense of weariness at Macron's repeated gaffes, with far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon capturing the sense of indignity.\n\n\"Macron, this time, it's too much. The History of France isn't your toy,\" Melenchon tweeted. \"This anti-Semitic traitor cannot be amnestied by the caprice of Macron.\"\n\nKalifat said it was \"an insult\" that a French president could honor Petain on \"the same level as the other generals.\" But he acknowledged the marshal's pivotal role in the Great War that earned him the nickname \"Lion of Verdun.\"\n\nFrench government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux insisted the issue was a \"false controversy.\" He quoted Gen. Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French forces in World War II and the nation's universal hero, as saying of Petain in 1966 that \"the glory he earned in Verdun .... can be neither contested nor go unrecognized by the nation.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFull coverage of WWI commemoration events at: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

But vehicle safety is changing dramatically. The latest vehicles have safety features that can help prevent an accident in the first place. A potential problem, however, is that drivers aren't fully ready for them.\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety , a significant number of drivers with new vehicles don't know what these new advanced driver safety systems can do. Others do not trust them or assume they provide greater security than they actually do. If your car has some of these advanced safety systems, or you're planning on buying a new car soon, here's what you need to know.\n\nADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES HELP PREVENT CRASHES\n\nThe most common advanced driver safety aids include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking; lane departure warning or lane keeping assist; blind-spot monitoring; and rear cross-traffic alert and/or rear automatic braking. In general, these systems use a variety of sensors to identify and warn the driver about possibly hazardous situations. If the driver doesn't take action, the vehicle can also potentially mitigate or avoid an accident by applying its own corrective braking and steering.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has studied these technologies by comparing rates of police-recorded crashes and insurance claims for vehicles with and without the features. For example, the rate of front-to-rear crashes involving a vehicle with a forward collision warning system and automatic braking is 50 percent lower than when a car without such a system is involved.\n\nHOW TO SHOP FOR A CAR WITH THESE FEATURES\n\nThe rapid change in safety technology is difficult for car shoppers to assimilate. Few people pay attention to new features in the car market until it's time to buy a new car. Automakers try to explain and hype their own systems, but the various branded names such as Safety Sense P, Co-Pilot360 and SafetyTec can just sound like a lot of mumbo jumbo to the uninitiated.\n\nAdditionally, the availability of these features can vary greatly. Certain models might offer them, but only as options and only on certain trim levels. Take the popular Chevrolet Traverse crossover SUV, for example. Blind-spot monitoring is either not available, optional or standard depending on which trim level and powertrain you select. Want forward collision warning, automatic braking and lane departure warning? They aren't available at all until you pony up for the Traverse's most expensive trim levels.\n\nWalking into a dealership and just picking a vehicle off the lot is a recipe for confusion and not getting what you want. A better way is to do your research beforehand. For a new vehicle you're interested in, look up on the internet what the automaker calls its safety features and examine the features associated with the vehicle's trim levels. You can also ask a knowledgeable salesperson.\n\nLEARN HOW YOUR CAR'S FEATURES OPERATE\n\nYou've bought a car that has these advanced safety features. Now what? For example, what if your car starts beeping at you? Did you cross a lane marker? Approach a car ahead too quickly? Not use your turn signal? If you don't recognize the warning signal, it might be too late to react. Many respondents in the AAA survey noted they weren't sure how these features operated in their vehicles until after they owned them. Useful explanations from the dealership salesperson at the time of purchase can be hit or miss.\n\nThe solution is to familiarize yourself with the operation of your car as much as possible. Reading the owner's manual and watching online videos from the manufacturer are good steps to take. Another resource is MyCarDoesWhat, a site sponsored by the National Safety Council and the University of Iowa. And, in general, just remember that these systems exist to support your driving, not take it over fully. The autonomous car isn't here yet.\n\nEDMUNDS SAYS: Advanced safety features are becoming available on more new cars each year. Smart car shoppers should do their research to make the most of them.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.

Please check back tomorrow for the latest.", "Ukraine's president has signed a bill threatening any Russian flying into Russia-annexed Crimea with a stint in prison.\n\nUkrainian border guards control the land crossing into Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. But most travelers prefer to fly to the peninsula directly from Russia, which regards the trip as domestic travel. Ukraine deems such flights illegal crossings of the Ukrainian border.\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament said Wednesday that the president signed a bill making such crossings a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison. The law will apply to Russian nationals or anyone acting in Russia's interests.\n\nThe new legislation means that any Russian who flies into Crimea or drives there via a new bridge linking it with Russia's mainland will face criminal charges in Ukraine.", "Vote counting started Wednesday evening in Madagascar where citizens cast their ballots with hopes that a new leader will take this Indian Ocean island nation out of chronic poverty and corruption.\n\nPolls closed at 5 p.m. local time (1800GMT) after a day of generally calm and uneventful voting.\n\nThe 36 presidential candidates have all promised to improve the country's economy, create new jobs and end graft, but the three leaders in the race are familiar faces who offer little chance of a dramatic change, say political analysts.\n\n\"I was looking forward to this election because the misery in Madagascar is everywhere! Our country is rich! Why are the Malagasy people, for the most part, poor?\" said Judith Rasolofo, 52, a housewife with five children. \"I want to see something new in Madagascar!\"\n\nBruno Bezara said he came to vote first thing in the morning.\n\n\"I was in a hurry to come and vote because it's very important,\" said Bezara, 65. \"I want change because there are many things that do not work in our country.\"\n\nThe winner must take more than 50 percent of the votes cast and with such a large number of candidates, it is likely the race will go to a second round, scheduled for Dec. 19.\n\nThe three former presidents who are the leading candidates have all voted. Former President Marc Ravalomanana, who ruled between 2002 and 2009, voted in his Faravohitra neighborhood, in the center of the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nAndry Rajoelina, who was president during the transitional period of 2009 to 2013, voted in the capital's Ambatobe district.\n\nAnd former president Hery Rajaonarimampianina, who led the country from 2013 to 2018, also voted in the Antananarivo. According to Madagascar's laws, Rajaonarimampianina resigned in order to campaign, leaving the country to be run by the president of the senate.\n\nVoting took place normally in the center of Toamasina, a large port city on the east coast of the island.\n\nWith an estimated 76 percent of its 25 million people in extreme poverty, Madagascar is one of the world's poorest countries, according to the World Bank. There are 9.9 million registered voters who will go to the polling stations. Preliminary results are expected by Nov. 14 and officials have until Nov. 28 to declare the final outcome.\n\n\"We hope that the calm and orderly atmosphere will continue throughout the day and especially after the closing of the polls,\" said Christian Preda, head of the European Union Election Observation Mission in Antananarivo. \"We hope that these elections will be an opportunity to consolidate the democratic achievements of the Malagasy.\"", "Facebook's recent disclosures on blocking suspicious accounts show that the company's efforts to root out election meddling are working \u2014 to a point.\n\nWhat's not known is how much the company isn't catching and whether this \"whack-a-mole\" fight will ever end, as those wanting to influence U.S. and other elections can easily create replacement pages, groups and accounts.\n\nFacebook said it blocked an unspecified number of additional accounts on Election Day because of suspected connections to foreign efforts to interfere in the voting through disinformation on social media. That's on top of the 115 accounts Facebook shut down earlier this week and the 652 pages, groups and accounts removed in August.\n\nFacebook said the additional accounts were identified after a website that claimed to be associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency published a list of Instagram accounts it says it created. Facebook said it had blocked most of the listed accounts already and has now blocked the rest.\n\n\"This is a timely reminder that these bad actors won't give up,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber security policy, said in a statement.\n\nU.S. tech companies have stepped up efforts to fight disinformation campaigns by Russian groups, whom authorities accuse of swaying the 2016 presidential election. The companies were caught embarrassingly off-guard then. This time around, there are clear signs they are making some progress.\n\nSam Gill of the nonprofit John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which recently commissioned a study on misinformation on social media, said that while tech companies cannot declare victory yet, \"the leaders of the companies don't talk any more that it isn't a problem \u2014 they talk about how important it is to get it right.\"\n\nThat's in contrast to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's now-infamous quip in November 2016 calling the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the elections \"pretty crazy.\"\n\nBut social media companies still have work to do . By some measures, the spread of fake news on Facebook has declined since 2016, but the same can't always be said for Twitter.\n\nThe Knight study on misinformation points to a central problem that has emerged since 2016: It isn't just Russian agents spreading misinformation. Plenty of homegrown sites are at it, too.\n\nThe study found that fake news is still being spread on Twitter, the vast majority from just a few sources.\n\nGill said that, at this point, we simply \"don't know enough\" to say how the spread of misinformation has changed since 2016. That's despite a slew of academic studies that attempt to measure the spread and consumption of fake news on these services.\n\n\"We need a lot more basic research studying the relationship between social media and democracy,\" he said. \"We need to see more and understand more from the companies. We need access to more information.\"\n\nLong criticized for not giving academic researchers access to its data, Facebook launched a program in April designed to address this issue \u2014 though only when it comes to elections. The initiative solicits proposals from outside researchers, then works with Facebook to give researchers access to Facebook data. Facebook doesn't get to pre-approve research and provides no funding.\n\nBut until there is more research, social media companies must contend with present-day problems around misinformation, hate and propaganda, playing whack-a-mole as new fake accounts and trolls pop up trying to misuse their services.\n\nAfter all, the 2020 presidential election is less than two years away \u2014 and jockeying for that contest starts now.", "The mayor of Warsaw on Wednesday banned radical Polish nationalists from marching on the 100th anniversary of Poland's independence due to security concerns. The move prompted Polish leaders to quickly draw up plans for an inclusive march Sunday that could be embraced by all citizens.\n\nIt was a significant about-face for the populist government, which has been trying not to alienate far-right voters but then faced the strong possibility that the main news from Poland on its centennial would have been about extremists or even violence. It seemed the Warsaw mayor, normally a political rival from the opposition centrist Civic Platform, offered them a way out of their predicament.\n\nMayor Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said she wanted to put a stop to the extremist displays that have appeared yearly on Poland's Nov. 11 Independence Day holiday at far-right marches that have drawn tens of thousands to the capital.\n\nAt last year's march, some marchers carried racist and anti-Islamic banners calling for a \"White Europe\" and displayed white supremacist symbols like the Celtic Cross. There were also cases of violence against counter-protesters.\n\nThe event drew heavy media coverage and international criticism.\n\nLawmakers in the European Parliament called the participants \"fascists\" \u2014 a label that infuriated the conservative Polish government, whose leaders said most people marched with the national flag and without the racist banners. They mostly praised the march as an expression of patriotism, with one minister calling it a \"beautiful sight.\"\n\nThis year, Poland is celebrating the centenary of its independence, gained in 1918 at the end of World War I.\n\n\"This is not how the celebrations should look on the 100th anniversary of regaining our independence,\" Gronkiewicz-Waltz told a news conference. \"Warsaw has suffered enough because of aggressive nationalism.\"\n\nGronkiewicz-Waltz noted that the chief organizer of the Warsaw far-right march is a leader of the National Radical Camp, which traces its roots to an anti-Semitic movement of the 1930s. She said she has asked the government to outlaw it but has been ignored.\n\n\"The capital city saved the honor of the country,\" the liberal daily Gazeta Wyborcza wrote.\n\nMany other Poles have resented how the nationalists in recent years have managed to draw so much attention on Independence Day, overshadowing other celebrations.\n\nPresident Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki met after the mayor's announcement and announced that a march organized by the government would take place in Warsaw on Sunday instead. Presidential spokesman Blazej Spychalski invited all Poles to march with national flags to show that \"we are one white-and-red team,\" a reference to the flag's colors.\n\nThe government had held failed talks earlier with the far-right nationalists, hoping to make their march a state event, but far-right organizers refused the government demand that marchers could carry flags only, no banners, Morawiecki said.\n\nA similar ban on a far-right Independence Day march was announced Tuesday by the mayor of the western Polish city of Wroclaw, who cited the risk that participants might incite racial and ethnic hatred.\n\nThe bans followed signals that extremists from elsewhere in Europe planned to travel to Warsaw on Sunday.\n\nMass walk-outs by Polish police officers in recent days also raised concerns that clashes between participants and counter-protesters could get out of hand if there were not enough officers to intervene.\n\nMeanwhile, a controversial statue of the late President Lech Kaczynski was installed in a central Warsaw square ahead of its weekend unveiling as part of the centennial celebrations.\n\nKaczynski, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia, was the identical twin of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the right-wing Law and Justice party currently in power.\n\nWhile Poles have universally mourned the deaths of the president and the 95 other people who perished with him they remain divided on how to judge his presidency and whether he deserves such hero status.\n\nMore than 140 memorials to him already exist across the nation of 37 million people.\n\nAuthorities in Warsaw's local government opposed the statue and its central location. Pro-government provincial authorities were in favor. The clash is playing out in Poland's court system even as the 7-meter (23-foot) statue went up.\n\nThe end of World War I is also being marked on Sunday in Paris, where dozens of world leaders will gather, including host French President Emmanuel Macron and counterparts Donald Trump of the United States, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nIn Britain, Armistice Day will be commemorated Sunday with a solemn ceremony at the Cenotaph in London that will be attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Special tributes to fallen and injured servicemen will also include a Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey in London.", "Interested in Midterm Elections?

But Chinese authorities have promised to avoid a \"competitive devaluation\" to help exporters who face U.S. tariff hikes in a fight over Beijing's technology policy.\n\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, or \"people's money,\" sank to a 10-year low of 6.9756 per dollar at the end of October, coming close to breaking the level of seven to the greenback. It strengthened slightly this month, suggesting authorities sold dollars to stop its slide.\n\nThe central bank \"appears to have intervened directly in the foreign exchange market again in October,\" said Chang Liu of Capital Economics in a report. \"But its intervention remains small in scale and seems calibrated to slow the renminbi's fall rather than stop it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department declined this month to label China a currency manipulator but said it was closely watching Beijing.\n\nMost forecasters say they expect Beijing to step in to prevent the yuan from breaking seven to the dollar. That level has no economic significance but could add fuel to U.S. complaints about currency controls.\n\nChinese regulators are trying to make the state-set exchange rate more responsive to market forces. But those are pushing down on the yuan as China's economy cools and interest rates in the two countries head in different directions.\n\nThe exchange rate is set each morning and allowed to fluctuate by 2 percent against the dollar during the day. The central bank can buy or sell currency \u2014 or order Chinese commercial banks to do so \u2014 to dampen price movements.\n\nA weaker yuan also might encourage an outflow of capital from the world's second-largest economy. That would raise borrowing costs at a time when its leaders are trying to shore up cooling growth.\n\nSome forecasters say Beijing's stance might change if U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, make no progress at a meeting this month during a gathering of the Group of 20 major economies.\n\nThe central bank tried to discourage speculation by imposing a requirement in August that traders post deposits for contracts to buy or sell yuan. That allows trading to continue but raises the cost.\n\nBeijing imposed similar controls in October 2015 to stop a slump in the yuan. The currency temporarily steadied but fell the following year.", "Transcript for Battle for Congress: breaking down results of midterm elections\n\nJoining us for insight and analysis, our powerhouse team of experts including former new Jersey governor Chris Christie, Donna Brazile, former chair of the DNC, Matthew dowd, political analyst. Former governor Chris Christie, what is your friend, Donald J. Trump, thinking tonight? What he always thinks, I won. He's going to say, I added seats in the United States senate. I went into red states that I'd won and got Republican senators there. Vanquished some people who opposed my agenda. And oh, the house? That was Paul Ryan's fault is I think what we'll hear at some point from the president. I think the president's going to look at that, look at the landscape of the governors, where he did better than expected, and say, this was a good night for me, and he'll move on. But I also think the one change I think he will make is, from an issues perspective, you'll see a guy who's going to look for opportunity to make an unexpected deal with house Democrats that gives him credibility moving into 2020. Donna Brazile, would your former chair of the democratic national committee work, Donald Trump be right in telling himself a story that he won? If you look at this historically, didn't he do better than most president dozen in their first midterm? No, because he didn't -- with a good economy, Donald Trump lost seats in the house of representatives. Democrats knew going into tonight that we had an opportunity to pick up some of the seats where the Republicans had retired or did not run. But what we saw tonight was that Democrats were able to even reach into some red state territory and pick up seats in the house and win back some key gubernatorial races, including in the state of Michigan and Kansas, which was a big surprise for Democrats. Matt, governor Kristy talked about the possibility of Donald Trump reaching across the aisle and cutting some sort of deal. Do you see that happening? I think it would be really smart. I think at this point in time every president that has been successful after a loss like this has figured out a way to make a deal with the other side. Bill Clinton did it after he was badly beat no one the '94 election. Barack Obama attempted to do it. Many of the presidents who have been successful in their presidency have done that. The question is, does he have the capacity to do that? Over a longer period of time than 24 or 48 hours? I think that's incouple BNT on him. The other thing is both sides in this, Democrat and Republican party, have things to celebrate and things to lament. I think they both do. Democrats suffered more losses than they expected to suffer. They expected to pick up more governorships. I think the Republicans had a good economy at their back and they have an unpopular president, and they lost the house, which could put them in dire danger of investigations. So they can both celebrate, but they also ought to identify their own wounds that came from tonight. Governor Kristy, a wild card is Robert Mueller. This investigation continues. Does the president have reason to be concerned? Well, I think, you know -- I've said all along, as long as there's a special counsel who has the ability to subpoena things, you should be concerned. Now you have Democrats who can subpoena things as well. That's a different story, that's in a political nature. This guy's a prosecutor who can send people to jail. The house Democrats are not going to be able to do that. So as long as there's special counsel out there who can serve subpoenas and bring criminal charges, you need to be concerned and wary of that. Until that shop closes down, the president has to be very careful about what he says and does vis-a-vis the special counsel. The house is a whole different political problem. A prosecutor problem is a much bigger one. With a wider majority in the senate does he have more leeway to be tough on the special counsel? No. Can he fire him? No. Because Republicans in the senate will not put up with firing Bob Mueller. They just won't. That will be a red line he knows he can't cross. If he thought he could, he would have done it a long time ago. He has a great sense of self preservation. Knows just about how far he can go before he gets himself in real trouble with the people he needs, like Republicans in the senate. What the Republicans' increased majority in the senate will do for him is allow him to appoint people, both to the bench and as replacements for cabinet members who leave, that he really wants because he's going to have a little leeway in the senate, maybe 54, maybe 55 votes, to be able to get people confirmed. We have seconds left here. I apologize for asking a big question. Do you have any optimism, given the current formulation in Washington, that we'll be able to see a reduction in tox sister any. Yes. Because Democrats campaign on the wave of hope and opportunity for all. I don't have much hope in the short-term. I have hope in the long-term. I think we're so divided today that it's going to take many years to get through this. Hope in the long-term, not in the short-term. Thank you all, really\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Democrats take House, Republicans keep Senate in historic midterms\n\nMillions of Americans turning out to vote in what has been perhaps the hardest-fought, certainly the most-expensive midterm elections ever. The results in the battle for control of congress, Democrats taking the house of representatives, surpassing the 23 seats needed to seize control and flip the majority. In the senate, however, a very different story. Republicans holding on to power, even picking up seats. President trump claiming victory via tweet, of course. Quote, tremendous success tonight, thank you to all. However, exit poll numbers from \"Today\" show a majority of voters disapprove of his job performance. And most people who went to the polls say they oppose the president. And interestingly, when voters were asked what is the most important issue, health care came in at number one. Way ahead of immigration. The issue the president chose to highlight in the closing days of this campaign. So much to talk about. So let's get straight to some very smart people. ABC news senior national correspondent Terry Moran, our political director Rick Kline, cokie Roberts, political analyst for ABC news. Good evening to all of you, or good morning. Whatever it is. Depending how you're looking at things. Democrats took the house. What does that mean for president trump starting right now? Trouble. He's got a whole new world in front of him, a world of committee chairmen who will have the power of subpoena and will maybe come after his tax returns, his family organization, business records. And also a very different world on policy. There's no more Republican trump agenda that's going to get through the congress. Nothing might get through the congress. So it's going to be a much more difficult presidency for him and one that he will have to probably adjust to in some form or fashion, suggesting he'll change his tone. I'll believe when it I see it. Cokie, do you believe that? That he'll change his tone? Yes, or that he can navigate this -- I think he probably can do some navigation. I think he naturally enjoys the company of Nancy Pelosi more than that of Paul Ryan. A boy scout from Wisconsin versus a signed pol originally from Baltimore and San Francisco. Just for the uninitiated, Paul Ryan, current speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, the once and perhaps future speaker of the house. Right. I think things like infrastructure that the president talked about in the campaign, the Democrats have been dying to do. Used to be always a bipartisan bill. Hasn't been in recent times but it might be again. There might be some things that can happen. Look, we've got a bunch of interesting things going on in the house. And they might contribute to more cooperation than we think. All these veterans, you know, veterans, we talked about it earlier, Dan, veterans care about the country, work together, and might be working together in the house of representatives. We've got a lot of veterans elected to office tonight. Rick, let me ask you, if this was a referendum on the president, what were the results of that referendum? Yes, and no. It was a little bit of everything. You could look at this election any bay way you want to slice and it find plenty to love about what happened and plenty to hate, a perfect enhance latin of our politics. Maybe all of the contradictions of president trump. You can have one country on one night vote in entirely different directions. To ratify the trump agenda in red states, a number of states that were key to his voting coalition two years ago, to reject it in other states. In suburban centers, you can go outside of Washington, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, los Angeles, and you find these little red spots that are now turning toward the blue. And president trump was very much repudiated in those places. It is this contradiction, I think, that's going to define this election. Cheered and chastened. Depending on where you sit, everybody is cheered and chastened. Look at the governors races, very important. We just decided at ABC news Wisconsin has gone democratic, Michigan has gone Democrat irk, Illinois, Nevada democratic -- States that handed Donald J. Trump the presidency. Exactly. Kansas as well. Kansas, now that was aberrant for various reasons. But still, quite remarkable. In some way dozen we start where we began? We're moving chips around on the board. We started with a divided Kun true, and here we are again. Divided not necessarily politically. It's this cultural division between us. Between those of us who live in certain places and look at life a certain way, and those of us in other places. Rural and suburban. And between men and women. A big, big difference between the way women voted and the way men voted. We now have all these women in congress. When my mother was elected in the special election in 1973 to congress, she became the 16th woman in congress. She joined 15 other women in congress. Now we will have more than 100. That is quite something. And another optimistic note, women do tend to work together better than the men do. So that's what I was going to ask about. There is data to show that women govern and legislate differently. They do. They tend to be -- obviously not every woman. But they tend to be less idealogical, more pragmatic, more willing to cross party lines, particularly on issues that have to do with women, children, families, but on all kinds of things. You saw the government shutdown, the most recent one, women in the senate came together and said, for god's sake, let us not play stupid games. You see a lot of that. We know issues that brought people out, health care, immigration, gun control, the economy. How are these issues going to be dealt with or will these issues be dealt with in any way going forward? Start with immigration. There's a chance of a showdown before the Democrats take over. You could have a government shut down if the president pushes his case for his border wall. He's talking about the caravan. Troops are still at the border to greet the migrant caravan. I think health care, though, is something -- it was the dominant theme of advertising. It was the thing that candidates were asked about more than anything else. And the parties are not just opposed, the president is trying to pursue a lawsuit that would get Obamacare thrown out entirely. The patch they'd have to put together for pre-existing conditions, that might be one of those areas, where as cokie mentions, they're going to have to work together. Referenda in the states, extended medicaid, you have the voters speaking as well. That's right. Thank you all, really appreciate it. Good to be with you. Tonight was a night of many firsts. For a look at some who made history in these elections, horse my \"Nightline\" coanchor Byron Pitts. Reporter: A pink wave of candidates. Has now become a record number of women heading to Washington. Many of them Democrats. Among them several veterans. Including former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor Mikey sharrow in New Jersey.

Fire crews deliberately brought down an adjacent third building that was also in danger of collapse.\n\nThe fire service says the site remains dangerous.\n\nThe collapse has provoked soul-searching and criticism about the parlous state of some housing in Marseille, France's second-largest city.", "A crucial sensor was replaced on a Lion Air jet the day before it plunged into the Java Sea, and that sensor replacement may have exacerbated other problems with the plane, Indonesian investigators said Wednesday.\n\nThat sensor, known as the \"angle of attack\" sensor, keeps track of the angle of the aircraft nose to help prevent the plane from stalling and diving.\n\nEarlier this week, Indonesian officials hinted that airspeed indicators played a role in the deadly Oct. 29 crash that killed all 189 people on board.\n\nThe jet's airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights, and that problem was related to the sensor issue, said Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, on Wednesday.\n\nLion Air's first two attempts to address the airspeed indicator problem didn't work, and for the Boeing 737 MAX 8 plane's second-to-last flight on Oct. 28, the angle of attack sensors were replaced, Tjahjono said.\n\nOn the Oct. 28 flight, from Bali to Jakarta, the pilot's and copilot's sensors disagreed. The 2-month-old plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, which the pilots were able to recover from. They decided to fly on to Jakarta at a lower-than-normal altitude.\n\nThe next day, during the deadly crash, the plane hit the water at very high speed just 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Its flight crew had requested permission to return to the airport several minutes after taking off.\n\n\"The point is that after the AOA (sensor) is replaced, the problem is not solved but the problem might even increase. Is this fatal? NTSC (National Transportation Safety Committee) wants to explore this,\" he said.\n\nEven if an angle of attack sensor on a jet is faulty, there's generally a backup system in place for the critical component, and pilots are trained to handle a plane safely if those sensors fail, airline safety experts said.\n\nThere are audio signals and physical warnings that can alert the pilot to malfunctioning equipment or other dangers, said Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.\n\n\"They should have been completely engaged in what was going on inside that cockpit, and any kind of warning that came up, they would have been wise to pay attention to it,\" Curtis said.\n\nInvestigators are likely focused on how a single sensor's failure resulted in a faulty command that didn't take into account information from a second sensor, said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.\n\n\"We don't know what the crew knew and didn't know yet,\" Cox said. \"We will.\"\n\nBoeing, which manufactured the Lion Air plane, issues safety-related bulletins, and had previously circulated instructions about what flight crews should do if sensors fail.\n\nIndonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee said it had agreed with Boeing on procedures that the airplane manufacturer should distribute globally on how flight crews can deal with \"angle of attack\" sensor problems.\n\nBut a Boeing statement said a safety bulletin, sent to airlines on Tuesday, directs flight crews to existing guidelines on how they should respond to erroneous \"angle of attack\" data. It wasn't immediately clear if it plans an update, though comments from Indonesian officials indicate they expect one.\n\nIndonesian investigators said their flight procedure recommendations to Boeing were based on how the flight crew responded to problems on the Bali-to-Jakarta flight.\n\n\"The draft of what will be conveyed by Boeing this morning has been presented to us,\" said air accident investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.\n\n\"There are some things that we ask for explanation and some that we ask to be removed, and there has been an agreement between the NTSC and Boeing to release a new procedure to all Boeing 737 MAX users in the world,\" he said.\n\nIndonesia's search and rescue agency on Wednesday extended the search effort for a second time, saying it will continue until Sunday. Body parts are still being recovered and searchers continue to hunt for the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nThe Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board.\n\nLion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations. It has been expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, a fast-growing region of more than 600 million people.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBusiness Writer Cathy Bussewitz contributed to this report from New York.", "A lawyer says Russian tycoon Dimitri Rybolovlev, the owner of Monaco's soccer club, has been detained in the principality in an investigation into suspected corruption and other allegations.\n\nLawyer Frank Michel said Rybolovlev was detained Tuesday in Monaco. The newspaper Le Monde, which first reported the detention, said the tycoon's home was searched.\n\nMichel is the Monaco lawyer for Swiss art dealer, Yves Bouvier, who has lodged a legal complaint for corruption and money laundering that centers on a lawyer for Rybolovlev.\n\nLawyers for Rybolovlev would not say, when asked Wednesday morning, whether Rybolovlev remains in detention. They sent a statement dated Tuesday that said Rybolovlev was being questioned.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Paris, which oversees Monaco, said it is aware of the detention and asked Monaco authorities for information but has not received a response.", "Three members of an Iranian opposition group were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of having praised those behind a Sept. 22 terror attack in Iran that killed at least 25 people.\n\nPolice spokesman Bjoerke Kierkegaard said that would violate Danish laws and they could face fines or up to two years in prison.\n\nKierkegaard said all three are members of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz that Tehran has blamed for the deadly attack in the Iranian city of Ahvaz. However, ASMLA has condemned the violence and says it was not involved.\n\nThe men were held on preliminary charges \u2014 a step short of formal charges.\n\nDenmark's intelligence agency has said that a police operation on Sept. 28 that briefly cut off Copenhagen from the rest of Denmark stemmed from an alleged Iranian plot to kill an ASMLA activist. The person was not named.\n\nIran has strongly denied the allegation, calling it an Israeli conspiracy that sought to harm Tehran's relations with the European Union,\n\nA series of raids were also made in Denmark Wednesday, Kierkegaard said, adding that the ASMLA remains under police protection out of fears they still may be targeted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to give the date of the police operation as Sept. 28, not last month.", "A record number of women were elected to Congress on Tuesday night as an unprecedented number of female candidates ran for the first time.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

Davids is also slated to become the Sunflower State\u2019s first openly LGBT congressional representative. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American, also won a resounding victory in Minnesota. She and Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, also made history as the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\n\n\"We have the opportunity to reset expectations about what people think when they think of Kansas,\" Davids in her victory speech. \"We know there are so many of us who welcome everyone, who see everyone and who know that everyone should have the opportunity to succeed.\"\n\nVoters in Virginia, New Jersey and Florida were among those contributing to a historic election, choosing at least eight first-time female candidates for Congress. Many of the first-time winners, including Davids, New Jersey's Mikie Sherrill and Florida's Donna Shalala, helped upset the political order in districts where Republicans had held seats.\n\nColin E.

They say unofficial border crossings also are a cause for concern.\n\nHealth workers are usually among the first to be infected in an Ebola outbreak.\n\nThe death from Ebola of a young Ugandan physician in 2000, one of more than 200 people killed in that outbreak, sparked a national outpouring of grief and helped spread awareness of how Ebola is transmitted.\n\nThe ongoing Uganda vaccinations targeting frontline health workers will be carried out in five districts along the border with Congo. Several studies have shown that the vaccine is safe and protects against the Ebola virus, the World Health Organization said in a statement.\n\nThe vaccine, although subject to more scientific research and is still not yet licensed, is \"being used on a compassionate basis, to protect persons at highest risk of the Ebola outbreak,\" the statement said.\n\nIn Congo, where thousands of people have been given the experimental Ebola vaccine, a worrying number of vaccinated health workers have been infected.\n\nThe WHO said last month that Congo's outbreak does not yet warrant being declared a global emergency but called for an \"intensified\" response. Dozens more have died since then, according to a tally reported by Congo's health ministry.\n\nFor Congolese health workers, combating the virus has proved a challenge in a densely populated region that is roamed by armed groups.\n\nInvestigators believe that the first victim of Ebola in any outbreak acquires the virus after coming into contact with a \"reservoir\" animal, say an infected bat or monkey.\n\nEbola was first reported in Congo in 1976 and is named for the river where it was recognized.\n\nThe Ebola virus is spread through direct contact with the fluids of an infected person, or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to indicate the number of Ebola deaths in the current outbreak is 189, not 198.", "A divided outcome, befitting a divided nation, came out of the 2018 midterms, with the House flipping Democratic, but the Senate staying Republican while voters were sharply split along partisan, ideological and demographic lines.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

It could\u2019ve been worse for a president whose average approval before his first midterm is the lowest on record.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVoters said they were casting their ballots to show opposition rather than support for Trump, by a 12-point margin, 38 to 26 percent. A third of voters said Trump was not a factor -- and they voted Republican for the House by 52-44 percent, sapping some force from the \"blue wave.\"\n\nThe voters got what they wanted most: By 52-44 percent they preferred a Democratic rather than Republican-controlled House. And the Democrats flipped at least six governorships as well.\n\nBut they got it with differences among groups that were as profound as ever, including, as analyzed for ABC by Langer Research Associates:\n\n\u2022 Women voted Democratic by 59-40 percent; men split 47-51 percent. That 23-point gender gap is the biggest in a national House vote in exit polls dating back to 1982 -- albeit by a single point. It was 22 points two years ago.\n\n\u2022 Whites voted Republican by 54-44 percent; nonwhites voted Democratic by 76-22 percent. Demonstrating the changing racial and ethnic face of the nation, nonwhites accounted for 28 percent of voters, highest ever for a midterm and 1 point from the record in any election, set in 2016. Consider the change: Nonwhites accounted for 9 percent of voters in the 1990 midterms.\n\n\u2022 Young voters didn\u2019t appreciably increase their turnout, but their vote preference was the most Democratic on record -- 67-32 percent. Seniors, twice as prevalent, split 48-50 percent.\n\n\u2022 College-educated white women voted Democratic by 59-39 percent, by far the widest margin on record. Non-college white men voted Republican by 66-32 percent, a point from the widest gap in a midterm election, in 2014.\n\n\u2022 Evangelical white Protestants, 26 percent of voters, voted Republican by 75-22 percent. Everyone else voted Democratic by 66-32 percent.\n\n\u2022 Urban residents voted Democratic by 2-to-1, 65-32 percent; rural and small city residents voted Republican by 56-42 percent. And the suburbs, home to half of voters, split dead evenly, 49-49 percent.\n\nNo wonder, perhaps, that 76 percent of voters said the country is becoming more divided politically. On that, ironically, there was majority agreement: 86 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of Republicans and 76 percent of independents shared this view.\n\nJessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nIssues\n\nOn the issues, health care prevailed, cited as the country\u2019s top challenge by 41 percent, vs. 23 percent for immigration, 22 percent for the economy and 10 percent for gun policy. It sharply split the vote: Health care voters went Democratic by 75-23 percent; immigration voters were precisely the opposite; economy voters voted Republican by almost 2-to-1, 63-34 percent; and gun policy voters went Democratic by well over 2-to-1, 70-29 percent.\n\nOn health care, concern over coverage for pre-existing conditions rang a bell for the Democrats; voters by 57-35 percent trusted them over the Republicans to handle it.\n\nOn the economy, 68 percent said it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, a dramatic turnaround from 2016, 2014 and 2010 -- but the impact at home was muted. Just 36 percent said their own finances have improved since Trump took office. As many said his trade policies have hurt their local economy as said they\u2019ve helped, 29-25 percent. And it was a similar verdict on the Republican tax law: 29-22 percent, hurt-helped.\n\nThere was other strong coffee for Trump and the GOP. As good as the economy is nationally, 54 percent of voters said the country\u2019s headed seriously on the wrong track. Many more said Trump\u2019s immigration policies are too tough than about right, 46-33 percent -- though 17 percent said they\u2019re not tough enough. And voters by 46-38 percent said Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy is making the country less safe, not more safe.\n\nThat said, Trump took some wins, as well, notably at special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s expense. After months of Trump\u2019s hammering, 54 percent thought the Russia investigation was politically motivated. Eighty-two percent of Republicans said so and 28 percent of Democrats agreed.\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP, FILE\n\nA few other issues produced clear majorities. Voters by 66-25 percent said Roe v. Wade should be left \u201cas is.\u201d Fifty-nine percent favored stricter gun control measures. Seventy-eight percent called it important to elect more women to office; 72 percent said the same of racial and ethnic minorities. And 84 percent called sexual harassment a serious problem in this country.\n\nYet there was far more disagreement than agreement in 2018 -- a highly likely omen for the 2020 presidential election ahead.\n\nAll this -- and more -- played out differently state-by-state and race-by-race.\n\nA summary of key races follows:\n\nArizona Senate\n\nWith no winner Wednesday morning, exit poll results were chock-full of reasons why the Arizona Senate race was so close. Voters 65 and older split evenly: 50-50 percent between the Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally. Sinema was helped by a 27-point margin among moderates (63-36 percent) -\u2013 the largest pro-Democratic candidate margin in an Arizona Senate race in available exit poll data back to 1994. Yet McSally struck back by winning the 44 percent who said Trump wasn\u2019t a factor in their vote, 58-42 percent. Trump\u2019s approval rating was 52 percent in Arizona -- higher than his 45 percent nationally -\u2013 and McSally won those votes, 88-11 percent. But Sinema held a narrow edge in Arizona\u2019s giant Maricopa County, 52-47 percent.\n\nRick Scuteri/AP\n\nFlorida Senate and governor\n\nShifts in vote preferences among key demographic groups denied any candidate an easy win. In the Senate race, again with no winner Wednesday morning, incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson\u2019s +12 advantage in 2012 shrunk to naught as he failed to maintain his margins among Hispanics and suburban voters, and lost men. He won 76 percent of health care-focused voters, but that was offset by those more focused on immigration and the economy. Republican Rick Scott gained 6 points among Hispanics and 8 points among small city and rural voters from his 2014 gubernatorial election. He also got to run on the economy\u2019s coattails: Two-thirds of Florida voters said the economy was excellent or good, and they favored him by 18 points. Still, that only brought them to an even 50-50.\n\nSimilar patterns emerged in the governor\u2019s race, though Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s early concession brought the race to an end. Gillum, an avowed progressive, was seen as too liberal by 46 percent, while Republican Ron DeSantis -- a Trump devotee -- was deemed too conservative by 34 percent. DeSantis won the suburbs by 7 points and rural areas by a whopping 42 points, while Gillum won the 43 percent who live in urban areas by 14 points. Regionally, Gillum took the Miami and Gold Coast areas, by 31 points, but lost every other region of the state. He was also not able to open up more space among nonwhites, who voted similarly this year as in 2014, when Democrat Charlie Crist narrowly lost to Republican Rick Scott.\n\nGeorgia governor\n\nIn another still-unsettled race, Republican Brian Kemp was helped by a record 51-point margin among white voters in a Georgia gubernatorial race, 75-24 percent (albeit by +1 from 2014). Democrat Stacey Abrams benefited from record midterm turnout among nonwhite voters, 40 percent, as they overwhelmingly broke for her, 84-15 percent. Kemp won Georgia\u2019s suburban voters by a wide margin, 57-42 percent -- suburban women (44-56 percent) and suburban men (40-58 percent) alike. Abrams won independents, 53-45 percent.\n\nJohn Bazemore/AP\n\nIndiana Senate\n\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly lost his re-election bid in the third most-Republican state in this year\u2019s exit polls (which were conducted in 21 states). His 12-point margin among women against a weak opponent in 2012 shrunk to just 2 points. He ran evenly among men six years ago, but lost them by 17 points this year. Donnelly even lost votes among urban voters in Indianapolis, going from a 34-point margin to 20 points. Trump and native son Mike Pence were popular here, 55 percent approval and 54 percent favorability, respectively. The Democratic strategy of promoting Libertarian Lucy Brenton may have backfired; she pulled away more liberals, 6 percent, vs. 4 percent of moderates and 2 percent of conservatives.\n\nMichigan governor\n\nJeff Kowalsky/Reuters\n\nWomen propelled Democrat Gretchen Whitmer to become the state\u2019s second female governor. While Hillary Clinton lost white women by 8 points in Michigan in 2016, Whitmer won them by a 7-point margin, 53-46 percent. She also won independents by 5 points -\u2013 a group that backed Trump by 16 points in the state 2016. Voters were significantly more likely to say she was able to handle the issue of safe drinking water than Republican Bill Schuette, 56-31 percent. She also won big among the plurality of Michigan voters (44 percent) who named health care as the most important issue facing the country, 74-23 percent.\n\nMississippi Senate\n\nDemocrat Mike Espy and incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith are headed to a runoff after ending the multi-candidate night in a dead heat, 41-41 percent, with Republican Chris McDaniel taking a consequential 16 percent of the vote in the Mississippi special election. Though 65 percent of Trump approvers (59 percent of the electorate) voted for Hyde-Smith, a substantial 27 percent voted for McDaniel. He also won a quarter of Republicans and conservatives, keeping Hyde-Smith well below the majority threshold needed to avoid a runoff. For his part, Espy won four-in-10 independents, a new high for a Democrat in sporadic exit polls since 1984, though far short of the share he needed to swing the deeply red state. And at 33 percent, the turnout among blacks was a bit short of its 2012 level, 35 percent. In a test two-way matchup, voters split 41-53 percent between Espy and Hyde-Smith.\n\nMissouri Senate\n\nRepublican challenger Josh Hawley\u2019s Senate victory relied on a large advantage in the suburbs, 57-42 percent, and an even bigger advantage in small cities and rural areas, 71-27 percent. Hawley won men by 15 points, 57-42 percent; in McCaskill\u2019s last race she won men by 8 points. The healthy economy helped Hawley; 42 percent said they\u2019re better off financially than two years ago, and they backed him 79-21 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. McCaskill won adults 18 to 44 years old, but their turnout -\u2013 36 percent of Missouri voters \u2013- wasn\u2019t enough to hold her seat.\n\nMontana Senate\n\nThe Montana Senate race was undecided by Wednesday morning, in part because voters preferred a Republican-controlled Senate by 50-42 percent, yet retained some affection for incumbent Democrat Jon Tester. Despite Trump\u2019s multiple visits to the state, 54 percent -- more than anywhere else -- said Trump was not a factor in how they voted, and Tester won that group by 57-42 percent. His vote against Brett Kavanaugh may also have played a role; Rosendale won by 20 points among the 67 percent of voters who said it was a factor in their vote. Tester doubled his 2012 winning margin among women (58-39 percent) and quintupled his margin among voters under 30 years old (70-27 percent), though the exit poll indicated that he was essentially even with Rosendale among nonwhites, a group Tester carried by 42 points in his last victory.\n\nNevada Senate\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images, FILE\n\nDemocrat Jacky Rosen's victory came from women -- she won them by 21 points, 58-37 percent. Republican incumbent Dean Heller had held his losses among women to 6 points in 2012. Moreover, while Heller won independents by 20 points in 2012, he lost them this year by 22 points, 58-36 percent. Nonwhites accounted for 38 percent of Nevada voters, a record in midterms in the state, and Rosen won them by 68-28 percent. Rosen focused on health care, the top issue to 39 percent of voters, and won them by 79-18 percent.\n\nNew Jersey Senate\n\nOnly a minority of voters said Democrat incumbent Bob Menendez has high ethical standards (30 percent), and 64 percent rated him unfavorably. Yet he won in solidly blue New Jersey nonetheless, with help from the 51 percent of voters who were looking to flip the Senate. Menendez won big over Republican Bob Hugin among liberals (86-10 percent), but lost some ground among moderates, winning them by 14 points, down from 24 points in 2012.\n\nNorth Dakota Senate\n\nMike McCleary/The Bismarck Tribune/AP\n\nDemocrat incumbent Heidi Heitkamp was unseated by Republican Kevin Cramer in a state where six in 10 voters approved of Trump \u2013- second-highest across exit polls this year. Heitkamp was seen as too liberal by 45 percent, while Cramer was seen as too conservative by fewer, 39 percent. Her vote against confirming Kavanaugh also played against her \u2013- 42 percent said it was important in their vote and nearly two-thirds of them backed Cramer.\n\nOhio governor\n\nSeventy-four percent of voters said the nation\u2019s economy is in good shape \u2013- up from 34 percent when Trump won the state in 2016 \u2013- and these voters went for Republican Mike DeWine over Democrat Richard Cordray by 29 points, 64-35 percent. Ohio voters were relatively pro-Trump (52-47 percent) compared with the nation as a whole (45-54 percent); his approvers backed DeWine by 89-10 percent. DeWine won big among constituencies that lifted Trump to victory, including whites (+16 points), men (+20), rural residents (+30) and non-college white men (+38).\n\nTennessee Senate\n\nFifty-eight percent of Tennessee voters preferred Republican control of the Senate, helping to propel Republican Marsha Blackburn over Democrat Phil Bredesen. It was one of the top states to favor Republican control (alongside Mississippi and North Dakota.) Blackburn also benefitted from strong personal popularity, rated favorably by 55 percent vs. Bredesen\u2019s 49 percent. While 37 percent said Blackburn\u2019s views are too conservative, more said Bredesen\u2019s are too liberal, 45 percent. Thirty-eight percent said they cast their vote to show support for Trump, vs. 24 percent voting to oppose him.\n\nTexas Senate\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\nRecord turnouts among nonwhites (44 percent) and Latinos (26 percent) in exit polls since 1984 weren\u2019t enough to for Democrat Beto O'Rourke. Whites, 56 percent of the electorate, voted for incumbent Republican Ted Cruz by a broad 32-point margin, 66-34 percent. Men also kept the Republican stronghold red, voting for Cruz by 56-43 percent, compared women\u2019s 8-point margin, 54-46 percent, for O\u2019Rourke. Among the 61 percent of Texas voters who live in gun households, Cruz won by 63-36 percent. Lastly, dispelling myths that the growing out-of-state population is turning the state blue, native Texans split 51-48 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz, compared with a 15-point margin for Cruz among those who moved to the state.\n\nWest Virginia Senate\n\nDemocrat Joe Manchin won re-election in Trump\u2019s best 2016 state -- despite the fact that Trump\u2019s 63 percent job approval rating was highest here in the 21 states where exit polls were conducted. A plurality, 40 percent, said Trump was not a factor in their vote, and Manchin won them by 54-41 percent over Republican Patrick Morrisey. Manchin also benefited from higher personal popularity than Morrisey; 49 percent vs. 38 percent. Forty-one percent called health care the top issue (of four) in their vote, and they went for Manchin by 51 points.\n\nWisconsin governor\n\nA 52-45 percent win among political independents enabled Democrat Tony Evers to unseat Republican Scott Walker. So did three-quarters support for Evers among nonwhites, whose 17 percent turnout was their largest in available Wisconsin midterm exit polls since 1994. (Walker won whites, 54-45 percent.)

Add Interest\n\nA divided country has rendered a divided verdict.\n\nPresident Donald Trump stands repudiated in House voting nationwide. Yet he was vindicated in voting that took place for Senate seats and a smattering of governorships -- endorsing an agenda and a style of governing that inspired the very backlash that cost his party the House.\n\nIt\u2019s a messy outcome, with vast consequences for Trump -- starting with coping with a House of Representatives controlled by the opposing party.\n\nBut the consequences for the nation may be greater still. If the country spoke with any consistency, it was to underscore the divides that Trump exposed and exploited with his still-shocking upset two years ago.\n\nMichael Wyke/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nThroughout this campaign, both sides were convinced they were right about where the country is. Both parties\u2019 proved correct -- yet also extremely wrong.\n\nDemocrats will be empowered by the knowledge of again winning far more votes -- and will be fired up by defeats as well as victories as they dig in for a reset Washington agenda. Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation could whirl back to life at the very moment that Democrats prepare to take power, with a growing list of potential investigatory targets.\n\nYet Trump and his Republican Party will boast of an expanded Senate majority. They also made strong statements about the endurance of Trump\u2019s coalition with victories in governor\u2019s races in key battleground states, including Florida and Ohio.\n\nJohn Bazemore/AP\n\nOn Election Day, vast swaths of red states turned redder and in January, will have representation that will be distinctly Trumpier.\n\nDemocratic senators went down in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, and others incumbents could yet suffer a similar fates in Florida and Montana. Their hopes of reaching into Tennessee and even Texas to pick up seats crashed against stubborn realities.\n\nYet the movement was equally unmistakable -- and more politically potent -- in the opposite direction, in a geographically diverse swath of suburban House races. Democrats turned out GOP incumbents outside Dallas, Houston, Miami, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Richmond, Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and -- most likely, when all votes are counted -- Los Angeles.\n\nAl Drago/Reuters\n\nThe House will now be populated by a rising generation of progressive Democrats, including a record-shattering number of women, a growing group of military veterans and diversity in terms of race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate is losing Democratic moderates and gaining Trump-loyal Republicans. Trump rightly took immediate credit for Senate victories -- wins made possible in large part via his recruitment and extensive campaigning.\n\nBut this is an unusual win: Voters in this election disapproved of the president\u2019s job performance by a 10-vote margin, according to exit polls. Despite the robust economy, 55 percent of voters said the country is on the wrong track, and the campaign closed amid anger, tension and grief after acts of political and ethnic violence.\n\nEmily Michot/Miami Herald via AP\n\nIn the candidates it nominated, and ultimately the races it won, the Republican Party again served notice that it is controlled by Trump. He brought his misleading attacks, his racially tinged appeals and his wild campaign style to the midterms, particularly in the closing days, and the GOP followed him there.\n\nNow that turns again to governing. That just got much more complicated.\n\nAs Trump showed, and the midterms have now confirmed, there are two very different Americas running on parallel tracks. Now, with vast shifts in their representation in Congress, they may have fewer reasons to align.", "A Syrian man was sentenced to life in federal prison for his conspiracy convictions for making circuit boards that were used to remotely detonate roadside bombs in attacks against U.S. soldiers during the Iraq War.\n\nAuthorities say Ahmed Alahmedalabdaloklah (AL-ah-med-AL-ab-dahl-OK'-lah) made circuit boards that were used to detonate bombs for the 1920 Revolution Brigades, an insurgent group that claimed responsibility for 230 attacks against American soldiers in Iraq from 2005 to 2010.\n\nProsecutors had sought a life sentence for Alahmedalabdaloklah's four convictions, arguing he hasn't shown any remorse for his actions. His attorneys said their client had no prior convictions and complained that co-conspirators haven't been prosecuted for their role in the crimes.\n\nAlahmedalabdaloklah twice declined a judge's requests to make statements in court about his case.\n\nU.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver said Alahmedalabdaloklah had a college education and technical expertise, but instead chose to use those skills to help make bombs for money. \"Mr. Alahmedalabdaloklah knew what these were being used for,\" Silver said shortly before handing down the sentence.\n\nThe case stemmed from a raid a decade ago at a Baghdad apartment where soldiers discovered a large cache of bomb-making materials, though no explosives were found. Prosecutors say his fingerprints were found on several items in the apartment.\n\nSeveral people have tied him to the production of IED components, including one person who said Alahmedalabdaloklah found a factory in China to make the circuit boards after he fled Iraq, authorities said.\n\nAlahmedalabdaloklah was convicted of conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, conspiring to destroy U.S. government property with an explosive, possessing a destructive device in furtherance of a violent crime and conspiring to possess a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.\n\nHe was acquitted on charges of providing support to terrorists and conspiring to commit extraterritorial murder of a U.S. national.\n\nProsecutor Joseph Kaster said Alahmedalabdaloklah chose to associate himself with people who used violence in a bid to force American troops to abandon Iraq. \"The defendant has forfeited his right to remain free in society,\" Kaster said.\n\nGregory Bartolomei, one of Alahmedalabdaloklah's attorneys, said a life sentence wasn't warranted for his client. Bartolomei described Alahmedalabdaloklah as a law abiding person \"who has lost everything \u2014 literally everything \u2014 in his life.\"\n\nDefense attorneys have said Alahmedalabdaloklah, who was brought to Iraq as a refugee when he was a child, operated a legitimate electronics shop in Baghdad and moved to China when security in Iraq deteriorated. They say he set up an electronics business in China that sold products in Iraq and elsewhere but never sent any components used in a bomb.\n\nHe was arrested in May 2011 after flying to Turkey from China. He was jailed for three years in Turkey before being extradited to the United States in August 2014.\n\nThe 1920 Revolution Brigades, the group he was accused of selling parts to, was active against U.S. forces in Sunni-dominated parts of Iraq until it switched sides in 2007 to fight against al-Qaida. The group derived its name from the 1920 revolution in which Iraqis revolted against a British occupation.\n\nThe trial was held in Phoenix because authorities say Alahmedalabdaloklah got components for a wireless initiation system used in the IEDs from a company based in Arizona.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jacques Billeaud at www.twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud", "Saudi Arabia's king has begun a domestic tour with a first stop in the conservative heartland of Qassim province, where he pardoned prisoners serving time on financial charges and announced 16 billion riyals \u2014 about $4.27 billion \u2014 in new projects.\n\nThis is King Salman's first such tour since he ascended to the throne in 2015 and comes as the kingdom faces international pressure following the killing of writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\nThe state-run news agency reported on Wednesday that the government would pay debts of up to 1 million riyals, or $267,000, on behalf of each of the pardoned prisoners.\n\nThe monarch also announced billions of dollars for some 600 projects to improve health facilities, roads, schools and other infrastructure in Qassim.", "Germany luxury automaker BMW said Wednesday that its net profit fell 24 percent in the third quarter as the company spent more on new technology and faced market disruptions due to other companies failing to get vehicles certified in time for new European Union emissions tests.\n\nNet profit fell to 1.40 billion euros ($1.6 billion) from 1.84 billion euros in the year-ago quarter. The figure was short of the 1.61 billion euros foreseen by analysts surveyed by financial information provider FactSet. Revenues rose 4.7 percent to 24.74 billion euros.\n\nThe Munich-based automaker said it was increasing its investment in the new technologies such as autonomous and electric cars that are expected to transform the industry in coming years. Research and development expenses in the first nine months of the year rose by 400 million euros to 3.8 billion, and are due to total 7 percent of sales for the year.\n\nBMW managed to get its cars certified under tougher new emissions tests but Daimler and Volkswagen both had to sell off uncertified vehicles ahead of the Sept. 1 deadline, leading to pressure on prices.\n\nThe company also faced headwinds from warranty actions and trade tensions. It had 679 million euros in charges for recalls and service actions, dominated by the recall of 1.6 million vehicles in Europe and Asia to fix an emissions control component that can cause the vehicle to catch fire.\n\nNew Chinese import taxes on cars, imposed in retaliation to new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, also hit BMW because it makes cars in the U.S. and exports them to China. The company's single largest plant is in Spartanburg, South Carolina. BMW said the tariff conflict had undermined consumer confidence.\n\nThe profit margin on sales, a key earnings metric, fell sharply to 4.4 percent from 8.6 percent for the automotive business.

ASIS is an overseas spy agency that operates out of Australian embassies.\n\nCollaery's lawyer Chris Ward told Australian Capital Territory Chief Magistrate Lorraine Walker on Wednesday that prosecutors had told his legal team late Tuesday that Attorney General Christian Porter had been asked last week to issue a Section 24 certificate under the National Security Information Act.\n\nSuch a certificate relates to so-called national security information \u2014 which can cover international relations, defense, security, and law enforcement \u2014 likely to be disclosed in court and can lead to the court being closed.\n\nLawyers for Collaery and the former spy, known as Witness K, want to keep the court open and to reach agreement with prosecutors on how to manage sensitive security information.\n\n\"The information the Commonwealth claims is likely to prejudice national security is already in the public domain and therefore cannot prejudice national security if discussed in open court,\" Ward said.\n\nWalker said she would rule on Friday on how the charges would proceed. She set a tentative date for the trial to be heard over three days starting Feb. 11.\n\nProsecutor Tim Begbie said the prosecution would struggle to be ready for a trial before April.\n\nRex Patrick, a minor party senator who is watching the case closely, was critical of the government lawyers' late notification to the defense of their application to the attorney general.\n\n\"That's clearly a breach of model-litigant obligations on the Commonwealth,\" Patrick said. \"You can't ambush defendants like that.\"\n\nCollaery and K each face a potential two-year prison sentence if convicted. Neither appeared in court on Wednesday.\n\nCollaery has said that he and K were victims of a vindictive prosecution by the government because they had exposed illegal spying on the East Timor government in 2004. The bugging allegedly took place while Australia and East Timor were negotiating a deal on sharing Timor Sea energy royalties, which was signed in 2006. Australia won't comment on secret service operations.\n\nK was to testify at the International Court of Justice in The Hague in 2014 in support of East Timor's challenge to the validity of the 2006 treaty. East Timor argued the alleged espionage gave Australian negotiators an unfair advantage.\n\nOfficers from the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, the nation's main domestic spy agency better known as ASIO, raided Collaery's offices and K's home in Canberra in late 2013. They seized documents and also K's passport, preventing him from leaving the country.\n\nAs well as conspiracy to communicate, Collaery has also been also been charged with communicating ASIS information. Collaery has said he assumed ASIO had intercepted conversations he had with journalists.\n\nCollaery has said the charges related to K complaining about the illegal bugging to the inspector-general of intelligence and security, an independent watchdog that reviews the activities of Australia's six intelligence agencies and investigates complaints against them.\n\nEast Timor last year dropped its case against Australia in the United Nations' highest court as an act of goodwill ahead of agreeing on a new resources-sharing treaty.\n\nIn March, Australia, a wealthy nation of 25 million, signed a new treaty with its neighbor, a half-island nation of 1.5 million people who are among the poorest in the world.

Jeff Flake.\n\nSinema supporters who were among the final few at the watch party held by the Arizona Democratic Party were holding on to hope because of the Maricopa numbers.\n\n\"I think she's got a stronghold here versus other parts of the state, and I feel good that she can close the gap,\" said Ted Hiserodt.\n\nPreliminary exit poll results suggest Sinema is getting help from moderate Arizonans, with a 27-point margin that has her up 63 percent to McSally's 36 percent.\n\nThat appeal, and her perceived independent streak, is what drew Matt Winter to volunteer for Sinema.\n\n\"In recent history, we've had John McCain and Jeff Flake and Republicans who have a strong independent streak, and she's a Democrat with a strong independent streak,\" Winter told ABC News.", "The Australian government on Wednesday warned it intends to block a Hong Kong and Chinese consortium's 13 billion Australian dollar ($9 billion) takeover bid for an energy infrastructure company because it conflicts with Australia's national interest.\n\nThe CK Consortium needed approval of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board to take over APA Group, which owns more than 43,700 kilometers (27,100 miles) of gas pipeline in Australia.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had told the consortium on Wednesday of his preliminary view that the takeover was not in Australia's interests. In practice, the decision to block the sale is final.\n\n\"I have formed this view on the grounds that it would result in an undue concentration of foreign ownership by a single company group in our most significant gas transmission business,\" Frydenberg said in a statement.\n\nThe Foreign Investment Review Board was unable to reach a unanimous recommendation, expressing concerns about the national interest implications of such a dominant foreign player in the gas and electricity sectors over the longer term, Frydenberg said.\n\nPeter Jennings, executive director of the government-established Australian Strategic Policy Institute think tank, had been advocating for weeks for the government to veto the sale on national security grounds.\n\n\"My sense is that if the FIRB and the treasurer are taking national security considerations seriously into account, they should say 'no' to this particular proposed takeover,\" Jennings said in September.\n\nThe consortium is led by Hong Kong-registered Cheung Kong Infrastructure Group, better known as CKI. CKI and Chinese state-owned State Grid Corp. were in 2016 blocked on classified national security grounds from leasing for 99 years a 50.4 percent stake in Ausgrid, a Sydney electricity grid, for more than AU$10 billion.\n\nThat decision was made by Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he was treasurer.\n\nWhile reasons were not detailed, there was speculation that the consortium was blocked because Ausgrid included an electricity node that was connected to the secretive joint U.S.-Australian intelligence facility at Pine Gap in central Australia.\n\nJennings said the finding that the sale of APA to Chinese interests was not in Australians' interest was a \"no-brainer.\"\n\n\"If the takeover proceeded, we'd have about 70 percent or more of electricity and gas infrastructure would be owned by either CKI, a Hong Kong company, or State Grid, a Chinese state-owned entity,\" Jennings said.\n\n\"I just think that's a risk that no country would really find acceptable,\" he added.\n\nIn 2016, China's state-run Xinhua News Agency criticized Australia for rejecting the Ausgrid bid along with Britain's recent move to delay a decision on a new nuclear power plant backed by Chinese investment. The agency said that although China's \"dramatic development, huge population and unique culture\" may cause concern for some countries, it could also result in \"China-phobia.\"\n\nThe Chinese Embassy noted this was the second time in 2016 that the government has decided not to back applications by Chinese bidders to invest in Australia.\n\nMorrison had earlier blocked a Chinese-led consortium Dakang Australia Holdings from buying an 80 percent stake in Australia's largest private landholding, S. Kidman & Co. Ltd.\n\nThe embassy said the two decisions showed \"a clear protectionist tendency and would have serious impact on the enthusiasm of Chinese firms which want to come and invest in Australia.\"\n\nThe embassy did not immediately respond on Wednesday for a request for comment on the government's latest decision.\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama raised questions with then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after Australia allowed a Chinese company, Landbridge, to secure a 99-year lease over the strategically important Port of Darwin, which has become a U.S. Marines training hub in northern Australia. Turnbull said Australian defense and security officials determined the AU$506 million deal did not threaten national interests.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that fair trade watchdog, approved the APA deal in September on condition that the consortium reduced its gas market dominance in Western Australian state by selling some of its pipelines there.

The trial had been due to resume Nov. 1 but was postponed after a defense lawyer fell ill.\n\nAisyah's lawyers made a new application to the court to compel prosecutors to provide them with statements that eight witnesses had given to police earlier.\n\nHer lawyer, Kulaselvi Sandrasegaram, said they were informed that one of the witnesses, the man who chauffeured Kim to the airport, had died while two Indonesian women who were Aishah's roommates were believed to have returned to their homeland.

National committee. Chairman Chris congratulations. On the house. House you lost the senate what went wrong there. While the map was historically challenging George and so we knew going in do it that it is going to be a tall order. We still got a couple races out west in Nevada and in Arizona that I think we have a real shot at and that that goes to show. That we're really here you're starting to see places like Arizona. Turned purple because there's a real opportunity there you cyan Kirkpatrick. When that C down in Tucson. And we've become a fifty state party again I mean you you look at Kansas and we picked up a seat there and we picked up the governor's residence there with Laura Kelly. Four out of the five governors flips from. Red to blue are also women so your point about Tony eighteen being the air the woman. That's also true in statehouses as well so. I'm I'm bullish because we needed to have a check and balance. In Washington we always knew the senate was going to be a tall order but we were confident about the house and California hasn't reported anything yet in terms of their results and I think we're gonna pick up a number of sea just south. His repeated the same phrase we heard from leader Pelosi check and balance what is the number one thing you want to check about president tried. All we need we need accountability I mean remember when Barack Obama was president the definition of a scandal was when he wore a tan suit. I mean here how many agencies have had leaders who've either had to leave. Or frankly should leave because they've been engaged in at a minimum ethical misconduct. And possibly criminal misconduct. Is a culture of corruption. That in golf's this administration and we need that accountability but what we're going to be frightened for their right at the outset as leader Pelosi pointed out. Is infrastructure. Protecting people preexisting conditions pick you sure we can create good jobs across this country that pay a decent wage. Make sure we protect our dreamers we're gonna go right to work and the issues that matter most of people I've heard a lot about education. From folks you saw that upset victory in Oklahoma. In the congressional race tonight well we helped flip for state house seats there. Last year and and the big part of the challenge in Oklahoma is George is that there's tens of thousands of school kids who go to school four days a week because Republicans. Have cut funding for education through the bone. And so that's why people are willing to take a look at the Democratic Party because we're fighting for the issues that Arab realistically can anything actually get done given the fact the Republicans and increase their majority in the senate. Well I worked for Ted Kennedy in nineteen ninety five's to 98. It was divided government after 1994. They said that you're not gonna get anything done. And we got a minimum wage increase there was immigration reform there was welfare reform there was a hate crimes bill. There's a lot of things that got done because. The Democrats were willing to work hard in a bipartisan fashion. Leader Pelosi said tonight we are absolutely willing to do that it absolutely takes two to tango. And the question presented is going to be will this president and will Mitch McConnell be willing to stand up. Two they are far right flank of the Republican Party we will stay well. Which Democratic Party wants that we saw such diverse he can't see that you saw some candidates would be very very progressed extremely aggressive other candidates trying to go right down the middle. Of the road. Can you get them together into common agenda into the bay into the common party. Again getting back to my former boss Ted Kennedy up and said. You know if somebody asks you what wing of the party you belong to tell me belong to the accomplishments swing because you want to get stuff done. Everybody got elected on the democratic side we want to make sure we protect. Health care for people so that if you have a preexisting condition you can keep your health care we wanted to do we want to pass an infrastructure bill. So that we can put people to work we want to we want to make sure that people who go to public schools. Regardless of where you live have access to quality public schools there are so many things that unite Democrats whether you're the new member from Kansas or whether you the new member from queens. There are so many things that unite us and those are the things we're gonna continue to work on. It seems like Florida's breaking the hearts of Democrats again and Republican this is going to be governor of Ohio. Again to such key states in president's race in 20/20. Coming up. What's gone wrong for the Democrats in Florida. Well we've got to keep organizing and we came up just short in that governor's race. We put a lot into it I think one of the first things I'm gonna do there is a ballot initiative there. I think it was referendum for amendment four to allow one point five million people. Who have been permanently disenfranchised from voting because they have a felony conviction. To get their rights restored and it passed it passed with a solid bipartisan majority. I had to make sure that people who paid their debt to society can vote. We saw this in Virginia Terry McAuliffe led the way there we've got to make sure that. We expand those opportunities in order to continue to work hard in Florida and elsewhere and I'm heartened by the fact that. We won five seats and there's another four or five that are still in play as you and I sit here. At at 1230 or 1240 East Coast time and and that's a pretty good year for Democrats that's a very good year and and against Michigan. Huge state very very important Illinois he. Very important Maine New Mexico. Kansas and then again we're still in play Wisconsin's a dead heat right now. And so I'll see what happens there so we got a lot more work to do and we've made a lot of progress and and these are twelve year elections because. They'll be in charge of redistricting so I'm heartened by that. And we're gonna keep fight and then Ohio we're gonna keep fighting and in Florida and a lot more votes to count.

There was much talk of the possibility of success following a meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but in the months since there has been little to quiet skeptics who believe the North will never give up weapons it has described as necessary to counter a hostile Washington.\n\nPompeo was supposed to travel to New York on Thursday to meet with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol. The U.S. State Department earlier said the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, was to join Pompeo and Kim to discuss how to get to what it calls \"achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization\" of North Korea.\n\nSouth Korean presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said later Wednesday that his government doesn't believe U.S.-North Korea negotiations have completely broken down or \"lost their momentum\" because of the postponement. Seoul's Foreign Ministry also expressed hope that the U.S. and North Korea can quickly reschedule a high-level meeting.\n\nSouth Korea's presidential Blue House said the United States had informed it of the talks' postponement in advance.

The North stopped short of threatening to abandon nuclear negotiations with Washington.\n\nKoh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University and a policy adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said a high-level meeting between the U.S. and North Korea immediately after the U.S. midterm elections was never realistic, especially when the North was in no mood to make any concrete concessions.\n\nTrump's engagement with North Korea in recent months was apparently timed to the midterms, but he will no longer agree to major meetings if there are no realistic expectations of progress in nuclear diplomacy, Koh said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Foster Klug and Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report.", "More than 1 million previously convicted felons have had their right to vote restored in Florida.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

She spoke of at a moments ago. That Democrats and Republicans think that restoring the constitution. Checks and balances. Do their job. Nancy Pelosi right there Martha and and neighbors and began it with you right there we've been talking about the call from president trump to Nancy Pelosi. Isn't guarantee. That she's going to be speaker announced because so many of these Democrats are running did say they wouldn't supporter does she have a kind of margin to see if enough cushion to guarantee shares the speakership. Won't look right now. Eight of the new Democrats are Democrats who said that they will not vote for Pelosi or that they believe that they need some new leadership that is not that big of a market it look close in. In the states make a chance of speaker speaker but she's gonna have to work for that's a little bit and it is a reminder of the fact that not only have so many. Democrats and they want new leadership but also they feel that they just need some blood in there. But don't discount Nancy Pelosi she is eight. Fierce force on the hill she knows how to get things done and she knows how to bring Ingle a diverse caucus with will be important as they pursue all of these and that's. I got every so even if it's close I would imagine it's pretty difficult to dis place that don't female democratic leader of the house in so many women. Are part of this new majority. I mean Nancy Pelosi is responsible. For help and to recruit this new generation of leadership. She has raised Obama 130 million dollars she is help to advanced the democratic cause including. Health care. I know that she's going to face some challenges but I still bet that Nancy Pelosi knows how to. Count the vote Cokie Roberts well that's the other thing cookie Robert G isn't great though she hasn't had an incredible vote counter and she also settle legislate. She can put bills together and put people together who will both of those bills but she knows how to do that. If the democratic presidential candidates in 20/20 had a book and I don't think she yellen said she's going to be a liability. For the Democratic Party if if in the 220 election if she speaker of the house. Well that's any strangely provocative there on the table I don't know who wants to get out maybe I can't get can't pick up. Not really what I'm not a sport I support Nancy hello to all the right reasons she knows how to legislate you know that account. And she knows how to go out and take when. And chills I think knows when to step aside when it's when it's time to step aside feed into it you know they could really popular new blood Paul Ryan. Granted he's no longer there so I think that it puts is going to be just fine and then what was the rocketed thing led us to talk no no yeah. You solve the problem Erica. Relationship with the president I mean not only have they been friendly at times in the past but while the president you know likes of fancy himself a dealmaker pulled Mozee is shrewd and she has shown that she can actually get the better. Of the president in some circumstances especially we saw that in the past with negotiations over the budget. And spending and government funding so Nancy Pelosi is a good oh for Donald Trump and someone that I think Democrats would like to see. In that role and she does not yet have a nickname for president put that yeah. Close he goes this flights coming in she sought coming in she suggested not long ago that she might only. Serve. A one term as the speaker bass like OT something like that but I would be shocked. If there be anybody that could displace Nancy Pelosi has yet to be so again they consider this sixteen incumbent Republicans have lost so far tonight.

The Vatican retirement age is 75.\n\nPope Francis named a temporary administrator for Guam in 2016 after Apuron was accused by former altar boys of sexually abusing them when he was a priest. Dozens of cases involving other priests on the island have since come to light, and the archdiocese is facing more than $115 million in lawsuits alleging child sexual abuse by priests.\n\nChurch lawyer Keith Talbot says the church has been able to settle two cases.\n\nSome Catholics on Guam said they were not surprised at the church's bankruptcy announcement.\n\n\"I knew it was going to happen,\" said 68-year-old Judith Salas. \"Eventually they would have to pay.\"\n\nFrancis Santos, 60, a member of his parish's finance council, said the move was inevitable. \"The church had to take a position to save all the churches and schools,\" he said. \"Personally, I'm glad. At least now we have some direction that we as Catholics can look forward to.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nJones reported from Honolulu.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to show Apuron is 73, not 72.", "Wall Street is set to open higher Wednesday after the U.S. midterm elections showed the Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives and the Republicans keeping a majority in the Senate.\n\nThough the election results increase the potential for political gridlock in Washington, traders were mostly expecting this outcome, so markets have not been as volatile as after other political events, such as the 2016 presidential vote.\n\n\"One thing is for sure - the cloud of uncertainty from the last few weeks has lifted,\" said Mike Read, founder of social trading platform Pelican. \"Underinvested traders will return to the markets.\"\n\nThat appeared to be the case in Europe, where stocks enjoyed bumper gains. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 1 percent at 7,113 while Germany's DAX also spiked 1 percent to 11,598. The CAC 40 in France was 1.1 percent higher at 5,131.\n\nWall Street was poised for similar gains, with both the Dow and the S&P 500 futures up 0.9 percent.\n\nThe outcome of the vote could magnify President Donald Trump's legal troubles and complicate his policymaking agenda. It was unclear how the divided Congress might affect his pursuit of an \"America first\" trade strategy that has drawn the U.S. and China, the world's two biggest economies, into a trade war.\n\n\"A split Congress will, in all likelihood, not stop Trump from doubling down on tariffs with China,\" said Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com.\n\nThose concerns help explain why China's main stock market, the Shanghai Composite, fell 0.7 percent to 2,641.34.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 0.3 percent to finish at 22,085.80 while South Korea's Kospi slipped 0.5 percent to 2,078.69. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent higher to 26,147.69 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,896.90.\n\nA primary concern in Asia is the potential for trade tensions to hobble growth for export-reliant economies. Trump has imposed penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing has responded with tariffs on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nThe dollar, meanwhile, gave up some recent gains, trading down 0.3 percent at 113.09 yen while the euro advanced 0.5 percent to $1.1485.\n\nKonstantinos Anthis, head of research at financial services firm ADSS, said Trump will \"definitely have a tougher time getting his legislative initiatives through Congress\" but that this in \"shouldn't be a dampening factor for the dollar itself in the long term.\"\n\nPotentially more important for the dollar this week, he said, will be the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate announcement on Thursday and its accompanying statement. Though rates are expected to be kept on hold, policymakers are set to signal a further increase next month.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.", "Transcript for Hawley to defeat McCaskill in Missouri: Projection\n\nDemocrat Claire McCaskill Missouri is conceding now.

Tonight I was looking at this election and as a referendum on what is America what is America choosing to be. How are redefining patriotism holly citing what it means in American.

Like many migrants he had to find his way back to the relative safety of the caravan in an unfamiliar country, with no money.\n\n\"There were a lot of people who got dropped off somewhere else,\" said Cubas, who at one point lost his two children, 2 and 6, before finding them again. \"It was ugly, going around looking\" for his kids, the 28-year-old father said.\n\nMembers of the caravans of migrants, which President Donald Trump made a central issue in U.S. midterm elections, declined to take an immediate decision Tuesday night on whether to stay in Mexico or continue north, opting to remain in the capital at least a couple more days.\n\n\"Nobody is in more of a hurry than me to get going (to the U.S. border), but we have to go all together,\" said Sara Rodriguez of Colon, Honduras.\n\nRodriguez, 34, fled her country with her 16-year-old daughter Emily, after the girl began to draw unwanted attention from a drug trafficker who just got of prison and pledged to go after her. Rodriguez left her 7-year-old son with her husband in Honduras. \"Even though it hurts to leave my son ... I had to protect her,\" Rodriguez said, weeping.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants and the government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nRina Valenzuela, who is from El Salvador, listened attentively to aid workers from the nonprofit Institute for Women in Migration as they explained the difficulties of applying for and securing asylum in the U.S. Valenzuela decided she would better off applying for refuge in Mexico.\n\n\"Why go fight there, with as much effort and as much suffering as we have gone through, just for them to turn me back? Well, no,\" she said.\n\nHundreds of city employees and even more volunteers helped sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics. Migrants searched through piles of donated clothes, grabbed boxes of milk for children and lined up to make quick calls home at a stand set up by the Red Cross.\n\nEmployees from the capital's human rights commission registered new arrivals with biographical data\u2014 such as age and country of origin\u2014 and placed yellow bracelets on wrists to keep count of the growing crowd.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, 41, said there was no space in the stadium when she and her 8-year-old daughter arrived Tuesday night, so the two from Honduras slept on the grass outside. Migrants pitched tents in the parking lot and constructed makeshift shelters from plywood covered with blankets and tarps. Forty portable toilets were scattered across the grass.\n\nSeveral smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south; officials estimated about 7,000 in all were in the country in the caravans.\n\nTrump portrayed the caravan as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nFormer Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes, who denies accusations he started the caravan, described it as a natural response \"to a situation more terrible than war.\" He said about 300 to 400 Hondurans leave their country on an average day.\n\n\"What do we have here then? The accumulation of 20 days\" of normal emigration, he said.", "As a young dancer compared with ballet legends Vaslav Nijinsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rolando Sarabia made headlines around the world when he abandoned Cuba in 2005 for a career in the United States.\n\nHe didn't dance in his homeland for 13 years, banned as part of a wider Cuban punishment of citizens who illegally left the country.\n\nStill lean and powerful at 36, a company dancer for The Washington Ballet, Sarabia stalked across the stage last month in the starring male role in \"Gisselle\" at Cuba's National Theater. Asked about his feelings upon performing once again in Cuba, he began to cry.\n\nSarabia and four other renowned defectors from the Cuban National Ballet took the stage at the 26th Havana International Ballet Festival as part of a wide-ranging and profound reconciliation between Cuba and its millions of expatriates and exiles around the world.\n\n\"Happiness, happiness. I just don't have any other words,\" Sarabia's brother and fellow dance star Daniel told The Associated Press after a rehearsal of the \"Grand Pas Classique.\" ''This is something big. Global stars have come but even more important are those of us who've left. This is my audience, my Cuban audience.\"\n\nThe country did away with the hated \"white card\" exit permit in 2013, allowing Cubans to leave freely for any country that would grant a visa. The change unleashed a wave of emigration that continues to this day, with tens of thousands leaving annually for destinations around the world. Also in 2013, Cuba allowed citizens to retain all of their rights \u2014 from free health care to owning property \u2014 as long as they at least briefly returned every two years.\n\nThose 2013 changes unleashed an opposite wave of more than 40,000 Cubans who have repatriated and reclaimed the same rights as residents. At the same time, Cuba's state-controlled cultural and sports institutions began opening to stars who left, allowing musicians who went abroad like singers Isaac Delgado, Kelvis Ochoa, Decemer Bueno and Raul Paz to live and perform in Cuba again, and welcoming baseball players like Dodger Yasiel Puig at official state events.\n\nCuba's relationship with its citizens overseas remains highly fraught and painful in many circumstances, particularly for families who left the height of the revolution \u2014 publicly cursed in state-organized \"acts of repudiation,\" with their life's work confiscated by the state and handed over to strangers. Many Cubans abroad have sworn never to return while the island's Communist government remains in power.\n\nBut tens of thousands of others are reconciling with the state. They include Rolando Sarabia; his brother Daniel of the Maurice Bejart Ballet in Switzerland; San Francisco ballet dancer Taras Domitro; Marize Fumero of the Milwaukee Ballet; Carlos Quenedit of the Houston Ballet; and retired star Lorna Feijoo, a fierce critic of 96-year-old Cuban ballet director Alicia Alonso. Their return is one of the most symbolically charged reconciliations, given the immense importance Cuba places on its prestigious state-run ballet program.\n\nThe stars' return began during the warming between Cuba and the United States begun by presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro in December 2014. A year or two later, a Cuban ballet official traveled to Miami and met with a group of former national dancers, who said they wanted to return to perform in Cuba.\n\nThe dancers wrote a letter requesting permission and, unlike in previous years, ballet director Alonso and the then-Minister of Culture expressed no objection to the dancers' return, according to a Cuban official with knowledge of the process who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the process. The plans were not derailed by the broader chilling of relations under President Donald Trump, who has tightened regulations on travel to Cuba and hardened official discourse toward the island.\n\n\"This is the correct path,\" said Domitro, who defected during a tour of Canada in 2007, one of the highest-profile departures from Alonso's company. \"We're talking about ballet; we have nothing to do with politics.\"\n\nCuba continues to try to repair relations with expatriates despite the chilling of relations with the country that's home to 1.5 million of the 2 million living Cubans outside the island, a number one-fifth the size of the country's actual population.\n\nForeign Minister Bruno Rodriguez announced last year that Cuba would be slightly easing onerous documentation requirements for returning Cubans, and easing the process of obtaining citizenship for children born overseas.\n\nIn September, President Miguel Diaz-Canel held high-profile meetings with expatriate Cubans in New York, including many who have been criticized by hard-liners on the island.\n\nDiaz-Canel said the expatriate community had become ideologically diverse and an important source of support for Cuba.\n\n\"We're counting on you,\" he said. \"We are all Cuba.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAndrea Rodriguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP", "As a young dancer compared with ballet legends Vaslav Nijinsky and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Rolando Sarabia made headlines around the world when he abandoned Cuba in 2005 for a career in the United States.\n\nHe didn't dance in his homeland for 13 years, banned as part of a wider Cuban punishment of citizens who illegally left the country.\n\nA company dancer for The Washington Ballet, Sarabia stalked across the stage last month in the starring male role in \"Gisselle\" at Cuba's National Theater.

And Harry Truman and so the president I think cast to in the course of this he's got what looks like he's gonna have a larger margin in the senate. But he's got a house to face that he's not a perfect never had to face he's got to figure out what is his strategy in the course of that when he knows the country voted against him. Cecilia what we're hearing from the White House let's see how I wanna come in the second and first what are you hearing from assertion went as a they're looking at this. What will we know that they've been bracing for an onslaught of investigations come as John and Mary we're both saying there are reports in have been out there that John Kelly is already. Formed a working group set to face this onslaught of investigations. You know Donald Trump has said that he will handle it very well if in fact the -- return the Democrats say take the house. But this house to have them nervous in some way they will be backed into a corner. The Democrats have said they wanna in recent re subpoenaed subpoenaed Don junior they want to hear from president terms family members and Nancy Pelosi. Said her very first order of business will be going after his tax return. Since Christmas he talked to the president often in ally ally of the White House how would you counsel. To read these results and to react to them. Well first off you react what Matthew said we had Obama Clinton. Eisenhower Truman all along reelection OK so if that's the result of this and Donald Trump will be doing just fine I I think listen. The president is who he is. And I think everybody who keeps waiting for him to become something different because of an election result or something else could be waiting three very long time. He is who we is he will be who used and that old we will determine 20/20 will be. Who do the Democrats crook the contrast with him. Because the perp report contrasts two years ago. And that's why he won. What they do this halfway to Wednesday morning when the Democrats start attacking Donald Trump and celebrating taking over the house how do you think this president will react he's gonna react when we always ends. It appointed a senate and say look what we just picked up in the senate and Georgia just want to show you this in the exit poll. If we're feeling tonight that the bill and what's reflected by the voters the polls today Republican pickups in the senate. Mostly it came in and Donald Trump states where he won handily. It in red territory already and then you see the pick up in the house for the Democrats this question are Americans becoming more united. More divided about the same and overwhelmingly voter 77%. Say this country's becoming more divided the question is who can bridge that. NN of course the Democrats have blamed the Republicans largely for this to. Divide so there were puppet that Democrats will now have control of the message don't have control of the tone and I think what are everyone is said here. If they overplayed their hand I mean remember and setting the message setting the tone going into 20/20. Remember Ben Ghazi remember the emails they can set the message going to twenty.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Voters across the country are showing extraordinary determination to make their voices heard in this crucial midterm election cycle -- including a Georgia woman who waited in line for nearly five hours to vote on Tuesday.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

We had a lot of discussion over a lot of weeks about making the drive back to Texas to vote,\" she said.\n\nIt was a difficult decision because the couple had to consider taking three days off work to make the trek. Ultimately, one of the biggest motivators Bassart identified was her identity \"as an immigrant, as an immigrant in Texas ... with immigrants being deported. That really did not sit well with me.\"\n\n\"We decided we needed to do the right ... thing for our country, for ourselves,\" she said.\n\nThe couple woke up at 3 a.m. last Tuesday and made the 15-hour drive to Austin, Texas. She said they cast their ballots just before their early voting polling station closed, spent the night in Austin and drove back to Colorado over the next two days to continue their vacation.\n\n\"Having to make a three-day round trip to vote was a pain in the butt but it was the right thing to do!\" Bassart said.\n\nStill waiting\n\nAnother voter in California was still waiting on line to vote as of 7:56 p.m. local time.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\u201cI want to look at all the things the president has done that go against the mandates of our Founding Fathers in the Constitution,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat who is poised to take control of the powerful House Oversight Committee. \u201cWe need accountability, transparency, integrity, and honesty from this Administration.\u201d\n\nDemocrats swept to power, having campaigned on the promise of providing a stronger check on the Trump administration. That pledge could initiate bruising legal battles over congressional subpoenas, a stack of demands for documents and testimony from federal agencies -- including Trump\u2019s tax returns -- and withering investigations into facets of Trump\u2019s personal life, his family business, and his government.\n\nCharlie Neibergall/AP\n\nCummings\u2019 committee has already compiled a list of 64 subpoenas and inquiries looking into concerns they had with Trump administration activities but were denied by the committee\u2019s Republican leadership. The Democrats said they intend to revisit the requests.\n\nPractically speaking, the Democrats will be well positioned to pursue their oversight agenda. The budget for the majority will enable committee leaders to hire a small army of investigators, lawyers, and other key staffers. Lawyers began contacting senior Hill aides months ago to discuss potential job openings, according to sources familiar with the informal conversations.\n\nThe power of the majority will also enable Democrats to issue subpoenas, and demand records and testimony from federal officials. Notable among those powers: the ability to ask the Internal Revenue Service to turn over Trump\u2019s confidential tax records for their review.\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat, is one of several committee members who told ABC News last month that the House Ways and Means Committee plans to exercise that power and initiate a review of Trump's tax filings.\n\n\"We will recommend a thorough review on a non-partisan basis, something I began asking for 18 months ago,\" Pascrell said. \"We are allowed to investigate this. Nothing should step in our way.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House Intelligence Committee have been frustrated by Republicans\u2019 decision to focus their investigation into Russian election interference on the conduct of the FBI, rather than any possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. They now say they intend to seek testimony from more than 30 witnesses \u2013- including Trump family members and confidants -- to address lingering questions they have about the Trump campaign\u2019s activities.\n\nDemocrats say Republicans failed to question key witnesses and follow some relevant lines of inquiry.\n\n\"We will take our oversight responsibilities seriously, both with respect to the intelligence agencies under our charge but also with respect to any work left undone in the Russia probe by the majority,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to ABC News ahead of the election.\n\nPatrick Semansky/AP, FILE\n\nThey say they intend to explore questions about the Trump Organization's finances, including the relationship between the family business and Deutsche Bank, which has financed some of the Trump Organization's real estate deals. The bank has said it is cooperating with investigators.\n\nThey want to review, among other items, what they have called \"credible\" allegations about the use of Trump properties by Russian oligarchs to launder money \u2013- allegations that Trump aides have refuted. The effort could involve hiring investigators with specialized data and forensic accounting experience, according to a congressional source. Trump has denied doing business in Russia, apart from the Miss Universe pageant.\n\nDemocrats also want to continue investigating Trump campaign's digital operation and relationship with the data firm Cambridge Analytica. The company, which shut down in May, is still being investigated by British authorities for alleged improper use of Facebook user data.\n\nFor months, Republicans have predicted that Democrats would overstep if they took control.\n\nDemocrats \u201chave proven beyond any doubt that their sole aim is to run an endless investigation against the administration in hopes of pinning some imaginary horrific crime on them,\u201d Jack Langer, a spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, told ABC News ahead of the election.\n\nRegarding Trump\u2019s tax returns, Republicans have said they plan to put up a fight. In October, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, responded on Twitter to statements from Democrats suggesting they would pursue copies of the returns.\n\n\"This is dangerous,\" Brady wrote. \"Once Democrats abuse this law to make public @realDonaldTrump tax returns, what stops them from prying/making public YOUR tax returns for political reasons? Who is next? #AbuseOfPower #EnemiesList\"\n\nJust this week, Trump told reporters he doesn\u2019t care if Congress looks at his returns. \"I don\u2019t care. They can do whatever they want and I can do whatever I want,\" Trump said on a campaign stop in Indiana.\n\nSome Trump allies warn that the Democrats\u2019 plans could stop the president\u2019s agenda in its tracks, and bog down the administration in endless oversight hearings.\n\n\"Everyone has to assume if Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker that every committee will hold hearings and bring every single Trump appointee in under oath,\u201d former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, told ABC News. \u201cIt would be an enormous drain on time away from policies they\u2019d like to pursue.\"\n\nConcern that overreach could spark a backlash has brought expressions of concern from Democrats as well.\n\nCummings has vowed he would not lose sight of kitchen table issues including prescription drug prices, postal reform and student debt.\n\n\"I'm not looking for retribution, life is too short,\u201d said Cummings, who battled with Republicans over investigations into the 2012 Benghazi attack and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. \u201cWhile we are dealing with whatever may come in the storm of Trump, I have to keep in mind that there are people who have to live day to day.\u201d\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nAnother House Democratic source told ABC News that there are broad concerns Democrats could spread themselves too thin investigating the administration and president, and some argue they should limit their work to a handful of inquiries and issues to maximize attention and deflect likely criticism from Republicans of overreach.\n\nAs the new Congress gets underway, the White House that is already grappling with Mueller\u2019s probe and has begun bracing for the fresh investigative onslaught.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be enough to go on Twitter and say, \u2018This is a witch hunt!\u2019 and not cooperate,\u201d Kurt Bardella, a public relations consultant who served as an aide to former House Oversight Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told ABC News.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about concerns with potential investigations from a Democrat-led House.\n\nDemocrats have taken caution not to bandy about one word that excites passions on both sides of the aisle: impeachment. But the man who would be positioned to oversee any movement to try to remove Trump from office, the expected Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., was spotted earlier this year on the Amtrak Acela reading a stack of books on the topic.\n\n\"They will start doing everything in their power to oppose, resist, impeach, obstruct this president,\" Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., a Trump ally, said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nWhile progressives have tried to force votes on articles of impeachment against Trump, senior Democrats, including Schiff, House Minority Leader Pelosi and Nadler, have all said they want to see the results of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation before giving any thought to potential impeachment proceedings. Pelosi, in particular, has been resistant to talk of any drastic measures.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone this summer, she said impeachment was, in her view, \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the interest of America\u2019s working families to focus on that, unless we have more to go on, which we don\u2019t at this time,\u201d Pelosi told the magazine. \u201cYou get the power of subpoena, you don\u2019t know where it takes you. I wouldn\u2019t not impeach the president for political reasons. But I wouldn\u2019t impeach him for political reasons, either. That\u2019s just not what it\u2019s supposed to be about. I think it\u2019s not unifying for the country.\u201d", "The Latest on U.S. Senate elections (all times local):\n\n4:20 a.m.\n\nThe race for U.S. Senate in Montana between Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Republican Matt Rosendale is too close to call.\n\nAs of 3:45 a.m. EST on Wednesday, Rosendale holds a lead of 6,082 votes out of more than 355,000 cast \u2014 a margin of roughly 1.7 percent.\n\nRoughly a third of precincts remain to be counted.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:18 a.m.\n\nThe race for U.S. Senate in Arizona between Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is too close to call.\n\nAs of 3:45 a.m. EST on Wednesday, McSally holds a lead of 17,240 votes out of more than 1.6 million cast \u2014 a margin of roughly 1 percent.\n\nRoughly 25 percent of votes in Arizona are counted after Election Day.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n4:16 a.m.\n\nThe race for U.S. Senate in Florida between Democratic incumbent Sen.

He conceded earlier in the night.\n\nHeller was once a critic of President Donald Trump, but the two have become allies. Rosen painted Heller as a rubber stamp for the president and counted on backlash to Trump to help her oust the incumbent.\n\nRosen's win puts Nevada with half a dozen other states represented by U.S. senators who are both female. Nevada's other senator is Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:39 a.m.\n\nU.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has won a fifth full term representing California after shaking off a challenge from a fellow Democrat who argued she hasn't been tough in confronting President Donald Trump.\n\nFeinstein defeated state Sen. Kevin de Leon.\n\nVoters first sent Feinstein to Washington in 1992. At 85, she is the oldest current U.S. senator.\n\nShe faced a fellow Democrat because of California's system that sends the two candidates who win the most primary votes to the general election.\n\nThe race failed to generate much excitement, with Democrats more focused on winning seats in the U.S. House than on a safe Senate seat.\n\nFeinstein argued that her experience and tenure in Washington made her the best person to serve California.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n1:40 a.m.\n\nMaine's independent Sen. Angus King has withstood a challenge from opponents on his ideological right and left to retain his seat.\n\nKing, a popular former Maine governor, defeated Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey and Democratic activists Zak Ringelstein to win a second term on Tuesday. King caucuses with the Democrats and was first elected to the Senate in 2012.\n\nTuesday's election was the first U.S. Senate race to use Maine's ranked-choice style of voting.\n\nBrakey or Ringelstein could have forced additional voting rounds under the system if King had fallen short of 50 percent of the popular vote. But King, who has long been popular with Maine voters, had a decisive win.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:55 p.m.\n\nRepublican Josh Hawley has unseated Missouri's Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in a national victory for the GOP.\n\nRepublicans have long hoped to flip McCaskill's seat in the increasingly Republican state. Missouri was once considered a bellwether known for picking the successful presidential candidate, but it's since lost that status and trended right.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the state by nearly 19 percentage points. Missouri's attorney general pinned his campaign to his support for the president.\n\nMcCaskill was one of 10 Democratic Senate incumbents up for re-election in states Trump won.\n\nVoters first elected McCaskill to the Senate in 2006. She won re-election in 2012 after Republican candidate Todd Akin said women's bodies can prevent pregnancy in cases of \"legitimate rape.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:40 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Cantwell has won re-election in Washington, beating Republican challenger Susan Hutchison.\n\nCantwell easily outdistanced Hutchison, a former Seattle TV anchor and state GOP chairwoman.\n\nCantwell is a former tech executive who previously served one term in the U.S. House and six years as a state representative in the state Legislature. She will be serving her fourth term.\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the GOP has captured a major statewide race in Washington.\n\nThe last time voters sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate was 1994, when Sen. Slade Gorton was re-elected to his final term before being ousted by Cantwell in 2000.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has won a fourth term in the Senate, defeating Republican challenger John James.\n\nStabenow campaigned as a pragmatic lawmaker who forges bipartisan agreement despite the partisan rancor in Washington. She cited her work shaping farm legislation and pushing a new law that allows pharmacists to tell consumers when they can save on prescriptions by paying cash instead of using insurance.\n\nThe 68-year-old Stabenow criticized President Trump's attempt to slash federal funding for the Great Lakes. She said James would have been an unabashed enthusiast of Trump with no governing experience.\n\nJames is a black combat veteran and business executive. Trump won Michigan in 2016. He called James \"a star\" candidate.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nMississippi's U.S. Senate special election is headed to a runoff, and the state's voters will either elect a woman to the office for the first time ever or a black man for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy advanced Tuesday from a field of four. They compete in a Nov. 27 runoff, and the winner will serve the final two years of a term started by Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired in April.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith, who was state agriculture commissioner, to temporarily succeed Cochran until the special election is decided. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress, but no woman has been elected to the job from the state. She is endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nEspy is a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii has defeated Republican Ron Curtis to win a second term.\n\nHirono had an advantage going into Tuesday's midterm election as an incumbent with broad name recognition. Her challenger is a retired engineer who had never run for public office.\n\nHirono has served in the legislature, as lieutenant governor and as U.S. representative. The 71-year-old kept a relatively low profile early on in the Senate, but has gained attention for her outspoken opposition to President Donald Trump and his policies.\n\nHirono urged men to \"shut up and step up\" when the Senate was considering confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSome Hawaii voters cheered the statement, while others accused her of being anti-male.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith has won Minnesota's special election to finish the final two years of former Sen. Al Franken's term.\n\nSmith defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley on Tuesday. The election was a 10-month sprint, triggered in January after Franken resigned amid a growing sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nSmith got a head start in the race when she was appointed to take the seat by Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Smith was Dayton's lieutenant governor and former top aide.\n\nHousley tried to brand Smith as a political insider. But national Republican groups largely bypassed Housley's race, sinking resources instead into more winnable races in states like North Dakota and Indiana.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Deb Fischer has cruised to a second term in Nebraska, defeating Lincoln city councilwoman Jane Raybould.\n\nFischer won Tuesday despite Raybould's efforts to cast the first-term incumbent as a Washington insider who sided with her party even when it was harmful to the GOP-friendly state. Raybould pitched herself to voters as an outsider who would look for ways to lower health care costs.\n\nFischer rejected the criticism and noted her work on Senate committees focused on agriculture and the military, both important areas to Nebraska with its farm economy and Offutt Air Force Base.\n\nThe candidates differed on their support for new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual assault allegations during his confirmation process. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Fischer voted to confirm Kavanaugh, while Raybould said the allegations merited further investigation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11 p.m.\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn has won a grueling, expensive contest to become the first female U.S. senator from Tennessee.\n\nThe congresswoman defeated Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen on Tuesday by closely aligning her bid with President Donald Trump. The president made three visits to the state for her.\n\nBlackburn has sought to undermine Bredesen's reputation as an independent thinker by tying him to national Democrats at every turn. Blackburn was first elected to the House in 2002 and has called herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\"\n\nBlackburn will replace retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker. She represents a rightward shift from Corker and other more centrist senators that Tennessee has historically elected.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nRepublicans have retained Senate control for two more years, shattering Democrats' dreams of an anti-Trump wave sweeping them into majority.\n\nThe result was all but assured when Republican Kevin Cramer ousted North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and when Republican businessman Mike Braun ousted Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz fended off a spirited challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn triumphed in Tennessee.\n\nThe GOP's gains come even as the results in Nevada and Arizona have yet to be determined.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has handily won a U.S. Senate seat in his adopted home state of Utah after a campaign where he backed off his once-fierce criticism of Donald Trump.\n\nRomney clinched the win Tuesday as he defeated Democrat Jenny Wilson, a member of the Salt Lake County council.\n\nRomney was the heavy favorite to win the seat in conservative Utah, where he holds near-celebrity status as the first Mormon presidential nominee from a major party.\n\nHe replaces longtime Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chose not to seek re-election.\n\nRomney denounced Trump as a \"fraud\" and a \"phony\" during the 2016 campaign, but has since said he approves of many Trump policies.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz fended off rising-star Democrat Beto O'Rourke to win re-election in a much-watched Texas race that began as a cakewalk but needed a visit from President Donald Trump to help push the incumbent over the top.\n\nCruz finished a surprising second in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and began the Senate race as a prohibitive favorite.\n\nBut O'Rourke visited fiercely conservative parts of the state that his party had long since given up on, while shattering fundraising records despite shunning donations from outside political groups and pollster advice.\n\nCruz argued that his opponent's support for gun control and universal health care were too liberal for Texas.\n\nTrump and Cruz were bitter 2016 rivals, but the president visited Houston late last month to solidify the senator's win.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has turned back a challenge by Republican Patrick Morrisey to win his second full-term in a state carried by President Donald Trump.\n\nManchin survived the most difficult re-election campaign of his career against the comparative newcomer Morrisey. Manchin is a former governor who has held elected office in West Virginia for the better part of three decades.\n\nManchin heavily outspent Morrisey and portrayed himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology. Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nManchin was critical of Morrisey's New Jersey roots and his past lobbying ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMorrisey is a two-term state attorney general and a staunch Trump supporter.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has won a second term, fending off a challenge from a Republican who ran as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nBaldwin led Leah Vukmir in fundraising and polls throughout the race.\n\nBaldwin is one of the most liberal members of Congress. The differences between her and Vukmir were stark. They disagreed on almost every issue.\n\nBaldwin made the campaign largely about health care and Vukmir's opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Baldwin argued for keeping the law and its guarantee of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe race was Wisconsin's first for Senate where both major party candidates were women.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has easily won a third term in Minnesota.\n\nKlobuchar defeated Republican state Rep. Jim Newberger on Tuesday. It comes as Klobuchar's name swirls amid the crop of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2020.\n\nThe race was never close. Newberger is a little-known state lawmaker who struggled to raise money against the popular Klobuchar.\n\nRepublicans put far more focus on the state's other Senate race to complete the last two years of Al Franken's term. State Sen. Karin Housley is carrying the party's hopes in that race against Democratic Sen. Tina Smith.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor AP's complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Transcript for Democrats take control of the House\n\nThis is an ABC news the election update now reporting.

Ron DeSantis in the state's contentious gubernatorial race.\n\nGillum conceded just before 11 p.m. ET, setting up a victory for President Donald Trump-backed DeSantis.\n\n\"Earlier this evening I called Mr. Ron Desantis and congratulated him on what we expect will be him as the next governor as the great state of Florida,\" Gillum said. \"I want you to know that in spite of our congratulating him on his victory this evening, nothing that we believe in is compromised.\"\n\nShannon Stapleton/Reuters\n\n\"I still believe and I still trust the voters,\" he added. \"We may not have always shown up but I still believe that there are more of us that believe in what is common and what is good.\"\n\n\"But I can guarantee you this,\" he continued, \"I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\nDeSantis thanked Floridians for the vote of confidence.\n\n\"Other than serving our nation in uniform, the opportunity to serve as the 46th governor of the great state of Florida is the greatest professional honor of my life,\" he said in his victory speech Tuesday night. \"Thank you, the people of Florida, for your faith, your support, and your trust you have placed in me.\n\nThe close nature of this election continued Florida's tradition of having consequential elections.\n\nTrump endorsed DeSantis shortly after he won his primary earlier this year, and the president went on to campaign for him in his so-called second home state.\n\nTrump carried the state by a slim margin over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCarlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nLast week, Trump entered into the fray to defend his staunch ally by relentlessly criticizing the Democratic hopeful over Twitter and at a rally for DeSantis in Fort Myers.\n\nBranding Gillum as a \"stone-cold thief\" and a \"radical socialist,\" Trump ignited tensions in the contest's final days.\n\nColin Hackley/Reuters\n\nFor his part, Gillum faced controversy earlier this year over an FBI probe into government corruption in Tallahassee and accepting a ticket to the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" from an undercover FBI agent. Gillum said during a gubernatorial debate that he's not the direct subject of the investigation.\n\nBut Trump wasn't the only presidential player who waded into this state-level race, as former President Barack Obama rallied for Gillum just days before voters headed to the polls to energize an already animated democratic base.\n\nThis tight battle between Gillum and DeSantis has at times become heated, particularly over race. The day after Gillum won the party's nomination in the August primary, DeSantis came under fire for telling voters during a Fox News interview that they should not \"monkey this up\" by voting for Gillum.\n\nAn occasionally controversial opponent, DeSantis said during one debate that he would represent all Floridians, regardless of race, but would not participate in political correctness.\n\nGillum responded: \"I\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist, I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\"\n\nMichele Eve Sandberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Democrats hoped to use the election as a referendum on Trump and highlight issues that have affected their state, like environmental disasters, gun policy and economic development. The state is the site of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 students and teachers were killed in one of the country's deadliest mass shootings.\n\nRepublicans campaigned on maintaining the economic growth fostered under Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who was term-limited and is running for Senate in the state this year.\n\nGillum, who scored Obama's endorsement last month and who was joined by former Vice President Joe Biden on the trail, was part of a progressive class of candidates who are dominating the Democratic ticket this cycle. More aligned with Vermont Independent Sen.

James Clyburn have both said they won\u2019t challenge Pelosi for speaker, but if she fails to win the support of the caucus, Democratic sources believe both would want the position.\n\nReps.

Murray/AP\n\nDemocrats on the House Oversight Committee are expected to revisit their 64 subpoena requests that Republicans denied in the committee. The requests cover a range of issues, from the rollout of the Muslim travel ban, to documents detailing the response to Hurricane Maria, the administration\u2019s refusal to defend the Affordable Health Care Act in court, and administration use of chartered flights.\n\nThey\u2019ll also ask questions surrounding the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., regarding foreign government spending at the property, and whether the president is in violation of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, the panel\u2019s current ranking Democrat, who is expected to become chairman in the next Congress, has signaled he would work with the administration to review prescription drug prices in an effort to lower costs for consumers, and also revisit postal reform and student debt.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee may revive the panel\u2019s dormant Russia investigation after Republicans ended the probe last year after concluding there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nDemocrats have complained that Republicans failed to follow lines of inquiry and rushed interviews without asking serious questions to important witnesses. Rep. Adam Schiff, who stands to become chairman, could subpoena several witnesses to reappear, including, Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former Director of Oval Operations Keith Schiller. Democrats also want to examine whether Michael Cohen ever traveled to Russia, and whether Donald Trump Jr. told his father about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.\n\nAt the House Judiciary Committee, Democrats are expected to schedule hearings on President Trump\u2019s use of the pardon power and questions surrounding obstruction of justice of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking Democrat who is anticipated to become chairman, will also lead hearings into the administration\u2019s actions on immigration -- from ending DACA to the Muslim ban and family separations, and investigate elements of the Russia investigation, including the Michael Cohen payments saga and obstruction.\n\nDespite the Republican attack ads, senior Democrats have tamped down any expectation of impeachment -- at least until the end of Mueller\u2019s investigation. First, they want to make the results of that investigation public, and will review the report before determining whether to proceed with impeachment.\n\nDemocrats on other committees in the House are laying the groundwork for policy-oriented oversight work and hearings with senior administration officials -- some of whom have not been forced to testify before Congress.", "Transcript for Democrats hope to win big after redistricting in Pennsylvania\n\nWe've been talking a lot tonight.

But Texas' white, college-educated women, which make up 13 percent of voters in the state, were split down the middle -- each candidate garnered 49 percent of the vote.\n\nLooming over the race was the contentious confirmation battle over Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with 59 percent of voters saying that Cruz\u2019s \"yes\" vote on Trump's Supreme Court pick was a factor in their decision, according to exit polls.\n\nMichael Wyke/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most high-profile moments came when President Donald Trump, Cruz's former rival in 2016, flew to Texas to stump on Cruz's behalf last month.\n\nTrump did his best to bury the hatchet with Cruz in Houston, just two years after insulting the GOP incumbent's father and wife.\n\nIn an effort to compete against the unprecedented energy surrounding O'Rourke's bid, Cruz tried to paint O'Rourke as a member of the liberal, Nancy Pelosi-aligned faction of the Democratic Party.\n\nCruz tested the limits of the progressive energy sweeping other parts of the country, and banked on a majority of Texas\u2019 conservative-leaning electorate rejecting the progressive challenger.\n\nMounting an aggressive, grassroots bid, O'Rourke crisscrossed the Lone Star State non-stop through Nov. 6 -- visiting all 254 counties in the state, according to his campaign.

China has won sales in the Middle East and elsewhere by offering drones at lower prices and without the political conditions attached by the U.S.\n\nThe CH-7's chief designer Shi Wen says the aircraft can \"fly long hours, scout and strike the target when necessary.\"\n\n\"Very soon, I believe, in the next one to two years, (we) can see the CH-7 flying in the blue skies, gradually being a practical and usable product in the future,\" Shi told The Associated Press.\n\nShi said manufacturer Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation plans to test fly the drone next year and begin mass production by 2022. He said the drone will likely be sold abroad but had no information on potential clients.\n\nA model of the aircraft is being displayed at this week's Zhuhai air show in southern China, a biannual event that showcases China's latest advancements in military and civilian aviation.\n\nWith a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet) and a length of 10 meters (33 feet), the swept-wing CH-7 is the size of a combat aircraft and its single engine can propel it at roughly the speed of a commercial jet airliner.\n\nThe U.S., Russia and France are also developing stealth drones, while Israel has long been a leader in the UAV field.\n\nHowever, low prices and a willingness to transfer technology have endowed China with a \"strong position,\" in the UAV market, said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group Corp. in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nThe U.S. has been extremely cautious about selling its higher-end unmanned system, even to NATO member states, opening up an opportunity to China in the export market, said Justin Bronk, an export on such technologies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London.\n\n\"It would represent an area of Chinese arms export offerings which no other country offers,\" Bronk said.\n\nAlongside its development of stealth fighters and commercial passenger jets, China has advanced rapidly in the development of UAVs, which have a relatively lower technological entry cost. Sales have also been boosted by the fact that China is not a signatory to the Missile Technology Control Regime that restricts exports of missiles and other unmanned weapons systems.\n\nThe numbers of drone programs unveiled in China in recent years has been \"dizzying,\" said Sam Roggeveen, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute.\n\nWhile the CH-7's ultimate effectiveness remains to be determined, if exported, it would \"mark another step-change for China, which has traditionally not offered its cutting-edge technology to foreign customers,\" Roggeveen said.\n\nAcross the Middle East, countries locked out of purchasing U.S.-made drones due to rules over excessive civilian casualties are being wooed by Chinese arms dealers, now the world's main distributor of armed drones.\n\nThe sales are helping expand Chinese influence across a region crucial to American security interests and bolstering Beijing's ambitions to lead in high-tech arms sales.\n\nWhile the U.S. still holds a technology advantage, China wins on price. The fact it is willing to sell the CH-7 abroad could indicate the technology is less than cutting edge, given China's desire to guard its technological edge in such areas, said Ron Huisken, a regional security expert at Australian National University.\n\nChina's exports also underscore the growing pervasiveness of drones in modern warfare, even without strong international agreements on where and how they can be used.\n\n\"One wonders what nasty surprises are in store as countries more casual about how they use drones and less strict about training standards get their hands on them,\" said Huisken.\n\nAlso appearing again at this year's Zhuhai show was China's homebuilt J-20 stealth fighter, which outwardly resembles the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor in service with the U.S. military.\n\nIt was joined by the Chinese J-10B fighter with vectoring thrust, featuring an engine equipped with a hinged nozzle. Vectoring thrust technology allows planes to direct their propulsion, giving it more flexibility in maneuvering, and the substation of Chinese-made WS-10 engines for those imported from Russia appears to mark a new milestone for the domestic defense industry.\n\nThe jet fighters on display thrilled spectators. For many, the performances demonstrated China's burgeoning aerospace industry and growing confidence in its technology.\n\n\"I think it is pretty awesome,\" said Xie Dongni, a marketer for an information technology company.\n\n\"I might not a plane specialist, but I can feel the way China is changing.

I wish Mike the best, and I hope he makes every single Hoosier proud as our senator.\"\n\nABC News has also projected Braun's victory based on an analysis of the vote.\n\nA former state representative, Braun ran as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, often criticizing Donnelly for not supporting the president enough \u2014 including for his vote against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Braun\u2019s victory is key for Republicans in their effort to keep control of the Senate.\n\nPreliminary exit poll results indicate President Trump has a 52-48 percent approval/disapproval rating in Indiana, where he won by 19 percentage points in 2016. Indiana native Mike Pence fares better at a 54-43 favorability rating. Thirty percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump, 34 percent to oppose him and 32 percent say he\u2019s not a factor. Brett Kavanaugh played a major role in the vote of a majority of voters, as 53 percent of voters say Sen. Joe Donnelly's vote against Kavanaugh was important to their vote.\n\nIndiana is a state President Trump won by nearly 20 points in 2016 \u2014 meaning incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly had an uphill battle in an ultimately unsuccessful re-election bid.\n\nThere were also briefly election issues at the polls in one Indiana County. Johnson County, a midsize county about 22 miles south of Indianapolis, reported issues with its electronic poll books, which contributed to longer lines, but noted that the issues were sincerely resolved.\n\nThis year\u2019s Indiana Senate race featured showdowns in the primary and general election cycles, putting Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s home state in the spotlight for battles within his own party, as well as across the aisle.\n\nMaddie McGarvey/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn May, Indiana businessman and former State Representative Mike Braun won the GOP primary election, edging out House Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer. The primary was filled with personal jabs and created an intra-party divide between sitting lawmakers and a relative political outsider. That difference in approach to politics spoke to a larger theme facing the Republican Party heading into November\u2019s election.\n\nRepublican voters in the Hoosier State flocked to a Washington outsider during the 2016 presidential campaign, but after taking down a pair of congressmen in the primary, it appears Braun's statehouse experience and his policy stances helped push him past the moderate Donnelly.\n\nWhile Donnelly aligned with Republicans on issues like abortion, he had a target on his back for voting against the tax reform bill spearheaded by President Trump. The president directly targeted Donnelly during a tax event last fall in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cIf Senator Donnelly doesn't approve it, because you know, he's on the other side, we will come here. We will campaign against him like you wouldn't believe,\u201d Trump said at the time.\n\nThe president made two stops in Indiana on Braun's behalf during the final week of the campaign. On Friday, both the president and vice president campaigned in Indianapolis for Braun, as did former Indiana Hoosiers basketball coach Bob Knight. The president made a second stop in Fort Wayne on Monday to stump for Braun one more time before Election Day.\n\nOn the Democratic side, former President Barack Obama visited Indiana to stump for Donnelly on Sunday and praised the senator for his bipartisanship.\n\nMaddie McGarvey/The New York Times/Redux\n\n\"Joe Donnelly and I didn't agree all the time. But Joe always let me know where he stood and I knew what he believed in and that he always was focused on, 'What's the best thing for the Hoosiers that he served?'\" Obama said. \"He was honest and he was direct. So you can count on that. That's what you want. You don't want just a yes man all the time.\"\n\nHealth care was the top issue of four major issues polled, with 42 percent of voters saying it was the top issue facing the country. Hoosier State voters give Democrats a 50-44 advantage on the question of who will better protect pre-existing condition coverage. Immigration was only the top issue for 26 percent of voters, despite President Trump's push on the issue. More say that his immigration policies are \"too tough\" (41 percent) than \"about right\" (34 percent) or \"not tough enough\" (21 percent). Despite the less-than-ideal exit poll numbers on the issues for Republicans, it appears they have been able to pull out a key flip of a Senate seat.\n\nIf the race were closer, it could have been complicated by the candidacy of a third-party candidate, Libertarian Lucy Brenton. The Libertarian nominee may earn enough votes to swing the election. Donnelly\u2019s campaign has been tied to ads touting Brenton as \u201cthe true anti-tax conservative\u201d in an effort to peel off conservative votes from Braun. President Trump slammed Donnelly in a tweet Saturday accusing the first-term Democrat of \u201ctrying to steal the election.\u201d", "Already have an account? sign in\n\nCreate an ABC Account to get the most of your ABC experience\n\nSign Out\n\nAre you sure you want to sign out?\n\nBy signing out, you will not be able to resume watching content where you left off, enjoy cross-device viewing experience, or save your favorites to your My List.\n\nsign out", "Transcript for New Jersey Sen.

Japanese surfer Tadashi Nakahara died at the same beach in 2015 after a great white shark 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) long tore off both his legs.\n\nGovernment shark experts measured the tooth imprints in Jonsson's surfboard and concluded a juvenile great white shark 2.6 meters (9 feet) long was responsible.\n\nBallina Shire Mayor David Wright said Jonsson came onshore after he was bitten while lying on his board, wrapped his leg and went to the hospital for treatment of a 20-centimeter (8-inch) wound.\n\n\"It dragged him off and he fought the shark with his board,\" Wright said. \"It's one of those unfortunate things.\"\n\nBeaches in the area are expected to be closed for at least 24 hours.\n\nOn Monday, a shark killed a man in a harbor in the Whitsunday Islands, where two tourists were mauled in September. The islands are 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) north of Ballina.\n\nThe victim, 33-year-old doctor Daniel Christidis, had been diving from a paddle board while on a yacht cruise. Police Inspector Steve O'Connell said the group included other doctors who worked to save him but Christidis was injured too severely.\n\nThe spate of attacks in the Whitsundays has left authorities struggling to explain an apparent escalation in danger in the internationally renowned vacation destination. In September, two Australian tourists were mauled on consecutive days, one a 12-year-old girl who lost a leg.\n\nTourism Whitsundays general manager Natassia Wheeler said Christidis' group of 10 friends had been warned when they rented the yacht not to swim in the harbor where he was attacked.\n\nThe briefing by the rental company \"involved saying no swimming at all in Cid Harbor, ... no swimming at dusk and dawn \u2014 all of the standard safety procedures,\" Wheeler told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nRescue helicopter crew member Ben McCauley, who accompanied all three Cid Harbor shark attack victims on the 100-kilometer (60-mile) flights from Cid Harbor to Mackay Base Hospital, said his role had taken a personal toll.\n\n\"It's tough. If you went home and came to work the next day and pretended it doesn't affect you, you're just lying to yourself,\" McCauley said.", "Voting machine glitches, long lines and misinformation were among the problems that voters faced at the polls on Tuesday.\n\nThe cause of the problems ran the gamut from human error to threatened violence to technological errors to Mother Nature as storms pummeled several states in the South.\n\nThe issues added more chaos to a bitterly fought election that will decide who controls the Senate, House and hundreds of down-ticket races.\n\nHere's what you should know about Election Day voting issues:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nLONG LINES, 911 CALL\n\nLong lines and malfunctioning machines marred voting in some precincts across the U.S. Some voters reported waiting up to three hours to vote, with some of the biggest problems in Georgia and New York.\n\nIn South Carolina, a woman said she called 911 after waiting outside her polling place for 45 minutes to get help because she's disabled.\n\nNot even Georgia's state election boss was immune from voting problems.\n\nSecretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate, had an issue with his voter card when he went to cast his ballot, but it was fixed quickly. He walked by reporters and said: \"Take 2.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, Sandy Hanebrink told the Anderson Independent-Mail she couldn't make it inside her polling place because she can't walk on the gravel or grass where vehicles have to park. Hanebrink said she tried to flag down poll workers and call Anderson County's election hotline before dialing 911. Poll workers went out after she made her call.\n\nIn Florida and California, some voters assigned to polling stations inside gated communities complained that it took them up to an hour to get their cars past security gates.\n\nElections clerk Rosemarie Reed told WTVJ-TV she was furious to see the long lines in Deerfield Beach, California, and called voting inside a gated community voter suppression. However, Deerfield Beach Commissioner Bernie Parness, who lives inside the gated community, said it was a needed safety measure and minor inconvenience.\n\nRuth Houston waited about half an hour to get to her polling place at Point Dume Club, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from her home in Malibu, California.\n\n\"Voters had to stop at a security gate to be allowed into the gated neighborhood where our polling place was located,\" she said in an email to The Associated Press. \"A poll worker told neighborhood managers they needed to open the gate so voters could drive in without talking to security, but management refused claiming opening the gate would be against their policy.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nRACISM AND UNREST\n\nVoting was mostly peaceful across the country on Tuesday, but there were a few reported problems, including heated confrontations between poll workers and voters.\n\nIn Texas, a white poll worker was accused of bumping a black voter during an argument at a polling site and suggesting that the voter could better understand her if she'd worn \"my blackface makeup.\"\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reported the dispute began over a discrepancy with the voter's address. The confrontation escalated, and witnesses confirmed to the newspaper that the worker said, \"Maybe if I'd worn my blackface makeup today you could comprehend what I'm saying to you.\"\n\nThe election judge at the site separated the two. The poll worker was cited for misdemeanor assault.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, a man was accused of threatening to shoot poll workers who told him he wasn't registered to vote.\n\nMelanie Ostrander, Washington County assistant elections director, said 48-year-old Christopher Thomas Queen, of Claysville, went to a polling place in South Franklin Township on Tuesday morning and became irate when he was told he wasn't registered.\n\nOstrander said the man \"told the poll workers he was going to go get a gun and come back and shoot them.\" He was charged with terroristic threats and disorderly conduct. Court documents don't list an attorney for him.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWEATHER WOES\n\nSevere weather and humidity were to blame for voting issues in a handful of states.\n\nIn North Carolina, officials said high humidity prevented ballots in some precincts from being able to be fed through tabulators in some precincts in Wake and Forsyth counties. Officials said such ballots are stored securely in emergency bins and would be tabulated as soon as possible.\n\nIn New York City, a co-chairman of the state election board, Douglas Kellner, said scanners were breaking down at a higher-than-usual rate because it was using a two-page ballot and the weather was damp.\n\nIn Tennessee, severe storms that knocked down trees and power lines forced voters in some places to use paper ballots instead of electronic voting machines. Tennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins said the polling places that had electricity knocked out were operating on generators and had emergency ballots ready. He said the paper ballots would be counted Tuesday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nVOTERS MISDIRECTED\n\nElection watchers say some voters are reporting being directed to wrong polling places by third-party election help websites such as TurboVote.\n\nSophia Hall, an attorney who was working at an election protection command center in Boston on Tuesday, says they received several such reports in Massachusetts and are aware of reports in other states.\n\nHall says they've also received reports of people being told they aren't registered when they arrive at the polls even though they thought their registration had been confirmed by a third-party site.\n\nTurboVote is a tool created by Democracy Works that helps people register and sends voters email and text reminders about registration deadlines, upcoming elections and where to vote. TurboVote doesn't actually register voters but facilitates registration with state election offices.\n\nBrandon Naylor, a spokesman for Democracy Works, says TurboVote gets its polling location information directly from the states, but sometimes the locations change at the last minute. He also says people sometimes mistakenly believe they are registered but didn't complete all the steps to complete their registration with the state.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFORECLOSURE ON POLLING PLACE\n\nA polling station in Arizona failed to open on Tuesday for an unusual reason: The building it was in was foreclosed on overnight.\n\nCounty Recorder Adrian Fontes said poll workers were trying to set up in the parking lot of the Golf Academy of America, which had been foreclosed on overnight Tuesday.\n\nThe owners of the Chandler property locked the doors, taking election officials by surprise. Fontes had said reopening the site would have required a court order.\n\nThe polling station was relocated and reopened four hours late.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMACHINES MALFUNCTIONING\n\nForty-one states were using computerized voting machines that are more than a decade old. Forty-three states were using machines that are no longer manufactured, making them more difficult to service when they break down, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. Yet Congress has repeatedly balked at appropriating the more than $1 billion needed to upgrade to more reliable systems.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the nonpartisan Election Protection hotline had received about 17,500 calls from voters experiencing problems at their polling places. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which helps run the hotline, said that was on par with the number of calls received during a presidential election and noted the hotline had received about 10,400 calls by the same time in 2014.\n\nClarke ran through a list of voting problems, which largely were connected to malfunctioning voting machines reported in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in this cycle we have seen sign evidence that we have important work to do to ensure that jurisdictions across the country are using the best voting equipment that is available and machines that don't malfunction,\" Clarke said. \"We should not tolerate this kind of outcome in 2018.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMEDIA KEPT AWAY\n\nMedia outlets were barred from taking photos or video Tuesday at a polling place in Kansas that has been at the center of controversy for weeks, and an embattled Republican congressman banned Iowa's largest newspaper from covering his election night events.\n\nIn the only polling place in Dodge City, Kansas, which is outside city limits and more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the nearest bus stop, reporters were allowed into the Expo Center polling place with notebooks only, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox said letting the media take pictures and video would be too disruptive.\n\nAttorney Bradley Schlozman, representing Cox, said Kansas law allows the election board to control procedures at polling sites.\n\nMax Kautsch, an attorney for the Capital-Journal and the Kansas Press Association, said that law needs to be balanced with rights under the First Amendment. He noted Ford County has allowed photographs in previous elections.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Rep. Steve King decided to ban the Des Moines Register from his election night events in Sioux City.\n\nThe Register reported it requested credentials to cover the event but King's son, Jeff King, responded Tuesday with an email saying, \"We are not granting credentials to the Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth.\"\n\nKing has faced criticism from Republican officials and lost funding from business groups after he tweeted support for a white nationalist candidate in Toronto and praised a nationalist party in Austria with Nazi ties. King said media reports have been inaccurate and unfair.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMISINFORMATION\n\nA sign discouraging college students from voting was spotted at polling place in Rexburg, Idaho, on Tuesday morning.\n\nKristine Anderson, of Rexburg, spotted the sign, which told students they \"should not be registering and voting in your college locale simply because you failed to register and vote at your true domicile.\"\n\nAnderson reported the sign to American Civil Liberties Union-Idaho, which tweeted: \"We've spoken with the Madison County Clerk and they're headed to the precinct to investigate these signs.\" Anderson said the area is home to a large contingent of college students at Brigham Young University-Idaho.\n\nCollege students have dual residency and a choice of where they want to vote. They can register back at home or on campus but not in both places.", "Transcript for Indiana exit poll: Voters say Donnelly's vote against Kavanaugh affected their vote\n\nRace there were re watching as a sign for how things really go this evening.

Demanding that he resigned because of this conflict of interest that they argued. On his side of course there's there's there's no problem with this he says that he's just enforcing the law. But there are going to be increasing calls for him to. One resign or be step away from the process if this doesn't end tonight. And moves to a runoff you're gonna hear people. I'll call for that with louder voices. President Jimmy Carter is one of those voices his calling for cap to step down. And when you look at history there there's precedent for this Karen Handel. Who is running for congress tonight when she ran for governor and was secretary of state she left the position. And so you know those calls are not coming out of thin air they may have good reason and and just to give you dance like one of the issues that could be in play here.

Add Interest\n\nMore than just the hopes of politicians were on ballots as voters also took up statewide measures to enact policy reforms, which may ultimately influence national policy.\n\nThe issues this election cycle included marijuana legalization, abortion rights and suffrage for felons. The results will offer insights into voter moods and the forces that drove Americans to the polls.\n\nHere are some of the most consequential state measures across the country:\n\nVoting rights for felons\n\nABC News confirmed Florida voters passed an amendment that could potentially shift Florida\u2019s political climate. The initiative will restore voting rights to the majority of felons who have completed their sentences.\n\nA provision of the Florida constitution, with Jim Crow\u2013era roots, prevented more than 1.5 million Floridians \u2014 a disproportionate number of whom are black \u2014 from voting, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nFlorida was one of three states, along with Iowa and Kentucky, to permanently bar all citizens with felony convictions from voting, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nMulti-award winning Grammy pop star Rihanna backed the measure.\n\n\"VOTE YES on Amendment 4 to restore voting rights to folks who have already paid their debt to society,\" Rihanna tweeted.\n\nFLORIDA: You have the opportunity to make history this election. Let\u2019s #bringithome. Vote @andrewgillum. And VOTE YES on Amendment 4 to restore voting rights to folks who have already paid their debt to society. VOTE on November 6th! https://t.co/ApH5hN7anc pic.twitter.com/Kpxz9XleYZ \u2014 Rihanna (@rihanna) November 4, 2018\n\nThe measure came after a federal appeals court blocked an injunction by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in March. He ruled Florida's system that requires felons wait five years to petition the governor and three elected Cabinet members for the right to vote was \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nLegalization of recreational marijuana\n\nState-level approval for marijuana use has been growing in recent years. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana through a ballot, Oklahoma voters approved medical marijuana in June and Vermont legalized recreational marijuana in July.\n\nSeeking to continue the momentum, a number of similar measures were up for consideration.\n\nVoters in Michigan and North Dakota were deciding on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, while Utah and Missouri were taking up a measure to approve medical marijuana.\n\nABC News confirmed Michigan voters approved the state's proposition -- making it the first state to legalize the possession and use of recreational marijuana in the Midwest.\n\nThe legalization of recreational marijuana in Michigan, also known as Issue 1, supports the legalization of marijuana for people who are 21 and older and would enact a 10 percent sale tax. The measure also permits users to domestically grow up to 12 pot plants.\n\nJason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP\n\nNorth Dakota was attempting to take a different approach. The measure would adopt the same policy as Michigan and legalize pot for people over 21, but it would also automatically expunge criminal records of individuals with marijuana convictions.\n\nAbortion on the ballot\n\nWith a conservative-leaning Supreme Court now in place after the addition of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, many abortion rights advocates are concerned about the impact of his confirmation on Roe v. Wade.\n\nAccording to a Pew poll, abortion was a pivotal concern for voters, with 61 percent of Democrats saying that abortion is very important to their vote this year.\n\nAt stake in several states is access and funding for abortions. Alabama, Oregon and West Virginia voters were deciding on ballot measures that challenge Roe v. Wade and could impact women\u2019s rights if the landmark 1973 decision is overturned.\n\nAlabama voters were taking up a proposed constitutional amendment, which seeks to \"recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.\"\n\nThe measure would rewrite the state\u2019s constitution, and effectively eliminate the right for a woman to obtain an abortion in Alabama, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nWest Virginia and Oregon\u2019s ballot measures want to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions for those people covered by Medicaid and public insurance plans.\n\nTed S. Warren/AP\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s amendment would add to the state constitution: \"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.\"\n\nThe initiative, if approved by voters in the Mountain State and if Roe v. Wade were overturned, could potentially make certain that the state\u2019s constitution would not allow abortions.\n\nIn Oregon, a measure was on the ballot that, if approved, would prohibit public funds from being spent on abortions, except when medically necessary or required by federal law.\n\nAn abortion would qualify as \u201cmedically necessary\u201d if a licensed physician determines that a woman would suffer an injury or death unless an abortion is performed, according to the initiative\u2019s text.\n\nDemocratic Oregon Gov. Kate Brown opposed the initiative, but through this measure, voters in Oregon would have the final say.\n\nHealthcare at stake\n\nHealthcare was a prominent theme in this midterm election, preliminary exit poll numbers show. Voters in four conservative states, including Montana, Idaho, Nebraska and Utah, had the chance to expand Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid is the main government-funded source of health insurance for low-income and disabled individuals. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, guarantees that all individuals are insured under Medicaid.\n\nCurrently, one out of six people are insured with Medicaid and there are 32 states that have already expanded Medicaid.\n\nTuesday's votes on Medicaid were the first time voters weighed in since Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2018.\n\nErik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nA vote for the ballot measures would require each of the four states to provide Medicaid for individuals under the age of 65, with income equal or below the poverty line. If the initiative is passed in each state, the expansion of Medicaid would insure an additional 325,000 individuals.\n\nPatient care in Massachusetts\n\nMassachusetts voters were also being asked a question about patient care.\n\nA certified question on the ballot would impose a limit on the number of patients a nurse could be assigned to during a shift. If a nurse were to violate the imposed ratio, the hospital would be fined $25,000.\n\nThe Massachusetts Nurses Association, which represents 20 percent of nurses in Massachusetts, implemented the initiative. The union argues it would improve the safety of nurses, patients and improve patient care.\n\nThe opposition suggests that the implementation of the rule would prompt a nursing shortage, cause hospitals to close if they could not staff enough nurses and could increase emergency room wait times, especially during mass casualty events or an outbreak.", "Interested in Russia?
