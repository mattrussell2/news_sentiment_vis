However, the new list of sanctions, which also aims to cut Iran's vital oil industry off from international sales, also included for the first time its state airline and its atomic energy commission, further highlighting the maximalist approach of President Donald Trump's administration.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFacebook admits not doing enough to prevent Myanmar violence\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Facebook is admitting that it didn't do enough to prevent its services from being used to incite violence and spread hate in Myanmar.

Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nNational Exit Poll\n\nDonald Trump and control of Congress are front and center in this election, and preliminary results from the state and national exit polls touch on both of them:\n\nIn results so far, 44 percent of voters approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, while 55 percent disapprove.\n\nAnd while the House races will be fought district by district, voters by 53-43 percent say they\u2019d rather see the Democrats than the Republicans in control of the House after this election.\n\nAntipathy toward Trump doesn\u2019t reach majority support for impeachment \u2013 41 percent of voters support impeaching the president and removing him from office, with 55 percent opposed. Still, 39 percent say they cast their ballots to show opposition to Trump, vs. 26 percent who say they voted to show him support. (33 percent say he didn\u2019t figure in their vote.)\n\nThere are vast divisions among groups on Trump and control of Congress, and voters recognize today\u2019s political polarization. Seventy-seven percent say Americans are becoming more politically divided, while just 8 percent see greater unity; 13 percent see no change.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, even with the economy its best in decades by many measures, just 41 percent say the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent say it\u2019s seriously off on the wrong track. There\u2019s a huge gulf between Republicans and Democrats on the question, but among independents, often swing voters, 58 percent say wrong track vs. 39 percent right direction.\n\nWhile preliminary exit poll results indicate a preference for Democratic control of the House, neither party is beloved. Voters divide 50-46 percent in favorable vs. unfavorable views of the Democratic Party. The GOP fares worse \u2013 43-54 percent, favorable-unfavorable. Nancy Pelosi, a Republican bugaboo in the campaign, trails her party\u2019s favorability rating - and Trump's approval rating - at 31-55 percent, favorable-unfavorable.\n\nIn one more eye-opening preliminary result: 51 percent of voters today say the government has not done enough to protect this election from foreign interference.\n\nIn terms of group sizes \u2013 which can change, these are preliminary results only:\n\nParty ID: Democrats account for 38 percent of voters in exit poll results so far, Republicans for 32 percent and independents for 30 percent. That compares with 36-37-27 percent in 2014, and 37-33-29 percent in 2016.\n\nIdeology: Liberal-moderate-conservative group sizes in results so far are 27-38-36 percent. That compares with 22-39-38 percent in the 2014 midterms. (And 26-38-36 percent in 2016.)\n\nSex: Women account for 52 percent of voters in preliminary results, matching their previous high in a midterm from 2010.\n\nLindsey Wasson/Reuters\n\nKey Issues\n\nAmong key issues in the campaign \u2013 beyond Trump himself \u2013 preliminary exit poll results indicate the following:\n\nImmigration: With the Central American caravan drawing broad attention in the campaign, voters divide on Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u2013 48 percent say they\u2019re too tough, 32 percent say they\u2019re about right and 16 percent say they\u2019re not tough enough.\n\nHealth care: Voters by 58-34 percent pick the Democratic Party over the Republicans as more likely to protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions, another central focus of the 2018 campaign.\n\nFurther, given a choice of four issues, 41 percent pick health care as the top issue facing the country, compared with 21 percent for the economy, 23 percent immigration and 11 percent gun policy. (We\u2019ll look at vote preferences in each group as the night proceeds.)\n\nKavanaugh: Any impact of the controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court may come down to state-to-state races. Nationally, the country divides \u2013 43 percent support his confirmation, 48 percent oppose it in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nTax and trade: Two of the president\u2019s signature economic policies get a mixed reception. Fewer than a third of voters, 28 percent, say they\u2019ve been helped by the Trump tax law (45 percent no impact, 23 percent hurt by it.) And just 25 percent say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy. 31 percent say they\u2019ve hurt, 36 percent say they've had no effect.\n\nWomen: Women account for 53 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results, numerically a record midterm high (albeit by just 1 point from 2010). They\u2019re voting for Democratic House candidates by 60-39 percent. And there\u2019s a tremendous gender gap in views of president Trump\u2019s work in office: While men voting today divide 50-49 percent on Trump, approve-disapprove, that goes to 39-60 percent among women voters. And while 57 percent of men approve of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, just 43 percent of women agree.\n\nSharp gender differences extend elsewhere. Voters by 78-20 percent call it important to elect more women to public office; 53 percent of women call it \u201cvery\u201d important, vs. do 37 percent of men. That may play out in the unusual number of races including female candidates this year.\n\nAnd 84 percent of voters today call sexual harassment a serious problem in the United States, including 47 percent who call it very serious. 52 percent of women vs. 40 percent of men call sexual harassment a very serious problem. In an even bigger gap, 64 percent of Democrats call it very serious, vs. 40 percent of independents and 29 percent of Republicans.\n\nElizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nMore On Groups And Issues\n\nRace: Turnout by racial and ethnic minorities is key to Democrats\u2019 chances in many contests. Preliminary exit poll results can change, but in these early results nonwhites account for 29 percent of voters nationally; as noted, the highest in any midterm was 25 percent in 2014. That nonwhite total includes 12 percent blacks and 12 percent Hispanics. The previous highs in midterm elections were 13 percent for blacks, in 2014; and 8 percent for Hispanics, in 2006, 2012 and 2014 alike.\n\nWith black candidates in several high-profile races, voters nationally by 71-24 percent say it\u2019s important to elect more racial and ethnic minorities to public office; 44 percent say it\u2019s very important. It\u2019s very important to 61 percent of nonwhites, compared with 38 percent of whites.\n\nThere\u2019s also a sharp division \u2013 as much political as racial and ethnic \u2013 in whether voters think whites are favored over minorities, minorities are favored over whites, or no group is favored. Among Democrats, 71 percent think whites are favored over minorities. Among Republicans, just 10 percent agree.\n\nVoting: Ballot access is a related issue: In these preliminary results, the public by 54-36 percent sees voter suppression as a bigger concern than vote fraud.\n\nAge: Will young and first-time voters make a difference this year? Patterns of when people vote mean this can change, but in preliminary results 18- to 29-year-olds account for 13 percent of voters nationally today; it was 11 percent in 2014, when they backed Democrats for House by a 12-point margin.\n\nEconomy: 68 percent of voters say the economy is in excellent or good condition, up dramatically from 36 percent just two years ago, albeit far below the peak, 85 percent, in 2000. Many fewer, though, say their own financial situation has improved in the past two years: 35 percent, compared with 30 percent two years ago.\n\nWhat typically matters most is people who say they\u2019re worse off: 14 percent in today\u2019s preliminary results. It was 26 percent in 2014; what mattered is that they favored Republicans for House \u2013 then voting against the president\u2019s party \u2013 by 67-31 percent.\n\nMueller/Election Security: In the investigation still hanging over the Trump White House:\n\nVoters divide on Robert Mueller\u2019s handling of his investigation, 42-46 percent, approve-disapprove.\n\nVoters by 54-41 percent say the Mueller investigation is mostly politically motivated rather than justified.\n\nGun Ownership: 47 percent of voters live in gun-owning households in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nStricter Gun Control Measures: 60-35 percent, support-oppose. Among those in gun-owning households, 42-52 percent.\n\nVeterans: 14 percent of voters, preliminarily.\n\nWhite Evangelical Christians: 27 percent of voters, preliminarily. The previous midterm peak was 27 percent in 2014. One of the most Republican groups, they voted 83-16 percent for House candidates in 2016, and 78-21 percent in 2014.\n\nLGBT Voters: 6 percent of all voters in results so far, compared with 4 percent in the last two elections.\n\nIndependents \u2013 often swing voters \u2013 are voting 55-41 percent for Democratic vs. Republican House candidates in preliminary exit poll results. In 2016, independents backed Donald Trump by 47-41 percent, and they voted Republican by a 14-point margin in the last midterms in 2014.\n\nYoung voters (18-29) are voting 68-31 percent, Democratic-Republican. That vast 37-point margin compares with a 21-point margin for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a 12-point margin for Democratic House candidates among under-30s in 2014.\n\nIn a continuing demographic trend, nonwhites make up 29 percent of voters today, the most on record for a midterm in exit polls since 1982.They\u2019re voting Democratic by 77-22 percent, including 69-29 percent among Hispanics, the widest Democratic margin in midterms since 2006, and 90-9 percent among blacks.\n\nSuburban women were a focus of election coverage. They\u2019re dividing 54-44 percent between Democratic and Republican House candidates. Among women overall, it\u2019s 60-39 percent.\n\nModerates backed Clinton by 13 points in 2016 and voted Democratic by a similar margin, 10 points, in 2014. Today moderates are voting 63-34 percent, Democratic-Republican, a 29-point margin in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of voters nationally are liberals - if it holds, a record high in any election in exit polls since 1976 (albeit by a single point from 2016). Conservative voters represent 35 percent of the electorate, compared with a midterm record of 42 percent in 2010.\n\nRepublican candidates are overwhelmingly winning voters who say they\u2019ve become better off financially under Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 but these are just 35 percent of voters. Among those whose financial situation is unchanged, the vote is 71-28 percent, Democratic-Republican.\n\nThere\u2019s been much attention paid to voters who say they\u2019re either showing support for Trump or opposition to him. Also of interest \u2013 the 33 percent who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They\u2019re dividing 46-51 percent, Democratic-Republican.\n\nEvangelical white Christians, a GOP mainstay, are voting 22-75 percent, Democratic-Republican, in the national House vote, their typical level.\n\nClinton won college-educated white women by 10 points in 2016, and this group voted +2 points Republican in 2014. Now they\u2019re favoring Democratic House candidates by 23 points, 61-38 percent.\n\nAcross the political spectrum, non-college white men, 20 percent of voters, are going 34-65 percent, Democratic-Republican in their national House vote. That\u2019s +31 points Republican, compared with their +46 points for Trump in 2016 and +35-point Republican vote in 2014.\n\nVoters who are focused on the economy are split 35-62 percent, Democratic-Republican. Among those concerned more with health care, that goes to a 77-21 percent Democratic advantage.\n\nFurther, they\u2019re voting for Democratic rather than Republican House candidates nationally by more than 2-1, 67-32 percent, a record margin for this group in exit polls \u2013 presidential and midterms alike \u2013 in available data back to 1990.\n\nJeff Kowalsky/Reuters\n\nNorth Dakota Senate race\n\nDemocrat Heidi Heitkamp has conceded the North Dakota Senate race to Republican Kevin Cramer.\n\nForty-seven percent of voters said that Heitkamp\u2019s (D) vote against Kavanaugh was important in their vote, and they went for Cramer by nearly 2-to-1: 38-62 percent.\n\nHeitkamp won independents (38 percent of voters), but only by a 10-point margin, not enough with Republicans accounting for 40 percent of the electorate. Predictably, they voted 92-7 percent for Cramer.\n\nDonald Trump won North Dakota by a 36-point margin in 2016, 63-27 percent. His approval rating there today is 60-39 percent, the second-highest approval rating across exit poll states. Even so, 47 percent of voters said that Trump was not a factor in their vote, versus 31 percent of voters who said they\u2019re casting a ballot to support him and 20 percent who said they\u2019re voting to oppose him.\n\nHeitkamp has a 43-53 percent favorability rating -- 10 points under water -- and is seen as too liberal by 47 percent of voters. Cramer\u2019s favorability rating is better, 53-42 percent, while 40 percent see him as too conservative.\n\nWDAY\n\nMore voters in this farm state said that Trump\u2019s trade policies have hurt their local economy, 36 percent, than helped, 23 percent; 34 percent see no impact. And a majority, 52 percent, said the tax cuts have had no impact on their finances. Thirty-nine percent said they\u2019ve become better off financially since Trump took office.\n\nHealth care ranks first as the top issue (out of four). And voters divide 46-42 percent on whether the Democrats or the Republicans would better protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nChanges to voter ID laws raised concerns about Native American\u2019s voting access. In preliminary results, Native Americans account for 2 percent of North Dakota voters, vs. 4 percent in 2008 (the most recent exit poll data in the state).\n\nThe vote in preliminary data is 38-62 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer, among those citing Heitkamp\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh as an important factor in their decision (47 percent of voters).\n\nUnusually, more than 35 percent of North Dakota Republicans voted for Democratic candidates in the 1990s and early aughts, when Democratic candidates won by 20-point margins. Not so today. Just 7 percent of Republicans are backing Heitkamp.\n\nWomen went for the Democrat in Senate races by more than 25 points between 1992 and 2006. Today, they split 51-48 percent, Heitkamp-Cramer, while Cramer took six-in-10 men.\n\nA bright spot for Heitkamp was the 44 percent who say health care is their top priority of four -- she has a +42 advantage among them, 71-29 percent.\n\nTexas Senate race\n\nRepublican Ted Cruz is on track to win the Texas Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nJonathan Bachman/Reuters\n\nMen voted for Cruz by a 15-point margin, 42-57 percent, compared with women\u2019s 7-point margin, 53-46 percent, for O\u2019Rourke.\n\nWhite college-educated women, 13 percent of Texas voters, divided 49-49 percent O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nFifty-nine percent said Cruz\u2019s vote in favor of Kavanaugh was a factor in their vote, they broke 40-60 percent O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nNonwhites account for 41 percent of Texas voters, including 24 percent Latinos. These are highs in Texas midterms in available exit polls back to 1984, and are at or near their record levels, 43 and 24 percent, in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTexas Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 9 points in the 2016 presidential election and 12 points in the 2014 midterms. Today it\u2019s a 5-point gap, 33-38 percent, Democrats-Republicans. (The last time a Democrat won a Senate seat in Texas, in 1988, turnout was +5 Democrats over Republicans.)\n\nTexas voters divide 46-49 percent on whether they\u2019d rather see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate.\n\nTurnout among liberals, 21 percent, is at a new high \u2013 but there are far more conservatives, 43 percent, voting in Texas in this election.\n\nForty-two percent of voters say Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) is too liberal, vs. 38 percent who say Ted Cruz (R) is too conservative. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s favorability rating is 51-41 percent; Cruz\u2019s, 52-46 percent.\n\nThirty-three percent in the longest-border state call Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies \u201cabout right,\u201d and voters divide 48-48 percent on whether they support or oppose a wall across the entire U.S. border with Mexico. Asked the top issue in the vote, 32 percent choose immigration among four issues given, compared with 23 percent nationally.\n\nIndependents in Texas voted Republican by a 37-point margin in the 2014 midterms. They\u2019re +5 for O\u2019Rourke, 51-46 percent, in these preliminary results.\n\nVoters focused on health care \u2013 37 percent of the electorate \u2013 are voting 68-31 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz. It\u2019s the 1st-ranked issue out of four in Texas. Among immigration voters, by contrast, it\u2019s 24-75 percent\n\nWhile conservatives predominate, a substantial 36 percent of Texas voters are moderates. They\u2019re voting 64-34 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nAmong the 62 percent of voters in gun households, it\u2019s 37-62 percent, a wide Cruz lead.\n\nTwenty-two percent cast a ballot for the first time in a midterm election today, the most of any of the 21 states with exit polls today. They\u2019re voting 52-45 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz.\n\nThirteen percent are younger than 30, voting 71-29 percent, the largest Democratic margin among this group in available exit polls back to 1984, and surpassing their margin in the 2016 presidential election by 23 points. By contrast, seniors, 29 percent of the electorate, are voting 42-58 percent.\n\nNonwhites are voting 69-30 percent, O\u2019Rourke-Cruz. That includes Latinos, 63-35 percent \u2013 their largest Democratic margin since 2006 - and blacks, 90-9 percent.\n\nJacob Hamilton/Ann Arbor News/AP\n\nWisconsin governor's race\n\nForty-seven percent of voters prefer to keep incumbent Scott Walker\u2019s (R) signature 2011 law eliminating most collective bargaining for public employees; 41 percent would like to see it repealed. (17 percent are from union households, a new low.)\n\nTony Evers (D) is more personally popular than Walker, who\u2019s seeking his third term. Evers has a 53-41 percent favorability rating, compared with 48-51 percent for Walker \u2013 10 points higher on unfavorability.\n\nTurnout divides 35-33 percent, Democrats-Republicans, in these preliminary results. That 2-point gap is similar to the last two gubernatorial elections (+1R in 2014, +1D in 2010).\n\nIn a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, he has a 46-53 percent job approval rating.\n\nWhile just 16 percent of the electorate, nonwhite voters are making up their largest share of voters in available exit polls for Wisconsin gubernatorial races since 1994.\n\nWalker won independents by double-digits in his previous gubernatorial victories; in this election Evers is winning them, 54-44 percent.\n\nWalker lost moderate voters by 6 points in 2010 and 13 points in 2010. Tonight he\u2019s losing them by more, 19 points, 59-40 percent.\n\nCritics of the state\u2019s controversial collective bargaining law, 41 percent of all voters, are backing Evers over Walker by 76-22 percent. Union voters are going 59-38 percent, Evers-Walker; Walker\u2019s 21-point deficit in this group is narrower than in either 2014 (31 points) or 2010 (26 points).\n\nNon-college white men are voting broadly for Walker, 40-58 percent.\n\nWalker\u2019s favorable rating is 49 percent; Evers\u2019, 50 percent.\n\nTurnout divides 34-34 percent, Democrats-Republicans. Walker won slightly more Democrats than Evers won Republicans. But Evers comes back among independents by 7 points, 52-45 percent.\n\nEvers is buoyed by nonwhites. While just 17 percent of the electorate, they are making up their largest share of voters in available exit polls for Wisconsin gubernatorial races since 1994. Evers is winning about three-quarters of them. Walker\u2019s margin is 45-54 percent among white voters.\n\nCritics of the state\u2019s controversial collective bargaining law, 38 percent of all voters, are backing Evers over Walker by 78-19 percent. However, Walker comes back with a similar advantage among the 48 percent who support it.\n\nUnion voters are 18 percent of voters, a new low. Evers is winning them, 55-41 percent, but this 14-point deficit is narrower than Walker had in either 2014 (31 points) or 2010 (26 points).\n\nMichigan governor's race\n\nDemocrat Gretchen Whitmer is on track to win the Michigan gubernatorial race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nWhitmer won independents, 50-45, a group which previously went for Donald Trump by 16 points and outgoing governor Rick Snyder (R) by 27 points\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton lost white women by 8 points in 2016, Whitmer won them by 14 points, 56-42. Among black women, the margin is 93-4, Whitmer-Schuette.\n\nFifty-eight percent of Michigan voters trust Gretchen Whitmer (D) to handle the state\u2019s safe-drinking water issue; just 30 percent trust Bill Schuette (R) to handle it.\n\nIn a state that narrowly went for Trump in 2016, his job approval is now 42-57, one of the lowest in the 21 states with exit polls tonight.\n\nWith Whitmer seeking to become Michigan\u2019s second female governor, 79 percent of voters say it\u2019s important for more women to be elected to public office. About 8 in 10 men and women alike say it\u2019s important.\n\nVoters in Michigan are about as likely to say Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies have hurt their local economy as to say they\u2019ve helped, 32-30 percent. And while 64 percent of voters say the national economy is in good shape, fewer, 36 percent, say they are personally better off financially since Trump took office.\n\nForty-six percent of Michigan voters named health care as the top issue facing the country\u2014more than twice as many as named the economy (20 percent) or other issues asked about. This was a winning issue for Whitmer, with those concerned about health care voting 79-19, Whitmer-Schuette.\n\nGeorgia governor's race\n\nIn preliminary exit poll results, turnout among nonwhites is a record 40 percent, including 30 percent black voters. The previous high among nonwhites was 36 percent in 2014 \u2013 compared with just 18 percent in 1994.\n\nForty-two percent of voters are conservatives, which is typical in Georgia. Liberals account for 20 percent, a new high for a gubernatorial election if it holds. It was 17 percent in 2014.\n\nThirty-nine percent say Stacey Abrams (D) is too liberal; 36 percent say Brian Kemp (R) is too conservative.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s approval rating is 51 percent among Georgia voters, 7 points better than his overall approval nationally. 20 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump; 15 percent, to oppose him.\n\nSeventy percent call it important to elect more women to public office; that compares with 78 percent nationally.\n\nThere's greater concern about voter suppression than voter fraud, 51-41 percent, a key topic in this contest.\n\nWhile the women\u2019s vote gets a lot of attention, men in Georgia are splitting about evenly, 46-49, Abrams-Kemp. In the last two gubernatorial elections for which we have exit polls (2014 and 2006), the winning Republican candidates won men by 60-37 and 61-34 percent.\n\nIndependents, historically a swing voter group in Georgia, divide 55-41 percent, Abrams-Kemp.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s suburban voters are voting 43-54 percent, Abrams-Kemp \u2013 including advantages for Kemp among suburban women (46-53 percent) and suburban men (40-54 percent) alike.\n\nLibertarian Ted Metz has 3 percent support, worth watching because Georgia requires candidates to get more than 50 percent of the vote to win an election.\n\nCollege-educated voters in Georgia are voting 55-43, Abrams-Kemp. This 12-point advantage is the largest Democratic lead in any midterm exit poll conducted in Georgia to date.\n\nIndiana Senate race\n\nJustin Casterline/EPA via Shutterstock\n\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly has conceded the Indiana Senate race to Republican Mike Braun.\n\nThe race was a test case for Kavanaugh impact: 53 percent call incumbent Donnelly\u2019s (D) vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation important in their vote; 19 percent call it a minor factor, 22 percent not a factor at all. We\u2019ll see how they voted after the polls close.\n\nDonald Trump has a 52-48 percent approval rating in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. (Native son Mike Pence has a 54-43 percent favorability rating.) Thirty percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump, 34 percent to oppose him, while 32 percent say he\u2019s not a factor.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Hoosier voters say the national economy is doing well but local conditions are less broadly positive. Forty-six percent say their own finances have improved since Trump took office, 36 percent say they\u2019ve benefited from the Trump tax law and 29 percent say his trade policies have helped their local economy.\n\nForty-two percent say health care is the top issue of four facing the country. And voters divide 50-44 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect pre-existing condition coverage.\n\nTrump\u2019s pushed immigration hard -- but it\u2019s the top issue to just 26 percent, far trailing health care. (The economy comes in at 21 percent.) More say that his immigration policies are too tough, 41 percent, than about right, 34 percent, or not tough enough, 21 percent.\n\nDonnelly won his seat in 2012 partly on the strength of an 11-point victory among independent voters. Independents are voting 52-40 percent between Donnelly and Mike Braun (R) in preliminary results tonight. They account for 32 percent of voters \u2013 if it holds, a new high in available exit poll data.\n\nDonnelly ran evenly among men in 2012. Today they\u2019re voting 42-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun.\n\nSuburban voters divide 48-49 percent, Donnelly-Braun. Donnelly won suburbanites by a scant 2 points in 2012; in 2016, fellow Democrat Evan Bayh lost suburbanites by 17 points and lost the race. Suburban women are voting 52-43 percent, compared with suburban men, 43-54 percent.\n\nHealth care/immigration showdown: The vote is 74-22 percent Donnelly-Braun among those who picked health care as the top issue of four; that compares with 11-84 percent among the 26 percent who picked immigration as the top issue.\n\nThose who call Donnelly\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh highly important divide by 41-54 percent, Donnelly-Braun.\n\nLibertarian Lucy Brenton has 4 percent of the vote, compared with 6 percent for Libertarian Andy Horning in 2012. Indiana Democrats ran ads highlighting Brenton\u2019s policy positions during the campaign, seeking to draw conservative votes her way.\n\nJohn Locher/AP\n\nOhio governor's race\n\nRepublican Mike DeWine is on track to win the Ohio gubernatorial race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nDonald Trump has a split-decision 49-49 percent job approval rating among Ohio voters today, in a state he won by 8 points in 2016. Those who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve by 7 points, 43-36 percent.\n\nDemocrats were outnumbered by Republicans among Ohio voters by 3 points in 2016, 34-37 percent, and it\u2019s the same gap again today, 35-38 percent.\n\nConservatives accounted for a plurality of Ohio voters, 43 percent, in the 2014 gubernatorial race and 39 percent two years ago. Today, in data so far, they account for fewer voters, 37 percent.\n\nThe national economy is well-rated \u2013 73 percent in Ohio say it\u2019s in excellent or good shape, up dramatically from 34 percent in 2016 \u2013 but far fewer say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy (30 percent) or say his tax law has helped their own finances (28 percent).\n\nOhio voters pick health care as the top issue facing the country out of four choices offered; 41 percent choose it, far above the other choices. In a health-related issue \u2013 one that played prominently in the campaign \u2013 there\u2019s vast concern about the government response to the opioid crisis \u2013 28 percent approve, 61 percent disapprove.\n\nIndependents \u2013 often swing voters in this swing state \u2013 favored Trump over Hillary Clinton by 14 points in the presidential race two years ago. In the gubernatorial election today they\u2019re splitting 50-46 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nWomen \u2013 who favored Clinton in Ohio by a scant 3 points in Ohio in 2016 - are backing Cordray by 58-41 percent over DeWine.\n\nNon-college white men, a GOP mainstay, are backing DeWine by a wide margin, 34-63 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nDeWine is +5 points among Suburban voters, 47-52 percent, Cordray-DeWine (no longer \"dividing evenly\"). That includes a wide gender gap, suburban men 40-58 percent; suburban women 54-46 percent. SIZEPLC3, SEX\n\nIn a race that focused heavily on the opioid crisis, voters who disapprove of the way the government is handling the issue favor Cordray by 57-39 percent.\n\nUnion households, while historically a Democratic group, voted for Trump by 13 points in 2016, 54-41. Tonight, representing 26 percent of voters, they are voting 52-42 percent, Cordray-DeWine.\n\nWest Virginia Senate race\n\nJoshua Roberts/Reuters\n\nDemocrat Joe Manchin is on track to win the West Virginia Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nWest Virginia voted 69-26 percent for Trump in 2016, his best state; today voters there give him a 63-34 percent job approval rating \u2013 his best approval rating in any of the 21 states where exit polls are being conducted.\n\nIn terms of basic popularity: Joe Manchin\u2019s (D) favorability rating is 49-47 percent. Patrick Morrisey\u2019s (R) is a weaker 40-55 percent, 15 points under water. It could matter, since 25 percent say they\u2019re looking chiefly for the candidate who \u201ccares about people like me.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 share of the West Virginia electorate has dived from 57 percent in 1996 to 32 percent now, a new low. Turnout by independents has grown \u2013 from 14 percent in 1996 to 31 percent today, a new high. Manchin won independents by 7 points in 2010, a key to his victory.\n\nManchin was the only Democratic senator to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. 40 percent of voters say Manchin\u2019s vote was a key factor in their Senate vote. Twenty-two percent call it a minor factor; 34 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nAmong the state\u2019s voters overall, 40 percent say Trump\u2019s trade policies have helped their local economy (22 percent hurt, 33 percent no impact).\n\nManchin slammed Morrisey for joining a lawsuit to repeal Obamacare and limit coverage for pre-existing conditions. Today 40 percent call health care the top issue (of four) in their vote, and voters divide 41-51 percent on which party, the Democrats or the Republicans, would better protect coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nManchin won independents by 7 points in 2010. He\u2019s running even with them, 47-47 percent, in today\u2019s preliminary results.\n\nAmong voters who call Manchin\u2019s vote for Kavanaugh a factor in their vote today, Manchin leads Morrisey by 53-44 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide gender gap, with a broad advantage for Morrisey among men, 40-57 percent, Manchin-Morrisey.\n\nForty percent say they\u2019re looking for the candidate who \u201cshares my view of government,\u201d the top candidate attribute, and Morrisey is winning them, 30-68 percent, Manchin-Morrisey.\n\nModerates. Manchin got hammered among conservatives in 2010 but won political moderates by 39 points. He\u2019s winning them by a narrower margin, 26 points (61-35 percent) in preliminary results tonight.\n\nFlorida governor's race\n\nDemocrat Andrew Gillum has conceded the gubernatorial race to Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nForty-four percent of Florida voters say Gillum (D) is too liberal, while 37 percent say DeSantis (R) is too conservative.\n\nLiberals account for 22 percent of voters, matching their high in governor\u2019s races in the state. Many more, 39 percent, are conservatives.\n\nDonald Trump won Florida with 48 percent of the vote in 2017. He\u2019s got a 51-48 percent approval rating now. Voters reject impeachment, which Gillum has supported, by 54-40 percent.\n\nNonwhites account for 34 percent of voters in the state, including 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. That\u2019s a new high for midterm elections in the state, albeit short of its 2016 record, 38 percent. While much attention is paid to the Republican-leaning Cuban-American vote, 67 percent of Hispanic voters in this election are not Cuban.\n\nRick Scott (R) won Florida\u2019s suburban voters by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. Today, they\u2019re +6 Republican, 46-52 percent, Gillum-DeSantis, with a wide gender gap: 53-46 percent among suburban women, 39-61 percent among suburban men.\n\nIndependents, who voted for Charlie Crist (D) by a 2-point margin in his narrow 2014 loss, are now +11 points Democratic, 54-43 percent, Gillum-DeSantis. They make up 30 percent of voters today, slightly below their share in 2014, 33 percent.\n\nTrump approvers overall are backing the president\u2019s ally DeSantis, 8-90 percent, but among those who only \u201csomewhat\u201d approve of him, 14 percent of all voters, the vote is 28-65 percent, Gillum-DeSantis.\n\nHispanics backed Gillum by 58-39 percent and blacks by 86-14 percent, similar to their vote in 2014.\n\nFlorida Senate race\n\nMinority voters may be key in Florida; they account for 34 percent of voters in the state, up sharply from a low of 15 percent in 1992 but less than the 38 percent who came out in 2016. That includes 15 percent Hispanics and 13 percent blacks. Among Hispanics, 32 percent are of Cuban origin, while 24 percent are Puerto Rican, following an influx from the island post-Hurricane Maria.\n\nForty percent say health care is the most important issue of the four asked, 29 percent immigration, 16 percent the economy and 11 percent gun policy. Voters give the Democrats an edge in trust to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions, 48-38 percent.\n\nSixty-seven percent of Florida voters call climate change a serious problem and say the government should do more to protect the environment, an issue used against both candidates after massive algae blooms.\n\nRick Scott (R) has a 46-50 percent favorability rating among voters, compared with incumbent Bill Nelson\u2019s (D) 50-43 percent favorability. Another consideration: Florida voters divide 50-46 percent on whether they\u2019d like to see the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate.\n\nOn the Kavanaugh-effect front, 38 percent call Nelson\u2019s vote against confirmation a top factor in their vote; 17 percent call it a minor factor \u2013 and 39 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nBattle of the \u2018burbs? Nelson has won the populous Florida suburbs by double-digit margins in each of his past Senate races. Scott won them by 4 points in 2010 and 8 points in 2014. It\u2019s 46-52 percent, Nelson-Scott. That includes a 52-46 vote among suburban women, vs. 40-59 percent among suburban men.\n\nScott\u2019s win in the 2014 governor\u2019s race came via a 21-point advantage among whites. Whites tonight are voting for Scott by 19 points, 40-59 percent.\n\nThose who think the government should do more to protect the environment are favoring Nelson by a 2-1 margin, 66-34 percent.\n\nHealth care is the top-cited issue in the state, and it\u2019s a 75-22 percent vote in for Nelson\u2019s favor among those with cited it. Among immigration voters, on the other hand, it\u2019s 17-83 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nNelson's margin is +11 among Hispanics, underperforming his best (+22) and Clinton\u2019s performance in 2016 (+27) alike.\n\nThose who call Nelson\u2019s anti-Kavanaugh vote a top factor divide 47-52 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nNelson is underperforming in the Tampa Bay area (16 percent of voters) compared with his 2012 run \u2013 he\u2019s down 8 points there now, 44-52 percent, vs. 52-41 in 2012. (They split in 2016, 47-46 Clinton-Trump.)\n\nNelson lost men, 42-58 percent, but didn\u2019t improve much on his margin among women from 2012, 56-42 percent now vs. 59-39 percent then.\n\nScott\u2019s improved his margin among Hispanics, winning 44 percent of them now vs. 38 percent in 2014. Nelson\u2019s 55 percent is slightly down from 59 percent in 2012.\n\nNelson is losing suburban voters by 4 points (48-52 percent), when he won them in 2012 by 14 points. By contrast, Scott did better among small city and rural voters than he did in 2014, netting 65 percent of their votes tonight vs. 57 percent then.\n\nTwo-thirds of Florida voters say that the economy is excellent or good, and they favor Scott by 41-59 percent, Nelson-Scott.\n\nHealth care-focused voters, 40 percent, favored Nelson by a +52 margin \u2013 but immigration and economy-focused voters (together, a larger 45 percent) swung just as hard for Scott.\n\nMissouri Senate race\n\nRepublican Josh Hawley is on track to win the Missouri Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nJosh Hawley\u2019s (R) victory is thanks to a large advantage in small cities and rural areas, 30-68 percent Claire McCaskill-Hawley, and a narrow advantage in the suburbs, 48-51 percent.\n\nHawley\u2019s also winning men, 46-53 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. In McCaskill\u2019s last race (2012), she won men by eight points, 51-43 percent.\n\nAnd, independents are dividing about evenly, 49-48 percent. McCaskill had won this typically swing group by 12- and 8-point margins in 2012 and 2006.\n\nMcCaskill\u2019s (D) narrow first election in 2006 relied on her 6-point margin among women, as well as the fact that they accounted for 55 percent of voters in the state. Women make up 52 percent of Missouri voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight.\n\nAlso to watch: a conservative turnout. Conservatives accounted 37 percent of voters in 2006 when McCaskill first was elected and to 42 percent two years ago. They\u2019re back down to 36 percent of voters in results so far tonight.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is an even 50-49 percent in a state he won by 19 points in 2016. Thirty-one percent say they\u2019re voting to express support for Trump, 35 percent to oppose him. That said, in a threat for McCaskill, Missouri voters divide 45-50 percent on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans in control of the Senate.\n\nForty-five percent think McCaskill\u2019s positions on the issues are too liberal, while 42 percent think Josh Hawley\u2019s (R) are too conservative.\n\nAfter two terms in office McCaskill has a 47-51 percent favorability rating; Hawley, 48-49 percent. While favorability doesn\u2019t differentiate them, views on their ethics do: 50 percent say McCaskill has high ethical standards, while 39 percent say Hawley does.\n\nHealth care dominates as the top issue of four offered \u2013 48 percent call it the most important of four offered; the economy and immigration tie for second with 20 percent each. Missouri voters pick the Democrats over the Republicans to better protect health care for those with pre-existing conditions, 52-44 percent.\n\nFifty-one percent of voters say McCaskill\u2019s vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was a top factor in their Senate vote. Seventeen percent say it was a minor factor; 27 percent, not a factor at all.\n\nTurnout among independents is 32 percent in preliminary exit poll results, potentially a new high in midterms, while Democrats and Republicans are at 34 percent of the electorate apiece. With Republican and Democrat voter turnout even, McCaskill likely needs independents to hold her seat.\n\nIndependents are voting a close 49-47 percent, McCaskill-Hawley, in preliminary exit poll results. McCaskill won this typically swing group by 12- and 8-point margins in 2012 and 2006.\n\nSuburban voters backed McCaskill by 55-39 percent in her easy 2012 race against Todd Akin (R), but she lost them, 46-52 percent, in 2006. They\u2019re voting by the same 46-52 percent in preliminary results today. That includes a gender gap, 49-50 percent among suburban women, 44-55 percent among suburban men.\n\nThose who call McCaskill\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh a top factor are voting 46-52 percent, McCaskill-Hawley. At the same time, 83 percent call sexual harassment a serious problem; they\u2019re breaking 58-42 percent in McCaskill\u2019s favor.\n\nUnusually for a Democrat, McCaskill won 35 percent of evangelical white Christians six years ago, vs. 24 percent in her close first election. Today they\u2019re dividing 27-72 percent, McCaskill-Hawley.\n\nYoung voters (age under 30) account for 10 percent of voters in Missouri in preliminary results. They\u2019re voting 63-34 percent for the Democrat \u2013 compared with 69-25 percent in her last race.\n\nTennessee Senate race\n\nMark Humphrey/AP\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn is on track to win the Tennessee Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nTennessee voters want the Senate controlled by the Republican Party, not the Democrats, by a broad 38-56 percent. It\u2019s one of the top three states to favor Republican control (alongside Mississippi and North Dakota).\n\nBoth Tennessee Senate candidates are relatively popular: Phil Bredesen (D) has a 51-43 percent favorability rating; Marsha Blackburn (R), 55-41 percent. Then there\u2019s Donald Trump, with a 57-40 percent approval rating among Tennessee voters, considerably better than his 44-55 percent figure nationally.\n\nTrump visited Tennessee for Blackburn as recently as this past weekend. Could help her: 37 percent say they\u2019re casting their vote to show support for Trump, vs. 27 percent voting to show opposition to Trump. Thirty-four percent say Trump\u2019s not a factor.\n\nBredesen, a former health care executive, has focused on health care; Blackburn on immigration policy. Among voters today, 38 percent call health care the top issue of four offered; 24 percent say it\u2019s immigration, 23 percent the economy. Trump\u2019s tough stance on immigration gets mixed reviews; 37 percent say it\u2019s too tough, 31 percent about right - and 27 percent not tough enough.\n\nThirty-eight percent of voters say Blackburn\u2019s too conservative; 42 percent say Bredesen is too liberal.\n\nIn terms of the candidate attributes they care about, someone who shares my view of government tops the list, 37 percent.\n\nRepublicans account for 44 percent of voters so far today \u2013 more than either Democrats (26 percent) or independents (30 percent).\n\nIndependents, potential swing voters in Tennessee, are voting 56-44 percent, Bredesen-Blackburn.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s running competitively among women overall, with 52 percent support to Bredesen\u2019s 48 percent. That includes a 41-59 percent result, Bredesen-Blackburn, among suburban women.\n\nBredesen\u2019s found votes in his focus on health care; among those who call it their top issue, he leads Blackburn by 72-28 percent. Then again, those calling immigration the top issue vote 18-82 percent, with Blackburn ahead, in preliminary results.\n\nSixteen percent voted for the first time in a midterm election, voting 57-43 percent Bredesen-Blackburn.\n\nMississippi Senate race\n\nIf Mike Espy (D) gets into a runoff, his life won\u2019t be easy: in a hypothetical head-to-head, voters divide 41-51 percent between Espy and incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith (R).\n\nNonwhites account for 36 percent of voters in Mississippi, including 31 percent blacks. Black turnout is up by 8 points from its low of 23 percent in 1988, though off its peak of 35 percent in 2012.\n\nConservatives typically dominate in Mississippi. In preliminary results today, they\u2019re at 51 percent of the electorate, the most of any state with exit polls this election.\n\nDonald Trump is popular in MS, with a 61-38 percent approval rating, and 40 percent say they\u2019re casting their ballot to show support for Trump. Both are among the highest of any state in the 21 where we have exit polls.\n\nWith Hyde-Smith the only woman among the four most prominent candidates, voters by 75-24 percent say it's important that more women be elected to public office.\n\nDemonstrating racial divides, 65 percent of black voters in Mississippi say whites are favored over minorities in the United States today. Seventeen percent of white voters agree.\n\nIn terms of top issues, 40 percent pick health care of four offered, 24 percent the economy, 23 percent immigration and 10 percent gun policy, similar to national results.\n\nAmong those casting their ballots to show support for Trump, Hyde-Smith has 59 percent support, compared with Chris McDaniel\u2019s (R) 36 percent. Trump endorsed Hyde-Smith.\n\nWomen are dividing 46-34-17 percent for Espy, Hyde-Smith, and McDaniel.\n\nAmong voters focused on health care, Espy leads Hyde-Smith 59-26 percent. Among those focused on the economy, it\u2019s 30-56 percent, Espy-Hyde-Smith.\n\nNew Jersey Senate race\n\nBryan Anselm/New York Times via Redux\n\nBob Menedez is on track to win the New Jersey Senate race, ABC News projects, based on exit polls.\n\nBob Menendez\u2019s (D) victory is largely thanks to the 55 percent of New Jerseyans who want to see control of the Senate flipped \u2013 highest among the 18 states where it was asked on exit polls tonight. Among this group, voters overwhelmingly chose Menendez over Bob Hugin (R), 93-6 percent.\n\nAdditionally, among the 60 percent who disapprove of Trump\u2019s job performance, Menendez beat Hugin by 83-14 percent.\n\nMenendez (D) is broadly unpopular, with a 33-63 percent favorability rating. Bob Hugin (R) is underwater in favorability as well, but not so broadly, 42-52 percent.\n\nRelatedly, just 27 percent say Menendez has high ethical standards. Twice as many say Hugin has high ethical standards, 45 percent. 33 percent of voters say neither has high ethical standards.\n\nHelpfully for Menendez, given those challenges, New Jersey voters say they want to see the Democrats win control of the Senate, 58-39 percent. Independents divide 59-36 percent on the question.\n\nDonald Trump has a 41-59 percent approval rating in the state, among his worst in the 21 states with exit polls tonight. Forty-seven percent say he should be impeached, more than the 41 percent who say the same nationally.\n\nMenendez lost whites by 10 points in 2012 but was elected on vast support from nonwhites. They accounted for a record 33 percent of voters then. Nonwhites make up 37 percent of voters in the state today, in preliminary results \u2013 a new high if it holds.\n\nMenendez benefits from representing a solid blue state; Democrats account for 43 percent of voters there in today\u2019s preliminary results, Republicans just 26 percent. Hugin needs independents to swing it. They account for 31 percent of voters in preliminary data.\n\nMenendez is losing those who see him unfavorably by 35-62 percent. He\u2019s also losing those who think he lacks high ethical standards, but he does win 44 percent of their votes nonetheless.\n\nMenendez ran evenly among independents in his first election in 2012. Today, independents are backing him over Hugin by 6 points, 51-45 percent, in preliminary exit poll results.\n\nArizona Senate race\n\nArizona voters prefer Republican over Democratic control of the Senate, 53-42 percent on whether they\u2019d like the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate, a potential boost to Martha McSally (R) vs. Kyrsten Sinema (D).\n\nThirty-two percent in this border state cite immigration as the top issue of four facing the country, compared with 23 percent nationally. Still, more pick health care (41 percent) as most important. Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies are seen as \u201cabout right\u201d by 41 percent, vs. too tough (35 percent) or not tough enough (17 percent). Nationally, his policies are seen as \u201cabout right\u201d by fewer, 32 percent.\n\nConservatives can dominate in this state, but their share of the electorate fluctuates -- 41 percent two years ago, down from a high of 46 percent in 2010. Conservatives again account for 41 percent of voters in preliminary exit poll results tonight. Liberals -- who turned out at a record 27 percent of voters in the state in 2016 -- make up 22 percent in preliminary results today.\n\nForty percent in the state say Sinema is too liberal, while 38 percent say McSally is too conservative.\n\nTrump has a 52-47 percent approval rating in the state, which he won by 4 points in 2016. Twenty-six percent say they\u2019re voting to express support for Trump, 28 percent to express opposition, while 44 percent say he\u2019s not a factor.\n\nFor all the \u201creferendum on Trump\u201d angles, there\u2019s another group to watch \u2013 the 44 percent of Arizona voters who say Trump is not a factor in their vote. They\u2019re breaking 42-58 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nMcSally\u2019s overwhelmingly is winning voters focused on the issue of immigration, 16-84 percent, Sinema-McSally. Those focused on health care, by comparison, are voting 77-22 percent.\n\nIndependents account for 30 percent of Arizona voters so far tonight; in 2012 Jeff Flake (R) ran essentially evenly in this group (-1 point) to win this Senate seat. Today, independents are dividing evenly, 49-49 percent.\n\nVeterans -- 14 percent of the electorate -- go broadly for McSally, 37-61 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nKyrsten Sinema (D) is helped by a 27-point margin among moderates (63-36 percent, Sinema-McSally) -- the largest pro-Democratic candidate margin in an Arizona Senate race in exit poll data dating back to 1994. (The next largest was 16 points in 2012.)\n\nMartha McSally (R) strikes back by winning the 44 percent who say Donald Trump isn\u2019t a factor in their vote, 42-58 percent, McSally-Sinema.\n\nVoters 65 and older (29 percent of Arizona voters) split dead even: 50-50 percent, Sinema-McSally.\n\nMontana Senate race\n\nFor all his visits, 54 percent of voters say Donald Trump is not a factor in how they cast their ballot for Senate -- more in any other state in which the question was asked. Tester is winning big among those voters, 57-41 percent. Still just 26 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump -- and 19 percent to oppose him -- leaving 54 percent saying the president, for all his visits, is not a factor.\n\nVoters are more apt to say they\u2019d like to see the Republicans than the Democrats control the Senate, 50-42 percent.\n\nIncumbent Jon Tester (D) has a 49-48 percent favorability rating, compared with Matt Rosendale\u2019s (R) weaker 41-53 percent. At the same time, 47 percent say Tester is too liberal, while 41 percent say Rosendale is too conservative.\n\nIndependents predominated in Montana when Tester won his seat in 2012, accounting for 41 percent of voters. In today\u2019s results they\u2019re 45 percent of the electorate, maintaining their central importance in the outcome. (Republicans are 29 percent of voters; Democrats, 26 percent.)\n\nForty-five percent say Tester\u2019s vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation is an important factor in their vote; 53 percent of women say so, vs. 37 percent of men.\n\nTester is winning women by 19 points, 58-39 percent, double his +9 margin among women in 2012. He won white women by 6 points in 2012; his margin among white women tonight is nearly three times as large, 58-39 percent.\n\nVoters chiefly are looking for a candidate who \u201cshares my view of government\u201d -- 57 percent say so, more than twice as many as say they care most about a candidate who \u201ccares about people like me\u201d -- 24 percent.\n\nForty-six percent of voters name health care as the top issues facing the country, among four choices. The economy and immigration trail (24 percent and 21 percent).\n\nThe 54 percent of voters who say Trump was not a factor in their vote are dividing 57-41 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nThose who say Tester\u2019s opposition to Kavanaugh was an important factor in their vote divide 31-66 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nTester won independents by 10 points six years ago. It\u2019s a similar 52-43 percent, Tester-Rosendale, now.\n\nTester is winning big among moderates, 70-26 percent; they account for nearly four in 10 Montana voters (38 percent). This 44-point margin is even larger than the 32 points by which Tester won moderates in 2012.\n\nTester lost men by 4 points while winning women by 9 points in 2012. Today he\u2019s losing men by 8 points, 46-52 percent.\n\nNonwhites account for 12 percent of Montana voters in these preliminary results. And, while Tester won them by a whopping 42 points in 2012, today they are dividing 49-50 percent, Tester-Rosendale.\n\nTester is winning the under 30 voters by a massive 43 points, 70-27 percent, compared with the 8-point margin he won them by in 2012.\n\nEighty-one percent of Montana voters live in a gun-owning household \u2013 more than in any of the 10 states where the question was asked. And a big number. They\u2019re voting 52-46 percent for Tester over Rosendale.\n\nNevada Senate race\n\nForty-four percent call Jacky Rosen (D) too liberal; 39 percent call Incumbent Dean Heller (R) Heller too conservative.\n\nFifty-seven percent call Heller\u2019s vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh a top factor in their vote, about equal numbers of men and women alike.\n\nHeller is the only incumbent Republican senator running in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Voters today divide 49-51 percent on Trump\u2019s job performance. While 34 percent say they\u2019re voting to show support for Trump, 38 percent who are voting to oppose him.\n\nVoters divide 48-47 percent in these preliminary results on whether they want the Democrats or the Republicans to control the Senate.\n\nWhites account for 62 percent of Nevada voters in preliminary results, nonwhites 38 percent \u2013 a record for nonwhites in midterms in the state. That includes 18 percent turnout by Latino voters \u2013 also, if it holds, a new midterm high.\n\nTwenty-three percent of voters are from union households, up 4 points from 2016.\n\nToday in preliminary results the electorate is 34-37 percent, Democrat-Republican. Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 8 points in 2016 and by 9 points in 2012, when Heller won his seat.\n\nHeller lost women by 6 points in 2012, while winning men by 10. He\u2019s losing women by 23 points today, 59-36 percent, Rosen-Heller.\n\nIndependents are voting 58-35 percent, Rosen-Heller \u2013 a group Heller won by 20 points in 2012.\n\nVoters who say Heller\u2019s pro-Kavanaugh vote is a top concern are dividing 49-49 percent, Rosen-Heller.\n\nHeller won in 2012 by winning by 32 points in rural counties; he\u2019s +40 points in preliminary results today.\n\nThis is a developing story.

ABC News' Kendis Gibson reports.", "The president of Cyprus took to the airwaves on Tuesday to defend his proposal for a more decentralized federal government he contended would function better if a reunification deal is reached with the ethnically divided nation's breakaway Turkish Cypriots.\n\nPresident Nicos Anastasiades said that giving more authority to the island's Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones would reduce deadlocks in decision-making at the federal level and make a peace accord more successful.\n\nAnastasiades didn't specify which responsibilities would be deferred to the zones, but said during a televised news conference that any decentralization wouldn't compromise Cyprus' territorial integrity, sovereignty, security or economy.\n\nHe said granting more power to either zone to decide on issues of \"direct concern\" would ease Turkish Cypriot concerns of domination by the majority Greek Cypriots and would roll back veto powers Turkish Cypriots seek in decision making on a federal level.\n\nA lesser risk of deadlock would alternately assuage Greek Cypriot fears that a peace deal could collapse and slide control of the island to Turkey which wants to keep troops in Cyprus and the right to military intervene as part of an accord, said Anastasiades.\n\nAnastasiades has faced criticism that his proposal deviates from the federal model on which peace negotiations have been based since Cyprus split along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by supporters of union with Greece.\n\nHe reaffirmed his commitment to seeking a deal based on two-zone federal model in line with his predecessors.\n\nUnited Nations envoy Jane Holl Lute is continuing contacts to determine with there's fertile ground to resume peace talks after the last round of negotiations collapsed in July, 2017.", "Authorities in Cameroon are looking for more than 80 students and staff members who were kidnapped from a school in Cameroon in the early hours of Monday morning.\n\nAt least 79 students and three staff members were taken from the Presbyterian Secondary School Nkwen in Bamenda, the capital of the country\u2019s troubled North West Region, according to the Associated Press.

In the video, they call themselves \u201cAmba boys,\u201d in reference to the English-speaking state of Ambazonia that is locked in an independence struggle with the Cameroonian government.\n\nWhile the authenticity of the video has not been confirmed, the Associated Press reported that parents recognized their children from the footage.\n\nThe region\u2019s governor, Adolphe Lele L\u2019Afrique, claimed that separatist militias were behind the attack, according to the BBC.

This allows police to create a much larger family tree than using regular law enforcement databases like CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, according to experts. In the case of Holmes, one person in his family who was interested in family history and genealogy entered into the GEDmatch database in the hopes of finding additional relatives she didn\u2019t know about, according to Orlando police.\n\nAuthorities have identified suspects in over a dozen crimes across the country this year thanks to genetic genealogy, including the April arrest of the suspected \"Golden State Killer,\" Joseph James DeAngelo, -- a cold case that stumped California law enforcement for decades.\n\nIn the case of Christine Franke, some of Holmes' family members had submitted their own DNA to the GEDMatch database when using DNA testing websites, police said, which allows authorities to access the information. Investigators also went to several of Holmes' family members who voluntarily gave them samples, police said.\n\nEventually Holmes was served with search warrant for his DNA which was determined to be a match to the crime scene DNA, police said.\n\nIt appears Holmes and Christine Franke did not know each other prior to the crime, police said.\n\nWFTV\n\nHolmes, 38, of Orlando, was taken into custody Friday, charged with first-degree murder with a firearm and robbery with a firearm, according to records.\n\nWhen arrested Holmes \"denied having any knowledge or being near the crime scene,\" according to police.\n\nHe has not yet entered a plea.\n\nHis public defender, Chelsea Simmons, declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nMeanwhile, Christine Franke's mother told reporters Monday that she hopes genetic genealogy technology helps more families.\n\n\"It's a terrible thing, not knowing,\" she said.", "A Washington police officer's decision to work late on Halloween helped him save a baby girl's life.\n\nDustin Johnson of the Tukwila Police Department was at the end of his shift when he and other officers responded to a 911 call.

She was really hot to the touch,\" Johnson said.\n\nTukwila Police Department\n\nJohnson swept the baby's mouth, performed rescue breaths and then got her into the recovery position as she became responsive again.\n\n\"After she reached up and grabbed my finger, I was able to stop and relax a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"I was so happy.

With a total of 1,661 Democratic House and Senate candidates and 1,471 Republican candidates, so far, a total of $1.26 billion has come from the Democratic side and a little shy of $890 million has come from the Republican side.\n\nMore than $1.3 billion in outside spending has come from more than 3,200 outside groups, including party committees, super PACs and political nonprofits, marking a 60 percent increase from 2014.\n\nAP\n\nMost expensive races\n\nTop Senate races:\n\nFlorida Senate: $181 million ($91 million from candidate campaigns, $90 million from outside groups)\n\nMissouri Senate: $119 million ($42 million from candidate campaigns, $77 million from outside groups)\n\nTexas Senate: $107 million ($94 million from candidate campaigns, $14 million from outside groups)\n\nIndiana Senate: $104 million ($36 million from candidate campaigns, $68 million from outside groups)\n\nArizona Senate: $104 million ($38 million from candidate campaigns, $66 million from outside groups)\n\nIn Florida, the Senate race between Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Rick Scott has brought in more than $181 million. More than $91 million of that has come from the two candidates, with challenger Scott outspending Nelson by more than $40 million. The Democratic leadership has jumped in to back Nelson, with major Democratic outside groups spending more than $53 million in support of Nelson and against Scott. Meanwhile, New Republican PAC, a super PAC almost exclusively dedicated to supporting Scott has spent more than $29.5 million against Nelson.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Claire McCaskill's vulnerable seat in Missouri has brought in more than $76 million from outside groups to the Missouri Senate race. Conservative groups led by Senate Leadership Fund, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and Americans for Prosperity, have spent more than $41 million in support of Hawley, while liberal groups have spent more than $35 million in support of McCaskill. Meanwhile, incumbent McCaskill's campaign has outspent Hawley by far, with the vulnerable Democrat spending more than $33 million and the Republican challenger spending $7 million.\n\nAP|Getty Images\n\nTop House races:\n\nCalifornia's 39th District: $34.5 million ($21 million from candidate campaigns, $14 million from outside groups)\n\nCalifornia's 48th District: $33 million ($13 million from candidate campaigns, $20 million from outside groups)\n\nWashington's 8th District: $30 million ($11 million from candidate campaigns, $19 million from outside groups)\n\nNew York's 19th District: $29 million ($15 million from candidate campaigns, $13.5 million from outside groups)\n\nPennsylvania's 1st District: $29 million ($15 million from candidate campaigns, $13.5 million from outside groups)\n\nIn the lower chamber, a toss-up between two minority candidates in California's 39th Congressional District, where immigrants make up a third of the population, has brought in the most money. Democrat Gil Cisneros' campaign has spent $10.5 million, while Republican Young Kim has spent just about $2 million. Kim has a strong backing of House GOP leadership though, with its super PAC Congressional Leadership PAC boasting a $6.3 million in support of Kim. House Democratic leadership is also behind Cisneros, with House Majority PAC and DCCC spending more than $5.2 million in the race.\n\nGOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's effort to defend his seat in California's 48th district has also become increasingly expensive, with candidate campaigns spending nearly $13 million and outside groups pouring in nearly $20 million. The Democratic side is eager to unseat the vulnerable Republican, with challenger Harley Rouda leading an aggressive $6 million campaign, and liberal outside groups including Independence USA PAC, House Majority PAC and DCCC spending more than $11 million to back him.

Please welcome one of our favorites, Kenan Thompson. ?????? Woo! Welcome to the show. You love you some Kenan. I was once your intern. So back one day in college I interned at \"Snl,\" and you were always so lovely. Thank you. So good to see you again. I'm sad that I have to ask you a hard question right now, so the hot topic was about your colleague, Pete Davidson making a joke about Dan crenshaw who is a veteran who lost his eye serving in our country in Afghanistan after he had his eye injure. He within the back for another deployment. Dan says he doesn't need an apology, but not everyone feels that way. I know you have been asked about this before. I know you didn't make the joke, but is \"Snl\" going to do anything to that end? I'm sure they are. I mean, I know it's being handled internally. It's not necessarily my department, but since I'm out promoting \"The grinch,\" I get to answer these questions. Yesterday is never somewhere I would go in the offense territory towards veterans because my father is one. Your father is one. Great man. I met him when he hosted. So it's been an unfortunate outcome when you go for jokes and you figure out a way to get into something that's a touchy subject or something that is very sorrowful and you want to try to bring joy into something and you miss the mark or whatever like I said. That's right. That's what I thought where he was coming from. Pete's a good kid. He has a big heart. He has tragedy in his heart with his father passing on 9/11 being a firefighter. I don't think he goes out to offend people, but that's what happens in this case. So they are figuring out a way to right that wrong I'm pretty sure. It's not our intention to disrespect anyone. Our whole thing is just to be artists and hold up the mirror, you know what I mean? And laugh. \"Saturday night live,\" they don't normally take any prisoners. It's satire. It makes the news. I was doing whoopi because there is a whoopi. That's all it is. Do you miss me? I do, yes. We passed the torch to Leslie. It makes me sad. Did you give her any tips now that she has playing her? I told her to do it the complete opposite because whoopi hates mine. She loves me, but hates my impression. I got to get better glasses than this. Why did you hate the impression? I never hated the impression. What happened to him? He graduated. That's it for me, I guess. Can you still do a whoopi impression? Oh, absolutely, child. Let's hear it. Can I borrow your glasses? Now that guy in the white house -- I don't even want to say his name or whatever, but we're not here to talk about whatever. We're here to talk about hot topics and we're going to have good coffee this morning, and I'm getting my hair braided later. Can you see through these? Are you sure? I have gotten much blinder since I saw you last. Listen. You won an Emmy this a fall. Yes, I have. You and chance the rapper. You made it on \"Snl,\" and it's timely since today is midterms day. Take a look at this. It's fabulous ??? every night, I turn the TV on and cry ??? ??? I cry, yeah, I cry ??? ??? I say why ??? ??? I feel like we're all going to die ??? ?????? ??? I want you back somehow ??? ??? I need you in my life ??? ??? so come back, Barack ??? And you also were nominated op your own for \"Snl,\" but Henry Winkler took home the prize in that category. And I know people say to you, you know you should have won, but what do you say? And explain why it's fine with you. That man -- first of all, he is Henry Winkler. He is not only the fonz, but one of the greatest human beings, like, walking the planet. He is, like, the nicest guy. When I first met him and we worked on a cartoon together, he embraced me like he knew me for 100 years. He don't have to talk to me. He could be, like, hi, and keep it professional or whatever, but he didn't do that. He was very warm and he is open. Like, we watch you all the time and I love you so much. Henry Winkler, are you kidding? You know we all love you, you know? He waited 42 years to win that thing. Hey, man. If I have to wait any less than that, I'll be happy. So I was happy to see him be recognized for how great he is on screen and off. That's a classy response. We have all watched you, though, for years. \"Good burger\" is one of my favorite movies of all-time. That's where it's at. Thank you very much. You're here for more than one reason. That's fabulous. The holidays are almost here and it's time for holiday movies and you're in the remake of the classic Dr. Seuss story, \"The grinch.\" Let's take a look. Yes, please. Have you heard? The mayor wants Christmas to be three times bigger this year. That means three times the lights, three times the eggnog. Information needed. That's a good one. This is one of your kidding things. Finally. Something you said is really funny. Yeah, I do kid a lot, but no. This is actually -- you're going to have a good time with this, aren't you? I got to say, it's really nice to see you laughing. Who plays \"The grinch\"? Benedict Cumberbatch. That's him? Yeah. I love him. You're such a jolly character, and bricklebaum, how did you bring him to life? Just look at him. They showed me the picture and I was, like, he is just a big ball of joy, a big ball of Christmas joy. That sweater, that beard. Just made that voice pop in my head. He tries to be the friend of \"The grinch.\" He wants to be his best friend. He is not taking pit. For awhile, and then it happens, and it's a tearful moment for him. It finally actually happened. I made my best friend out of, like, the worst dude ever, and everybody loves a good redemption story. I'm excited to be part of it. It's great. I saw it with my children. I'm glad you enjoyed it. My kids enjoyed it. They are 12 and 16. You have a new baby. Second baby. Yeah. 3 months. You're doing something they can see. My big girl, she is 4, she will see it. We went to an unveiling of Bloomingdale's yesterday, and they have a picture, and she was there, and the baby was there of course, but she can't talkyet. They did the countdown and it was just -- it warmed my heart to see her counting down with everybody. She is so involved in life now, you know what I mean? It's amazing. They turn 4 and then they're people. They turn into people. It's freaky. It's beautiful, yeah. Really sweet. So, pop, come back any time. We love having you here. Do I have to leave now? Because I want to stay here. I'm afraid so. We continue want to really let go of Kenan. You can stay I think. I'll just do the outro and don't go anywhere. He'll be here on \"Snl\" Saturday nights and \"The grinch\" hits theaters on November 9th and\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The judge who is the most prominent face of Brazil's anti-corruption campaign denied Tuesday that his appointment as justice minister was a reward for having convicted and jailed a political rival of his new boss.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the case of ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva,\" Judge Sergio Moro told reporters at his first news conference since accepting the nomination. \"I know that some interpreted my nomination as a reward. That is not the case.\"\n\nMoro is both celebrated and loathed in Brazil for his role in the \"Car Wash\" investigation, which jailed dozens of business leaders and politicians who participated in schemes to trade public contracts and favors for kickbacks and bribes.\n\nThe most prominent is da Silva, whose conviction resulted in him being barred from seeking another term this year, paving the way for President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's victory.\n\nMany credit the hard-charging judge with ending a culture of impunity, but others feel the probe has focused too much on da Silva's leftist Workers' Party, while giving less attention to politicians on the right.\n\nThose complaints have grown since Moro accepted a position in President-elect Jair Bolsonaro's cabinet. Da Silva's attorneys have already filed an appeal alleging that the appointment proves the judge's bias.\n\nMoro said that he has no intention of ever running for elected office and said his work at the ministry would be \"technical.\"\n\nMoro at times defended Bolsonaro, saying some of the far-right politician's extreme comments had been taken out of context, but he also said the two disagree on some points, such as Bolsonaro's contention that people who occupy land in protest should be considered terrorists.\n\nMoro rose to national prominence by cracking down on the white-color corruption, but as the head of the justice and public security ministries, he will now face a potentially thornier problem: a scourge of violent crime, often fueled by drug-trafficking gangs. Last year, nearly 64,000 people were killed in Brazil, a record for the country that has long been the world leader in annual homicides.\n\nMoro told reporters that he would use some of the same tools employed in Car Wash to fight organized crime, such as using task forces to investigate crimes, saying that New York had success with the practice in its fight against the mafia.\n\nIn contrast to Bolsonaro, whose rhetoric on crime often focuses on the use of police force, Moro spoke about improving data collection, using technology and imprisoning and isolating gang leaders to combat organized crime.\n\n\"A good police operation is when no one gets hurt, and the criminal goes to jail, and the police officer goes home,\" he said.\n\nHe also pledged to implement measures to help fight corruption and said that if wrongdoing were found in Bolsonaro's administration, the justice system would pursue it.\n\nCritics worry that Bolsonaro's praise of the military dictatorship and torture, his often violent rhetoric on crime and his repeated disparaging remarks about women, black people and gays presage policies that will roll back civil rights. The president-elect himself obliquely referenced those fears on Tuesday at a ceremony to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Brazil's constitution, saying the document is the \"true north\" of democracy.\n\nMoro, too, addressed those concerns, saying that everything he would do would be based in the law and rights.\n\n\"There is no possibility that there will be a policy of discrimination against minorities,\" he said.", "The top Google trend search on the morning of the 2018 midterm elections was \"Donde votar,\" Spanish for \"Where to vote,\" providing further evidence that the Latino vote is becoming more of a deciding force in electing political leaders.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

More than 36 million people have already cast early ballots and here to break down how much is at stake, please welcome one of the really great people here at ABC, he is the ABC news chief white house correspondent, but we just know him as Jonathan Karl. What's up? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So what do you make of all of this? The guy in the white house has been making some controversial comments saying he is going to end, you know, birthright citizenship, ordering troops to meet the migrants of the caravan at the border, claiming voter fraud. What is going on here? Is this, like, a hail Mary? Is he trying anything? You're saying the economy is about as good as any president could ever ask for, and this would be like a morning in America message. Things are good, keep going the same direction. Instead, it is midnight in America. He is trying to scare his base into voting. He is appealing to the core of his base with a negative message because he believes that fear is a great motivator. It worked for him two years ago, and he thinks it will work here. There is fear on the other side. There is fear, and you know what? This is -- this is the first time that America will have the chance to go to the polls to render judgment on Donald Trump's presidency. This is the first time, so I think that is why you are seeing such massive turnout, and we are shattering all records. All kinds of records. For a midterm election. Yeah. We are shattering those records and you have fear. Those who don't like him, who hate what he stands for and what he has done and fear from his base that he is doing the best. And that the caravan is going to come into the country even though they are 700 miles away, and they are mostly children and people who are fleeing horrible situations in Honduras, right? I interviewed him a few days ago, and he said this is an invasion. They are invading our country and, you know, they are 700 miles away. Some of the poorest people in the world, but that is the message that he is taking. Now that message may work with some of these deep red states where we have big senate races, but here's the problem for Republicans is the house races are being fought in suburbs and where independent voters are the key voters, where moderates are the key, and that is not a message that you would think would work with those people. One key race people are talking about is the race in Georgia, the governor's race, and we had Stacey Abrams on the show. Yeah. She is very popular, and she has accused her opponent, Brian Kemp, who is I guess, the secretary of state who is overseeing the very election that he is in, of voter suppression. What is going on there? Do you have predictions about that race? I think it goes to a runoff because neither one of them has 50%, and it's a runoff, and I think it's that close. There are some real concerns. First of all, he is secretary of state. They have gone through, and he has taken 50,000 registered voters and because there has been some slight -- if it's not an exact match, and the form isn't done right, challenged their registration which means those people with still vote, but they must vote with a provisional ballot and that is something that can definitely have an impact today. The other thing is this allegation that he made of cybercrimes that the democratic party of Georgia has committed cybercrimes and hacked into the website. It's an extraordinary allegation to make on the eve of an election and he has done it without any offering any evidence whatsoever. Whatsoever. Okay. Let's talk about Texas. Meghan and I have an argument that I say Beto could win and she says it's impossible. She will take my to dinner if I win. Fy if I win I get nothing apparently. We have to even this out a little bit. I'll buy you a margarita. A margarita or a dinner? Give me a break. This is Democrat dirty games. We both get a nice dinner, okay? Deal. Beto has raised $38 million. In three months. This is amazing. No one has ever done that. Presidential level numbers. Yeah, and also there is a lot of early voting in Texas which to me, that indicates that a lot of people are out there voting for Beto instead of Cruz because they know Cruz, you know, is old school already. We're sick of him already, but we have got this new guy. What do you think of that? Politico has an article that they just did, and put up the other day. How Beto blew it, and it would be interesting to see him win so you could go back to that article. It would be because he went to left instead of moderating like he should have done in Texas. He didn't do a lot of the traditional. He ran a very, you know, campaign of hope and change, very obama-esque without some of the real Obama research and -- Obama had a very disciplined campaign. John Kennedy, more than anybody else. He ran a completely nationalized campaign with outside money. He went -- this article, he went completely way too far. Fine. He has charisma. I want in on the bet. Can we all get a piece of this? Either way if I win or lose I end up paying. That's how I feel all the time. There is no favorite. It would be a colossal episode, and if Cruz wins, he is the front runner. He is popular, and has been for some time. It's closer than people expected. I want to ask about Florida because Florida was the one trump won in 2016 when everybody woke up and said, this might end differently, and the governor race is fascinating. Ron Desantis has tied himself with Donald Trump, and Gillum who is running to the left on the policies. A Bernie sanders-esque campaign. Yeah. He might win. He is ahead. One or two points. I would say going into today, Gillum is the front runner in that race. I agree with you. Is that bad? It's bad for trump because Desantis was chosen by trump because he was not the front runner for the Republican nomination. It was a guy named Putnam that was, you know -- Better liked in Florida by the way. Had a long career in Florida. He had won statewide office before, and he got on board with Desantis because he likes him so much. Exactly. It could be a surprise. Now Gillum is the front runner. Why are governor races just as important as the senate and house? You could argue in long-term more important because we are going into another census and round of redistricting. The governors that are elected today will have a huge impact on how the house race and how the house districts are drawn. The Jerry mandering? Yes, and going forward. And Republicans right now dominating across the country and they could lose in a lot of states today that the trump carried, you know. Wisconsin is a tough race. Scott walker. Bye-bye. It's walker's fourth time running many, you know, and it will be his third term, but he had the recall election. He has won three, but he has had a tough race. Iowa and Ohio is a tough race.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Authorities in Peru say a former head of the national police force is under arrest, accused of involvement in a baby trafficking ring.\n\nProsecutors say that Gen.

Trump says he regrets not using a 'softer tone' at times\n\nWell, it's finally here, the midterm elections are happening right now so if you did not get out to vote yet, I did. Make sure you get out there after the show. ABC news chief white house white house correspondent will be joining us, and if you have questions about eligibility and polling hours, we have info on our website to check us out. We will be getting into the vital issues that many people will be voting on today, but on a much lighter note, another annual election. I'm so moved by this one. Was just held, and I feel like the whole country just might be able to agree on this. The person voted \"People\" magazine's sexiest man alive is -- Okay? Okay? Everybody, left, right, center, black, white, Orange, yellow, green, fuchsia, can get behind that. Okay? That's right. Everybody. Oh, yeah. I mean, I almost feel that it's late to name him the sexiest man alive because he has been sexy for a minute. Let's face it. When Idris came onto the show, we had a really special moment together. I think we have a clip. I thought we all did. You did those stunts? Yes, baby. You're talking to Idris Elba here, okay? Did I just get a yes, baby from Idris Elba? Did that just happen? He is now the sexiest man alive. A woman in the audience could see that we had that moment, right? I didn't want to tell you this, but you know -- Don't tell me, whoopi. I had the whole evening with him. No. And I wasn't invited? And his lady. Well, there is that. Well, there is that. You know. He is engaged to a lovely woman actually. When you get to be a certain age, you can't look at these men like that. You can't lick your lips anymore. All you can do is go, how nice to see you again, you know? When really, you're, like, baby. But on a certain age, that jus don't look good, you know what I mean? He took the opportunity to tell people to get out and vote. Yeah. Which means he is not only sexy, but he is brilliant. He has also been a contender for years, and it's nice to see him. I was looking back at sexiest man alive. The first one was Mel Gibson in 1985, 25 years old. Can we make him James bond now? Please? I think he should be the next James bond. Of course. Yep. So now onto other things. You know, the guy in the white house has been rallying around the country and yesterday, he was asked if he has any regrets and here's what he said. Take a look. I would like to have a much softer tone. I feel to a certain extent, I have no choice, but maybe I do, and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint, but I want to get things done. I'm not sure that if I did, that maybe I would be swamped, okay? Swamped meaning with the other side because I wouldn't say their tone has been so nice either, but that would be something I say I'll be working on. So, he then went on to have several rallies last night, and of course, the tone wasn't what he said he would like it to be, but he went back to business as usual at all three rallies. So, you know, I don't know why they are asking this question B but I'm going to ask it because it's on the monitor. So why do you think he said that? He said it -- he said it because he realizes that women like him less than menstrual cramps. That's why he said it. So appealing to women. Yes. He now has, like, this moment where he says, gee. They don't like me because do you see the numbers? The women are out there voting in droves. He now realizes that. He polls around 34% with women, so yes. It's not great. The women that still like him say that he is a protector. A hero. That he protects -- Their way of life and their values. They don't know the difference between a predator and a protector because as far as I can tell, he is the one grabbing women by the you know what. I try to find the positive in these moments and I think the one thing about his tone that has been helpful for this country is it motivated people to get out and vote. On the other side. Whether you like the tone or you hate the tone, people are voting. We're already seeing this. 31 million people have already cast their ballots for this election. I don't know if that's worth the tone. I don't know if that's worth it. I don't know if him calling people names and talking about families and, you know, scaring people into thinking that brown people are coming to get them and take their jobs -- It shows that people care. No. It shows that people are scared and they know -- they know that this is not what you want in the guy that's supposed to be running stuff, but I don't know if the tone is -- I can take a lot of stuff. As I said weeks ago, you know, when you start the conversation with, they are murderers and rapists or they are this or they are that, for me that shuts everything down. I can't hear anything. There is a lot of this going ongoing forward. The Democrat wills probably end up taking the house, and I think they should have some historical perspective. We don't know yet. We don't, but if you are betting in Vegas, you can put at least a small majority win, with the tea party wave, Republicans picked up 63 house seats. Tonight, we're looking at 20 something for Democrats, and that shows that the tone whether he regrets it or not, it hasn't made nearly as much of an impact as it did in 2010, and what's interesting about this race, president Obama traditionally had a difficult time garnering votes in midterm election when is he wasn't at the top of the ticket. We'll see tonight if president trump has the same problem. He goes around saying the ticket is about me. It's smart politics, but -- It's all about him. He made a referendum on himself, and I wonder -- Even though he says it's not about him. What would that be? It will be interesting to see if he can do what president Obama did. I know we're late on time. On tone, I think it's too late. I don't think it matters anymore if he regrets or not. I think the cast has been dyed, and I think ultimately we know who this man is, and whether or not it matters to you, character over policy is what we'll be seeing tonight.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "A man who was spotted taking unusual photos of a memorial to Oklahoma City bombing victims and who warned his sister in Iran that hundreds more people would die has been arrested on a complaint of threatening to kill with explosives.\n\nAmiremad Nayebyazdi, 32, was being held Tuesday in Oklahoma County jail without bail, according to records.\n\nA court affidavit said police received a tip Thursday from a longtime friend of Nayebyazdi living in California that the suspect had left a phone message for his sister in Iran saying \"hundreds are going to die in Oklahoma City.\"\n\nIn the message, Nayebyazdi said, \"Don't tell mom and dad until after it is seen on the news,\" the affidavit said.\n\nNayebyazdi, who has a degree in petroleum engineering and worked for an oil company in Oklahoma City, was spotted at the Oklahoma City National Memorial on several occasions taking photos of \"unusual angles and places where people didn't normally take photographs,\" the affidavit said.

The report confirms this and offers recommendations, including preparing for \"massive chaos and manipulation\" in the country's 2020 parliamentary elections.\n\n\"Facebook has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm, and posts have been linked to offline violence,\" the report says. \"A minority of users is seeking to use as a platform to undermine democracy and incite offline violence, including serious crimes under international law.\"\n\nThe Myanmar report comes as Facebook and other social media companies face a trove of problems in dealing with people, groups and nations intent on using their services for malicious reasons, whether that's inciting violence, spreading hate messages, propaganda and misinformation or meddling with elections around the world.\n\nFacebook is focused on rooting out misinformation in the U.S., but it's also dealing with people using its platforms to incite violence in Sri Lanka, India and elsewhere. Late Monday, Facebook said it shut down 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts for suspected \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" linked to foreign groups attempting to interfere in Tuesday's U.S. midterm elections.\n\nFacebook and smartphones entered Myanmar quickly, and the report notes that this has led to a \"steep learning curve for users, policymakers, and civil society.\" The report notes that Facebook \"is the internet\" for many in Myanmar and that it has played an important role in supporting freedom of expression and helping activists organize.\n\nAt the same time, the report said, hate and harassment is leading to self-censorship among \"vulnerable groups such as political activists, human rights defenders, women, and minorities.\"\n\nFacebook released the report on the eve of the U.S. midterm elections, prompting critics to question its timing when so many people are focused on other news. Facebook says the report was focused on \"Myanmar stakeholders,\" for whom the U.S. elections are not a priority. It also said it had promised to share the results of the assessment once it had them.\n\nThe report does acknowledge that Facebook has made progress, but adds that there is \"more to do.\" In August, the company banned Myanmar's military chief and 19 other individuals and organizations from its service to prevent the spread of hate and misinformation.\n\nFacebook doesn't have any employees permanently based in Myanmar, but makes \"regular trips\" there with a range of employees.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nAfter racking up thousands of miles on Air Force One, flying all over the country for an unprecedented number of raucous campaign rallies, President Trump is having a quiet Election Day at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWith the future of his presidency and control of Congress at stake, the president was lying low on Tuesday. He would be \u201cmaking phone calls, monitoring Congressional, Senate and Gubernatorial races across the country and meeting with his political team for real-time updates,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in the early hours of Election Day after the president arrived back at the White House shortly before 2 a.m.\n\n\"Later this evening the President and First Lady have invited family and friends to join them in the residence as they watch election returns,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nTrump's blitz of 44 \"Make America Great Again\" rallies took him to 23 states since the primaries began, and culminated in three events that stretched late into the night. The final stretch played out like a rock and roll reunion tour, as the president\u2019s advisers. including Sanders and Kellyanne Conway and his favorite Fox News pundits including Sean Hannity and Judge Jeanine Pirro stumped for the president\u2019s agenda \u2013 and Republicans \u2013 on stage to a cheering crowd at his final rally Monday evening in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.\n\n\"I had no idea you were going to invite me up here,\" Hannity said after being called on stage. \"And the one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else: Promises made, promises kept.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Fox News called the appearance of network talent at the president's political rally \"an unfortunate distraction.\" During the rally, Hannity pointed to news reporters there to cover the event calling them \"fake news.\"\n\n\u201cFox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d the news network said in a statement. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\u201d\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president was relatively subdued in his Election Day tweets, his first trying to debunk a \"rumor\" he claimed Democrats were spreading that GOP Senate candidate Josh Hawley, left the Missouri rally early.\n\nThere is a rumor, put out by the Democrats, that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early. It is Fake News. He met me at the plane when I arrived, spoke at the great Rally, & stayed to the very end. In fact, I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2018\n\nWhile it's unclear what exactly Trump was referring to, it appears host Brian Kilmeade on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning alleged Hawley didn't stay the entire time.\n\n\"How will that translate down the ticket with people maybe not invited to those rallies and why Josh Hawley didn't stay last night for the Missouri rally is beyond me. What could he have been doing that was so important?\" Kilmeade said.\n\nThe national crisscrossing and finale in states with tight races like Missouri, Indiana, and Ohio was a calculated plan from Trump\u2019s political strategists who studied how former Presidents Obama and Bush traveled in midterm years and planned to top their schedules. Neither Obama nor Bush campaigned as much as Trump in previous election years.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence plan to visit Walter Reed Military Medical Center in the late afternoon on Election Day. The Pences of Indiana \u2013 like the Trumps of New York \u2013 voted absentee in their home states.\n\nThe president loomed large over the 2018 midterm elections, and he admitted that even though his name isn\u2019t on the ballot, this election is also a referendum on him and his administration\u2019s policies. But while Republicans are confident in their ability to hold onto the Senate, the House faces an uncertain future.\n\nDays before the election, the president appeared to admit for the first time that Republicans might lose the House. \"It could happen,\" Trump said. \"And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? 'Don't worry about it, I'll just figure it out.'\" Trump said.\n\nOn Saturday at the White House, the president said the difference between the potential House and Senate outcomes is that he wasn\u2019t able to stump for all the House candidates on the ticket.\n\n\"The difference is I can't campaign for all of those House members. There's so many of them. But I can go out and help Senators and I think I've made a big difference,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president\u2019s final pitch for Republicans mostly focused on the red-meat issue of immigration to animate his base. Even in states thousands of miles away from the southern border, the president riled up voters as he described the migrant caravan from Central America as an \u201cinvasion,\u201d falsely told voters that undocumented immigrants are gang members, and commit crimes, and made the allegation that Democrats are working to bring undocumented immigrants into the country.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Democrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws and violate our borders. And they want to sign them up for free welfare, free health care, free education, and most importantly, they want to give them the right to vote,\u201d Trump said at his final campaign stop.\n\nEven though the Labor Department reported strong employment numbers days before the election with a low unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, a quarter of a million jobs added to the workforce and wage increases, the president said he bucked the advice of his advisors and focused on other issues.\n\n\"They all say 'speak about the economy, speak about the economy.' Well, we have the greatest economy in the history of our country. But sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right? \u2018Cause we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" Trump said in West Virginia.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election results will test whether the former reality star\u2019s messaging -- to make the 2018 midterm elections about an \u201cinvasion\u201d of migrants that hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 is a success. No matter the results, the president signaled he would not take the blame.\n\n\"I've seen many of the newspapers saying it's a referendum on what we've done, so I don't know about that, but I can tell you that's the way they're going to play it, and if we don't have a good day, they are going to make it like it\u2019s the end of the world,\u201d Trump said in a call with the supporters the day before the election.\n\n\u201cThe election,\u201d Trump said, \u201cis very vital because it really is summing up what we've done, it's going to show confidence for what we've done.\u201d\n\n\"Even though I'm not on the ballot in a certain way I am on the ballot,\" Trump said.\n\nCoverage of the 2018 midterms on ABC News Live:\n\nGet full election coverage on ABC News Live beginning today at 4:30 p.m. EST at ABCNews.com/Live, on the ABC News app and on Roku, Hulu and Facebook.", "The leader of Belarus has warned his nation would have to beef up its weapons arsenals if the United States sets up a military base in Poland.\n\nCommenting Tuesday on Poland's proposal to host a U.S. base, President Alexander Lukashenko said it would force Belarus to commission new missiles.\n\nBut he also reaffirmed that Belarus doesn't need a Russian military base.\n\nLukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, has maintained close political, economic and military ties with Moscow.

Authorities notified the company about recently discovered online activity \"they believe may be linked to foreign entities,\" Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote in the post .\n\nU.S. tech companies have stepped up their work against disinformation campaigns, aiming to stymie online troublemakers' efforts to divide voters and discredit democracy. Facebook's purge is part of countermeasures to prevent abuses like those used by Russian groups two years ago to sway public opinion ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe company based in Menlo Park, California, has been somewhat regularly disclosing such purges in recent months, most recently in October. More are likely going forward since, even as its systems get better at detecting and removing malicious accounts, the bad actors are sharpening their attacks, too.\n\nGleicher said Facebook will provide an update once it learns more, including whether the blocked accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, or other foreign entities.\n\nAlmost all of the Facebook pages associated with the blocked accounts appeared to be in French or Russian. The Instagram accounts were mostly in English and were focused either on celebrities or political debate. No further details were given about the accounts or suspicious activity.\n\nAlso on Monday, Facebook acknowledged that it didn't do enough to prevent its services from being used to incite violence and spread hate in Myanmar. Alex Warofka, a product policy manager, said in a blog post that Facebook \"can and should do more\" to protect human rights and ensure it isn't used to foment division and spread offline violence in the country.\n\nLast month, Facebook removed 82 pages, accounts and groups tied to Iran and aimed at stirring up strife in the U.S. and the U.K. It carried out an even broader sweep in August, removing 652 pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran.\n\nTwitter, meanwhile, has said it has identified more than 4,600 accounts and 10 million tweets, mostly affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, which was linked to foreign meddling in U.S. elections, including the presidential vote of 2016. The agency, a Russian troll farm, has been indicted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller for its actions during the 2016 vote.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and other companies have been fighting misinformation and election meddling on their services for the past two years . There are signs they're making headway, although they're still a very long way from winning the war.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has reversed its stance of late 2016, when CEO dismissed as \"pretty crazy\" the notion that fake news on his service could have swayed the presidential election.\n\nIn July, for instance, the company said that its spending on security and content moderation, coupled with other business shifts, would hinder its growth and profitability. Investors expressed their displeasure by knocking $119 billion off Facebook's market value.\n\nOne problem is that it's not just agents from Russia and other nations who are intent on sharing misinformation and propaganda. There is plenty of homegrown fake news too, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere.\n\nStill, Facebook is seeing some payoff, and not just with the accounts it has been able to find and take down. A recent research collaboration between New York University and Stanford found that user \"interactions\" with fake news stories on Facebook, which rose substantially in 2016 during the presidential campaign, fell significantly between the end of 2016 and July 2018. On Twitter, however, the sharing of such stories continued to rise over the past two years.", "Transcript for DeSantis, Gillum battle for Florida governorship\n\nSome of those key battleground states now Florida is one of the most closely watched because things have gotten. Fairly heated there not only for the house and senate but also for the governor race with Johnson is in Tallahassee. With the latest on that which lets over the governor's race it doesn't get much closer than this. Absolutely Diane and really it would be a major election without drama happening in Florida and capital Pristina play out we are outside. One of the polling locations here this is the Catholic Church polls open at 7 AM there's been a steady stream of people going in to cast their ballots including. The Democrat running for governor. Mayor Andrew gill I'm he was here with his wife with his children casting a vote for himself about the same time. His Republican opponent Ron Desantis was casting his ballot itself a Jacksonville Florida this morning. Let's talk about the candidates here the Tallahassee mayor Andrew Dillon was really an underdog in the primary not expected to win but he got huge support for millions of dollars coming from outside donors who was endorsed early on by. Bernie Sanders a true progressive and then you've had Barack Obama the former president you've got Hillary Clinton in this state campaigning for Andrew Dellums. On the Republican side Ron Desantis. Practically hand picked by president Donald Trump he is all in. On the trump agenda he's a congressman who actually resigned his seat so that he he could focus on this race there's even an early campaign ads showing Desantis. Building the trumped wall with toy blocks with his daughter. Now this has been an ugly battle from the start though allegations of racism. Hurled toward Desantis accusations of corruption directed at Gil -- it's been back and forth and back and forth and in some ways both candidates acknowledged that. That the ugliness has in some ways overshadowed the real issues that matter to people here in Florida like healthcare like immigration. Like the environment and the issues with the toxic algae here the economy and much more. Let's go ahead and listen to both candidates this morning making their final plea to voters. Well me plus winning tonight I think we'll send a message to mr. trump and mr. Desantis is well. That the politics of hatred and a division of separation. That they come to win game at least in this election that's what we're going to show that people are going out and they're voting for something and not against. We've really at every turn in spite of all the distractions. I tried to keep voters in this state focus on what matters. I believe that that is what it went to allow us to walk away with a win today. Andrews agenda a massive tax increases. Working against law enforcement you name it. That is get it do damage to this state that has got out that families lives at their kitchen table. On an everyday basis and so this one really does matter. You know one thing that his interest in talking to the voters here president Trump's name may not be on the ballot in Florida but you wouldn't know it if you talk to the voters they are very much. Casting a vote to either support and promote. Or reject the trouble agenda. You talk about early voting quickly want to give you some numbers already coming in. Five point two million people in Florida have already voted early either absentee votes or voting in person that is a record. If you break it down Republican and Democrat it's almost split with Democrats just having the slightest edge. The democratic candidates also having a slight edge in the polls but it is all about turnout anything can happen in the state of Florida Diane. And I want rain Mary Alice parks here where marry us how surprise you to see that break down. You know we're going to be watching those numbers in the southern part of the state X specially the Miami area were injured Gillen was really hoping to expand the electric and get new voters. Who maybe haven't voted in the past but he tend to tilt. To the Democratic Party. Out in big numbers and there are a number of very key congressional races. In the southern Florida and Miami area where Democrats are helping to flip on Republicans and went on that note mr. Brady downpours was going on there in terms of those congressional seats. Exactly Walt what's interesting about the congressional seats you have some of these c.s that were held by long time Republicans but. Hillary Clinton won those districts by double digits in some places to the most competitive districts she won via fifteen points another one she won by twenty points. The Republican and one is retiring and so that's become a competitive race. Also aside from the house races you have this huge senate race that's going on here the longtime senator. Three term senator Bill Nelson who was also a congressman he was a state lawmaker one of the first members of congress to fly in space. Obviously he is a household name here and Florida. In the fight for his career. Up against Florida Republican governor Rick Scott. Who's had a frosty hot and cold relationship would Donald Trump he's been one of the early supporters and he was endorsed by president trump. But also in recent months has distanced himself on some key issues on immigration the separation of families. Com also on other things like gun control following the park when shooting. Rick Scott was front and center taking on the MR and knowing how important Florida it is. Continued to maintain his support for Rick Scott just some perspective here this is the state of 1%. It's when he sixteenth president from beat Hillary Clinton by about 1% and 2012. President Obama beat Mitt Romney by about 1% the last two governors' races forty tents when he fourteen Rick Scott won both of those. By just about 1%.

Is Stacey Abrams has launched if it kind of very different campaign. Than the traditional Democrat her election could be historic as the first African American woman governor but also just the way she's campaigning welcomed the results of this race mean. For her message and what does that do for the party. It could mean we have an entirely new a Democratic Party. I'm the last two years the parties really tried to rebuild itself and Stacey Abrams is certain testing a theory about how Democrats run in the south. She's been. Open about her support for gun safety reforms and assault weapons ban she's talking about student loan debt and expanding health care access trying to register new young voters and and voters that are why in the south. And not necessarily working towards the middle like we've seen Democrats in the past. So she were to win not only wouldn't be so historic for the country but would really set a new tone for the Democratic Party.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "Transcript for Voters head to the polls\n\nAs you mention the early voter turnout is already record this could be the first time in mid term elections we see 100 million American voters Mary Alice parks is here.

However, those interred in the cemetery immigrated later, coming from Morocco in the 1800s to seek economic opportunities.\n\nMany of these Jewish immigrants were men who married local Catholic women and stopped actively practicing their religion.\n\nThe burial grounds have been restored through a partnership between the local government and the Cape Verde Jewish Heritage Project, a non-for-profit founded in 2007. King Mohammed VI of Morocco financed the restoration of the cemeteries on Cape Verde, which gained independence in 1975 after more than 500 years of Portuguese rule.\n\nTwo other cemeteries, also on Cape Verde, were similarly restored in 2013 using a donation of some $100,000 from the king, Castiel said.\n\n\"This is a project from a Cape Verdean Jewish organization that is supported by a Muslim country, Morocco, in a Christian country, Cape Verde,\" said Carlos Wahnon Veiga, Cape Verde's former prime minister and current ambassador to the United States.\n\nVeiga, who is of Jewish descent, added: \"It is a very good example of tolerance worldwide.\"\n\nNo synagogue has ever existed on the archipelago.

Fox reporter Kristin Fisher, who tweeted a copy of Fox's statement on Tuesday, was covering the rally.\n\nIt's considered standard for employees of news organizations not to engage in political campaign activities so their outlets do not appear unfair; some journalists go so far as to not vote at all for this reason. Fox News resisted Monday when the Trump campaign had advertised to its followers that Hannity would appear as a \"special guest\" at the Missouri rally, saying Hannity was only there to cover the event.\n\nHannity, cable news' most popular personality and a vocal Trump defender, has twice been publicly rebuked by Fox for campaign activity. Hannity was made to cancel a 2010 appearance in Cincinnati when it was revealed he was participating in a fundraiser for the Tea Party. When he was featured in a 2016 Trump campaign video, Fox told him to never do it again.\n\nSince then, Fox opinion personalities have doubled down on their support of Trump. Already No. 1 in the cable news ratings, Fox has had a strong fall with the campaign and hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Hannity leading the way.\n\nCritics have claimed that Fox News Channel is less of a news organization than an arm of the Trump campaign, and Monday's rally gave them fresh ammunition. In the past, Hannity has said that he's a talk show host, not a journalist. But in an interview with The New York Times a year ago, he said he was a journalist, more specifically an advocacy or opinion journalist.\n\nHannity broadcast his show from the site of the rally Monday, where he exhorted viewers to vote Republican and echoed a Trump campaign theme seen on banners: \"Promises made, promises kept.\" He spoke briefly on camera with Trump at the end of the show.\n\nWhen it was done, White House Communications director Bill Shine, a former Fox News Channel executive, high-fived Hannity, according to the White House pool report.\n\nTrump called Hannity to the stage after praising Fox, saying, \"they're very special, they've done an incredible job for us. They've been with us from the beginning.\" Hannity hugged Trump and, after lobbing his crowd-pleasing insult at the media, recited economic statistics. Pirro, a former New York state attorney general who has a weekend show on Fox, spoke after him.\n\nTheir speeches weren't televised on Fox News, but were seen on C-SPAN.\n\nHannity's appearance meant either Fox lied Monday about its collaboration with the Trump campaign, or that it has no control over Hannity, said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal think tank Media Matters for America, which has unsuccessfully called for an advertiser boycott of Hannity's show in the past.\n\n\"Fox's admitted lack of control is only reinforced by the absence of sanction here,\" Carusone said. \"Anyone doing business with Fox News should worry about the network's inability to enforce even the most bare minimum standards.\"\n\nIt's not clear, however, whether Hannity was sanctioned or not. Fox has not addressed the question publicly.\n\nSome surprised journalists at other news organizations didn't hesitate to make their feelings known on social media. \"The White House-Fox News nexus has rarely been as evident as tonight in Cape Girardeau,\" said Philip Rucker, White House bureau chief at The Washington Post, on Twitter.\n\nWhite House reporter Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted: \"Still can't get over Hannity denying he would be on stage the whole day, getting brought up by Trump, and then pointing to actual news reporters and calling them fake.\"\n\nAlisyn Camerota, a former Fox News anchor who now hosts a morning show on CNN, said executives at Fox \"know vaguely\" that they're not supposed to have one of their hosts endorse a candidate or party, but that Hannity can't help himself.\n\n\"They're having a schizophrenic moment over there trying to figure out what their role is going to be with the Trump presidency,\" Camerota said on CNN.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhite House correspondent Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.", "A single mother was all smiles (and a few tears) recently when she claimed a $343.9 million check for being one of two winners of the $687.8 million Powerball jackpot.\n\nInterested in Lottery?

He said he would work to ensure that peace returns to Cameroon.\n\nOpposition parties have demonstrated against Biya's re-election, and violence has increased in the country's English-speaking North West and South West regions, where the armed separatists are fighting for an independent English-speaking state.\n\nLate Sunday, 79 students and three staff members were abducted from a school near the northwestern regional capital of Bamenda.\n\nU.N.

Armed separatists later took over the protests and began using violence in pursuit of their goal.\n\nFighting between the armed separatists and security forces has killed hundreds.

The number of openings far exceeded the roughly 6 million people who were unemployed in September.\n\nThe number of available jobs, in fact, has topped the number of unemployed for six straight months. Steadily strong hiring has lowered the U.S. unemployment rate to a nearly five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nAnd wages have begun picking up. Average hourly pay rose 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the fastest year-over-year gain since 2009, the year the Great Recession ended.\n\nEven with the dip in job openings in September, hiring remains robust. In October, U.S. employers added a strong 250,000 jobs, the government reported last week.\n\nIn September, the number of people who quit their jobs was essentially unchanged at around 3.6 million, a record high. A high number of people quitting their jobs is typically an encouraging sign: Most people quit when they have another job lined up or are confident they can find one.\n\nTuesday's figures come from the government's Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, which tracks the number of openings, quits and hires. They showed several industries with a particular abundance of openings:\n\nTrade, transportation and utilities; professional and business services, which include many higher-paying positions in engineering, accounting and architecture, as well as temporary help; education and health services; health care and social assistance; and hospitality and leisure.\n\nA slight pickup in inflation has eroded some of the value of higher pay. And a storm-related drop in average wages a year ago, resulting from Hurricane Harvey, helped inflate October's average hourly pay gain.\n\nStill, a broadening rise in wages suggests that the benefits of a healthy economy have been rippling out to more people. A more dynamic job market, with more people quitting and finding new work, typically helps produce higher pay.\n\nWith the economy growing at a brisk pace and consumers spending freely, employers are generally optimistic about customer demand and want to hire more.\n\nEmployers hired about 5.7 million people in September, down slightly from 5.9 million in August. The new hiring was close to record levels, partly reflecting population growth.

But the president-elect has been stingy with the details, and many wonder if he'll stick to his recent conversion to market-friendly reforms or if the dormant nationalist in him might reappear.\n\nEven if he holds fast to the agenda set forth by his economic guru Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist and the man who convinced many investors to take a chance on Bolsonaro, the former army captain could face fierce opposition in Congress and from labor unions to what will be undoubtedly unpopular measures. His economic agenda will also have to compete for priority with his better-known promises to crack down on crime and corruption, and the latter are much dearer to his heart \u2014 and his base.\n\n\"It's really unclear what Bolsonaro is when it comes to economic policy,\" said Matthew Taylor, an associate professor at American University's School of International Service. \"He himself has admitted to ignorance on the economic front, but he's also an extraordinary statist and a nationalist.\"\n\nFor years, Bolsonaro, who will be inaugurated Jan. 1, supported heavy involvement of the state in the economy, and he remains an admirer of Brazil's 1964-1985 military regime, which supported nationalist policies. But during the campaign, he espoused free-market principles.\n\nIt's not clear how complete his conversion is. For instance, after Guedes told reporters that he supported privatizing all of Brazil's dozens of state companies, Bolsonaro walked that back, saying he would sell off many but keep \"strategic\" ones, including big names like Petrobras and Banco do Brasil.\n\nAmid this swirl of doubt, one thing is clear: Brazil must quickly cut its deficit or it risks heading back into crisis. A World Bank analysis concluded last year that Brazil spends more than it can afford and spends poorly.\n\nBrazil's central government deficit was 7 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, according to the Central Bank, and has been above 5 percent in recent years. A large portion is interest payments on debt, but even excluding those, Brazil still had a primary deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP last year \u2014 which economists say is unsustainable because it means the already high debt level will continue to grow.\n\nThe new administration will have only a narrow window to show investors that it's serious about addressing this problem \u2014 by cutting spending or raising taxes \u2014 before they will begin to balk, making an adjustment more difficult because it could drive up borrowing costs.\n\nCompounding the challenge, Brazil is only just beginning to emerge from a two-year-long recession, and growth remains stagnant. That means it can't rely on big increases in tax revenues to help it plug the hole \u2014 and Bolsonaro has even promised to cut tax rates.\n\nGuedes, who will lead the Economy Ministry, appeared to be sending just that signal hours after Bolsonaro's victory on Oct. 28. He laid out a three-part plan to reduce Brazil's public spending by passing a pension reform, privatizing state companies to draw down the debt and enacting other unspecified reforms that will reduce \"privileges and waste.\"\n\nPension reform will be the linchpin in reducing Brazil's state spending for two reasons: Brazil's government spends more on pensions than anything else, and many other parts of the budget can't be altered because they're mandated by the constitution.\n\nAttempts to reform the pension system will likely face stiff resistance from labor unions and other groups since any measure will force Brazilians to work longer and receive fewer benefits. Bolsonaro, who in 27 years in Congress didn't show any particular gift for building consensus, will have to build a broad coalition to get a reform through. His Social Liberal Party holds about 10 percent of the seats in next Congress, but so does the Workers' Party, which is against such a reform and has vowed tough opposition.\n\nPresident Michel Temer, who is known for his ability to negotiate with Congress, failed at that task. Still, Glauco Legat, the chief analyst at the brokerage Spinelli, points out that Bolsonaro's decisive win gives him more legitimacy than Temer, who came to power after his predecessor was impeached in controversial proceedings.\n\nAny reform will be whittled away at in order to win votes, but Monica de Bolle, director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University, says she fears Bolsonaro's proposal will lack ambition right out of the gate since he has indicated he will leave military personnel out of it. That could also mean he will exclude other civil service sectors, which are key to taking a bite out of the problem.\n\n\"The watering down process is going to take place on the basis of an already diluted reform,\" she said.\n\nBeyond pension reform, Bolsonaro has promised to reduce the size of the state, including halving the number of ministries, and selling off state companies. Reducing the number of ministries could yield some savings, but other presidents have struggled to do that in more than name. And Bolsonaro has already taken off the table many state companies that would yield the most cash.\n\nInstead, economists say that many of the savings lie in eliminating inefficiencies. Guedes didn't give details, but if he's serious about reducing waste, there's plenty of it: The World Bank analysis highlighted Brazil's high civil service salaries, a constitutional mandate on education spending that often results in spending for spending's sake, overlapping social welfare programs and a proliferation of small hospitals in the public health system.\n\nDespite the challenges, Legat said it's important to remember that just by virtue of saying he'll take on Brazil's thorny issues, Bolsonaro has built momentum, which can have real-world effects.\n\n\"He brings optimism that's very important for the economy in this moment,\" he said. \"This increase in confidence is reflected in real numbers.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Victor Caivano contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Sarah DiLorenzo: www.twitter.com/sdilorenzo", "The United States says it has authorized rewards for information on the whereabouts of three top Kurdish rebel leaders wanted by Turkey, in a sign of improving ties between the NATO allies.\n\nThe announcement was made by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Palmer, who was in Ankara on Tuesday.\n\nPalmer said in a statement that the U.S. would pay up to $5 million for information leading to \"the identification or location\" of Murat Karayilan, up to $4 million for Cemal Bayik and $3 million for Duran Kalkan.\n\nAll three are senior leaders of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States.\n\nLast week, Turkey and the United States mutually removed sanctions imposed on each other's ministers.", "\"Nine Perfect Strangers\" (Flatiron Books), by Liane Moriarty\n\nLife is good for Liane Moriarty. The \"Big Little Lies\" novelist who partnered with actress Nicole Kidman to turn that book into a hit HBO series, sold the rights to her new novel, \"Nine Perfect Strangers,\" to her Australian friend before the rest of us could even read it.\n\nSo let's help them out and do some casting. Kidman, with a little extra padding and lots of red lipstick, can star as Frances Welty, the romance novelist with a broken heart who is the emotional center of \"Nine Perfect Strangers.\" Eight more actors with name recognition will join the project once she's officially onboard.\n\nThe key casting decision will be the antagonist, Masha, a former corporate exec turned health and wellness zealot. She needs to be beautiful, but severe. Driven and buttoned-up, but also a little unhinged. Russian, or Eastern European. Milla Jovovich, maybe?\n\nLuckily, before the series comes to a screen near you, you can spend a few hours with the book. It's a quick read, populated by the title characters who sign up for a retreat at Tranquillum House, a resort in Sydney that promises personal transformation in just 10 days.\n\nThe first half of the 450-page novel is a little slow, but once the nine guests complete their five-day \"noble silence,\" the pace accelerates and the story moves from a series of character perspectives (each chapter title is a character's name) to a light-hearted thriller. As soon as the strangers can talk, they find themselves with a lot to talk about.\n\nDoes Masha really have their best interests at heart? And most important, what the heck is happening to them during the retreat's final \"emotional-release exercise?\"\n\nMoriarty manages to keep the tone mostly light, despite creating characters with real issues. From a family unable to come to terms with the suicide of their son and brother to a divorce lawyer with daddy issues, all nine characters are adequately developed and feel genuine by book's end. Moriarty has fun fleshing them out through the eyes of Frances: Carmela, a mother of four in her mid- to late thirties, \"wearing an oversized brand-new-looking white t-shirt that hung almost to her knees over black leggings, the standard outfit for an average-sized woman who starts a new exercise program and thinks her perfectly normal body should be hidden.\" Tony, a retired Aussie Rules footballer, \"cradling his big solid belly on his lap as if it were a baby that had been handed to him without his consent.\" Or Jessica, a young woman not quite comfortable with her cosmetic enhancements: \"(She) didn't sashay as she deserved; rather she scurried, her shoulders hunched as though she were somewhere out of bounds and trying to escape notice.\"\n\nReaders learn much more about each of the nine as the novel speeds toward its climax. You root for them all and get the impression that Moriarty does too, so much so that she has a hard time saying goodbye, writing a series of final chapters updating readers weeks, months and even years later about what happened to them after the events at Tranquillum House.

The episode was caught on her daughter\u2019s camera and started an online conversation about corporal punishment.\n\nIt's a hot topic.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has just come out with a new policy statement urging that parents avoid both \"physical punishment and verbal abuse of children,\" citing evidence that links corporal punishment to \"an increased risk of negative behavioral, cognitive, psychosocial, and emotional outcomes for children.\"\n\nCorporal punishment -- defined as noninjurious, open-handed hitting with the intention of modifying child behavior -- is both ineffective for changing behavior and damaging to children and teens, the AAP said.\n\n\"In one study, young children who were spanked more than twice a month at age 3 were more aggressive at age 5,\" a press release accompanying the policy statement this week said. \"Those same children at age 9 still exhibited negative behaviors and lower receptive vocabulary scores, according to the research.\"\n\nThe effects of corporal punishment as well as harsh verbal abuse can actually change a child's brain, the organization said.\n\n\"Research has shown that striking a child, yelling at or shaming them can elevate stress hormones and lead to changes in the brain's architecture. Harsh verbal abuse is also linked to mental health problems in preteens and adolescents,\" the release said.\n\nThe AAP urges doctors to advise parents against using corporal punishment either in a moment of anger or in a planned response to misbehavior, and to opt instead for \"positive and effective parenting strategies of discipline.\"\n\n\u201cAdults caring for children [should] use healthy forms of discipline, such as positive reinforcement of appropriate behaviors, setting limits, redirecting, and setting future expectations,\u201d the organization said.\n\nThe AAP's new policy statement \"strengthens its call to ban corporal punishment,\" it said. In 2000, the group recommended that all states to abolish the practice of corporal punishment in schools.\n\nThis week's statement, focused on families, also seems to build on an earlier one in 1998 that recommended pediatricians \"use a comprehensive approach\" when advising parents and encourage the development of disciplinary \"methods other than spanking.\"\n\nSupport of corporal punishment is generally declining in the U.S.: In 1995, 80 percent of parents reported spanking their child, which fell to 67 percent of parents in 2013, one poll found.\n\nBut in 2015, over half of U.S. adults believed it was necessary to use physical force to discipline a child. This was true across different ethnic groups as well as different regions of the country, according to a study published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies.\n\nSince 1989, the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child has called on all member states to ban corporal punishment, and 53 countries have done so.\n\nBut in the U.S., nineteen states still allowed corporal punishment in schools as of 2016, according to a study which also said and physical discipline was meted out to 160,000 children in the 2011-12 school year.\n\n\"I hear from many parents, 'I was hit and I turned out fine,' to which I say, 'Every developing little brain is different,'\" said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician in California and a consultant to ABC News.\n\n\"The goal I hear from parents is a desire to teach, and when children are hit, they see themselves as the victim and automatically turn off their learning,\u201d Bracho-Sanchez said.\n\n\"It is important for parents to remember children are always watching, so we as adults need to model the behavior we want to see in children\u201d, Bracho-Sanchez said. \"Consistent limits and consequences are also very important \u2026 For example, if the child doesn\u2019t pick up her toys, say you will put them away for the rest of the day and actually follow through.\"\n\nRepeated use of corporal punishment has been associated with increased aggression in school, and increased risk of mental health and substance abuse disorders. In one study, it was even associated with physical dating violence as adolescents, the AAP said. On a biological level, young adults who experienced significant corporal punishment actually had visible changes to the brain itself on imaging, and elevated cortisol hormone levels that are associated with toxic stress.\n\nThe AAP recommendation focuses more broadly than on just physical punishment, saying parents should avoid any disciplinary action, including verbal abuse, that shames or humiliates a child.\n\nThe group is also reminding pediatricians to advocate for effective discipline policies in their states and communities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting softer,\" said Dr. Ryan Brown, a board-certified pediatrician and a member of the AAP's council on child abuse and neglect in a statement. \"I think we\u2019re getting smarter with our discipline.\u201d\n\nDr. Tiffany Yeh completed pediatrics residency at Brown University, and is currently an endocrinology fellow at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.", "Interested in Brexit?

CVS operates more than 1,000 clinics in its stores, which is marketed as a better option to deal with low-grade problems like sinus infections, rather than paying higher fees at the doctor's office or emergency room.\n\nCVS also wants to use its tie up with Aetna and its more than 22 million customers to monitor prescription use and to help people stay on their medications.\n\nCVS CEO Larry Merlo told analysts Tuesday that both CVS and Aetna, which reported better-than-expected results last week, have created a solid financial foundation \"on which we will build our revolutionary new model\" for care.\n\nIn the third quarter, CVS Health's prescription volume in stores open at least a year jumped 9 percent. That pushed revenue from its retail-long-term care business up more than 6 percent to about $20.9 billion.\n\nCVS Health also recorded a $268-million drop in income taxes due to federal tax cuts.\n\nOverall, net income climbed 8 percent to $1.39 billion, while adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.73. Revenue rose 2 percent to $47.27 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected, on average, third-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on $47.2 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nCVS Health Corp., based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, is the nation's second-largest drugstore chain. It also runs prescription drug plans for customers like insurers and employers, processing more than a billion prescriptions annually.\n\nThe company also reaffirmed on Tuesday its forecast for 2018 adjusted earnings of between $6.98 and $7.08 per share. CVS Health has been conservative with its forecast this year as it focuses on the Aetna deal.\n\nAnalysts predict earnings of $7.04 per share on average.\n\nShares of CVS Health advanced 3 percent, or $2.23, to $75.92, as broader indexes edged up slightly after markets opened Tuesday.

U.S. support for the Kurdish-led forces, who retook large areas from IS, has raised tensions between the two NATO allies.\n\n\"Not only can we not accept (the joint patrols), such a development will cause serious problems at the border,\" Erdogan told reporters at parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, a bomb went off inside a car in the northern Syrian town of Manbij, killing one person, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Manbij Military Council, which administers the town.\n\nThe SDF drove IS out of Manbij in 2016.

It appeared to have paid off.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday oil prices had fallen moderately, with benchmark U.S. crude down 0.3 percent and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, down nearly 0.4 percent. The fear was that the sanctions deadline would have pushed oil prices sharply higher.\n\nFive of the eight economies granted waivers as long as they work to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero are in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The others were Greece, Italy and Turkey.\n\nThe sanctions on Iran were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Donald Trump rejected that accord, and on Monday the U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions.\n\nThe new sanctions were particularly aimed at Iran's vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency.\n\nJapan said it was pleased to be temporarily spared from possible penalties for importing Iranian oil. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tokyo was analyzing the potential impact and was in close consultations with the U.S. on protecting Japanese companies from \"adverse consequences.\"\n\nThose would include penalties for breaking long-term oil purchasing agreements.\n\nStill, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said Tuesday that the waiver had \"opened breathing room\" for South Korea's oil refining industry, which relies on imports of a very light crude oil called condensate.\n\nThe waiver also is a relief for South Korean companies that export to Iran: The U.S. also agreed to uphold a special transaction system set up in October 2010 after discussions between Washington and Seoul that essentially allows South Korea to take Iranian oil as payments for its goods.\n\nWith the U.S. upholding the transaction system, South Korean companies will be able to continue exporting non-sanctioned items to Iran, officials said.\n\nIndia has a similar arrangement whereby Iran can use crude oil to pay for food and other necessities.\n\n\"These countries currently take the lion's share of Iranian oil exports. It is therefore likely that Iranian oil exports will stabilize at their present level of a good 1 million barrels per day,\" analysts at Commerzbank said in a commentary.\n\nThey said Iran's exports could well recover somewhat since Japan and South Korea had sharply cut their imports in the past few months as they sought the waivers from the U.S.\n\nFor both Japan and China, Iran is a significant but not huge supplier. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Qatar and Kuwait export more crude oil to Japan than Iran.\n\nChina, which said it regretted the U.S. rejection of the deal with Iran, is the single-largest importer of crude oil, at about 9 million barrels a day, and also of Iranian oil, so cutting off all shipments could have jolted global markets.\n\nBut while its demand is huge, China has diversified and relies on Iran for less than 10 percent of its total crude oil imports, with Saudi Arabia, Angola, Russia, Oman and Iraq providing more than half, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nMajor European allies have opposed the U.S. decision to reject the nuclear deal with Iran. The 28-nation European Union reportedly is preparing a new financial mechanism to help its companies avoid U.S. sanctions, and that could help keep Iranian oil exports flowing.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May's Downing Street office said Tuesday that the U.K. will continue to expand trade relations despite the decision.\n\n\"We regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S.,\" May's spokesman James Slack said. \"We continue to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran and encourage U.K. businesses to take advantage of the commercial opportunities that arise.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Danica Kirka in London and Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed.", "An installation commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the end of World War I has opened in London.\n\nInterested in United Kingdom?

Please check back tomorrow for the latest.", "Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThe risk of excessive disruption to world markets was a key factor behind the decision to allow exemptions for some of the biggest, most oil-thirsty economies. It appeared to have paid off.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday oil prices had fallen moderately, with benchmark U.S. crude down 0.3 percent and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, down nearly 0.4 percent. The fear was that the sanctions deadline would have pushed oil prices sharply higher.\n\nFive of the eight economies granted waivers are in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The others were Greece, Italy and Turkey.\n\nJapan said it was pleased to be temporarily spared from possible penalties for importing Iranian oil. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tokyo was analyzing the potential impact and was in close consultations with the U.S. on protecting Japanese companies from \"adverse consequences.\"\n\nFaced with the Nov. 5 deadline for re-imposing sanctions, the major importing countries had been winding down their purchases, which have dropped in recent months by more than a million barrels of crude per day. That deadline has now been extended.\n\nStill, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said Tuesday that the waiver had \"opened breathing room\" for South Korea's oil refining industry, which relies on imports of a very light crude oil called condensate.\n\nThe waiver also is a relief for South Korean companies that export to Iran: The U.S. also agreed to uphold a special transaction system set up in October 2010 after discussions between Washington and Seoul that essentially allows South Korea to take Iranian oil as payments for its goods.\n\nWith the U.S. upholding the transaction system, South Korean companies will be able to continue exporting non-sanctioned items to Iran, officials said.\n\nIndia has a similar arrangement whereby Iran can use crude oil to pay for food and other necessities.\n\nFor both Japan and China, Iran is a significant but not huge supplier. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Qatar and Kuwait export more crude oil to Japan than Iran.\n\nChina is the single-largest importer of crude oil, at about 9 million barrels a day, and also of Iranian oil, so cutting off all shipments could have jolted global markets.\n\nBut China has diversified and relies on Iran for less than 10 percent of its total crude oil imports, with Saudi Arabia, Angola, Russia, Oman and Iraq providing more than half, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo and Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed.", "The NATO chief urged the Taliban on Tuesday to stop killing their fellow Afghans, an appeal that came just hours after the insurgents attacked border troops in western Farah province, killing at least 20.\n\nSpeaking at a joint press conference with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the \"Taliban must realize the war does not benefit anyone.\"\n\nA resurgent Taliban now hold nearly half of Afghanistan and carry out near-daily attacks on Afghan security forces, inflicting heavy casualties. The Taliban view the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as a dysfunctional Western puppet and have refused repeated offers to negotiate with it.\n\nBut Washington and NATO are holding out hope, seeking to find a negotiated exit to 17 years of war.\n\nSpeaking alongside Stoltenberg, Ghani said his government hopes \"the beginning of formal negotiations is not far.\"\n\n\"The result has to be an inclusive Afghan peace, one that all Afghans accept,\" he said. To this end, \"we support the engagement of our international colleagues.\"\n\nThe remarks of the two stood in sharp contrast to the violence that shakes the nation almost daily.\n\nIn western Farah province, the Taliban attacked an Afghan border base on Monday night, killing at least 20 troops and abducting about 20 others.\n\nAccording to Abdul Samad Salehi, a provincial council member, about 45 border forces were based at the outpost in the Posht Koh district as it was overrun by the Taliban, setting off an hours-long gunbattle. All communication with the base was lost, he said.\n\nThree guards managed to reach a nearby village while the rest were either killed or taken by the Taliban, Salehi said. A senior army official in Farah, who was not authorize to speak to the media, confirmed the casualty figures.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Farah attack; he also claimed several military vehicles and large amounts of amination were seized.\n\nOne of the key demands of the Taliban is that all foreign forces should leave the country.\n\nStoltenberg said one of the reasons for the high casualties among the Afghan security forces is that they have taken the responsibility for the \"security of the entire country.\"\n\n\"There no way I can go back to Europe or to United States, NATO allies and partners and say that it didn't exactly go as we expected, so now we should leave (Afghanistan),\" Stoltenberg said. \"That will be a total wrong approach; we are here because it is in our interest to be here, to increase our own security.\"", "Britain's financial regulator says about 1,300 firms from the rest of the European Union have expressed interest in a proposal that would smooth the transition for their businesses if the U.K. leaves the bloc without an exit deal.\n\nA top official at the Financial Conduct Authority, Nausicaa Delfas, says the proposal would allow firms based in the European Economic Area - the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - to continue operating in Britain for up to three years while they seek full authorization under the new regulatory regime.\n\nDelfas, in a speech delivered Monday, says \"we are working to ensure a robust regulatory framework and a smooth and orderly transition for firms and their customers.\"\n\nWhile about 8,000 firms and funds trade in Britain, the level of interest at this stage is seen as positive and expected to grow.", "It's Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines.\n\nThe approvals came three months after Ivanka Trump announced she was dissolving her namesake brand to focus on government work.\n\nChina also granted provisional approval for two \"Trump\" trademarks to DTTM Operations LLC, headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. They cover branded restaurant, bar and hotel services, as well as clothing and shoes.\n\nThe marks will be finalized if there is no objection during a 90-day comment period.\n\nAll the trademarks were applied for in 2016.\n\nBoth the president and his daughter have substantial intellectual property holdings in China. Critics worry that China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party, could exploit those valuable rights for political leverage.\n\nThere has also been concern that the Trump family's global intellectual property portfolio lays the groundwork for the president and his daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office.\n\n\"Ivanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses,\" wrote Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group that first published the news about Ivanka Trump brand's new Chinese trademarks.\n\nLawyers for Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump in Beijing declined immediate comment.\n\nCompanies register trademarks for a variety of reasons. They can be a sign of corporate ambition, but many companies also file defensively, particularly in China, where trademark squatting is rampant. Trademarks are classified by category and may include items that a brand does not intend to market. Some trademark lawyers also advise clients to register trademarks for merchandise made in China, even if it's not sold there.\n\nChina has said it handles all trademark applications equally under the law.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press researcher Chen Si in Shanghai contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Kinetz on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ekinetz", "Interested in ISIS?

Findings from the gravesites can be used as evidence of the group's crimes, they said.\n\nThe graves date from 2014 to 2017 when the militant group, sometimes known by the acronym ISIL, ruled some of Iraq's largest cities and towns.\n\nAs the militants swept through Iraq and neighboring Syria, they killed captured members of the security forces en masse, expelled or killed minorities, and enslaved women from the Yazidi sect. The U.N. says the widespread violations could amount to genocide.\n\nSeveral graves found in Iraq's Salahuddin province contain the remains of victims of the 2014 Camp Speicher massacre, when the militants killed around 1,700 Iraqi security forces and army cadets.\n\nIn some cases, the militants dropped their victims or the bodies of their victims in wells or sinkholes instead of digging graves. Investigators said there could be thousands of bodies in the Khasfa sinkhole south of Mosul, the largest city once under IS control.\n\nIraqi authorities have exhumed the remains of 1,258 victims from 28 graves, according to the U.N. It urged authorities to identify the remains of all gravesite victims and seek justice for families. It said bodies should be preserved and returned to families.\n\nIraq's Mass Graves Directorate and Martyrs' Commission could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nIraq declared victory over IS in December last year, but the militants still control pockets of territory just across the border in Syria, and continue to claim responsibility for abductions and bomb blasts around the country.", "has blocked 115 accounts on its platforms due to alleged \"inauthentic behavior\" ahead of the 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nFacebook made the announcement in a statement Monday evening, saying it blocked 30 accounts on its namesake platform and 85 on Instagram that authorities believe are linked to foreign entities tying to interfere with the closely watched U.S. elections.\n\nThe social media giant said U.S. law enforcement flagged the accounts on Sunday, citing \"online activity that they recently discovered and which they believe may be linked to foreign entities,\" according to the statement. Facebook, which owns Instagram, said it immediately blocked accounts and opened an investigation.\n\nLightRocket via Getty Images\n\nNearly all of the blocked Facebook pages appeared to be written in French or Russian, although the Instagram accounts were mostly in English, the company said, noting that some of the Instagram accounts focused on celebrities and political debate.\n\n\"Typically, we would be further along with our analysis before announcing anything publicly,\" Facebook said. \"But given that we are only one day away from important elections in the U.S., we wanted to let people know about the action we've taken and the facts as we know them today.\"\n\nFacebook released a statement Wednesday evening, possibly linking some of the blocked accounts to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency.\n\n\"Last night, following a tip off from law enforcement, we blocked over 100 Facebook and Instagram accounts due to concerns that they were linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) and engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, which is banned from our services. This evening a website claiming to be associated with the IRA published a list of Instagram accounts they claim to have created,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said in an statement. \"We had already blocked most of these accounts yesterday, and have now blocked the rest.

Facebook also disclosed sophisticated attempts from Russia to interfere with elections and promote political discord in the U.S.\n\nAn internal investigation into the Iranian accounts found that more than 1 million Facebook users had followed at least one of the fraudulent pages, while about 25,000 users joined at least one of these politically oriented groups, according to a company statement.\n\nFacebook company opened a war room earlier this year in an effort to combat election interference around the globe.

However, health official Vicharn Pawan said Thailand imports measles vaccine products that do not contain porcine gelatin.\n\nThe recent cases in Buddhist-dominated Thailand's Muslim-majority southern provinces represent half the total for the whole country since the beginning of the year.\n\nMeasles cases nationwide have increased in recent years, Thailand's Health Ministry said. Last year, nearly 3,000 cases \u2014 with no deaths \u2014 were reported, compared to just over 1,000 in 2012. According to the U.N.'s World Health Organization, this year Japan and Brazil have also reported measles outbreaks, while Europe experienced a surge in 2017 with more than 20,000 cases and 35 deaths.\n\n\"Increasingly, there is a lot of misunderstanding about vaccinations that spread around Muslim communities here. Some said it is against their religion to receive vaccine shots, while others think it's not safe,\" said Anchanee Heemmina, a rights activist who lives in an affected area in the south.\n\nThe Indonesian Ulema Council, the religious body governing the world's largest Muslim population, had to deal with the same problem earlier this year when some local Muslim groups declared their opposition to the vaccine. It ruled that Muslims were allowed to use such vaccines out of necessity until other options were available. Its statement came after a measles outbreak in Indonesia's eastern province of Papua was believed responsible for the deaths of as many as 100 children.\n\nThe Indonesian controversy may be responsible for the concerns among Muslims in Thailand and other countries.\n\nAccording to the Thai Health Ministry's Prevention and Control office, the misunderstandings about vaccinations have resulted in some areas in which only 60 percent of the population receives immunizations.\n\nFor highly contagious diseases such as measles, the World Health Organization says at least 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated for a community to be considered immune to the spread of the disease.\n\nHealth authorities in Thailand have posted messages from local religious leaders on their websites urging people to accept vaccinations.\n\nOne video message from the Central Islamic Council of Thailand explains that even if vaccines contain religiously prohibited items, the medical benefit to a person and the community would take precedence.\n\nHealth workers meanwhile are visiting schools and homes in areas with measles outbreaks to target children under age 5 for free vaccinations, offering them also to others who are judged vulnerable. They are also trying to spread the word that Islamic religious bodies have given their approval for the use of such vaccines, said Vicharn Pawan, director of the Health Ministry's Bureau of Risk Communication and Health Behavior.\n\nResistance has not been overcome. Twenty families from three villages in Yala province refused vaccinations, with 10 of the families signing formal letters stating their intention to not receive any immunizations in the future, public broadcaster ThaiPBS reported Monday.\n\nYala's public health office said in a statement that its medical teams will continue to work in the communities to address their concerns.\n\n\"We are still facing tough tasks,\" said Vicharn. \"But health workers will continue to reach out to communities. Even if they refuse vaccinations this time around, we will have to keep up the visits and continue to deliver the message that vaccines are good for their health and their community.\"", "President Donald Trump at a press conference where he sparred with some reporters claimed that he \"stopped the blue wave\" by Democrats through his heavy campaigning for Republican candidates ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

I remember when we tried it in the late '90s,\" McConnell said. \"We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down, and we under-performed in the next election.\"\n\nHouse Democrats swept to power after campaigning on the promise of providing a stronger check on the Trump administration.

But Mills captured a majority in the first round.\n\nWednesday, 9:48 a.m. EST \u2013- Alaska's new governor is Republican Mike Dunleavy.\n\nHis path to victory became clearer when incumbent Independent Gov.

The Russian campaign to under mine our elections ongoing and the timing could not be worse. On the eve of one of the most closely watched and consequential elections of our lifetime. One voter caught in the chaos, Aaron Mcgee. We caught up with him at a trump rally. A staunch supporter of the president. Especially his stance on immigration. I've often referred to Donald Trump as the trump card. Mcgee's views informed in part by social media. He frequently consumes and shares posts that reenforce his political perspective. I think social media are just a reflection basically of what people think. Last year he shared a Facebook post from a page called \"Stop all invaders\" which was filled with anti-immigration rhetoric what he didn't know, what he thought was a pro-american post was actually created by a Russian. I had no idea that it was not a post made by an American. Or U.S. Permanent resident. It was all part of a years' long multi facetted Russian campaign attempts at hacking the voting system and robust campaign on social media that touched on hot button issues such as immigration, gun control and race relations. Was often about sewing the vision and about leveraging the controversies that are already existing in society. Just last month, a Russian woman, Elena khusyaynovaa was indicted alleged by part of a conspiracy behind that stop all invaders Facebook page post like Mcgee shares but she denied the allegation. Mcgee says it didn't work on him anyway. In no way whatsoever was a influenced. So far the special counsel Robert Mueller has inexcited 13 other Russians in their involvement in the disinformation campaign. Last year I travelled to Russia to see for myself what happens inside one of these so-called troll factories. I'm from ABC news in the United States. Cut. I was quickly turned away. But an under cover journalist provided us footage showing rows of troll inside the internet research agency which was later named in one of Robert Mueller's indictments. And the disinformation campaign was just the beginning. Next step, motivating Americans to take their frustrations off line and on to the streets. Conrad James an activist from Raleigh, North Carolina, says he was approached by a woman who claimed to represent black matters U.S. To his dismay he later learned they were an allegedly russian-group. They make the entire movement look bad. Who else was hooked like me by the same group. Now the lead up to this midterm election day American intelligence officials warn their subterfug. Reporter: Reporter: Has not stopped. This is culmination of two years of massive investment we have made in people and technology to ensure our platforms are safe and secure place for elections. Disinformation campaigns are by no mean it's the only threat to American democracy.

You're saying somebody who is voting that actually wants to create mischief can put it something in the machine. Correct. Because this whole area is voter accessible. What would you do just suck the data out of it. You can do whatever you want. You have the same unrestricted supervisor access. Elected officials say these concerns are over blown but you don't eefb actually have to be at a polling place to tamper with the vote. This is cloud security expert with red lock tracks how hackers a access voter databases on the internet. Show me how it works. This exclamation point has a known security issue. He sets up vulnerabilities that mimic those of state board of elections. It's a honey pot for hackers, if hackers find a way into cloud based servers they could tamper with voter registration data, voter rolls and potentially ballot files which tells the voting machines who is on the ballot and how to record the vote. If they exploit this host they can do whatever they want with the files on it. As a attacker don't need to go after the voting machine. As far as we know most attempts to breach board of election sights failed but in at least one state, Illinois, Russian hackers were able to access the electronic voter registration system potentially compromising the information of 76,000 citizens. I think we're more ready than ever but still lack the stand toord secure the ecosystem, not just the voting mushes but everything that supports it.

The Civil Guard said 13 of the survivors were thought to be unaccompanied minors.\n\nIt also said 17 other people traveling were missing, but could have reached Spanish shores. The Civil Guard on Tuesday resumed the search for them both on sea and land.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Spanish maritime rescuers found 80 people, including five women, and recovered the bodies of 13 dead migrants in the Alboran Sea, part of the western Mediterranean migrant route into Europe.\n\nThe migrants were traveling in two different boats, the Spanish Maritime Rescue Service said, adding that they were all transferred to the Spanish enclave of Melilla, which borders Morocco.\n\nThe U.N. says over 2,160 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe this year, 564 of them trying to reach Spain.\n\nAt the Strait of Gibraltar on the western edge of the Mediterranean, Africa and Europe are only 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) apart but the waters there can be dangerous due to high winds and strong currents.

He appeared alert and attentive as presiding judge Rainer Brackhane asked him questions, answering in slow, concise sentences.\n\nRehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about early September 1944.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but over 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nThe retired civil servant showed no reaction as prosecutor Andreas Brendel read the accusations against him, detailing the horrific way prisoners at Stutthof were killed. Some were given lethal injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts, shot or starved. Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or put to death in the gas chamber.\n\n\"Anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives,\" Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen, a former SS Sturmmann \u2014 roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist \u2014 does not deny serving in the camp during the war, but has told investigators he was unaware of the killings and did not participate in them.\n\nNo pleas are entered in Germany and Andreas Tinkl, one of Rehbogen's attorneys, would not comment on his client's defense. He said Rehbogen would address the court at some point during the trial, which is scheduled into January.\n\nRehbogen lives in Borken, near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, on no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court and faces a maximum 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nSeventeen Stutthof survivors or relatives of victims have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, but Brendel said it was unclear whether any would testify in person due to their ages.\n\nIn one of several statements read by their attorneys, survivor Judy Meisel remembered being forced by the Germans into a ghetto at age 12, where she said she endured hunger, daily humiliation and terror.\n\n\"But I was not prepared for what came next,\" said Meisel, who today lives in Minneapolis. \"Next came Stutthof and I experienced the unimaginable, the hell organized and executed by the SS.\"\n\nRehbogen, who was given headphones so he could clearly follow the testimony, showed no reaction as Meisel said the last time she saw her mother, they were both standing among a group of naked women about to be forced into the gas chamber, before she herself was able to break away.\n\n\"Stutthof was organized mass murder through the SS, made possible through the help of the guards,\" she said.\n\nBen Cohen, Meisel's grandson who came from New York to attend the trial, said hearing her statement with one of her former captors in the same room was both important and moving.\n\n\"I know her story so well it is emotional every time I hear it, but it takes on more importance than my own emotions now,\" he said.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate Stutthof survivors for the case, stressed that even more than 70 years after the end of World War II it is not too late to pursue justice.\n\n\"The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\" said the center's head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor's office that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing.\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany's top criminal court on appeal.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first use of this reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and was initially used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from nearby Danzig.\n\nFrom about 1940, it was used as a so-called \"work education camp\" where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "The Latest on the situation in Iran after the re-imposition of all American sanctions on the country (all times local):\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nIran's oil minister has written a letter to the OPEC chief, asking that the so-called Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee \u2014 which consists of all OPEC and non-OPEC countries \u2014 be dissolved because of its stance on the newly re-imposed U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said in his letter to OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo that some members of the committee \"openly take side with the United States in imposing unilateral and illegal sanctions against Iran.\"\n\nHe says there is no reason to continue with JMMC.

Dog parks are rare and canines are almost always required to be on leash.\n\nHowever, Wenshan's ban appears to go well beyond that by saying dogs can only be outside before 7 a.m. and after 10 p.m.\n\nIt also says dog leashes cannot be longer than 1 meter (3 feet) and dogs can only be walked by adults.\n\nDespite the newfound popularity of keeping dogs, many Chinese remain wary over the presence of wild or unleashed dogs. Rabies spread by unvaccinated dogs also accounts for a substantial number of the roughly 2,000 deaths from the disease that the World Health Organization counts in China each year.", "The \"largest-ever\" U.S. sanctions list targeting Iran drew mockery from Iranian officials on Tuesday for including mothballed Boeing 747s, a bank that closed years earlier and a sunken oil tanker that exploded off China months ago.\n\nHowever, the new list of sanctions, which also aims to cut Iran's vital oil industry off from international sales, also included for the first time its state airline and its atomic energy commission, further highlighting the maximalist approach of President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nTrump pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, and more than 200 people and ships.\n\nHowever, scattered among the list are surprising entries, like the crude oil tanker Sanchi. That vessel collided with a bulk freighter and caught fire off China's east coast in January, killing all 32 sailors aboard.\n\nAnother entry was Iran's Tat Bank, which closed in 2012.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif took to Twitter to mock some of the targets of the sanctions, describing it as a \"desperate\" psychological ploy.\n\n\"The U.S. designated a bank that was closed 6 years ago, and a ship that sank . in a widely televised saga,\" he wrote, ending the tweet with \"(hashtag)USisIsolated.\"\n\nBut for the first time, the United States targeted Iran Air. It also sanctioned the state carrier's mothballed fleet of Boeing 747s, which were manufactured in the 1970s.\n\nIt also appeared that the U.S., in another first, was directly sanctioning the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the government agency that oversees Iran's nuclear program. Prior sanctions targeted specific subsidiaries of the organization.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, President Hassan Rouhani's senior vice president, also criticized the sanctions.\n\n\"Americans think their list is more effective if it is longer,\" Jahangiri said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. He said he had discussed the list with other officials, with many saying it was \"less than what we expected.\"\n\nStill, Jahangiri warned that \"Americans intend to damage economy of the country\" through psychological warfare.\n\nZarif later issued an online video criticizing America's \"indiscriminate assault\" on his country.\n\n\"The U.S. administration appears to believe that imposing illegal draconian sanctions on Iran will bring about such pain to our nation that it will force us to submit to its will, no matter how absurd, unlawful or fundamentally flawed its demands are.\"\n\nZarif urged America to re-examine its \"catastrophes\" in the Mideast, including its support for Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed.\n\nSporadic smaller demonstrations still reportedly erupt from time to time.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran's vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. The price of benchmark Brent crude has dropped from over $80 a barrel in recent days.\n\nDuring a visit to Madrid on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran was \"not legitimate\" and that the rest of the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Washington are working to make economic cooperation with Tehran possible.\n\nLavrov's remarks were Russia's first reaction to Washington's new list of sanctions against Iran. The Russian diplomat said the sanctions go against international law and practices, and that the U.S. \"policies of issuing an ultimatum and making unilateral moves are unacceptable these days.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.", "Sean Hannity spoke from the stage of President Donald Trump's last midterm election rally, after Fox News Channel and its most popular personality had insisted all day that he wouldn't.\n\nHannity appeared on the podium in a Missouri arena Monday night after being called to the stage by Trump. Another Fox News host, Jeanine Pirro, also appeared onstage with the president.\n\n\"By the way, all those people in the back are fake news,\" Hannity told the audience.\n\nIt was an extraordinary scene after the news network had worked Monday to establish distance between Hannity and the campaign. Trump's campaign had billed Hannity as a \"special guest\" at the rally, but Fox had said that wasn't so. Hannity himself had tweeted: \"To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president. I am covering final rally for the show.\"\n\nBut Trump called him to the stage after saying, \"they're very special, they've done an incredible job for us. They've been with us from the beginning.\"\n\nHannity hugged the president when he came onstage and, after echoing Trump's traditional epithets about the media, recited some economic statistics.\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman did not immediate return a message seeking comment.\n\n\"Either Fox News lied all day about their direct collaboration with the Trump campaign, or the network simply doesn't have any control over Sean Hannity,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America, which has urged an advertiser boycott of Hannity in the past. \"This is a problem. It's dangerous for democracy and a threat to a free press.\"\n\nHannity has been rebuked by Fox in the past. In 2016, he was part of a Trump political video, which Fox said it had not known about in advance and told Hannity not to do so again. When Fox found out in 2010 that the Tea Party had advertised that Hannity would be appearing at one of his fundraising rallies, Fox said it had not approved the arrangement and ordered him back to New York.\n\nMonday's rally appearance was not shown on Fox News Channel, but was aired on C-SPAN.\n\nIt came after Hannity's prime-time show aired from the rally site. He played the role of cheerleader from the side as the crowd waited for Trump's appearance. He pleaded with viewers to vote Republican on Tuesday to support Trump, and his opening monologue echoed a campaign slogan seen on signs at the arena: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"\n\nHe moved backstage, and with six minutes before the end of his show, Trump appeared for a billed interview that was largely bereft of questions. Trump told Hannity he had seen the beginning of his show.\n\n\"I never miss your opening monologue,\" he said.\n\nHannity's role at the rally had been put in question by Trump campaign itself. It announced on Sunday that Hannity was to be a guest, along with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and singer Lee Greenwood. Fox said it did not know how that impression had been created and Michael Glassner, chief operating officer for the campaign, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDespite Fox's disavowal, the Trump campaign continued to list Hannity as a guest throughout Monday at the link where people could seek tickets to the event.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Lou Kesten in Washington contributed to this report.", "Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 28 percent surge in its net profit in the last quarter, helped by growing sales in Europe, Asia and the Americas, and raised its earnings forecast for the full year.\n\nThe top Japanese automaker said Tuesday that its July-September profit totaled 585.1 billion yen ($5.2 billion), up from 458.3 billion yen the year before. Quarterly sales rose 2 percent to 7.31 trillion yen ($64.7 billion).\n\nThe manufacturer of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Corolla subcompact forecast a 2.3 trillion yen ($20 billion) profit for the fiscal year through March. That exceeds its earlier forecast for 2.1 trillion yen ($19 billion), but is down nearly 8 percent from a nearly 2.5 trillion yen net profit in the previous fiscal year.\n\nToyota sold 2.183 million vehicles in July-September, up from 2.175 million vehicles the same period a year earlier.\n\nVehicle sales slipped in the U.S. and Japan but improved in Europe, the rest of Asia and Central and South America. The company stuck to its full-year forecast for selling 8.9 million vehicles globally for the year through March 2019.\n\nCost reductions and marketing efforts helped the results for the latest quarter though an unfavorable exchange rate hurt, according to Toyota.\n\n\"We are steadily making progress toward achieving our challenge-level target,\" Senior Managing Masayoshi Shirayanagi said in a statement of cost cutting efforts.\n\nToyota is often seen as an icon of Japanese-style manufacturing. It has been shifting its focus to leading technologies such as artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, car-sharing services and other new applications to keep up with changes in the industry.\n\nToyota President Akio Toyoda, a member of the company's founding family, has repeatedly said Toyota's business needs to change from merely making various vehicles to addressing all kinds of mobility needs.\n\nFor the fiscal first half, Toyota's sales rose to a record 14.67 trillion yen ($130 billion), up 3 percent from the previous year.\n\nToyota's sales projection for the year through March at 29.5 trillion yen ($261 billion), if realized, will also mark a record for the company.\n\nToyota's stock price jumped after the upbeat results were released, closed 2.1 percent higher.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "More than a year after Hurricane Maria caught Puerto Rico's government wildly unprepared, officials acknowledge they still haven't come up with a plan to cope with the next such disaster \u2014 and it's not clear when they will.\n\nThe U.S. territory's government insisted for months that it had a complete, updated disaster plan, saying it was kept secret due to protect information about vulnerable infrastructure and officials' private contact details.\n\nBut a suit filed by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism led officials to concede last month that that plan doesn't deal with catastrophic events such as hurricanes and earthquakes, prompting outrage on an island where many blame government bungling for the estimated 2,975 deaths linked to Category 4 Hurricane Maria, which hit in September 2017.\n\n\"The government has clearly failed the people and hid the fact that the plan was under revision,\" said Nazario Lugo, a former executive director of Puerto Rico's emergency management agency and president of the island's Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n\"We are talking about the lives of people. Someone is not going to react the way they're supposed to. This is a team effort, and when the team is not in tune, when it's not in position, it fails,\" he said. \"Lives are lost.\"\n\nCarlos Acevedo, director of Puerto Rico's Bureau for Emergency and Disaster Management, did not respond to requests for comment about why the plan hasn't been updated.\n\nAt the Oct. 30 court hearing, government lawyer Tania Fernandez said she didn't know when the plan would be finished and made public because officials haven't yet hired experts to create such plans.\n\nA partial plan released by the government last month stresses the risks of poor preparation and blames previous administrations.\n\n\"The consequences of Hurricane Maria made it clear that we did not have emergency plans that contemplated such scenarios, nor the sufficient resources to face catastrophic disasters of such historical magnitude,\" the document states.\n\nHowever, Lugo and another former emergency management agency director, Epifanio Jimenez, said Puerto Rico has had a plan for a Category 4 hurricane that was drawn up after Hurricane Hugo, a Category 3 storm, hit the island in 1989. They say Gov. Ricardo Rossello's administration failed to follow it.\n\n\"They're using the impact of Maria ... to justify the unjustifiable,\" Jimenez said of what many consider a botched government response to that storm. \"Improvisation is the worst enemy of emergency management, and we saw that.\"\n\nLugo and Jimenez said that emergency response was hindered by a lack of fuel and truck drivers, communication between local government agencies broke down, supplies weren't dispatched quickly enough and officials didn't know the immediate needs of each municipality.\n\nDespite the lack of a finished formal plan, local and federal officials have learned lessons from Maria and are more prepared than they were when that storm hit, according to Jesus Cuartas, an operational planning chief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who urged patience.\n\n\"We are not racing for time,\" he said. \"Any plan that is simply rushed out the door ... the thought of that being viable is slim to none.\"", "Humanitarian aid converged around a stadium in Mexico City where thousands of Central American migrants winding their way toward the United States were resting Tuesday after an arduous trek that has taken them through three countries in three weeks.\n\nMexico City Mayor Jose Ramon Amieva said 4,500 migrants have arrived at the Jesus Martinez stadium since Sunday, and city officials are bracing to attend as many as 5,500 at the site by Wednesday. Hundreds of city employees and even more volunteers were on hand to sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics.\n\nMigrants searched through piles of donated clothes, grabbed boxes of milk for children and lined up to make quick calls home at a stand set up by the Red Cross as U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue.\n\nEmployees from the capital's human rights commission registered new arrivals with biographical data\u2014 such as age and country of origin\u2014 and placed yellow bracelets on wrists to keep count.\n\nRina Valenzuela wore one of the yellow bracelets as she sat attentively listening to aid workers from the nonprofit Institute for Women in Migration explain the difficulties of applying for and securing asylum in the U.S. Valenzuela, who is from El Salvador, decided she's better off applying for refuge in Mexico.\n\n\"Why go fight there, with as much effort and as much suffering as we have gone through, just for them to turn me back? Well, no,\" she said.\n\nThe aid workers explained that the asylum process in the U.S. could take years, with no guarantee of approval.\n\nHonduran Antonio Perez listened to the warnings but said he remains determined to continue north.\n\n\"This is interesting but tough news,\" he reflected. \"But neither this nor Donald Trump is going to stop me.\"\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium was more institutional and organized than what migrants encountered on the road, where townspeople pushed bags of drinking water, tacos and fruit into their hands as they passed through tiny hamlets in southern Mexico.\n\nBut there were signs Tuesday that the stadium was already nearing its capacity to hold 6,000 people.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, 41, said there was no space in the stadium when she and her 8-year-old daughter arrived during the night, so the two from Honduras slept on the grass outside. Migrants pitched tents in the parking lot and constructed makeshift shelters from plywood covered with blankets and tarps. Forty portable toilets were scattered across the grass.\n\nThe stadium's enclosed space and government intervention makes it difficult for aid workers to reach the migrants, said Nancy Rojas, an Oxfam charity worker who has accompanied the migrants for weeks.\n\nFour big tents have been set up for women and children to sleep under with thin mattresses and blankets, while men were relegated Monday night to concrete bleachers. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) during the night in a city some 7,300 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level and still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\nSeveral smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south. Mexico City Mayor Amieva said the city needs to \"reinforce\" to meet the needs of the migrants, especially vulnerable children and pregnant women.\n\nMexico City's central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd, plus 600 bottles of water. The human rights commission said it planned to set up more tents and eating areas.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea and other maladies. City officials administered vaccines for tetanus and influenza.\n\nTrump has seized on the caravan as an election issue and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, vowed to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support relatives back home.\n\nWalkiria Viamney, 19, said she and her husband have relatives in Tijuana and California who have promised to help them cross into the United States. The pair from Honduras hoped to soon advance northward, although they relished the opportunity to rest and wash clothes in the stadium.\n\nNot far from Viamney, men played cards and chess while children ran between inflatable games. Others gave themselves sponge baths or lounged in the shade of improvised tents.\n\n\"I've been here for three days already, and I'm already rested. I want to move on,\" said Francisco Redondo, 40, a Honduran who said he worked construction for 12 years in California.\n\nOrganizers are urging members of the caravan already in Mexico City to await the arrival of stragglers and perhaps even the other caravans further back. The idea is to find strength in numbers. The outpouring of support for the caravan that first set out from Honduras on Oct. 13 has inspired thousands of others to march north from Central America.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas. A caravan last spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nEdgar Corzo, an official with the National Human Rights Commission, said that based on experiences with previous migrant caravans, the group probably will begin to break up now that it is in the capital.\n\n\"Each one goes to the place that he considers best,\" mainly wherever is closest to where they have relatives or friends already in the United States, he said.", "Turkey's top diplomat on Tuesday criticized the U.S. resumption of sanctions on Iran as unilateral, not wise and dangerous, calling for a dialogue and engagement instead.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Tokyo for talks with Japanese leaders, told reporters that Turkey opposes sanctions because they don't achieve results.\n\n\"As a principle Turkey is against sanctions and we don't believe that any result can be achieved through sanctions,\" he said. \"Cornering is not wise, isolating Iran is dangerous and punishing the Iranian people is not fair.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration's resumption of sanctions on Iran took effect Monday.\n\nTurkey is an U.S. ally and one of eight major importers of Iranian oil spared temporarily from immediate penalties.\n\nStill, Turkey has to be frank with the U.S. about its opposition. The U.S. \"unilateral\" measure affects the world, including Turkey, one-third of whose gas imports come from Iran, he said, and urged Washington to find other reasonable solutions. \"I think instead of sanctions, meaningful dialogue and engagement is much useful and this is our principle.\"\n\nCavusoglu also urged Saudi Arabia to fully cooperate in the investigation of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month, demanding the country locate his missing body and hand over suspected collaborators.\n\nTurkey is determined to get to the bottom of the case and Saudi Arabia hasn't answered the key questions, he said. \"We have to find out how it happened, who did it and who gave the instructions, and we also have to find the body of the journalist Khashoggi.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post that the order for the journalist killing came from the highest level of the Saudi government but not King Salman.\n\nErdogan knows the king well and is convinced he was not involved in the murder, Cavusoglu said. He added that other evidence not made public suggested the king was not involved.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "After a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon is now reportedly looking to build offices in two cities instead of one, a surprise move that could still have a major impact on the communities it ultimately selects.\n\nNew York's Long Island City as well as Crystal City in northern Virginia have emerged as the front runners, according to sources familiar with the talks with Amazon.\n\nSelecting those areas would bring more jobs to places that already have plenty. Jed Kolko, the chief economist at job site Indeed, said that choosing New York and the D.C. area would \"be a much less radical move than many imagined\" and another example of \"rich places getting richer.\"\n\nThe company had originally promised to bring 50,000 new high-paying jobs to one location, which founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said would be \"a full equal\" to its Seattle home base. Amazon may now split those jobs equally between two locations, The Wall Street Journal reported, with each getting 25,000.\n\nThat would beg the question of whether the new locations would be headquarters at all. Kolko said a headquarters is \"where the decision makers are,\" but it's unclear where Amazon's executives \u2014 such as Bezos \u2014 would spend much of their time. If Amazon decides to split the 50,000 workers in two places, each of those offices would be smaller than Seattle's, which has more than 40,000 employees.\n\nVirginia officials and some state lawmakers were recently briefed by the head of the state's economic development office that Amazon was considering splitting up its second headquarters, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nOfficials in Virginia believe there's a strong likelihood Amazon will pick Crystal City as one of its sites, but the company has not said anything definitive, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\n\"They're a real secretive company,\" the person said.\n\nOne of the other areas the online retail giant is considering is Long Island City, according to a source familiar with the talks. Across the East River from midtown Manhattan, Long Island City is a longtime industrial and transportation hub that has become a fast-growing neighborhood of riverfront high-rises and redeveloped warehouses, with an enduring industrial foothold and burgeoning arts and tech scenes.\n\nAmazon has been tight-lipped about the process and declined to comment on the latest news. There's been intense competition to win over the company, with some throwing around billions of dollars in tax incentives. Amazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in September 2017, initially receiving 238 proposals before narrowing the list to 20 in January.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo met two weeks ago with Amazon officials in his New York City offices, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Cuomo offered to travel to Amazon's Seattle hometown to continue talks, the source said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuomo told reporters that Amazon is looking at Long Island City, but didn't say if it was a finalist. He said winning over Amazon would give an economic boost to the entire state, and joked that he was willing to change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" to lure the company.\n\nAn estimated 135,000 or more people live in Long Island City and neighboring Sunnyside and Woodside, and the median household makes about $63,500 a year, a bit higher than the citywide median, according to New York University's Furman Center housing and urban policy think tank. About 40 percent of people over 25 in the Long Island City area have a bachelor's or higher degree, slightly above the citywide rate, the Furman Center's data shows.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Amazon is finalizing deals to locate to Long Island City and the Crystal City section of Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the possible plan to split the headquarters between two cities, said Dallas is also still a contender. Both newspapers cited unnamed people familiar with the decision-making process.\n\nA spokesman for the Dallas Regional Chamber declined to comment.\n\nLong Island City and Crystal City would meet Amazon's requirements for a new locale: Both are near metropolitan areas with more than a million people, have nearby international airports, direct access to mass transit and have room for the company to expand.\n\nOther locations that were on Amazon's list of 20 either declined to comment or said they haven't heard from the online retailer.\n\nJay Ash, the economic development chief in Massachusetts, said Tuesday that he's had \"no recent contact\" with Amazon about a headquarters in Boston, but his office is still talking with the company about other opportunities. Earlier this year, Amazon unveiled plans for an office expansion in Boston's Seaport District, promising 2,000 new technology jobs by 2021 in fields including machine learning and robotics.\n\nAmazon has said it could spend more than $5 billion on the new headquarters over the next 17 years, about matching the size of its current home in Seattle, which has 33 buildings and 23 restaurants.\n\nThe company already employs more than 600,000 worldwide. That's expected to increase as it builds more warehouses across the country to keep up with online orders. Amazon recently announced that it would pay all its workers at least $15 an hour, but the employees at its second headquarters will be paid a lot more \u2014 an average of more than $100,000 a year.\n\nEarlier this month, Bezos said during an on-stage interview in New York that the final decision will come down to intuition.\n\n\"You immerse yourself in that data, but then you make that decision with your heart,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKlepper reported from Albany, New York, and Suderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.

It was surreal to everyone involved.\"\n\nThe boy's footprints were visible in the sand, showing where he'd wandered from the tent into the water. He'd floated about 15 meters (50 feet) before Hutt spotted him.\n\n\"If I hadn't been there or if I had just been a minute later I wouldn't have seen him,\" Hutt told the newspaper. \"He was bloody lucky but he just wasn't meant to go.

And she decided to live on to see the inauguration and spend time in that big Executive Mansion where the food was pretty good.\"", "Chinese authorities have begun deploying a new surveillance tool: \"gait recognition\" software that uses people's body shapes and how they walk to identify them, even when their faces are hidden from cameras.\n\nAlready used by police on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai, \"gait recognition\" is part of a push across China to develop artificial-intelligence and data-driven surveillance that is raising concern about how far the technology will go.\n\nHuang Yongzhen, the CEO of Watrix, said that its system can identify people from up to 50 meters (165 feet) away, even with their back turned or face covered. This can fill a gap in facial recognition, which needs close-up, high-resolution images of a person's face to work.\n\n\"You don't need people's cooperation for us to be able to recognize their identity,\" Huang said in an interview in his Beijing office. \"Gait analysis can't be fooled by simply limping, walking with splayed feet or hunching over, because we're analyzing all the features of an entire body.\"\n\nWatrix announced last month that it had raised 100 million yuan ($14.5 million) to accelerate the development and sale of its gait recognition technology, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nChinese police are using facial recognition to identify people in crowds and nab jaywalkers, and are developing an integrated national system of surveillance camera data. Not everyone is comfortable with gait recognition's use.\n\nSecurity officials in China's far-western province of Xinjiang, a region whose Muslim population is already subject to intense surveillance and control, have expressed interest in the software.\n\nShi Shusi, a Chinese columnist and commentator, says it's unsurprising that the technology is catching on in China faster than the rest of the world because of Beijing's emphasis on social control.\n\n\"Using biometric recognition to maintain social stability and manage society is an unstoppable trend,\" he said. \"It's great business.\"\n\nThe technology isn't new. Scientists in Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency have been researching gait recognition for over a decade, trying different ways to overcome skepticism that people could be recognized by the way they walk. Professors from Osaka University have worked with Japan's National Police Agency to use gait recognition software on a pilot basis since 2013.\n\nBut few have tried to commercialize gait recognition. Israel-based FST Biometrics shut down earlier this year amid company infighting after encountering technical difficulties with its products, according to former advisory board member Gabriel Tal.\n\n\"It's more complex than other biometrics, computationally,\" said Mark Nixon, a leading expert on gait recognition at the University of Southampton in Britain. \"It takes bigger computers to do gait because you need a sequence of images rather than a single image.\"\n\nWatrix's software extracts a person's silhouette from video and analyzes the silhouette's movement to create a model of the way the person walks. It isn't capable of identifying people in real-time yet. Users must upload video into the program, which takes about 10 minutes to search through an hour of video. It doesn't require special cameras \u2014 the software can use footage from surveillance cameras to analyze gait.\n\nHuang, a former researcher, said he left academia to co-found Watrix in 2016 after seeing how promising the technology had become. The company was incubated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Though the software isn't as good as facial recognition, Huang said its 94 percent accuracy rate is good enough for commercial use.\n\nHe envisions gait recognition being used alongside face-scanning software.\n\nBeyond surveillance, Huang says gait recognition can also be used to spot people in distress such as elderly individuals who have fallen down. Nixon believes that the technology can make life safer and more convenient.\n\n\"People still don't recognize they can be recognized by their gait, whereas everybody knows you can be recognized by your face,\" Nixon said. \"We believe you are totally unique in the way you walk.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this story.", "Transcript for Jimmy Carr and Jim Gaffigan perform for veterans\n\nHello everyone I'm ABC's don't look you can name any SFO's stock way and we are coming to you live in the red carpet here at Madison Square Garden in New York City aboard a great cause that is being celebrated. And honored here tonight is called stand up for heroes. It is a joint venture. Presented by the Bob Woodruff foundation and the New York comedy festival and we again on the red pepper to bring you some of the sights and sounds. A leading into this very big night in very big week for comedy to help benefit the Bob Woodruff foundation. In a post 9/11. Impacted veterans and their families who get the period and I get the help. That they deserve and need. To you witnessed Benton. Last year due to its war on the first ten minutes a lot of time it's a lot of fun pressure have a lot of fun tonight in the case. Lots of comedy we had Jimmy Hart John sewer except my areas. Jim gap again and it'll also be having performances from Bruce Springsteen as well as Eric church they think it's his first time ever Springsteen is he's been at data for here is quite a lot of times out of excited seven. That's going to be fine and into the all benefiting from 9/11. Eleven veterans and their families and again our colleague Bob Woodruff. His wife leave asserted their foundation and this is in coordination after with men and again. I want to show you look into the red carpet there's no line itself for us right now on what people have been walking and tonight we're gonna talk to. Quite a few people over the next thirty minutes or so calm as they come through they're going to be comedians. They're going to be armed. You know what we got one right here though when I bring Iran and this is. Captain Sully volleying and I think you guys might have this guy right there right there again it made me think let you know you think this is my wife Laurie its own I think you so much for joining us. Eventually you and he has now also with AB thirty. A guy is. So please tell you guys agree by the way tells why it is so important for you to be here tonight I'm a veteran and for many years. More and I have supported veterans' causes she argued that the number of years ago but one that made earlier Bob this is our first Jessica this event we're very excited to. Are there any specific comedians are looking to see in particular area comedy banning all my answer yeah I've always Jon Stewart and dale all the long peg into the mental ward knows every time the first time congress. What do you mean we did noticing alone could yeah. And I've been to accommodate yeah. Case and what's your comedic John Johnson on evening and on here yeah. That was the extent that. Ventilated a it was good it was pretty good and not talk about obviously we're concerned profound London. And those veterans who who is of the call to serve this country and have been injured in war. Your thoughts about them in their sacrifice. It takes a lot of courage to volunteer for service during wartime. And I I think we should honor that went more than just think tanks and passing them in an airport. We needed to make sure that there's other services rewarded. And an honored and that all their needs are met long after your services are complete and and right now they're assuming big gaps and that every day and make sure that their resources available to meet their needs in every way we don't gaps. And help them heal helps them be reintegrated holding a news. That's something that's an ongoing process work. Hundreds of thousands of and I think a lot of us are all went one degree separation from new we have veteran with someone who is currently serving concert. Confident even in our family. Yeah we just came back to air force academy. They had met a lot of young men and it's sad very inspiring smarts every time we leave we think it. As president. And he even though. Many of us know this. Still it's a tiny single digit fraction of our entire population that's doing all the heavy lifting. Still that's didn't stepping forward. To serve causes greater than themselves. To do for everybody else what either cannot move on to ourselves and redeeming. We got does its citizens and go it's a family thing is it tradition often so you'll find it. If someone they're not there are thought there are some analysis service. My son or daughter so it kind of runs and her dad I'm sure this organization is happy for your support as well. Think you again for doing and I think he had talked to enjoy the event tonight. Yeah have a lot so that's doing a little burners and Sony and eating you know they live thank you have a great say they do consumers doing it. It's not what. Regular. Yeah hair and famous famous Craig Newmark the founder of Craigslist hi nice to me and he has never made it seem you are doing. Let's turn a little bit but you can see. Do a really good job. It's a big deal. You know two minutes. We will photographers. And how did prince get involved with a Bob Woodruff foundation because they don't you happen to him part of that for a long time I believe I stumbled upon them. Five or six years ago it made sense to me that it made more sense and I just did stuff. You just did stuff I love that and and I know that if you might fit you're also one of the arteries for the Bob Woodruff foundation generous personal ordered. So what does you know in the context of that and coming here tonight what does it mean to you to be here at stand up for heroes for the fifth or sixth. I'm well we need to remind everyone. How much we owe vets and their families active service it's so a lot of stuff I do. It is for the opportunity to say we know lots of them all. And we did and we and again. It's an act that you're here supporting on invisible line is we'll figure again is very nicely into it though it's not my pleasure I appreciate baker grew. You read in the fight any comedians are looking forward to seeing red when they're behind. OK and again you're right in the middle after its elegant might need your little. Clinton has been and I want to listen and yeah. I don't did you I don't know her birdie. You need to adapt get everyone to live together. They're girls up didn't get the from ABC news. Nice to Israel and drew are all part of the all star line up here at home and on the involvement with the kind of for the month of the area line up also a lineup here. Now I've done this event a couple times. It's. You know per comedians I think it's probably that in one of the most prestigious events you can. The asked to do the caliber of comedians is always kind of awe inspiring and obviously. Good causes. So well respected army and there's finally a break causes valid business. Tangible experience where have. Audience some of the participants are service vehicles so its grip. And he talks a lot of you know comedy and how important it is for comedians to come here what do you think it is about. Whether it's comic. Gather crowds like this. Gosh I don't know I mean idealists. What. At least for me I've. Feel like it's the least a comedian can do our. About them. The loud mouths here that means though it's like these warriors that we can honor that somehow and but I think comedy is something that. You know has had strains. Healing property too good values and it's weird that are now I'm not gonna pretend like I understand us. And I'm not very Smart enough I'm good got planned for tonight obscurity filthy he you know I. Love that yeah that is yeah. It's strange because it isn't a very special. Show. And so I have an idea of what I'm gonna do but I also. We have done this before where I've had changed my mind as I watched the other performers. And see what's working you know it was. This is such an event. That being so generous in spirit that you. Some cynicism kind of dancing summits disrespectful so I can be setting. Even though like comedians are exposed to censor themselves but like I don't know we'll say. I'm sure some of those veterans the they're gonna love all of those things really happen because it makes me a better view of their own I'm sure that we think a probably can't be fed on television. Now it's about may be in fact enactments. Ellen gets hurt Matt. His message that you want to kind of the harder you just gave stunning gotta go with the flow on the side. I think that overall I. There's no one that would disagree with the notion that. Better veterans and their families and a can only use some more recognition events and assistance you know I wish that this. A bad weather is obsolete but I think that we're always and need to do something like that's. Before we let you go obvious that with you pervert tomorrow's kind of a big day in this country I'm from Hancock good news today. And Oakley gets on top of that you get about right. Comedians out we talk about comedy killing the nation. And we think we may need some more of that your thoughts about the big day tomorrow. While I mean I think everyone and then no you know it's weird because. There's almost this sense that nobody wants to predict any market they were so wrong twenty years ago. I didn't know I think it's going to be exciting I have to be. Optimistic. I hope a lot of people vote I hope it leads and no matter what happens that may be. Our democracy is strong with people voting and I got a good feeling but then again I'm superstitious underwent a double to hear me turn. Pay down stiff GAAP and thank you so much Goddard and me and ASEAN have fun tonight and thank you for your service to their cause yet. Thank you yeah. Again to so many celebrities comedians hear him. And that's when you lose your car through on your comedy. Islam means so that's co founded by anti oxidant Carolina parents think it was cook cited something like eleven years ago Caroline from terabytes on Broadway mom she started got about 35 years ago cities are people that have really been any greens and the the New York comedy you are hardly know all the comedians they discovered a bunch of comedians with its nice to see them on come together. But the really big night yeah. For New York yes and those who gets you he summit this comedy GAAP and know that it's working on yes and obviously for matters we person did Martin say that. He still need so much assistance and bring attention now. In the foundations like the Bob Woodruff foundation definitely talk to Bob Woodruff hopefully. Here's our leaders usually you always does direct marketing its deadlock let them have been. About room around a little more. And that's what he is solid with my name of that I'm yeah.

You know billion artificial limbs and making some of those guys who got what they need to live regular normal lives there injured in action. You know. Protecting our freedoms. Hospitals and mental health and you know all of the biggest games giving people something despite going two children coming in the UK it's been. Huge TV just getting this kind of Prince Harry just we don't stay in the in Australia Arkansas recently. It's amazing to see those kind of schools. It really is and it needs people like you but the foundation to really highlight what they've gone through and the assistance that they need do you know anyone impact. Hot air or anyone deserves. And he would. In the UK here in the US I think I'd be lucky to be quite a little people. It down in there and had to coal which is that we have sent from the UK wages servicemen retreated in and did every man behind its comedy joke about eight years ago about how you know. It's a terrible thing these young remain in them calling these young great men getting injured but it means. We'll then you want to paralympics and these guys have just a minute just legendary I'm just extraordinary spokesman and that got I think espouses the same feelings go into the military.

Not liaison one veterans is here ex fiance story you read the New York marathon yesterday.

Kind of amazing news days and when his and it's looking to be involved in kind of a mixed built in humans and it feels like an old school variety show yeah we got some scenes. We'll get some play in the National Anthem of the top just a couple of guys telling jokes is going to be a lot of I'm Heidi prepare for and I like this. I will you prepare to let. In New York high tech the two nights and did five shows tonight on what count walk jokes but gonna hit about it. Just because I really kind of thing like because I'm very edgy I'm really brutal comedian actually. Playing to military giants. Visiting you can go to these troops were so what do you do show viewers give my full rights against glimpse beyond forces have a couple of with a family isn't just a little way of saying thank you. And that the best stories thanks but because it's not like I've gone on since acutely they like to brutal drug. It's thanks Mike you are amazing for me but then actually this kind of thing you know I'm personally clowns are going to be able to capitol. I'm pretty edgy you know Google me if you're watching us. Everything didn't you and I can't yeah. We're gonna go rolled out Google are going to date thank you so much is an absolute yeah a year ago that he could become an ABC exhibits. Everything behind Atlanta. Jimmy Carter now they are eating is a pretty hear what I don't know I don't think straight nonetheless responded here are some doors by the media. Yeah. And a little help here and find interviewing the comedian yeah. They really as Tom. I still under 1000 nights it was all of them as well when Martin got thrown her she's one of the kids yes really partnered when she. She's right here behind me what venture fox I believe accounting matter here. A partner with the Bob ordered the foundation to lobby against while you're for the so it's twelve years ago. After the fact seniors he isn't talking yet you're here and presumably that's been stolen in the hours ago yeah. We are going to challenge therein doesn't moment. Carol I'm gonna get divorced like ABC news. ABC news how are you come on you can admit here. Yeah you're right here please got to get this outfit in the yeah you'll be looking great tonight. Some thing twelve years you believe that you've lived. We we started as a hunch it. With a lunch stay with the lead to make this might happen twelve to thirteen years ago almost. We started in May and by November we had this this done together with Conan O'Brien Robin Williamson. Lewis black and Brian Regan and look where we are today it's incredible what the first year we did raise three million dollars commissioner and I secretaries general raised close to six million dollars. Even bigger tendency is to get you gotta be extremely proud of those numbers and what they're doing to help with so many programs are so many veterans we are with Brad and the proud mother I'm a board member. The public juice foundation. And this money goes to the greatest causes everything is headed out some kids eat there. And everything goes to these men and women better helped us in the war. Wrench your bedroom. When you think about how far you've common you've seen all of these comedians are also the founder Caroline's on Broadway do you think comedy has changed very involved in any way has stacked like. Does have standup comedians changed their crops. Well I think what we happened in the last year's admission is seen a lot more political come from when I started 35 years ago. And we have a lot more people doing comedy. And a lot more women do. So that's changing its the observational humor as you see tonight we have a prisoner jam concert that was John Oliver last year. Yeah. Yeah. Here de L yeah I'm curious about honestly. Here gets bigger and better but Gemma favoring a particular and more than ball. And you know what many years I'm. We read the beacon theater and Robin Williams was on the show and it was really that I really remember that night with him so much. This any came to the after party and its keeping all that's entertained all night. So like I really remember the world really misses him blindness and sound. The greatest dad. Opposite tonight any other little tidbits are things that maybe we don't know about that sound. Clearly. Lowered CEO we have Eric church and I am we have Bruce Springsteen so may be. Anyway and alerted him to get we have heard that yeah. At Atlanta and then a good course we have Bruce telling jokes so that we wouldn't that. And I keep harping on this how many years but I know that you wanted to keep this going keep this going what's plan for the future war this event. We didn't do it until people stop coming so we are here to do it you know we can't forget that this is not only that we have men and women that will be. Needing our help. In the next three years in the life absolutely we can't give up now and he'd ever even show this here early this year in San Francisco San every heroes went out to the West Coast. I mean so he talks about you want to keep you wanna see it keep crying but. In terms of the keep all what. What's one message that you want any part to the audience members who come to the show earlier this thing we need to impart is what I dissent before the sack. Not all of just because you think there is no war going on as we just saw. Mayor from Utah was shot and killed last week when us. So it's not over an end because it's not in the headlines every day. We can't forget about him we cannot. And thank you for your service of them as well as an incredible work that you're in the foundation. Are going to have been doing for more than a decade it's hot and these tremendous run in hand Marines into the blue room experience T. He met ABC news Bob Bob yeah do you believe there are so thank you again to bury you guys you know I'm so good to see I get any next here. Already so yeah it's is considering current or bad their doing the foundations built in so many people. Karl Malden yet. These hidden as well no definitely. Sitting here comedy festivals Felix's leader something that is really Caroline -- and oranges boxes you know they created at. It's there it's actually going to be launching this next week. So you'll be seeing very 200 comedians they're out New York City performing at different clubs including parents Carolina I'm Bradley is about something that people should be looking towards him. Flat at elevated we actually do better as Atlanta Tuesday and as well I would can't wait for that actually when it. Funeral a little bit over Dave I appreciate that they would get some veterans who are right here who we're gonna grab students work. Republican began this night it all at home and then again we are alive. The red carpet here in Madison square garden and Bob brings special coverage of stand up for heroes again the twelve year for this incredible event presented by Bob Woodruff foundation in the New York comedy festival. And as we step before and we can't see it enough that this benefits goes both not eleven impacted veterans. And their families and it raises funds and awareness and support the foundation and a godsend right LA. I just can't eat good and as you so much of digital yeah yeah let me say that first offense again. What was that like to hear tonight yeah. It's it's amazing we can imagine being on this platform. And help our the problem. Woodruff foundation being able to and our own nonprofit project summary a lot there. This is just an amazing guy. We never expected that. Talk a bit more about project unbreakable because I think it's such an important organization that you guidelines that just like to hear you kind of talk about. How it came to be Evans. Where you're at now. So we came across unbreakable back in 2015. Alone and we're small it's just turn I would do work. Now we do my home wearing a suicide prevention for military veterans and first responders. Our one of the very few nonprofits to incorporate first responders are simply because it's. Alone not to mention in effect in 2005 my dad was a police officer and upstate New York when he years. Concert is and why so it's it's personal for us. And Jim was a police officer for yours well so we just want to make sure there were able to get out there and save lives that way you know. Families don't have to go to. We wanted to. I'm curious when it comes to matters we know there can be shy about talking. There's so that's. But it really we think stand up for heroes and hero within through words and IP. Doesn't really to describe the sacrifices that are made by this one that can get pretty close. When it's when we talk about service and those were still impacted and so living way. You'll often ran into war and mental health issues. Are yet obviously traumatic brain trauma. About the needs for those veterans. All right now as far as mental health on investments we need so much fun being just by the stigma that we're going to be receiving. And now only eight hits are not enough health care providers but ones that history specifically veterans who have experience kind of stuff. We're just hire bears upstairs over counseling. Because we've experienced those things it's. About values proved effective community be hidden for counseling. And we're like to see projects unbreakable at 510 years. Home as of right now you know are our five year plan is. Just it to be owl and Jane is much traction as we possibly can. You know whether it's still just her night getting out there on a platform. Saying hey there's a real problem pants. We need to address it now. You know that's that's one of our biggest thing is getting now speaking against the stigma that is so strong in the backs in the first commuter first responders communities. And so you know we're gonna push this. As as far as we possibly can. And who knows five years ten years from now hopefully will be known nationally nationwide end will be fairly big like the Bob Woodruff foundation. We'll where we're happy to help you with bat and that could give as much publicity to that it's possible again. I can means anything the organization of what we're gonna help you will get more from me synagogue or. Kimberly and Justin eight. I just unbreakable dollar and yeah. Again anyway so I do this call really happy I donate half very lucky to see it right Diane. To be in the position we got the we've got to meet air germs aren't you that was that was pretty much our. We were looking forward to meeting so we live now. Ridiculous it would Springsteen thing I'm looking forward to that as well I mean he's the boss yeah along the lines of. Marketing your church actually met hers bracing for the first time in days and together for a little wow yeah. Yes wow all right Williams already has the whole show you down.

Bob Woodruff foundation app is other reasons as well yeah you're back hoping to move on with this benefit and it's just incredibly inspirational yeah. And the Bob Woodruff foundation is it's really interesting because I mean it's been around for over about twelve year high price data for here's been around for talk here is that they hop. All kinds of organizations all kinds of nonprofits like project unbreakable that we just saw so let's. Let's bring him. I go third nice to meet cannot move with ABC news. Com thinks it will join us really appreciated so. Called him at that ABC news as well they say yes. So a lot of them we're going to be here and have you been to the civil war now serves as my very first time you fill it.

Does the battering here in the spring keep arrest court and we US army. Veteran thank you for your service odd couple of the bonds are fanned out with a report. Well I served since 2001 it's 2015. Being deployed to our bags and 2005 week we've got hit by an idea to get back home to preliminarily 2006 and sadly similar. More and alienation for veterans out there says that guy needs to a suicide attack word. I spent over thirty hours seem to beta and yeah 2800. Interest so who might be coming back from their deployment. Do you have any advice for that matter you know resources that you what what would you say to them for someone who might have been and decision seems situation they re yeah. Just three child there's many people and. Looking to see how they can help the veterans can meaning. And leaving cars and other champions and you're not alone and there's a lot of people out there. Manages its long odds we have to sad fact that we need help and Gaza hardest part because. Coming up someone else. You've benefit benefited from programs that help veterans. One I think wanted to hear the missing continues and I'm did was the mission continues it was that benefited by the Bob Woodruff foundation are part of it. Yes indeed Bob Woodruff foundation are our sponsor on the platoon leader effort. Put Regan. Michigan seniors first continues in it's been an amazing journey so hard on the island and yes. Then when you think about everything that you experience and overcome. What does it need continued to be here tonight at an event that's honoring them. Wow better so I would say it's its armaments and it's time that people needs to understand that and not because I'm a veteran. Wars I meant to leave you today as civilians. We shared. A lot more that we and we have to end up and finished with this thing. Right now we're not crazy and we're just going through artery of the heart heart trusses that won't leave those who went through that. Nails and let me tell you this fashion. 90%.

The fighting occurred \"over a 35-minute period\" and involved at least six children, police said. Video shows that the children wore oversized gloves on their hands when they were fighting.\n\nNicole Merseal\n\n\"At one point during the video, Guliford, while watching the children fight, can be seen jumping up and down with excitement,\" police said in a statement.\n\nOne child who was encouraged to fight, \"suffered red marks and swelling on his face and forehead\" as well as a black eye, according to police.\n\nThe St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said neither Guliford nor Dailey were currently in custody.\n\nCourt records do not show that the two woman have attorneys yet and they have not given public statements. Records also show that the women were issued a summons on Monday, have not made a plea, and are not due back in court until next month.\n\nNicole Merseal told ABC News in an interview that in December of 2016 her then-4-year-old son was encouraged to fight another child by Guliford and Dailey at the Adventure Learning Center. She filed a lawsuit over the incident .\n\nSt. Louis Metropolitan Police Department\n\nMerseal accused the day care center of directing a \"fight club\" in court documents, and permitting another child \"to intimidate and harm\" her son.\n\n\"My son was very afraid,\" Merseal told ABC News. \"He didn't understand why his best friends beat him up. These are children that he's been around for a couple years. He described them as his best friends. He just doesn't understand why they punched him in the face. ... I don't know any parent that could watch their children go through this and not be upset.\"\n\nMerseal said her two older sons who were at the day care center witnessed the incident.\n\nSt. Louis Metropolitan Police Department\n\nWhen the teachers did not stop the children fighting in December 2016, one of her older sons took a video of the incident on his iPad and sent it to his mother, Merseal's attorney, Jennifer Hansen, told ABC News.\n\n\"When I got the video, I was just in complete shock. I immediately left work,\" Merseal said. \"I also called the day care immediately and told them to go stop the fighting.\"\n\nIn documents released by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services , Jennifer Scott, the director of the center, said that Guliford told her the children \u201cwere bored\" and \"we ran out of things to do,\u201d according to documents.\n\nScott said she then sent Guliford and Dailey home, called the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline and completed an incident report, according to the state's documents. Guliford and Dailey were then fired.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said they received information about the incident from the day care on Dec. 8, 2016.\n\nDocuments show that two unidentified children were interviewed and said the teachers had allowed them to play with \"Hulk Hands,\" large, green gloves, and fight each other.\n\n\u201cIt happened a lot of times,\u201d one unidentified child said, according to the report.\n\nGuliford also admitted to having the kids fight, according to state documents, saying, \"I meant for the fighting with the Hulk Hands to be a stress release exercise.\"\n\n\u201cIt did not last more than three or four minutes...No children got hurt but it was still a bad judgment call on my part,\u201d Guliford said, adding she had taken the children to the lower floor of the building because of a broken heating system on the other floors.\n\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services conducted an investigation upon learning of the incident, according to a statement released by the agency to ABC News. Charges were not filed at the time.\n\n\"The Section for Child Care Regulation\u2019s report concluded that licensing rules were violated and requested that the facility take additional steps to ensure staff were trained and knowledgeable about age-appropriate activities for children. The facility completed the corrective measures in April 2017,\" the department said.\n\nMerseal is seeking $25,000 in damages in a civil suit against the facility.\n\nABC News' attempts to reach the day care center, Scott, Guliford and Dailey were unsuccessful.", "By the end of Monday there will be 5,200 active duty service members serving along the border in what is officially a support mission to Customs and Border Protection (CBP), but on the eve of the mid-term election President Trump continues to play the deployment as a campaign issue.\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\n\"I noticed all that beautiful barbed wire going up today,\" Trump said at a Montana campaign rally on Sunday. \"Barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight.\"\n\nAlfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe president was referring to active duty soldiers placing concertina wire near a Texas border crossing over the weekend. The move was in line with the support mission to Customs and Border Protection being provided by U.S. Northern Command.\n\nBut on Monday Trump made it sound as if the active-duty troops assigned to Operation Faithful Patriot would play a more visible role.\n\n\"Barbed wire looks like it's going to be very effective, too, with soldiers standing in front of it,\" Trump told a campaign rally in Cleveland.\n\nBut Operation Faithful Patriot is intended to be a mission where the active duty troops are only to provide support for CBP since they are forbidden by federal law to carry out law enforcement duties.\n\nGen. Joseph Dunford restated the mission's intent in remarks at Duke University on Monday evening.\n\n\"There is no plan for U.S. military forces to be involved in the actual mission of denying people entry to the United States,\" said Dunford. \"There is no plan for the soldiers to come in contact with immigrants or to reinforce the Department of Homeland Security as they are conducting their mission. We are providing enabling capability.\"\n\nTo that end, engineering and construction units will build vehicle barriers and fencing along the points of entry along the border, as well as build temporary housing for CBP personnel being sent to the border, Helicopter units are also being deployed to transport CBP personnel to hard to reach border areas, officials said.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman said Monday that the laying of concertina wire was in line with the mission to help CBP \"plug gaps\" at ports of entry along the border.\n\n\"They tell us what points are vulnerable,\" said Col. Rob Manning.\n\nSpc. Hosannah Vickery\n\nPresident Trump last week also backtracked on comments that raised questions about when military forces might be authorized to shoot their weapons.\n\n\u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military is going to fight back \u2026 we will consider that a firearm\u201d he had said on Thursday.\n\nTrump changed his stance the following day.\n\n\"They do that with us, they're going to be arrested, there's going to be problems. I didn't say shoot. I didn't say shoot. But they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time. We will arrest them,\u201d he told reporters who had asked for clarification.\n\nThe Pentagon acknowledges that military service members have the right of self-defense, but does not make public the standards for the use of force other than to say they are proportional.\n\nCol. Manning declined to discuss a hypothetical situation with reporters on Monday. However, he clarified that only military policemen would be armed along the border as they provide force protection to other military units.\n\nThe Pentagon estimates that by the end of Monday there will be 5,200 active duty forces in Arizona, California and Texas with that number rising to more than 7,000 in coming days.\n\nThe majority of the forces are currently in Texas where 2,600 service members have arrived over the last week, there are 1,100 service members in Arizona and California respectively.\n\nThose numbers will rise to more than 7,000 over coming days.\n\nConstruction units have begun building temporary tent housing for military units at some of the large bases serving as staging areas.\n\nSpc. Keion Jackson\n\nLast week, President Trump described \"massive cities of tents\" being built by the military that he said would house migrants seeking asylum. But military officials emphasized that the temporary tents were only to house additional CBP personnel being sent to the border.\n\nHowever, ABC News has learned that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had made an initial request to the Pentagon \u201cto hold\u201d migrants seized along the border in tent structures, according to a U.S. official.\n\nThe initial DHS request was not accepted early on by the Pentagon and was not forwarded up the chain of command for approval.\n\nThe official noted that the request was different than a previously approved DHS request from earlier this year to house migrant families further along in the immigration process, on military bases.\n\nReuters was first to report that the Pentagon had balked at the initial request from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nAsked about the Reuters report Manning declined to comment on internal deliberations between the Department of Defense \"and our interagency partners\". Captain Bill Speaks, another Pentagon spokesman added, \"we have not received a request from DHS to build facilities to house migrant families.\"\n\nTrump said last week he plans to build tents to house migrants, who would be held in those facilities while the U.S. government weighs their asylum request.\n\nManning also clarified that Military Police (MP's) will be the only active duty forces to be armed during the operation. MP units have been assigned to the border mission to provide force protection to the units that will be providing logistical support to CBP.\n\nThere is still no official cost estimate made public for the 45-day mission, but Manning said the Defense Department will \"absorb\" the costs of the operation.\n\n\u201cThe costs are being determined by our Comptroller and when we are in a position to provide them, we will do that,\u201d said Manning.", "Transcript for Single mother in Iowa comes forward as Powerball winner\n\nFinally tonight here, it's always nice when the person who wins one of those giant jackpots seems so deserving.

There are more women running for office than ever before, early voting totals are shattering midterm records and Democrats are working against the odds to take back control of the House.\n\nABC News\u2019 Political Director Rick Klein and Chief White House and Washington Correspondent Jon Karl spoke with Deputy Political Director MaryAlice Parks and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran about what to expect on Tuesday on this week's Powerhouse Politics Podcast.\n\nTopics like health care, immigration and tax reform have dominated debates and national rhetoric. The true test, though, will be if Democrats can garner enough support for voters to show up at the polls.\n\nEarly voting totals have been historically high for a midterm and voter registration has been up among minorities and youth voters, which could help Democrats in Texas, namely Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is running to unseat incumbent GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nReuters, FILE\n\n\u201cWhat can we learn, if anything, about where this vote is coming from? Just even the fact of it being so much, is it simply a matter that early votes have expanded?\u201d Karl asked.\n\n\u201cEarly voting has surpassed total vote from four years ago,\u201d Parks said. \u201cTexas, you have to remember, was 50 out of 50 in voter turnout four years ago. They could only go up ... but we don\u2019t know where these ballots are going.\u201d\n\nTurnout isn\u2019t just high for Democrats. Unusually steep totals for Republicans, Democrats and Independents have surged this year, all propelled by voting for or against President Trump and his policies.\n\n\u201cThis is not a conventional moment, so conventional wisdom doesn\u2019t seem right for this moment. There\u2019s so many things that are pushing this in unconventional ways,\u201d Klein said. \u201cPart of it is the engagement of voters that traditionally haven\u2019t been engaged before. Part of it is President Trump, part of it is the fact that he has a strong economy to run on -- that\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis first midterm, at this check-in moment, to have these different forces converge in different ways, to have the different loud landscape for the House and the Senate. It really stretches our ability to look into the future, because all we can do in looking at polls and making forecasts is what\u2019s happened in the past,\u201d Klein said.\n\nUnusual events which have dominated national attention, such as the contentious confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh, have allowed Trump to re-frame the election, Moran said. The #MeToo movement, health care and immigration issues all touch on how many Americans see themselves reflected in politics.\n\nJeff Roberson/AP\n\n\u201cI think he changed the election so that now it\u2019s a verdict, yes, on him and his performance in office, but more on what he stands for and how he\u2019s trying to move American politics from a less pragmatic perspective to these issues of identity,\u201d Moran said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the American voters are going to deliver their verdict on.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Americans are still looking for major changes, and Democrats have been able to argue that they are the outsiders, Parks said. Some of these candidates are running in suburban districts which have historically been red. Those races may give Democrats the margins they need to flip the House blue.\n\n\u201cWill Donald Trump have cost Republicans this slice of the electorate for a long time, because of the way they\u2019ve engaged suburban voters, women voters primarily, college-educated white people that for a long time have had their instincts on the Republican side,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWe know that Trump is going to do well, and the Republicans are going to do well in deep-red parts of the country...but it\u2019s remarkable to me how you can look across the map and say this could be a wave.\u201d\n\nEvery Wednesday, ABC Radio and iTunes bring you the Powerhouse Politics Podcast which includes headliner interviews and in-depth looks at the people and events shaping U.S. politics.

Reporter: The Republican then taking aim at Gillum, pointing to the feds looking into corruption in Tallahassee. The fact of the matter is, he has not served honorably as the mayor. Reporter: The other big race in the senate, the incumbent Democrat bill Nelson facing a tough challenge from Republican governor Rick Scott, who's maintained president trump's support, despite their differences on several key issues. And tonight, new polls just out in Florida show both Democrats with a slight lead. But it's all about turnout, and the party that wins Florida gets an influential advantage looking ahead to 2020.

We're on the eve of a crucial midterm election here in America. The polls razor thin tonight, and president trump knows it. Telling supporters, pretend I'm on the ballot. In so many ways, this will be a referendum on the president. The stakes are enormous. And just take a look at what will be decided, as we bring the capitol to life right here in our studio tonight. All 435 seats in the house are up for voting, and 35 seats in the senate. That's a little more than a third of the senate up for grabs. Voters in 36 states will elect governors. And two numbers to watch as we head into election night. 23 seats in the house, that's what Democrats need to take back control. They also need two seats in the senate, if they want to take control there, but that's going to be a very difficult task. With so many Democrats playing defense, trying to keep their jobs, up for election in states president trump won. It's impossible to predict, of course, how this will go, but look at this tonight. At least 36 million Americans have already voted in early voting this midterm, that dwarfs the last midterm at this point, just 20 million voted then. The energy, the interest enormous this time around. Tonight, the key raceses, where it's a fight to the finish. It is so close. And president trump now on his final push, knowing all of this will reflect on him. ABC's chief white house joernt Jonathan Karl leading us off tonight. Reporter: Urged by party leaders to focus on what they think is his strongest selling point, president trump is now talking up jobs and the economy. Republicans have created the best economy in the history of our country. Reporter: But the core of the president's closing argument is not hope, it's fear -- dark warnings about illegal immigration. Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan -- isn't that nice? -- Of illegal aliens to flood into our country and overwhelm your communities. Reporter: There's no evidence Democrats having anything to do with the caravans of migrants fleeing violence and poverty, and they are more than 600 miles from the border. You think we're letting that caravan come into this country? You can forget it. Reporter: And now, just hours before polls open, the president is raising the specter of a stolen election. There are a lot of people, a lot of people, in my opinion, and based on proof, that try and get in illegally and actually vote illegally. Reporter: But there's been no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and the president hasn't offered any. In fact, in 2016, \"The Washington post\" could only find four documented cases in the entire presidential election. President Obama, stumping for Democrats, has taken aim at president trump's falsehoods. Unlike some people, I don't just make stuff up when I'm talking. I got facts to back me up. Reporter: President trump is drawing large and enthusiastic crowds, but he's acknowledges anything can happen tomorrow. But who knows, right? Who knows? You've got to get out to vote. But who knows, the president says. He seems to know that anything can happen tomorrow night. Jon Karl with us here tonight. The president clearly knows this is a referendum on him. Reporter: Well, he's been explicit about it. Vote for me as if I'm on the ballot. A fascinating interview that just came in he did with Sinclair broadcasting, he was asked if he had any regrets over the past two years, and he said, quote, I would say tone. I would like to have had a softer tone. And he added, he maybe had no choice because of how Democrats were talking about him, but he added again, I could have been softer. Tone on the eve of the election. Reporter: Especially given the way he's ending this campaign. Jon, thank you.

ABC's Steve osunsami and so many of our teams out across the country tonight. Steve has the state of the race in Georgia. Reporter: Democrat Stacey Abrams' final pitch to become the nation's first black female governor has her getting out the vote in rural Georgia tonight. If every eligible Georgian in the state votes, then we will win this election. Reporter: If she wins tomorrow, Democrats everwhere will be studying her campaign, because Abrams has been preaching to the Progressive choir, talking gun control and subsidized health care, not at all trying to convince hard conservatives. And she has no worries bringing in out of towners like Oprah Winfrey to knock on doors. They said, \"I have her cell number.\" I go, \"Give it to me.\" I'm going to call her up right now. So I called Stacey Abrams, and I said, \"Stacey, this is Oprah.\" You know what she said? She said, \"Girl, let me pull over to the side of the road.\" Reporter: Republican Brian Kemp has the blessing of the president. This race is a battle for the soul of our state. Reporter: Kemp is ignoring repeated calls for him to resign from his day job as secretary of state, where he supervises state elections. Over the weekend, Kemp, in his official role, launched an investigaton into state Democrats, accusing them of hacking into state voter registrations without any evidence. I'm not worried about how it looks. I'm doing my job. He is abusing his power. He is both the candidate, he is the elector and he's the guardian of the system. That is wrong. Reporter: Abrams says Kemp's office is still sitting on thousands of registrations from minority voters. And Steve osunsami joins us live tonight from Atlanta. And Steve, this is a close election, might not end tomorrow night, in fact. Reporter: Yes, there's a very real possibility of a runoff election. To win tomorrow, someone has to get to 50% of the vote, and there is a third candidate, a libertarian candidate in this race. And right now, this race is very, very tight. If no one wins a simple majority, a runoff will be scheduled in December. David? All right, huge stakes on both sides. Steve, thank you.

Reporter: Tonight, it's a fight to the finish in Texas, as voters decide if this deep red state will turn purple. The two senate candidates both in their 40s, one ran for president, the other could run one day. Senator Ted Cruz and three-time congressman Beto O'rourke could not be more different. Overnight, we were with Cruz in his final push. You look at the Texas economy right now. The economy is booming. We've got the lowest unemployment rate in 49 years. And I think Texans understand, why would we want to screw that up? Reporter: And Beto O'rourke with a new ad, traveling to all 254 counties, documenting it on his iPhone. This our chance, Texas, to lead this country. America has never been more divided, never been more polarized. Reporter: More people have already voted than the total that voted in the last midterm. Do you think that early voter momentum is leaning your way? I do. Reporter: And with president trump focused on the images of the caravan, so is Cruz. Security is on the ballot tomorrow. Reporter: You say you want to secure the borders, can you do that without a wall, can you do that without militarizing the border? We don't need a wall. We don't need to militarize the border. Reporter: O'rourke says we need immigration reform. It is precisely at that moment that Texas stands up, not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans, as human beings, to rewrit this country immigration laws in our own image. Paula, we know that Beto O'rourke is from El Paso. He likes to talk about the safety of El Paso, with all this talk of the caravans. Reporter: That's right, David. And the Mexican border is just a half mile from where we are. O'rourke tells me that the city of El Paso has been one of the safest cities in 20 years. As for senator Cruz, he's making his closing arguments tonight, David, a main theme will be border security. David? All right, big race in Texas, Paula.

It's time to say to Claire Mccaskill, you are fired. Reporter: Mccaskill's counting on one issue to save her seat -- health care. Josh Hawley will always protect pre-existing conditions. Reporter: In fact, as Missouri's attorney general, Hawley joined a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare that would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Health care is one of those top issues for Missouri voters, but Hawley is counting on the president's last-minute swing through this state to put him over the top. David?

For Democrats to take control of the house, they need 23 seats. It's a big if, but if they're able to pull that off, what are the three things you'll be watching? Reporter: Democrats are going to put the trump administration under an intense microscope. The first thing I'm watching, the investigations. They are going to demand to see president trump's tax returns. They're going to dig into conflicts of interest to questions about possible Russia collusion. Second thing to keep an eye on, Robert Mueller. Democrats are likely to take steps to try to protect the special counsel. The third issue is impeachment. Don't expect Democrats to bring that up much. They want to see what the special counsel has discovered. They want to know what Robert Mueller has. In the meantime, if Democrats pull this off in the house, much harder in the senate, so many democratic senators defending their seats in red seats that trump won, but in the house, it's not a guarantee it would be madame speaker with Nancy Pelosi. Reporter: Many candidates have already said they will not support her.

He faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison, according to the statement.\n\nBennett, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Australia, had claimed that Hellman fell from the 40-foot catamaran while they were sailing. He was arrested in February in Miami and charged with murder after the FBI found evidence that discredited his story. The couple has a 1-year-old daughter together.\n\nFind Isabella/Facebook\n\nThe couple set sail on their honeymoon aboard a vessel named \"Surf Into Summer\" from St. Maarten in April 2017, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nOn May 14, 2017, the newlyweds departed Cuba for Florida on the catamaran, and about 8 p.m. that evening, Bennett had Hellman take control of the vessel for the night watch but did not instruct her to wear a life jacket, harness or personal locator beacon, the statement read.\n\nBennett, who was asleep in a cabin below deck, was awoken by a loud noise early the next morning, and when he climbed onto the exterior of the boat, he saw that the sails and rigging were loose but his wife was not there, according to officials.\n\nHe couldn't remember if he had called out to Hellman, but he did not deploy flares to illuminate the area to look for her or to signal his position in the open water for safety or recovery, the statement read. Bennett also did not search for Hellman, either with the catamaran or a dinghy, and did not activate any emergency equipment or use the satellite phone to signal or call for help, officials said.\n\n\"Bennett ultimately abandoned the vessel and boarded the life raft,\" the statement read.\n\nBroward Sheriff\n\nBefore he boarded the raft, he loaded various items onto it, including a suitcase, two duffel bags, a backpack, water, unexpended parachute flames, a radio transmitter, buoys, food and silver coins, according to the DOJ.\n\nBennett told investigators he gathered his personal belongings when he noticed that the vessel was taking on water, according to a criminal complaint filed when he was arrested.\n\nHe is an \"experienced sailor\" and had received certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a coastal skipper, the training of which includes instruction on emergency procedures, such as man overboard protocols and night sailing safety, officials said. Hellman was not trained in emergency sailing procedures and had \"substantially less sailing experience,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Bennet also had hands-on sailing experience on the open water for extended periods of time, including a three-month voyage from St. Maarten to Australia,\" officials said.\n\nWhen Bennett left the catamaran, it and the attached dinghy were \"inoperable,\" the DOJ said, adding that it has evidence from expert testimony \"that the catamaran was intentionally scuttled.\"\n\nU.S. Coast Guard District 7, FILE\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard received an emergency alert from Bennett when he was about 26 nautical miles west of Cay Sal Bank in the Bahamas, officials said.

He also raised suspicions when asking the Coast Guard for a \"letter of presumed death\" on the day they called off the search for her, according to the complaint.\n\nThe day Bennett was arrested was the same day Hellman's parents and sisters sent a letter to a federal judge complaining that he had kept them away from the couple's daughter, Emilia.\n\n\"We do not want to say anything bad about Lewis, but we would like him to know how much it hurts us not to be able to see and spend time with our granddaughter and niece, Emilia, since he took her out of the country,\" the family wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News. \"Lewis knows that Isabella's mother was very much involved in caring for Emilia from the time of her birth here in Florida until she was lost at sea.\"\n\nFederal officials said Bennett will now be held accountable for his wife's death.\n\n\"Although nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett\u2019s criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant\u2019s admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim, Ms. Isabella Hellman, and her family,\" Orshan said. \"The federal government remains committed to the safety and security of our U.S. citizens, whether they are at home in South Florida or traveling on the high seas.\"\n\nIn November, Bennett pleaded guilty to unrelated charges of transporting $5,000 in gold and silver coins, according to the complaint.\n\nABC News could not immediately reach Bennett's federal public defender, Vanessa Chen, for comment.\n\nThe Hellman family plans to speak at Bennett's sentencing, their attorney, Mitchell Kitroser, told the Sun Sentinel.\n\nABC News' Michael Edison Hayden, Bill Hutchinson and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.", "Transcript for DNA, genetic genealogy led police to suspected killer in Maryland cold case\n\nFor nearly a decade policing and a run of county were stopped by a fatal shooting that left more than its fair share of evidence no killer.

He faces a maximum eight-year prison sentence in the May 2017 disappearance of Isabella Hellmann, his wife of just three months. U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno set sentencing for Jan. 10.\n\n\"Although nothing can ever erase the pain and suffering caused by Lewis Bennett's criminal acts, the U.S. Attorney's Office and our law enforcement partners hope that the defendant's admission of guilt is a step toward justice for the victim,\" U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan said in a statement.\n\nBennett, a mining engineer, had told the FBI and British journalists that he and Hellmann, a South Florida real estate agent, took their 37-foot (11-meter) catamaran, Surf Into Summer, for a Caribbean cruise. They left their infant daughter, Emelia, with her family in Florida.\n\nAs the catamaran passed the Bahamas on the return to Florida, Bennett sent out an emergency radio signal. When the Coast Guard found him on a life raft three hours later, he told rescuers he left Hellmann on deck as he retired for the night to their cabin. He said he was jolted awake when their craft hit something and that Hellmann was gone when he went outside. He said he abandoned the catamaran in a life raft because it was sinking.\n\nA sworn document signed by Bennett and filed in court says that he could not recall whether he called out for his wife. He did not deploy any flares and did not search for Hellmann in the water with either the catamaran or an attached dinghy. Nor did Bennet immediately activate any emergency equipment or call for help using his satellite phone.\n\nIt was not until Bennett boarded the life raft that he called for help and reported his wife missing, about 45 minutes after he was awakened.\n\nProsecutors said Bennett is an experienced sailor who received a certification from the Royal Yachting Association in the United Kingdom as a \"Coastal Skipper.\" The training included instruction on emergency procedures such as man-overboard protocols and night-sailing safety. His wife was not nearly as experienced.\n\nThe Coast Guard eventually located the boat. The FBI says an inspection of the catamaran before it sank showed portholes below the waterline had been opened and damage to the twin hulls appeared to have been caused from the inside, meaning the boat may have been intentionally scuttled.\n\nAlso investigators found Bennett on the life raft with $100,000 worth of coins stolen from a yacht he had worked aboard in 2016.\n\nBennett pleaded guilty to the coin theft charge and received a seven-month prison sentence. While serving that sentence, he was charged in February with Hellmann's death and has remained jailed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt", "___\n\nFed likely to keep rates on hold and sketch a bright outlook\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With the economy strong, wages rising and unemployment at a near-five-decade low, the Federal Reserve remains on track to keep raising interest rates \u2014 just not this week.

Team room New York edition final countdown to Election Day great to have you with us today and joined by the political brain trusts of ABC news political director Rick Klein deputy political director. Ellison parks in the great Matt Dowd is here at ABC news theater great to have you guys all with us. Here we are the final hours everybody is anxiously awaiting. And to be results tomorrow the record turnout already in the early vote. I'm one of the places that were most closely watching. Is Georgia. That's worst evo since Johnny has been on the trail in this final stretch the governor's race there. One of the hottest of the season and Steve and there has been a dramatic twist again. In this race over voting rights and allegations of voter suppression and now. Allegations of hacking and bring us up to speed on on the latest and that. That twist in that race. So that the current secretary of state Brian camp is also running for governor on Saturday. Announced that he believes that the Democratic Party hacked into state. Voter rolls but were unsuccessful he gave very little evidence about how that happened but it was a giant accusation. Which the Democrats deny 100%. And accuse. Cam actually trying to pull off a political stunt. Two G and the Republican Party. Just hours now before the election camp. Went further than just the accusation saying that he's now contacted. The FBI to investigate this. We've reached out to federal authorities they are not confirming that they're looking into this at this point and have no comment but it's a huge. Accusation that's coming just hours now before the election and it's got everyone talking about whether or not this is true. SI understand it how this happened was a voter who identified a vulnerability. With the state web site. Notified democratic Democrat party officials who then shared this with the secretary of State's office. And somehow this became the Democratic Party trying to hack into state voter rolls. At the rally that camp appeared out with the president yesterday south of Atlanta and Macon Georgia neither of the two made any mention of this. And I will say DeVon there's one point that we have to underline and all of this criticism against. The secretary of state they are he is facing mounting pressure to resign or at least step aside from this election. Because during his day job his official duty is to monitor. Elections which people here on both sides actually say is of huge conflict of interest and saves. Casey Abrams the Democrat was on Good Morning America this morning she said this whole thing is cooked. Op. At the last minute certainly. Smells of politics on both sides in these back and forth that allegations. What's your read there you've been a longtime Georgia resident. Of how this is playing with voters is they've many of the Marty made up their minds and will giving this have any impact. I think it will I actually and I think it's working I think that. What we're seeing in this election here which we haven't seen as much in previous elections for governor. Is he you have both sides speaking to their base. Preaching to the choir. And what Brian camp has done in this whether or not these accurate accusations are true or not which they do. Appear to be somewhat manipulated. Putting it kindly. Is that many of his supporters will be more motivated to vote because of this. There is also a flip side to this point something that was spread around over the weekend there were these racist robo calls. That were sent into voters' homes over the weekend. Making fun of Oprah Winfrey who was here last week. Campaigning for Abrams. One of them referring to her as aunt Jemima. Those robo calls are indeed fact those did happen and they have the same net effect in terms of their influence on voters here. On each side is trying to get their voters to the polls this is about turnout. And one of that one of the one of the campaigns over the weekend had a conference call where they shared. That about six they believe about 65%. Of Democrats have voted so far and early voting and about 55%. Of Republicans. This is all about turnout the polls right now put this as a very close race within the margin of various bearer whoever gets the most voters to the polls. Of their people get more of their people to doubles the polls on Tuesday wins. Artsy but since Tommy we know you be stand on the case tomorrow night and are part of our live team coverage thank you so much Steve for that report. That I was struck it was in Georgia yesterday with the president. And struck how much this race he's. Is racially tinged it's in all the conversation you have with voters on both sides. I'm happy to be at the trump rally for most the day also talked to some Democrats and all of them. Brought up the issue of race in this debate. Well this is that state it's obviously from the old confederacy that has changed on the history if that but it's changed dramatically in the course of the last twenty years and it's now a state. If it's not purple yet it's getting to purple which is why this race has become incredibly competitive and the difference between Atlanta and the suburbs in the rest. The state is dramatic I mean it's speaking directly to this I mean this would to me is the definition of a conflict of interest the guy camp runs this state elections. He makes this allegation of in from a place where he actually runs from about a race. For the chief executive of the state that he's running for. Come seems completely conflicted than. It's not just the the voting system he oversees malice but you've been covering these voter registrations 50000 of them that have been put on hold and. It's worth pointing out that so a mat saying he's the referee as well as one team. And he's the one that should have any evidence of an issue and yet he's not producing any evidence he's just making an accusation and that I think is not gonna go over very well. But I but what's a thinner at the end it seems a little bit. Tried and true and it's all I cannot turn out but it's really true and George up because she hasn't run to the middle. Seizing arms is not trying to win over moderates are Republicans she's trying to build out the party in Georgia and bring new Democrats in the table. Yet and I think. When you see in this race and a handful of others just a clear dissolution of the choices. The president has gone out and run a very misleading campaign to try to frame choices and false ways I actually think in George up. Florida and Texas you're seeing a clean contrast presented by the candidates themselves than. That offer that often that route is raise the stakes of what we already know is going to be a record smashing election. And this and keep in mind that this it I mean obviously this is a very close race that we're all going to be watching tomorrow night because of the historic. If CC a reverse to African American governor to win Maris but it's going to be incredibly close and it we may go into a runoff if neither side gets 50%. But there's also had some key can grab a key congressional race that that even if she loses by virtue of her turnout may have changed that race as well. A lot to watch in Georgia hey you know spending the day there as they were saying a lot of racially tinged conversation but also. A lot of focus on immigration among Republicans I was struck by. The number of Republicans said their top issue this election granted this is at a trump rally is the caravan in rural Georgia of all places. Thousands of miles from the border they were talking about the caravan. And that is were Marcus Moore is right now with these traveling migrants of poor and impoverished many Hondurans Mexicans traveling up to the US forward the president has made a part of this campaign Marcus. Out tell us where you are now and what's happening there today. Well DeVon good afternoon to you this caravan has made it to Mexico City the capital. Of this country and I just behind do you concede. The other people who are lined up to get booed here at this a sports complex. That has been turned into a shelter a refuge. For the up thousands of migrants have been in the midst of this out this caravan. This is an area where just last week they helped evict a Formula One race was that huge international event where thousands of people show up is also concerts that are held here. And Dick's sporting events and I bring that up. Because it is the place that cannot handle a lot of people. And we talk about this caravan we're talking literally about thousands of people who this afternoon. Have found refuge here at this out this exports complex in Kansas in Mexico City. And I wanted to get off in the distance there were people are getting clothing. This is where a lot of people have been. Recoup rating again and refreshments. And I do want to talk to a one of them migrants. Who we met along the way David Mendoza and he's from El Salvador and David. A you made it here to Mexico City yesterday. How how important and you thought it was to it to make it here to Mexico City and why. Oh I think this is really important for all look the people you because. Is the boat did did Disney where they can update. It about this because what you're gonna go to either to what border either to. You know tour saw Texas or California. Absolutely MM in Seoul as we've described this as a fork in the road this is where where people like David and families would decide. You know whether or not they will stay here in Mexico perhaps or continue north and I do want to askew Davis. I've heard that that that some people have heard some of the things the president trump has set and they also know about the soldiers at the border. And because of that they don't want to go to the US any more because they don't but like it will be safe. Is that is that how you feel or be used to wanna go to the. No no no I was already thinking in. Well when I got the party I knew that I wasn't gonna go back because I got punished for ten years. Somewhat the way the state you're here in Mexico. In and not because trump and the Marines in America's and that's because. No I want a father though what they told me you know the rules. About the way the ten years here Mexico. So you wanna do it the right way yes the legal that legal way via. And so so there you go a DeVon hearing from David thank you very much for your time appreciate it. And David one of the many of migrants who we've met along the way who says he wants to make it to the US but he wants to do the right way and because of the rules have to wait so are we here. Here to do that David thank you it's good to see you com. DeVon I want to Saudi around just a little bit because I can tell you that that the mood here is very different we've been to a number of towns where the Mike where the migrant. I caravan has come to a stop for the day. And here in Mexico City. It is much more relaxed if it is very column here. And much more festive if you will and we show you very quickly. No have a lot of time markets that you're doing let let me ask you if you can hear me they give us a sense of located on your Hoffa how far away are they from. From the US Texas border is that we talking days weeks months. We're yet we're talking. At the rate they've been going we're talking weeks dampened absolutely weeks. Companies whose properties in it was typical. Yes yes. We're talking weeks worth of about a thousand miles away from the nearest port of injury. Into the into the United States and that would be Texas on the Reynosa area the Holocaust. Let's take a look at what you can see around the but the people here does look somebody entertainment. That they are trying to give the out migrants here who have been in the midst of a very long journey. And out this the first I've seen of entertainment for the for the adults we've seen it DeVon for the children. And of it's certainly gives you a sense of this being a major milestone for them on this journey. And in fact you're asking about how far away they are from the US Mexico border there are people here who are thinking they'll stay in Mexico City here at this shelter. At least for the next few days as they figure out what their next steps will be and there are a number of agencies here to help them not figure that out. All right Marcus Moore force in Mexico traveling with the caravan of migrants thank you so much for that Marcus you've been under tremendous job down there. You know I'm struck by how much this is in our consciousness can headed into tomorrow and how quickly it seems almost everybody that watches politics closely thinks this will go away. After tomorrow and then in the conversation do you do you I buy that. This is this is only let the president simply is fixated on but but for the fact. Election Day is tomorrow there is I don't think there's any possible way troops would have been sent two months earlier seven weeks early to the border in order make some demonstration of strength. And the reality evidence as he it was shown. This is actually a humanitarian problem this isn't a invading. Group a horde of people with guns that are coming to storm the border it's a humanitarian problem that each country they pass through has tried to deal with in this. I actually think the calculation of political calculation. And Rick and I were just talking. We're not gonna know until tomorrow night as the results come in. But I think for every base voter that trump thinks by doing this he's Costa have more passion and go vote. He's actually offended. 22 independent voters by doing it because I think most of the independent voters in the country we're gonna decide this election look at this assays are poor people are starving people I don't see a criminal element. I don't see this. Let's treat them humanely this figure a way to secure our border do that we'll know tomorrow night but from my sense of things and watching the polls and all of that I see no. Movement to the present and movement to the Republicans in the course it. And speaking of tone in speaking of turning off independent voters women voters there is a new act that president from. Has been running that's been gaining some extraordinary blow back furry its treatment of immigrants let's take a look I think we just have. A little snip of it. About Nolan. The war. We have a lot of ads. And they certainly are effective based on the numbers that we're say. A lot of things are offensive. Your questions or offensive a lot of times I get out. And I think you seem. Do the two parties make a play to do two different Americas here at the close. They may both be right you can see the situation we're Democrats take the house Republicans holder to expand into joining the senate. Because of the same set of messaging because of the same president at the top of the ticket and because these issues hit. But as Matthew says it's a big gamble because we don't know what this electorates want to look like we think. We have we have some indications about it being younger and more diverts and larger than a typical ms. from electorate. But if we're talking about an election that the truly changes that connect plea to the base will not end up being a Smart one it's on its sacrifices of the house and may even jeopardize. Some other potential Republican pick ups in the senate. Speaking of public a program like I was gonna say Brad are scale who was the one in charge of this and who president Trump's campaign manager his campaign manager after 20/20. Who's never run a campaign before. Tweeted out this this afternoon saying he was offended by the fact that MSNBC NBC FaceBook and now Fox News won't run the ad. So I treated at him I say listen I don't I know you're not might not be familiar with this. But -- have to contain both facts and they can't be racist so in the future. You might want to do I respond decade he did respond Arafat from the but I think that's the problem is is is factually incorrect was both factually incorrect as they told the story that's fundamentally wasn't true about what the Democrats did or didn't do in this. And for most people are watch the and it felt. Clearly racist and one of the places that is tracking immigrant sentiment tracking the president's adds certainly is Texas. Everything's bigger in Texas I think in the turnout there certainly has been take a look at some of these graphics. About the turnout in Texas mats from Texas he can attest to this we have some of the numbers just in. Extraordinary. Levels of early voting they have surpassed. All of us to between fourteen the last mid term voting total total already in total total vote in early vote is exceeded total vote. In the voting continues our Paula Ferris is there she's been tracking. Voter turnout and of course that he senate race Ted Cruz better or worked for Democrat. Paula. There she is. Oh my on how do you feel the I don't like men against spots I'm in new York and you're standing in front of the lone star flag this you know right. I I actually feel like I'm CNN and the sun is so hot right now but you guys this is a hot race. And Matt you know this better than anybody any dis should've been a slam dunk race for tanker is this particular seat has been read. Since 1988. Or since Ted Cruz was seventeen. I'm not could indict any of us as to how well we were back in 1988 but. No tonight at the demographics are changing here. In the state of Texas I spoke with Ted Cruz and he's not taking anything for granted he believes that the momentum. Is on his side right now and he says he's confident that if his people show up to the polls. He will prevail take a lesson. I think momentum is very much with us mercy and record turn giant is great but we always an apartment to show they were ticked off. This election was all about. Ordinary text shown up don't know about some were seen. In and you look at that enthusiasm that the bedrooms person to deals which was seen all the tax system fair do you think that early voter momentum. Is leaning your way but I do. Tom this was all about getting. Texans to focus on this race and focus on the issues you know two months ago. Every other day we had these media profiles that were. Just puff pieces they were all puppy dogs and rains and in the last two months on the back till O'Rourke yes yes and an end and the national media was in love with. Because he was running hard left campaign is running away Bernie Sanders was born campaign. A lot of national borders Exide. But it's not what people texts can. Sick sick Devin you wrap up the numbers here the early voting numbers which today that the numbers are just mind boggling five million. What an early which surpassed the total amount and 2014 he would think that those numbers would lean towards that tell work he's running a really strong ground game. He's been president and campus says he's targeting young voters minority voters and a Tel 254. Counties I was surprised when I was. At the attack that Ted Cruz rally last that he talks about the enthusiasm. And I spoke to somebody overflow crowd he says this is the type of thing we're seen consistently at our rallies people can't get and since he said don't dismiss our enthusiasm and and I asked. Damn how many of them voted early take a listen. Our so as an alien act would happen. People. And a rally I'm talking probably fifty people out we haven't now here you go. Critics Ted Cruz rally could hear raise your hand if you voted early. All of a pretty much all of you voted early this. Okay why did you utterly. Don't mind a certain why did you what did you apparently does it. Mark words. Anger anybody else can't why did you vote early streets rails they should be loans. Right I used it Friday how many people have come to the polls early surprises in record numbers now. There's a lot on and each other's. That. And needs to candidates. Edu that they couldn't be any more different in personality and policy. Ted Cruz is going out there on the stock and he's preteen job security and freedom con verse late better O'Rourke. Is pre teen health care. Dreamers and no while A vis the guys are literally night and day different. But about O'Rourke was in Houston this morning he and has just and it running a breakneck speed he was at a rally. And he talked about the enthusiasm that were seen so far in terms of the early to Gillis and. In his stated she's in rent and did dead last in the country in order for now. Yeah where our democracy less than anyone else. After 100% on purpose behind us. The most alternative station. Kind of song we brought. Obama and congressional district solely based on their race or their ethnicity. Shenzhen. Those errors those obstacles remain short it counted at all. He's got up and he counted. So that was Houston now he's headed to Dallas and then tonight he's going to be here at a campus at bag you tap which says. Where is gonna hold his final rally as he makes his final push and then he's going to be watching the returns come in. That stadium here tomorrow night in Al paso as well but. I talk to both of these candidates. They're both exhausted they're ready to cross the finish cited both admit this taking a tour on their mailing me have young children and that as for Ted Cruz he's going to be watching those returns tomorrow ratings used and which is eleven hours awake. Matt Dowd I had no idea how large the status. By the way he really didn't give me any sort of forewarning if you if you listen country in an avid self. Yeah so paso in your car and drove to Beaumont it would take you eighteen hours. And it got this yeah. I don't. And that's some that's what's remarkable about the race and you can understand the pure exhaustion at these guys are feeling as at this point you know particularly bad overwork who has canvas and Criss cross its latest have a voice anywhere but tankers to me he's having. Safety town halls and just the last couple of weeks at these guys. Are gone for it. We'll see what happens my night. All right Paula Harrison Texas we know you're there to the finish Paula thank you so much for that it is it is extraordinary scene is playing out attacks you know. I admit my age just something TK because she said 198827. Years old then and I was running Lloyd Bentsen's campaign it was a Democrat. Was a Latin with took their one net seat then resigned to become. Bill Clinton's trip as secretary of treasury and that the last time that seeing what's behind this what's behind this turnout is in a better or effect does this trump a fact what what do you it has asked the whole environment I think it's AH I think it's a combination of a better off lights less trop. It's a better when Ted effect. And that Ted was always. Vulnerable in this race because after his presidential campaign his numbers were low in Texas he was vulnerable in a red state but a red state that's trending towards lighter red and ultimately. We'll be purple because of the growth in Latino population so it's ten was vulnerable. Because of how we spend perceived as state. But also expect -- run a campaign it's been aspiration only in many ways and turned on the question I think comes down to I think the race will be close I think it's still favors Ted. In this but I think it's going to be really close. Is ten Bechtel. He's gonna turn out a whole bunch of people into turmoil which in new people. Is can he get enough of them white vote in Texas in order overcome I can see you getting to 45% of the vote has bets or 46% of the vote. Can you get the last 45%. Of the vote. It's almost all going to be among white suburban mothers. The fascinating. To watch you know you're obese keeping your close eye and Texas tomorrow night meanwhile.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nIn the first of a three-state sprint to the midterm finish line, President Donald Trump continued his push for Republicans and demonizing of Democrats in Cleveland in an effort to mobilize his base on the eve of election day.\n\n\"Tomorrow, with your votes, you can stop the radical resistance in its tracks,\" Trump announced, adding that \"Tuesday is your chance to send a message to the Democrat mob and to everyone who has made it their mission to denigrate our movement and to divide our great nation.\"\n\nTrump supporters in the Buckeye state turned out in droves to hear the president's closing refrain before election day, as early voting figures across the country have already eclipsed 2014 totals in many states. But that didn't keep Trump, who has two more campaign stops in Indiana and Missouri tonight, from encouraging his supporters to get out to the polls.\n\n\"I remember with [my election], this is very much a Tuesday state. The people are sort of holding for Tuesday,\" Trump said after asking the audience whether they'd already voted. \"The midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didn't they? Who ever even heard of a midterm? Now they're, like, the hottest thing.\"\n\nOhioans overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016, so with Republicans facing a tough slate of gubernatorial, Senate, and House races this cycle, it's no surprise the president chose to be in Cleveland on his last day of campaigning. And if there was any doubt that this election is all about Trump, he made that clear.\n\n\"In a sense, I am on the ticket,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump heaped praise on Mike DeWine, the state's current attorney general and Republican candidate for governor, who is deadlocked in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Rich Cordray, the former director of President Obama's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. DeWine has sought to garner support from Trump's wing of the GOP while maintaining ties with a moderate block aligned with the state's current governor, John Kasich - a frequent critic of Trump.\n\nCarlos Barria/Reuters\n\n\"He's fighting, he's great,\" Trump said of DeWine, before turning his attention toward Cordray, who he called a \"bad guy.\"\n\n\"I know his opponent -- he\u2019s a bad guy, not a good person. He\u2019s hurt a lot of people. Cordray, a bad person who will do a terrible job,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nCordray, in a recent campaign ad, expressed a desire to do what's best for Ohioans.\n\n\"When President Trump does something that helps Ohio, I'll work with him,\" Cordray told viewers. \"But when he does something that hurts Ohio, I'll stand up to him. But Mike DeWine backs Donald Trump every single time, no matter what.\"\n\nIf Trump is trying to push DeWine over the goal line, his endorsement of Rep. Jim Renacci, a U.S. congressman challenging Democrat Sherrod Brown for a seat in the Senate, is nothing short of a Hail Mary. Polls suggest Renacci trailing Brown by a substantial figure, with 538 giving Renacci a 1 in 30 chance of winning.\n\nNevertheless, Trump hailed Renacci as \"a wonderful human being\" who has \"run a really good campaign,\" adding, \"it\u2019s not easy.\"\n\nIn addition to his kind words for Republicans on Ohio's ballot, Trump nailed his well-worn stump speech, highlighting the booming economy, bemoaning the migrant caravan and boasting of his successes in confirming two Supreme Court nominees.\n\nTrump spared a moment for his daughter, too, inviting Ivanka Trump onstage by joking with the audience that he isn't allowed to call her \"beautiful\" anymore.\n\n\"You\u2019re not allowed to use the word beautiful anymore - it\u2019s politically incorrect. So I\u2019m not allowed to say it. But she's really smart. It\u2019s my daughter Ivanka, and she\u2019s here!\" Trump announced.\n\n\"That was some introduction!\" Ivanka chided, before going on to highlight a laundry list of the administration's accomplishments.\n\nFrom Cleveland, the president takes Air Force One to Fort Wayne, Indiana, before closing out his 2018 campaign stretch in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Monday night.\n\nIndiana\n\nLess than three hours after leaving his rally in Ohio, President Trump took the stage before nearly 13,000 supporters in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the second of his three last-day stops to boost Republican midterm turnout.\n\nThough the penultimate event largely echoed the common rally theme of depicting Democrats as an obstructionist party trying to bring chaos, while crediting Republicans with bringing order through a strong economy and strong borders, in Fort Wayne the president took time to focus on Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\n\"Tomorrow the people of Indiana are going to send Mike Braun to the U.S. Senate,\" Trump said of the businessman-turned-candidate, adding later that it would be \"a vote to keep your family safe.\"\n\nBraun is running a tight race against Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly, this in a state where Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 19 points in 2016. The president implied Donnelly, whom he called \"an extreme liberal,\" has been pretending to support him to get votes.\n\nAaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\n\"He\u2019s gone rogue on the Democrats, he\u2019s gone rogue, because now he likes Trump a lot, he loves my border policy,\" the president said. \"There\u2019s one problem,\" he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the election tomorrow, and on Wednesday he\u2019ll be totally against us.\"\n\nDespite Donnelly's lean to the right on some issues including immigration and bank deregulation, former President Barack Obama came to Indiana the day before Trump to campaign for him. Former Vice President Joe Biden also made the trip to support the senator in October.\n\nEven before the high-profile visits from Trump and Obama, early voting in Indiana had surpassed its 2014 total, as it has in dozens of other states. Several attendees at the Fort Wayne rally told ABC News they voted early this cycle to be sure their preference for GOP candidates would be heard, citing the Kavanaugh confirmation as well as the state of the U.S. economy and foreign policy as motivation -- all factors that could just as well motivate Democratic voters.\n\nMidway through his talk, Trump surprised the crowd by inviting White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor Kellyanne Conway on stage.\n\n\"You'll have to forgive Kellyanne and I, we're maybe a little speechless -- we're not used to friendly crowds,\" Sanders said, to laughter from the crowd.\n\nSarah Sanders and Kellyanne Conway join Pres. Trump at campaign rally in Fort Wayne, Indiana. \"You'll have to forgive Kellyanne and I, we're maybe a little speechless. We're not used to friendly crowds,\" Sanders said. https://t.co/0SeyYkZhQ7 pic.twitter.com/XzM3NWubMS \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) November 5, 2018\n\nBoth women implored the audience to vote for Republican candidates, as Conway called the election a \"very personal\" matter for her.\n\n\"Elections have consequences, and your vote tomorrow is so incredibly important,\" Conway said. \"You've got to get everyone you know out to the polls tomorrow or it doesn't matter.\"\n\nDespite enjoying overwhelming support from the audience, the rally was paused three times due to protester interruption. Each time a protester was removed from the packed arena, the crowd would chant Trump's name, and Trump would tell the protester to \"go home to mommy!\"\n\n\"I haven't had one of these things happen in a long time, and I have three of them tonight,\" Trump said. \"That's Indiana for you.\"\n\nTrump ends his long string of pre-midterm rallies Monday evening in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, where pundits Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are expected to attend.\n\nMissouri\n\nPresident Donald Trump held his 44th rally of the 2018 campaign cycle Monday night, submitting the GOP's closing message in the Show Me State, where he laid out the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s highly anticipated midterm elections.\n\n\"We have to get out tomorrow, and we have to elect a Republican Congress,\" Trump proclaimed, warning that a Democratic Congress would socialize health care.\n\nIn his third rally of the day, Trump campaigned on behalf of GOP Senate hopeful Josh Hawley, who's challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in one of the election's most closely contested races.\n\n\"Tomorrow, the people of Missouri are going to send Josh Hawley to the United States Senate to keep America's economic boom going full speed ahead,\" Trump told the crowd. \"Josh is a young, incredible guy with tremendous talent. He will represent Missouri so well, and he's actually leading.\"\n\nThe president repeatedly bashed McCaskill, asserting she \"will be a disaster for jobs, for your state.\"\n\nDespite heavy rains drenching the region Monday afternoon, thousands of Missourians packed the Show Me Center for the rally and did not let the gloomy weather dampen their enthusiasm, chanting \"four more years\" and collectively singing \"Amazing Grace\" as a woman who collapsed near the stage was tended to by emergency personnel.\n\nTrump is the first U.S. president to visit Cape Girardeau since Ronald Reagan in 1988. Trump won Missouri by 20 points in 2016.\n\n\"Go out and vote Republican tomorrow,\" said Trump, wrapping up his speech as midnight approached on the East Coast. \"This Tuesday, in 15 minutes -- we're almost into Tuesday -- I need the people of Missouri to seize this incredible moment in history.\"\n\nTrump campaigned across 22 states this year, including three stops in Missouri: Springfield, Columbia and Cape Girardeau. The president is expected to monitor election results from the White House today.\n\nABC News Live -- the network\u2019s 24/7 streaming channel for breaking news and live events -- will offer continuous and commercial-free coverage on Election Day starting at 4:30 p.m. EST on Roku, AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV, YouTube, Apple News, Facebook, Twitter and the ABC News site and mobile apps.

He is accused of shooting Michael Anthony Temple Jr. in 2010 in a home in Odenton, Maryland, the Anne Arundel County police said.\n\nOn Feb. 2, 2010, two men in masks invaded a home where they shot Temple, leaving him a quadriplegic, police said.\n\nTemple died on June 18, 2015, and his death was ruled a homicide, police said.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police\n\nThe police department's cold case unit picked up the investigation in October 2015, police said.\n\nBecause DNA was left behind at the crime scene, experts were able to develop a composite image of a possible suspect, police said.\n\nSnapshot Parabon-Nanolabs\n\nDespite the image and a $10,000 reward, which were released in December 2015, police said no arrests were made -- until genetic genealogy came into play this year.\n\nThrough genetic genealogy, an unknown killer's DNA from a crime scene can be identified through his or her family members, who voluntarily submit their DNA to a genealogy database. This allows police to create a much larger family tree than using law enforcement databases like CODIS, in which an exact match is needed in most states, according to experts.\n\nOver a dozen crimes have identified suspects this year thanks to genetic genealogy, including the April arrest of the suspected \"Golden State Killer\" -- a cold case that stumped California law enforcement for decades.\n\nOnce genetic genealogy led experts to Frampton as a possible suspect in Temple's killing, detectives then surveilled him and obtained multiple DNA samples, police said Friday.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police\n\nThe DNA collected from Frampton was found to be a match to the DNA left behind at the crime scene, police said.\n\nFrampton, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, was apprehended Thursday and arrested on multiple charges including first-degree murder, second-degree murder and armed robbery, police said.\n\nSearch warrants and interviews led authorities to identify the second suspect as Jonathan Ludwig, police said; however, Ludwig died this March.\n\nAnne Arundel County Police\n\nFrampton appeared at a bond hearing Friday and was held without bail, Anne Arundel County State's Attorney Wes Adams said.\n\nHis preliminary hearing is set for Nov. 27.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\n\nABC News' Amanda Maile contributed to this report.", "Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, is supposed to be a time of religious celebration each fall.

And it happened. And so I look at my family, and I feel the same way about them. And \u2026 it's scary but \u2026 you just kind of try to hold it tight and be vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe movie holds few punches in its portrait of addiction, recovery and relapse though neither Chalamet or Carell say they\u2019ve struggled with addiction personally.\n\n\u201cAddiction doesn't have a recognizable face,\u201d Chalamet said. \u201cWhat I've found \u2026 with this character was the humanity of it.\u201d\n\nThat humanity is at the heart of both Chalamet\u2019s and Carell\u2019s performances.\n\n\u201cAs a parent, all you want to do is protect your kids from day one -- and you're fearful from day one until the day you die,\u201d Carell said. \u201cYou're always going to be afraid of something bad happening to your kids \u2013 [to] watch your kids go through something like this and to spiral out of control and to be completely helpless \u2026 I think that's the part of it that's the scariest for me.\u201d\n\nThe emotional days on set took a toll on the actors.\n\n\u201cI would go home at the end of these days and want to call dad, and just say, 'I love you, we are so lucky to have each other,'\" said Chalamet.\n\nCarell said coming home to his two children and wife of 23 years, Nancy Carell, made it easier.\n\n\u201cEvery day I'd sit with my wife \u2026 and I would tell her about what we filmed during that day,\u201d Carell said. \u201cIt was good to talk about it because it does get inside of you \u2026. especially a topic like this when you're looking at your kids when you come home, and you're feeling all the things they're going through -- and you just love them so much and you pray that nothing bad ever happens to them, and you're always knocking wood.\u201d\n\nFrancois Duhamel/Amazon Studios via AP\n\n\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d puts a human face on the epidemic ravaging the nation.

And you have to deal with it. And we did the best we could.\u201d\n\nNic\u2019s drug of choice was crystal meth. He would do anything to feed his addiction, including stealing money from his kid brother\u2019s piggy bank.\n\n\u201cI was hijacked by the drugs and I didn\u2019t want to be acting the way that I was acting,\u201d Nic remembered. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d\n\nDavid said he was \u201calways looking for Nic when he wasn\u2019t home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn't know where he was when he was on the streets ...

And I wanted so badly to connect and I wanted so badly for him to agree that he needed help and to \u2026 let me try to help him. And \u2026 in the movie, you see Steve Carell\u2019s face. And you see that he is so sad, and so broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have two teenagers and it's terrifying,\u201d Carell said. \u201cThe thought of a child going through what Nick Sheff went through is the most terrifying thing for a parent.\u201d\n\nCarell became famous for his comedic roles in movies like \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin.\u201d\n\nHe said the reason he was drawn to the role of David Sheff was because \u201cit\u2019s something that I felt people needed to see. It\u2019s a national epidemic and tragedy.\u201d\n\nChalamet auditioned for the role of Nic before his breakthrough Oscar-nominated performance in \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t have any sort of career,\u201d Chalamet recalled. \u201cIt was still very much a job of \u2026 trying to keep your cool on set.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d has generated Oscar buzz for both Chalamet and Carell.\n\nBut for Nic and David, the movie is a stark reminder of how far they have come as a family.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel again that we're so lucky,\u201d David said. \u201cI hear, and I've heard over the years, people say \u2018You know, your story is our story ... but our story had a different ending. My beautiful boy died [or] my lovely daughter didn't make it.\u2019 And I didn't do anything more magical than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tried as hard as I did, and we were very lucky,\u201d David added. \u201cSo I feel I think there's something a little bit guilty or maybe a lot guilty -- there's sort of a survivor's guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's no absolutely no reason that I survived when other people didn\u2019t,\u201d Nic said. \u201cI guess the thing is, that as long as there is life, that's when there is always hope.\u201d\n\nAfter years of relapsing and going in and out of treatment, Nic has been sober for eight years.\n\n\u201cMy life has gotten so much better since getting sober. I've seen it with so many friends and people I work with, that when they get sober, they get their lives that they've always wanted,\u201d Nic said. \u201cYou know, your life can really just blossom and get so much bigger than it ever had been.\u201d\n\nAdded David, \u201cAnd though we were lucky and they weren\u2019t, there is a sense of\u2026 we\u2019re not alone.\u201d", "Interested in Donald Trump?

Not apparently.\n\nLess than a year and a half after releasing the double-platinum album \"Evolve\" and crisscrossing the globe on a 100-date tour, the band is back with a dozen new songs. Whew.\n\n\"Origins\" is supposed to be a sister companion to last year's monster \"Evolve\" and it's an intriguing follow-up, offering more textures and sonic experiments. If \"Origins\" was the band stalking around as an arena powerhouse, \"Origins\" is their quirky little sister, making cool stuff in her bedroom.\n\nDon't let the first single, \"Natural,\" fool you. That slice of bombastic, fist-pumping bravado seems to indicate more of the same on \"Origins,\" but they drift into other areas, like the blissed-out summer jam \"Cool Out\" that could be on a DNCE album, and the gloriously anarchic, disruptive \"Digital,\" which plays with dub step and chops itself into pieces.\n\nThe album sees the Dragons again reteaming with producers Alex da Kid and Mattman & Robin \u2014 folks who have delivered some of the band's biggest hits \u2014 but, to everyone's credit, not doing more of the same.\n\n\"Bullet in a Gun\" is fresh with unpredictable electronic flourishes, and the club-ready \"Only\" has interesting temp shifts and unexpected layered parts, as if the Dragons are fighting monotony this time. \"West Coast\" is basically a folky tune that could happily sit in a Lumineers album \u2014 how's that for predictable?\n\nLyrically, \"Origins\" dwells on modern-day alienation and the band's own uncomfortable relationship to its own fame. On \"Zero,\" lead singer Dan Reynolds reminds everyone he once felt empty and unreal. On the moody \"Bullet in a Gun,\" he notes sadly: \"To make a name you pay the price\" and later the words \"sellout, sellout, sellout!\" are heard.\n\nThe Dragons also explore a dehumanizing digital world, like in their plea for \"Love,\" where Reynolds notes everyone tones out shocking news: \"We put on our headphones.\" Elsewhere, he screams: \"I'm not a part of your machine/I am the machine.\"\n\nThe new album extends the band's flirtation with Charles Darwin \u2014 taking its name from \"On the Origin of Species\" and coming right after \"Evolve.\" In some ways, the names should be reversed: \"Origins\" shows their sound really evolving.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "An Amber Alert has been issued after a 13-year-old North Carolina girl was kidnapped in front of her home before school, local police said.\n\nEighth-grader Hania Noleia Aguilar was kidnapped just before 7 a.m. Monday at the Rosewood Mobile Home park in Lumberton, said Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeil.\n\nLumberton Police Department\n\nHania grabbed her aunt's keys so she could turn on the car ahead of going to the bus stop when a family member saw a man dressed in all black with a yellow bandanna over his face approached the teen and forced her into the car, police said.\n\nThe suspect then stole the car and drove away with her, police said.\n\nmissingkids.org\n\nThe aunt's stolen car is described as a green 2002 Ford Expedition with South Carolina license plate number NWS984. The car has paint peeling from the hood and a Clemson sticker on the back window, police said.\n\nInvestigators are desperate to bring her home, and are interviewing witnesses, family and friends, as well as canvasing the neighborhood, McNeil said.\n\nThe FBI is now assisting in the investigation, police said.\n\nAnyone who sees Hania or the car is urged to call the Lumberton Police Department at 910-671-3845.", "Transcript for Gov. John Kasich shares his midterm predictions\n\nStay tuned for more deals. Well, as we know midterms are tomorrow. The rhetoric keeps getting more insane and Republican Ohio governor John Kasich has been calling for a much needed return to civility and empathy in America, which is why we're sorry he's stepping down. Please welcome back governor John Kasich. Thank you. Are you sorry that you decided to go? Well, I mean, I had a great 8 years as governor. I've been in politics for a very long time, but I'm not going anywhere. My voice is going to stay out here. Maybe you guys can even help me to keep it out there, because I think we need a voice that's calming and positive, looks to the future because we have to get this country back on track again, absolutely. Are you running for president? I don't know. I mean, all of my options are on the table. You know, in the Republican party pretty hard because it's kind of locked down right now and we don't know what's going to come in the future. But I think for the first time there is a legitimate chance for a third party candidate because if you have the Republicans on the extreme and the Democrats on the extreme, there's a big, wide open space in the middle. So all of my options are on the table, whoopi, and I just want to contribute. One thing I don't want to do is to diminish my voice because it's taken so long for me to have a voice. We'll have to see what happens here in the future. But it will be fun. So you would probably run for an independent versus primary? Right now, Meghan, you know, I don't know because -- Why do you say it's a lockdown? It's not a lockdown for 2020. Right now I'm saying in the Republican party. Right today it would be very hard to win a primary. I could win in New Hampshire but I go down south and I'd get blown out and I don't want to do that. I don't want to waste my family's time or my friends or resources. It has to be something that's legitimate, that can have an impact on moving this country in the right direction. But the primary situation on both sides sounds like it's destroying the country. Well, maybe that's why -- It's a small group of people -- Maybe that's why people are ready for a third party. I'm not saying that for sure but it might be so. Look, we don't know what's going to happen next week let alone what's going to happen in the next six months or a year. Right. But what I do know is, here's the thing, that our leaders are letting us down, and when leaders let us down, then it's up to us where we live to create a synergy with other people to be able to rise. I went to see that movie \"Bohemian rhapsody.\" I was telling Meghan about it, on Saturday night my wife and I went to see it. You know what was great about that movie? You had Republicans, Democrats, black, white, rich, poor, all in womenably stadium dancing and clapping. It sends those goose bumps about what happened when humanity is united, when we are together. And think about driving from the bottom up. Okay, I think about kind of three things. First of all, the civil rights movement, the politicians wanted nothing to do with it. It was the folks from the churches and their friends who marched in the streets. I was talking to whoopi about Mary Lou hammer. What a hero, beatings, gassings, dogs, but she wouldn't quit. She seized a high moral ground, inspired others. We changed America. The Vietnam war, if it wasn't for the people, we would still be in Vietnam, right? I mean, because they weren't doing anything. Now we have -- John, now we have cruises to Vietnam. That's right. But I'm saying it can change. But is it going to change, governor? I mean, tomorrow is the midterm elections. I know early voting is up and trump is campaigning in three states including your home state of Ohio. Yeah. Notice I'm here. Yes. Yeah. In my view, and I think a lot of people share this view, he's made this election about him, a referendum of him. He's running on race baiting, anger, especially with this caravan stuff. I mean, is this a winning strategy? Well, it's a terrible strategy for our country. Fear -- to dish out fear in order to achieve something, there ought to be some ethical limits to what you will do when you're involved in a campaign. But is it a good strategy for Republicans? I think what's going to happen in all likelihood, I think the Democrats will win the house, the Republicans will keep the senate -- this is no brilliant thing. We don't know that for sure. That's where it looks and I think the Democrats are going to have more power in the governorships across the country. That's what it looks like. Why? Because I think a lot of people have said I've had enough of this. I mean, I'm not going to live my life with anger and I don't think -- And fear. People don't want to live there. And look, I didn't vote for the guy. I didn't endorse the guy -- Is there anything you think the president's doing right? Is there anything that you would say I actually support that? I think the fact that he was able to move and deregulate parts of our economy which has created economic growth, yes. Look, I'm not here to say everything he does is bad but what I can tell you is we cannot have our leaders who divide us and cause fear. You can't have that and when you do -- Now, Abby, look, I've been in politics a long time and I've been in some really knockdown, dragout fights, back when we shut the government down and then we ultimately got the budget balanced working with Bill Clinton. You can hold positive -- strong views about things but you don't demonize the other person or question their worth or what their intentions are. That's how he's winning. That's how he keeps his base happy. Well, but the base has shrunk. The Republican party unfortunately has shrunk or maybe people said I've had enough of this. The biggest risk that the Republicans have in the future is they have turned off women. They have turned off the young. They have turned off minorities. What? I mean, you can't -- you can't do that. There's three white guys left. Let's take Ohio. Let's take my state. We're up over half a million jobs. We have $3 billion in the bank. We have held people who are small business people but people who are disabled, people who are mentally ill, people who are drug addicted, we've not left anyone behind. That's the road map in my opinion for how you must lead. You want to ask a question? I just -- I mean, I have lots of things to say but who are we kidding saying that the rhetoric is going to die down because I don't think no matter what happens tomorrow it's going to die down. We know the president hates losing. If Democrats win they're going to open up all kinds of investigations. I think impeachment talks will start immediately if they take over the house. Really, things are only going to get uglier. Do you agree? That's one scenario. The other scenario is they will not move in the direction of all these investigations which I don't like, particularly if they're political in nature, and that maybe in some sense, Meghan, they could moderate the president. I don't know, we have to see. But what I believe is that we got to stop spending our time wringing our hands, whoopi, about these leaders in Washington. No, no, I'm saying to you, we need to get the fire to start demanding change. Yeah. I'll give you one example. I got this bill I've proposed in Columbus. If you know somebody in your family or somebody in the workplace who is unstable, you can go to a court and take their gun. Who the heck is not for that, okay? A lot of people. We as the people -- I don't think so. If we the people demand that we want change at the top, let me tell you something, we scare the politicians. They may scare us but we're in charge of them. That's what people don't seem to get sometimes. People don't know what to do. And you -- and you matter. What you're doing -- you right there, young man. You didn't run that. You don't have the badges. Keep raising your hand, young man. Think about the greatest social movements. But you need to vote. That's the key. Yes, absolutely. So, always thank you for coming. Good luck. Hand wringing. Listen, like you said, you know, if you're not going to make the change, you can't bitch about it not being made. There you go.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "A tiger that officials say killed 13 people was shot dead in central India over the weekend, igniting a firestorm of criticism from politicians and animal rights activists who said the killing was unnecessary.\n\nThe operation to find the female tiger, called T1 by authorities and Avni by animal rights advocates, had gone on for months but had intensified after the tiger claimed its latest victim in August. Since then, forest officials doubled their efforts to find it, with patrols, a paraglider, thermal drones, sniffer dogs and even cologne.\n\nBut late on Friday evening, locals in the west-central Indian state of Maharashtra tipped off hunters that the tiger had been seen near a road.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt was the location where three [previous] human kills had occurred,\u201d Asghar Ali Khan, a 37-year-old hunter from the Indian city of Hyderabad, told ABC News. Khan was brought in along with his father, a well-known shooter, to work with the Maharashtra forest department.\n\nKhan said a team of about 14 was rushed to the spot, near the village of Borati in the Yavatmal district. The team, he said, included a forest official carrying a tranquilizer gun.\n\nAfter hours of waiting, the tiger was spotted by the official, who shot a dart at it, according to Khan.\n\n\"The moment the dart hit, the tigress was a different animal. She gave a roar, which hit our body more than hearing it,\" he remembered.\n\nThe tiger, still alive, then \"turned and came for us,\" he added.\n\nThat's when Khan said he shot the tiger.\n\n\"It was in self-defense,\" he noted.\n\nForestry officials did not respond to requests for comment. But AK Misra, principal chief conservator of forests for the Maharashtra forest department, confirmed the tiger's death to The Times of India.\n\nThe hunt for the tiger had been has been controversial from the beginning, with activists challenging the forest department in the courts. But the animal's fate was sealed a few weeks ago when the case reached India\u2019s Supreme Court. The court ruled that it would not interfere if forest rangers were forced to shoot the tiger.\n\nSarita Subramaniam, who runs Earth Brigade Foundation, an Indian NGO, has challenged the version of events put out by the forest department.\n\nHandout via AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe told ABC News from Mumbai, India, that Khan's account left many questions unanswered.\n\n\"A charging tiger, while roaring, and this guy is shooting, is not likely to face him sideways,\" she said. \"How did the bullet go from the left side and come out of the right side?\"\n\nShe accused Khan of fabricating the facts. \"He is lying through his teeth,\" she said.\n\nVillagers in central India told ABC News last month that they lived in fear because of the tiger.\n\n\"I was returning home from the fields and saw a crowd had gathered here, right at this spot,\" said Ram Krishna Lonkar. \"The tigress had attacked a farmer and killed him.\"\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nActivists have now turned their attention to the fate of the tiger\u2019s two cubs, who are still in the wild. Some locals believe the 1-year-old cubs may not survive very long without their mother.\n\nNot surprisingly, with general elections just a little over six months away, political reactions have come fast and furious. India\u2019s opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi condemned the killing on social media.\n\n\"The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated,\" Gandhi tweeted, quoting Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi -- no relation -- and using the hasthag #Avni.", "Eritrea is hoping that the U.N. Security Council will soon lift sanctions it imposed on the East African nation in 2009, now that its relations have thawed with Ethiopia and other neighboring countries.\n\nThe Security Council imposed an arms embargo and other tough sanctions on Eritrea for supplying weapons to al-Shabab Islamic militants opposed to the Somali government and for refusing to resolve a border dispute with neighboring Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in the Horn of Africa.\n\nA draft resolution obtained by The Associated Press would lift the arms embargoes, travel bans, asset freezes and targeted sanctions imposed in late 2009. It also urges Eritrea and Djibouti \"to continue efforts to settle their border dispute peacefully in a manner consistent with international law\" and to engage on Djibouti combatants missing in action.\n\nThe Security Council met privately Monday to hear from its committee monitoring sanctions on Eritrea and Somalia.\n\nThe draft resolution would also extend the arms embargo on Somalia until Nov. 15, 2019, as well as a ban on the import and export of Somali charcoal, a key source of income including for al-Shabab fighters.\n\nThe Security Council is scheduled to meet Nov. 14 to vote on an Eritrea-Somalia resolution.\n\nEritrea, a former Italian colony, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war. It had a decades-long border dispute with Ethiopia, including a war from 1998-2000 in which about 80,000 people died.\n\nBut the East African region saw an unprecedented level of diplomatic activity after Ethiopia's reformist Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, came to power in April and accepted a border decision by an international boundary commission that favored Eritrea.\n\nThe move set off a number of diplomatic thaws, including one between Eritrea and Somalia. Leaders of Djibouti and Eritrea, which also had a turbulent relationship after multiple border clashes, met in recent weeks with the help of regional power, Ethiopia, though no breakthrough was announced.\n\nEthiopia has lobbied for sanctions to be lifted against Eritrea.\n\n\"The final decision will be made on November 14 . but the early signals coming out from New York are positive indeed,\" Eritrea's Minister of Information, Yemane Gebremeskel, tweeted on Saturday. \"Tribute to Eritrea's steadfastness and resilience for nine long years.\"\n\nBut U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said Djibouti is unhappy about the possible lifting of sanctions against Eritrea because their dispute remains unresolved despite the reconciliation between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\n\nEritrea has denied providing any support to al-Shabab and has long accused Ethiopia of spearheading and influencing the sanctions against it. The draft resolution would condemn al-Shabab attacks in Somalia and beyond.\n\nAt the United Nations, Equatorial Guinea's ambassador, Anatolio Ndong Mba, welcomed \"the new dynamic in the Horn of Africa.\" He said the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions on Eritrea \"hasn't found any evidence\" that the country is helping al-Shabab.\n\n\"Therefore we are of the opinion that these sanctions should be lifted to send a message of a new dynamic in this Horn of Africa,\" he said as he headed into the council meeting. \"But what we think also is that Djibouti should be part of all this dynamic.\"\n\nThe Netherlands' deputy U.N. ambassador, Lise Gregoire Van Haaren, also a council member, said, \"We certainly think a revision of the sanctions is warranted and we should also support the positive developments.\"\n\nBut at the same time, she noted the Netherlands has a large Eritrean diaspora and said extortion and threats of force against them is \"a very sensitive topic.\" That is \"politically high on the agenda\" in her country and must be taken into account in any decision, she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.", "Social media platform Gab, where the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre spewed anti-Semitic messages, is back online roughly one week after domain registrar GoDaddy and other internet services dropped the site.\n\nGab returned on Sunday after a Seattle-based company, Epik, accepted the site's domain registration.\n\nGab suspended the account belonging to Robert Gregory Bowers, the man charged with killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last month, shortly after the attack. The site said it backed up all user data for that account and notified the FBI.\n\nOn its account, Gab posted a message Sunday that said it \"will not be defined by the actions of one individual.\"\n\nGab has been a haven for racists and anti-Semites who have been banned from Twitter for hateful and harassing behavior. Gab's founder and CEO, Andrew Torba, has portrayed his site as a bastion of free speech.\n\nGoDaddy said in an Oct. 28 statement that it gave Gab up to 24 hours to move its domain to another registrar because it had violated the company's terms of service.\n\n\"In response to complaints received over the weekend, GoDaddy investigated and discovered numerous instances of content on the site that both promotes and encourages violence against people,\" the statement said.\n\nWithin hours of the Oct. 27 synagogue shooting, PayPal spokesman Justin Higgs said the online payment service had canceled Gab's account. Higgs said the service has been \"closely monitoring\" Gab and had been in the process of canceling the site's account before the shooting.\n\n\"When a site is explicitly allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance, we take immediate and decisive action,\" Higgs said in a statement.\n\nChristopher Cantwell, a leading white nationalist figure who has one of the largest followings on Gab, posted an anti-Semitic message Sunday after the site was back online.\n\n\"Hey Jews! We're back on Gab now. Thanks for the press. Pretty soon the average citizen is going to figure out that we wouldn't be having these problems in your absence, and we genuinely appreciate your help in stepping up the timeline on that,\" Cantwell wrote. In July, Cantwell pleaded guilty to assault charges stemming from the torchlit rally on the eve of the August 2017 white nationalist rally that erupted in violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe mayhem in Charlottesville prompted many internet platforms to crack down on online hate. For example, Google and GoDaddy yanked The Daily Stormer's web address after the neo-Nazi website's founder, Andrew Anglin, published a post mocking the woman killed when a man drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters in Charlottesville. Anglin's site struggled for months to stay online.", "The end of this long 2018 midterm election cycle is upon us, and we are about to hear the political verdict of millions of Americans. With approximately one-third of the country -- at least 34 million people -- having voted early, tomorrow is not Election Day per se, it is the conclusion of many election days around America. And it looks like this will be an historic election in terms of engagement and turnout. In no midterm election cycle have more than 90 million people voted, and we are very likely to blow right past that and exceed 100 million voters nationwide.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections? Add Midterm Elections as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Midterm Elections news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nHere are five points to keep in mind as the returns start coming in on Tuesday:\n\n1. Pay close attention to the early voting election returns. In some states like Florida, Texas and Nevada, early voting could make up two-thirds of all votes cast, and it will give us early signs of where those states are headed. One cautionary note: we don\u2019t exactly know how many of those early votes were cannibalized from people who normally vote on Election Day. However, some initial analysis shows that many of these voters have never voted in a midterm before.\n\n2. We are going to see another epic political battle between two pillars of American politics: geography vs. demography. In 2016, President Trump carried the Electoral College (geography), and Hillary Clinton carried the popular vote (demography). It seems highly likely that Democrats will carry the popular vote tomorrow, and the GOP will win more counties. The question is if the Democrats have their votes efficiently spread across districts and states to overcome the GOP\u2019s geographic strength. We should know the answer to this fairly early on in the evening as states like Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia begin to report results in key races.\n\n3. This is the first election in modern memory where the bases of both parties seem very energized and engaged. Normally one side is lukewarm and the other is hot. Today, both are on fire. This is one big reason why there will be a record voter turnout. One cautionary note for the GOP: the Democratic base this year looks much larger than the GOP base, and this is reflected in the strongly approve vs. strongly disapprove attitudes towards the president of likely voters. Among those most engaged likely voters, 35 percent strongly approve of the president while 48 percent strongly disapprove. And while intensity is matched by likelihood to vote, the size of the bases are much different. The GOP base is composed primarily of white voters over age 45, the Democratic base is very diverse: people of color, younger voters, suburban/urban women, etc.\n\nNick Oxford/Reuters\n\n4. Independent voters spread across America will decide this election. Those voters who either don\u2019t register a party affiliation or decline to state will determine the winners and losers on election night. This is also what happened in 2016 and previous midterms. And so while people are basing their expectation of early voting on the party affiliation of registered voters, we don\u2019t know about those who have no party registration. In many key states, Democrats seem to have about a 7 point lead among these independent voters.\n\n5. The economy is doing well according traditional indicators as well as voter confidence, but it is not helping the incumbent president or party. In every other election, when the economy was doing anything close to this well, the incumbent party either picked up seats or didn\u2019t risk losing the House or Senate. The president has so personalized his time in office, constantly gets in his own way on other extraneous issues, and has only been communicating to his base and not America as a whole, he is getting no advantage from the economy in this election cycle.\n\nThese are just five of the thoughts to keep in mind as we journey the last few miles of an exciting, unique and historic midterm marathon election.\n\nSee you Tuesday night.", "Disney After Hours events have been such a huge hit among Disney fans and we wanted to share this good news with you first: not only are more event nights set for Magic Kingdom Park, but for the first time, Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom will join in on the fun!\n\nIn case you aren\u2019t familiar with Disney After Hours events, these evening events are your opportunity to experience the magic of a Disney theme park for three hours after regular park hours, which means little-to-no wait for attractions, experiences and character greetings!

I realized there are some really gross people running for office this year, so here are my first impressions. Dan crenshaw -- Oh, come on, man. Hold on. You may be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hit man in a porno movie. I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever. You know, his cast mate, Kenan Thompson, who's going to be here tomorrow, has kind of said, you know, maybe Pete should like apologize or something. Ideas, thoughts? \"Saturday night live\" doesn't take any prisoners. They've been on the air for like, what, 40, 50 years now? They took a shot at Alec Baldwin who's part of their family, so they go after a lot of people. And this kid Davidson, his father died in 9/11, and he said I like making things that -- I like making things out of dark, awkward, weird things that you don't really find funny, funny. There's nothing I won't joke about and I think it's because of what happened to me. So he's coming from a place of -- you know, you make fun of things that are so painful to lighten the load. That's where he's coming from. But it's because of those veterans that allows him to sit and do that job every day, to tell those jokes. I'm bumped because I really liked Pete Davidson and I thought it was completely tone deaf and not just him but the producers behind him that helped write it. It's not like free speaking. He's looking at note cards when he's reading it. So this was all rehearsed and planned in advance. KREN saw is a Navy S.E.A.L. Who did five tours of duty. He lost his right eye when he was hit by on ied blast in Afghanistan and returned and did another deployment two more times. I had such a problem with this over the weekend. I'm not a snowflake. I can laugh at jokes. I would think if your father died in 9/11, I don't know his story, but maybe you would be more empathetic to people who sacrificed. I will say that if it were Tammy Duckworth who is also a hero as well and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, if someone had been making fun of her, I don't know if we would have the same reaction. I don't know if it's because he's a Republican, but the response as the conservatives are angry. Is he going to win? Yes. He's going to be a congressman tomorrow. Why take pot shots at people who have served and made sacrifices. It just wasn't funny. The joke wasn't funny. When I say it's in bad taste, if it's not funny, it's just not good. Is it ever okay to make fun of vets. I'm not that easily offended but I was like, oh. It seemed like such a sucker punch. Why not fun of not only someone's service but their looks. I don't ever really find that funny. And should he apologize, I mean, why not? But they do it all the time over there. Offensive humor is their stock in trade. It's not funny. Humor is the operative word. He said that's how he deals with it and that's fine if he finds catharsis in comedy which a lot of people do but that doesn't give him the right to take shots at someone else's service and people's physical pain. He has a right to do it. You have a right to speak out against it. If \"Snl\" wants to be in the game where you make fun of wounded veterans, that's a hill you'll die on alone. I didn't like it when the president of the United States did it and I certainly didn't like it when this comedian did it. I agree. People across the board have spoken out about this. You're right, he has every right to say it but we can stand up and say this is not okay. I didn't get that the president of the United States made a joke about her father? Made fun of people with disabilities. He was making fun of people. He's not a comedian trying to get a laugh. If you're making fun of veterans, even if you're trying to be funny, it shouldn't happen. We got to go.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "The man who shot and killed two women at a yoga studio was fired from his job as a substitute teacher for inappropriately touching a middle school girl, a Florida school district said.\n\nPaul Scott Beierle, 40, posed as a customer during a yoga class Friday, then began shooting, authorities said. A 61-year-old faculty member at Florida State University and a 21-year-old FSU student from Georgia were killed. Five others were injured. Beierle then killed himself.\n\nIt's unclear why Beierle chose that yoga studio in the Florida capital. He had lived in Tallahassee from 2011-2013 but had recently been living several hours away. Police have not released information on a motive.\n\nBut what's clear is that Beierle had a history of harassing women and acting inappropriately. From pinching women's buttocks to tickling a middle school student to appearing to make misogynistic videos, there were several red flags surrounding his behavior.\n\nKelly Schulz, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County School District, said Monday that Beierle was fired in May after he asked a female student if she was ticklish and then touched her at the top of the stomach \"below the bra line,\" a district report says.\n\n\"Student was frightened and hid behind another student,\" the report said.\n\nSchool personnel records show that students and a parent complained about Beierle's conduct at a different school prior to the May incident.\n\nNicole Gillespie said her twin eighth-grade daughters told her on the first day of school in August of 2017 that Beierle, who was teaching language arts, was \"creepy.\"\n\nShe encouraged her daughters to give him a chance, but they insisted his behavior of calling only girls to the front of the room was inappropriate.\n\n\"Mom, he's staring at us,\" they told her.\n\nWhen Gillespie looked him up on the internet, she found pictures of burlesque dancers, inappropriate sexual discussions and photos of him with weapons on his Facebook page. Her daughters told school authorities of their discomfort, and he was moved to a different school.\n\nSchulz said Beierle was hired in 2017 after he passed a federal and state criminal background check both with Volusia County Schools and the Department of Education. He was issued a teaching certification by DOE in July 2015, she said.\n\nBeierle was a military veteran with degrees from Binghamton University and Florida State University. Raised in Vestal, New York, he appeared to have made videos detailing his hatred of everything from the Affordable Care Act to girls who'd allegedly mistreated him in middle school. The videos were posted four years ago, and were removed from YouTube after the shooting.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos in 2014 where he called women \"whores\" if they dated black men, said many black women were \"disgusting\" and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman wouldn't confirm or deny the videos were Beierle's. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like him, and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle.\n\nIn 2012, he was arrested twice for grabbing women on FSU's campus. Charges were dropped.\n\nFour years later, Beierle was arrested for misdemeanor battery after a woman said he approached her at the swimming pool of a Tallahassee apartment complex, complemented her rear end and offered to rub sunscreen on it, records show. The woman said she declined the offer and Beierle then slapped her on the buttocks and grabbed her.\n\nCourt records indicate prosecutors agreed to dismiss the battery charge after Beierle completed a six-month diversion agreement requiring him to stay out of trouble, not drink alcohol to excess and to follow a psychologist's recommendations.", "News of another mass shooting, including the recent attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh, makes many people wonder what they would do if confronted with an active shooter or other assailant. And small business owners may wonder how they can prepare their companies to deal with a possible attack.\n\nHere are some questions and answers:\n\nQ. What resources are available to help small business owners prepare their staffers to deal with potential violence?\n\nA. There are websites and videos online that describe what employees should do if there is an active shooter. Government agencies have web pages with instructions and videos, among them the Department of Homeland Security ( www.dhs.gov ), the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( www.fema.gov ) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( www.osha.gov ). Another site is www.ready.gov , also operated by Homeland Security.\n\nBut sending employees an email with a list of online resources may not help prepare people, says Sean Ahrens, a security consultant with AEI Affiliated Engineers. In-person training sessions that include role-playing and tours of a company's facilities to point out exit routes and potential hiding places are more likely to have a lasting impact, he says.\n\n\"When you put someone into that role-playing, the adrenaline gets going,\" Ahrens says.\n\nOwners may want to consider bringing in security consultants to train staffers. And many local law enforcement agencies are willing to analyze small businesses and help owners and employees understand where and how they can escape or hide. For example: If they hide inside a room with furniture, they should block the door with pieces of furniture piled on top of one another, creating as big a barricade as possible.\n\nQ. What's involved in preparing to deal with an active shooter?\n\nA. There is no way to prepare for the exact circumstances of an attack because each situation is unique and unpredictable. But a company can create a plan that helps people know generally what to do, says Rob Shuster, a vice president at the security consultancy AFIMAC Global.\n\nFor example, everyone should know how to report that there's an assailant on the premises, and they need to know how the company will communicate with everyone on the premises. They should know that they need to run from the building if possible, where all the exits are and where they should assemble. They need to know all the possible hiding places, and how to secure the doors of rooms and closets. They need to know quirks in the building that can save their lives \u2014 like a crawl space that a shooter or other assailant doesn't know about.\n\nA plan can also help people know what common mistakes to avoid, Shuster says. For example, escaping employees may want to run up to a law enforcement officer, a dangerous idea because officers may not know whether the people approaching them are innocent or assailants, he says. And, their hands should be empty, so no one mistakenly believes they're carrying a weapon.\n\nQ. Are there potential incidents besides a random active shooter that companies should prepare for?\n\nA. Security experts also train owners and workers about what to do in the case of disgruntled staffer or a domestic dispute \u2014 two situations that are more likely to happen at a workplace. They also instruct companies about how to deal with a robbery or other criminal act.\n\nIn the cases of a vengeful staffer or a domestic dispute, employees would take some of the same steps, starting with running and hiding, as with a random shooter. In the case of a robbery, the safest approach is to give criminals what they're looking for, says Brent O'Bryan, a vice president at Allied Universal, a company that provides security and other services. While there have been videos on TV and online of some store employees tackling robbers, that is not recommended, and could be deadly, he says.\n\nIt's not possible to know in advance that a current or former staffer will come into a workplace and begin attacking employees and managers. But owners can lessen the possibility of an attack by addressing problems as they come up, O'Bryan says. An owner should consider asking human resources professionals for advice in dealing with angry or troubled staffers.\n\n\"A business owner needs to make sure he or she as leaders are willing to step in and stop issues \u2014 whether it's an employee acting up for a problem between employees \u2014 and snuff it out so it cannot evolve into something worse,\" O'Bryan says.\n\nViolence related to a domestic dispute is equally hard to predict. But owners also need to encourage staffers to speak up if they are having domestic issues or have obtained an order of protection against a spouse, partner or boyfriend or girlfriend, O'Bryan says.\n\nCo-workers also need to feel free to approach the boss if there seems to be a problem, such as a troubled or angry staffer, or an employee suffering through a difficult and possibly threatening domestic situation.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor more small business news, insights and inspiration, sign up for our free weekly newsletter here: http://discover.ap.org/ssb\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Manijeh Khorrami, who had come to buy tablets for his diabetic mother, said the Iranian-made version's price had tripled since the summer and the foreign version was no longer available.\n\n\"Can it get worse than the current situation?\" Khorrami said. \"I don't know what will happen.\"\n\nThe new sanctions end all economic benefits America had granted Tehran for its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, though Iran continues to abide by the accord, which requires it to curb its uranium enrichment. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord in May, saying it did not address Iran's regional military activities and other issues.\n\nIran's national currency, the rial, has plummeted for months and is now trading at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar, compared to around 40,500 a year ago. The new sanctions will likely undermine the rial even more since they target Iran's oil industry, a crucial source of hard currency. They also target dozens of Iranian banks, aiming to push the financial sector deeper into isolation.\n\nThe result has been skyrocketing prices for everything from clothes and transportation to food.\n\n\"Check the shops here one by one, there are no customers,\" said Hossein Ahmadi, whose purse shop is located on a normally busy commercial street in the Iranian capital. \"People have kept their money for rainy days out of fear of sanctions while rent of the shop has gone up.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to explain this to my wife and children,\" he said.\n\nAt nearby clothes shops, a few women looked through the scarves and coats.\n\n\"A lot of people are not able to buy these things anymore,\" said one 22-year-old shopper, Mina Sholeh.\n\nWashington has issued a list of 12 demands Iran must meet to get the sanctions lifted, including ending its support for regional militant groups, withdrawing from the civil war in Syria \u2014 where it backs President Bashar Assad \u2014 and halting its development of ballistic missiles. On Friday, Trump said the objective is \"to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\"\n\nIn large part, the bet is that Iran's leadership will be pressured by public outrage. Iran's economic chaos sparked anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. At the time, the Trump administration cheered the protests.\n\nDemonstrations have become sporadic and rare. But bitterness remains among many Iranians who complain about corruption and their government's costly interventions in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"The government is wealthy, it sells oil abroad but it does not care about ordinary people,\" said Mohammad Ghasemi, who sells scarves on a street corner. \"They waste money where it does nothing to cure the wounds in our heart.\"", "This is a Kaiser Health News story.\n\nBetsy Foster and Doug Dillon are devotees of Josh Harder. The Democratic upstart is attempting to topple Republican incumbent Jeff Denham in this conflicted, semi-rural district that is home to conservative agricultural interests, a growing Latino population and liberal San Francisco Bay Area refugees.\n\nTo Foster\u2019s and Dillon\u2019s delight, Harder supports a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d health care system that would cover all Americans.\n\nFoster, a 54-year-old campaign volunteer from Berkeley, believes Medicare-for-all is similar to what\u2019s offered in Canada, where the government provides health insurance to everybody.\n\nDillon, a 57-year-old almond farmer from Modesto, says Foster\u2019s description sounds like a single-payer system.\n\n\u201cIt all means many different things to many different people,\u201d Foster said from behind a volunteer table inside the warehouse Harder uses as his campaign headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s all so complicated.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, catchphrases such as \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d \u201csingle-payer,\u201d \u201cpublic option\u201d and \u201cuniversal health care\u201d are sweeping state and federal political races as Democrats tap into voter anger about GOP efforts to kill the Affordable Care Act and erode protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nRepublicans, including President Donald Trump, describe such proposals as \u201csocialist\u201d schemes that will cost taxpayers too much. They say their party is committed to providing affordable and accessible health insurance, which includes coverage for preexisting conditions, but with less government involvement.\n\nVoters have become casualties as candidates toss around these catchphrases \u2014 sometimes vaguely and inaccurately. The sound bites often come across as \u201cquick answers without a lot of detail,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, a professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School Public Health.\n\nSamantha Young/Kaiser Health News\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite understandable people don\u2019t understand the terms,\u201d Anderson added.\n\nFor example, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) advocates a single-payer national health care program that he calls Medicare-for-all, an idea that caught fire during his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 labels are misleading, health experts agree, because Medicare isn\u2019t actually a single-payer system. Medicare allows private insurance companies to manage care in the program, which means the government is not the only payer of claims.\n\nWhat Sanders wants is a federally run program charged with providing health coverage to everyone. Private insurance companies wouldn\u2019t participate.\n\nIn other words: single-payer, with the federal government at the helm.\n\nAbsent federal action, Democratic gubernatorial candidates Gavin Newsom in California, Jay Gonzales in Massachusetts and Andrew Gillum in Florida are pushing for state-run single-payer.\n\nTo complicate matters, some Democrats are simply calling for universal coverage, a vague philosophical idea subject to interpretation. Universal health care could mean a single-payer system, Medicare-for-all or building upon what exists today \u2014 a combination of public and private programs in which everyone has access to health care.\n\nOthers call for a \u201cpublic option,\u201d a government plan open to everyone, including Democratic House candidates Antonio Delgado in New York and Cindy Axne in Iowa. Delgado wants the public option to be Medicare, but Axne proposes Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nAre you confused yet?\n\nSacramento-area voter Sarah Grace, who describes herself as politically independent, said the dialogue is over her head.\n\nSamantha Young/Kaiser Health News\n\n\u201cI was a health care professional for so long, and I don\u2019t even know,\u201d said Grace, 42, who worked as a paramedic for 16 years and now owns a holistic healing business. \u201cThat\u2019s telling.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most voters approached for this article declined to be interviewed, saying they didn\u2019t understand the issue. \u201cI just don\u2019t know enough,\u201d Paul Her of Sacramento said candidly.\n\n\u201cYou get all this conflicting information,\u201d said Her, 32, a medical instrument technician who was touring the state Capitol with two uncles visiting from Thailand. \u201cHalf the time, I\u2019m just confused.\u201d\n\nThe confusion is all the more striking in a state where the expansion of coverage has dominated the political debate on and off for more than a decade. Although the issue clearly resonates with voters, the details of what might be done about it remain fuzzy.\n\nA late-October poll by the Public Policy Institute of California shows the majority of Californians, nearly 60 percent, believe it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health coverage. Other state and national surveys reveal that health care is one of the top concerns on voters\u2019 minds this midterm election.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the issue, pounding GOP incumbents for voting last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act and attempting to water down protections for people with preexisting medical conditions in the process. A Texas lawsuit brought by 18 Republican state attorneys general and two GOP governors could decimate protections for preexisting conditions under the ACA \u2014 or kill the law itself.\n\nRepublicans say the current health care system is broken, and they have criticized the rising premiums that have hit many Americans under the ACA.\n\nWhether the Democratic focus on health care translates into votes remains to be seen in the party\u2019s drive to flip 23 seats to gain control of the House.\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nThe Denham-Harder race is one of the most watched in the country, rated too close to call by most political analysts. Harder has aired blistering ads against Denham for his vote last year against the ACA, and he sought to distinguish himself from the incumbent by calling for Medicare-for-all \u2014 an issue he hopes will play well in a district where an estimated 146,000 people would lose coverage if the 2010 health law is overturned.\n\nYet Harder is not clinging to the Medicare-for-all label and said Democrats may need to talk more broadly about getting everyone health care coverage.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a spectrum of options that we can talk about,\u201d Harder said. \u201cI think the reality is we\u2019ve got to keep all options open as we\u2019re thinking towards what the next 50 years of American health care should look like.\u201d\n\nTo some voters, what politicians call their plans is irrelevant. They just want reasonably priced coverage for everyone.\n\nSitting with his newspaper on the porch of a local coffee shop in Modesto, John Byron said he wants private health insurance companies out of the picture.\n\nThe 73-year-old retired grandfather said he has seen too many families struggle with their medical bills and believes a government-run system is the only way.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most effective and affordable,\u201d he said.\n\nLinda Wahler of Santa Cruz, who drove to this Central Valley city to knock on doors for the Harder campaign, also thinks the government should play a larger role in providing coverage.\n\nBut unlike Byron, Wahler, 68, wants politicians to minimize confusion by better defining their health care pitches.\n\n\u201cI think we could use some more education in what it all means,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

The odds are longer for Republicans or Democrats emerging with majorities in both chambers.\n\n\"Divided government equals gridlock,\" said Terry Haines, head of US policy and political analysis at Evercore ISI. \"Gridlock is a good thing for markets because markets like certainty.\"\n\nHere's a look at how the market might react to the different scenarios:\n\nSPLIT DECISION\n\nIn the scenario where Democrats regain control of the House, major policy initiatives from the White House will be dead on arrival. Compromise could be difficult, especially if the Democrats move to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Democrats might find common ground with the GOP in some areas. Agreement on an infrastructure bill could give a boost to construction equipment and transportation companies. And legislation to control drug pricing would likely be a drag on pharmaceutical company stocks.\n\nA Democrat-led House could also lead to heightened oversight and investigations of big banks and Wall Street firms, which could weigh on financial sector stocks.\n\nThe possibility of a government shutdown also increases with a divided Congress, according to a report from UBS on the potential impact of the midterm elections. That could unnerve investors. The S&P 500 slumped nearly 20 percent during the government shutdown that occurred during Congress' 2011 debt ceiling impasse.\n\nTHE BLUE WAVE\n\nThe odds of the Democrats taking both houses of Congress have diminished of late, possibly to the relief of Wall Street.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats could push to shore up the Affordable Care Act, but any move to reverse the Trump administration's hefty tax cut on corporations or its steady rollback of government regulations on businesses could be fruitless in the face of Trump's veto.\n\n\"With this in mind, this election is really about how dysfunctional Washington will be for the second half of President Trump's first term,\" Mike Ryan, chief investment officer, Americas, for UBS Global Wealth Management, noted in the company's report.\n\nMORE OF THE SAME\n\nShould Republicans remain in control of Congress, it's likely the Trump administration will try to make the personal tax cuts included in last year's reform package permanent. Also, on the possible to-do list: reforming entitlements, more easing of government regulations on banks and other businesses and perhaps tackling the issue of drug price controls, according to the UBS report.\n\nIf the GOP extends its majority, there also could be a push to lower capital gains taxes and enact an infrastructure spending bill.\n\nThe midterms add to the uncertainty that has buffeted the market for the past month.\n\nAfter a solid third quarter that saw records for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials, stocks have swooned on fears that rising interest rates and the U.S. trade dispute with China could undo some of the benefits of the GOP tax cuts and eventually squeeze corporate profit margins. October snapped a six-month winning streak for the S&P 500, giving the benchmark index its worst monthly loss in seven years.\n\nStill, regardless of how the midterm elections turn out, history suggests stocks will be fine.\n\nThe S&P 500 has generated an average price return of 16.7 percent in the 12 months after each of the midterm elections going back to 1946, according to CFRA. That's 18 elections, many of which ended up shuffling the balance of power in Congress.\n\n\"It turns out that under every political makeup in Washington, stocks have gone up and the economy has grown,\" said Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones.", "Remember when Santa set sail on a Disney cruise for his summer vacation?

I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cThis is how we would handle any investigation when something like this comes up.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Kemp\u2019s office said they had officially requested the FBI to investigate the matter. The FBI declined to comment. The Department of Homeland Security said Sunday that the State of Georgia had notified the department about the issue but declined to comment further. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the state\u2019s independent investigative agency, confirmed on Monday that its Georgia Cyber Crime Center will conduct an investigation at the request of Kemp\u2019s office.\n\n\"The Democratic Party of Georgia will stop at nothing to regain relevance and power in our state,\" Ryan Mahoney, Communications Director for Kemp\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, said on Sunday. \"In an act of desperation, the Democrats tried to expose vulnerabilities in Georgia's voter registration system. This was a 4th quarter Hail Mary pass that was intercepted in the end zone. Thanks to the systems and protocols established by Secretary of State Brian Kemp, no personal information was breached. These power-hungry radicals should be held accountable for their criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Democratic Party took to Twitter on Monday to join Abrams in accusing Kemp of misusing his office to influence the election, tweeting \u201cKemp is trying to play Georgians and the media for fools, just hours before polls open. Won\u2019t work. Georgians can fight back against abuses of power by VOTING tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the party published two emails that purport to show a private individual who pointed out potential vulnerabilities in websites used by Georgia residents to print sample ballots and registration information that the individual suggested could allow a hacker to steal or manipulate registration information.\n\nDavid Cross, an attorney who has been involved in cybersecurity-related litigation against the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, told ABC News he was also alerted to the potential vulnerabilities by that same individual. He said he contacted the FBI \u2013 in an email exchange he shared with ABC News -- and an outside counsel for Kemp on Saturday.\n\nElection security researcher Matt Bernhard, a post-graduate student at the University of Michigan who serves as a security expert in Cross\u2019s lawsuit against the Secretary of State\u2019s office, told ABC News he was asked by someone involved in that litigation to review the claims. He said he verified them as far as he could by analyzing the sites\u2019 source code, but Bernard and other cyber security experts told ABC News that fully verifying the issues would have required potentially running afoul of the law.\n\nRuth Fremson/The New York Times via Redux, FILE\n\nBernhard outlined his findings in a blog post, which was reviewed by Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, at ABC News\u2019 request. Meyers told ABC News the vulnerabilities as described were potentially serious.\n\n\u201cThere are huge issues here,\u201d Meyers said, both because of the potential for political mischief and for cyber-criminal groups who specialize in stealing and selling personal information.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, however, Candice Broce, a spokesperson for the Georgia Secretary of State, said that no vulnerabilities had been found, telling ABC News in a statement that the \u201callegations of vulnerabilities could not be substantiated by our cyber security team.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, those webpages are not linked to a location containing files with confidential or sensitive information,\u201d Broce said in a follow-up statement.\n\nThis is not the first time Kemp has raised allegations about attempts to infiltrate the secretary of state\u2019s computer network. Just days after the 2016 presidential election, Kemp requested a federal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, citing 10 suspected unauthorized attempts by DHS personnel to penetrate the state\u2019s firewall.\n\nA report from the Inspector General of DHS released in July 2017, concluded that allegations were unsubstantiated. The investigation determined that the activity flagged by Kemp was the \u201cresult of normal and automatic computer message exchanges,\u201d and that there were no unauthorized intrusion attempts.\n\nThe race between Kemp and Abrams, who could become the nation\u2019s first African-American woman to be elected governor, has been close and contentious. As of Monday afternoon, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s gubernatorial forecast showed Abrams and Kemp locked in a tight contest, with Kemp holding on to a very small advantage.\n\nDavid Cross's interview was featured in the Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, episode of ABC News' daily news podcast, \"Start Here.\"\n\n\"Start Here\" is the flagship daily news podcast from ABC News -- a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

The organization is technically nonpartisan, but several on its list of celebrity co-chairs such as Tom Hanks and Chris Paul have been vocal critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nLyft is also working with Voto Latino \u2014 whose co-founder Rosario Dawson has urged voters to choose Democrats to combat Trump's immigration policies \u2014 as well as nonprofit organizations that help blind people and student veterans to distribute discount codes and identify where free rides are needed. Lyft's efforts have been promoted on social media by celebrities such as actor Samuel Jackson, another Trump critic.\n\nUber is offering $10 off rides to the polls across the country and added a feature in its app that helps customers find their polling stations by typing in a home address.\n\n\"In this critically important election, we want to do our part and use Uber's technology to help drive the vote,\" said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in an email. \"Decisions get made by those who show up and we believe Uber can help voters show up like never before.\"\n\nZipcar, which allows members to rent cars on an hourly basis, is offering a $20 credit on election night, enough to cover about two hours of driving, said spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley. Zipcar has been offering discounts for election-related rides since the company was founded in 2000, Chesley said.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who have really busy schedules during the daytime, and we just really want to make sure every last voice is heard,\" Chesley said.\n\nThis is the second time Lyft has offered discounted or free rides to the polls and Uber's first.\n\nIn 2016, 15 million eligible voters cited transportation as a key reason why they didn't vote, according to The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, so \"we want to use our platform to eliminate that pain point from the voting process,\" said Mike Masserman, head of social impact at Lyft, in an email.\n\nMotivate, which operates most of the bike share programs in the U.S., is offering free day passes to ride bikes on Election Day in nine of its markets for the first time. Lime is offering free rides on its bikes and scooters.\n\nUber is cleaning up its public relations image in preparation for an initial public offering next year, and the Election Day promotion is \"a clear sign of extending goodwill to consumers while deploying clever marketing tactics,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director of private investment research at SharesPost.\n\n\"Let's not forget that these companies have had a lot of clashes with communities, and this is sort of a nice way for then to show their support for communities,\" said Mike Ramsey, senior research director at Gartner. \"They're probably touching into the Zeitgeist that these elections are very important to a lot of people on both sides.\"", "The six mountain caribou remaining in the lower 48 states will be relocated farther north into Canada, a move that ends decades of efforts to reintroduce the large animals into Idaho and Washington state.\n\nThe Spokesman Review says biologists hope to breed the few survivors of the South Selkirk herd in captivity north of Revelstoke, British Columbia.\n\n\"This is what extinction looks like, and it must be a wake-up call for wildlife and habitat managers in both Canada and the United States,\" said Joe Scott, international programs director for Conservation Northwest.\n\nThe news \"marks the tragic end of an era,\" he said.\n\nMountain caribou were listed as an endangered species in the U.S. in 1983.\n\nThe Kalispel Tribe in Washington state has been involved in a breeding project to try and expand the herd, but the project failed.\n\nThe South Selkirk herd ranged along the crest of the Selkirk Mountains near the Canada border. About 14 other herds that include an estimated 1,400 mountain caribou, wander the tundra farther north of the border.\n\nKnown as Grey Ghosts because of how rarely they are seen, the South Selkirk caribou use their wide feet to stand on top of deep snow and eat lichen that grows high in old-growth forests.\n\nBart George, a wildlife biologist for the Kalispels, hopes the herd can start expanding again in Canada and that caribou will spill into the U.S.\n\nIn 2009, George said, the South Selkirk herd had 46 animals and was increasing every year before wolves entered the region.\n\n\"That's been our primary source of mortality that we've known about,\" George said.\n\nLogging roads and increased snowmobiling also played a part in the demise of the herd.\n\n\"We really didn't mobilize until it was too late,\" George said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com", "The Billboard charts and streaming services truly dig rising country star Kane Brown. But the industry voters at the Country Music Association Awards? Not as much.\n\nDespite being the genre's most successful new artist, Kane Brown was snubbed at the 2018 CMAs, but he's still going to the awards show on Nov. 14 anyway.\n\n\"I was upset a little bit just because I felt like we had a very good year,\" said 25-year-old Brown, who will release his sophomore album, \"Experiment,\" on Friday. \"I felt like me and Luke Combs and Brett Young were the most-talked about (artists) of the year. I felt like I should have at least been recognized.\"\n\nCombs and Young were both nominated for new artist of the year, and Combs got a male vocalist nomination as well. Brown, whose Dec. 2016 self-titled debut album and deluxe reissue last year spawned two multi-platinum hits \u2014 \"Heaven\" and \"What Ifs\" \u2014 was included on the second-round ballot for multiple categories, including new artist, but ultimately didn't make it into the final five in those categories, according to a CMA spokeswoman.\n\n\"But I don't have any hurt feelings,\" Brown said in a recent interview on his tour bus in Nashville, Tennessee, as he prepared to play an opening slot at the Bridgestone Arena for Chris Young. \"I'll still be at the show and I will still be rooting for everybody that got nominated. All those people are still family. I wish good on everybody and I'm not really hurt at all.\"\n\nAlthough he's one of country music's next big stars, Brown still has an underdog mentality, which goes back to his upbringing in rural Georgia and being raised by a single mom.\n\n\"I feel like I am the outsider on the inside, if that makes sense,\" Brown said. \"But I have coped with it.\"\n\nHis manager, Martha Earls, said his lack of CMA nominations mean there's still a lot of people in Nashville who don't understand him.\n\n\"The fans really want him. But the CMAs are industry-voted,\" Earls said. \"And so there's a lot of politics involved in that.\"\n\nBrown has had to walk a lot more miles than most new artists to get to where he is today, Earls said.\n\n\"He came to town and immediately everyone was suspicious of him because they couldn't understand how somebody could break on social media,\" Earls said. \"There were obviously stereotypes against him because he's bi-racial and he has a ton of tattoos and he doesn't look like your stereotypical country artist.\"\n\nBrown built his fan base through his Facebook page, doing covers of country songs that were amassing millions of views. His debut album achieved platinum status and topped Billboard's country albums chart for 12 weeks. He topped all five Billboard country charts simultaneously at one point this year, making him the first artist ever to do so. \"Heaven,\" which peaked at No. 15 on the all-genre Hot 100 chart, is the second most-streamed country song of the year behind the record-breaking hit \"Meant to Be,\" by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line.\n\nAlthough country radio was slow to respond, fans immediately connected to the soft-spoken singer-songwriter with the deep voice. On his first album, Brown opened up to fans about his background, being abused as a kid and not fitting in at school because of his clothes and his skin color.\n\nHe's won big at fan-voted awards show, sweeping the country categories at the 2018 American Music Awards with three wins and picking up a CMT Music Award for \"What Ifs,\" his No. 1 hit featuring Lauren Alaina. And although Brown would have likely been a strong contender for best new artist at the 2019 Grammys, he is ineligible because he's released too many songs, Earls said.\n\n\"I feel like our industry sometimes doesn't recognize the artists that are making the biggest impact,\" Earls said.\n\nBrown, who recently got married to singer Katelyn Jae, sounds like a young man deeply in love and coming into his own on his new album. His voice carries more confidence as he explores his love of '90s-era country music, while also incorporating elements of R&B and pop.\n\n\"I wanted to call it 'Experiment' because it's all kinds of different sounds,\" Brown said. \"We have a bunch of instruments on there that are basically going extinct, like the fiddle, the steel guitar, the slide. ...We basically did like a new school meets old school country on some of them.\"\n\nHe's become a fast learner as well. When he had just 15 minutes to play as an opener for Florida Georgia Line, he studied the duo's set to learn how to improve his own. \"I've learned that I want to be the headliner one day,\" said Brown, who will start his first headlining arena tour in January.\n\nBut Brown insists that all the success hasn't changed him. Family is one of the most important things to him, whether it's the family he came from or the tight crew of band members and co-writers. When he played the arena in Nashville, he brought his mother and his 88-year-old grandfather onstage and told his fans to follow their dreams.\n\n\"I am very family oriented,\" Brown said. \"This camp is a family. My writers are my family.\"\n\nSo even if part of the country music industry has not yet recognized him for his accomplishments, Brown said he likes proving that people's expectations of him are wrong.\n\n\"That's why this album is so different because I want people to be like, 'Whoa, I wasn't expecting that,'\" Brown said. \"I feel like I can do what I want to do because my fans are always going to be there.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://experiment.kanebrownmusic.com/", "NBC, Fox News Channel and all said Monday they will stop airing President Donald Trump's campaign advertisement that featured an immigrant convicted of killing two police officers.\n\nCNN had rejected the same ad, declaring it racist.\n\nAsked before leaving for campaign rallies if he thought the advertisement was offensive, Trump said, \"a lot of things are offensive. Your questions are offensive a lot of times.\"\n\nThe ad has already likely been seen by more people than it would if it kept running. NBC aired it on the \"Sunday Night Football\" game between the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers, which drew the highest overnight ratings of the franchise's history. During season, it's usually the most-watched show on television, often with around 20 million viewers.\n\nMSNBC also aired it on \"Morning Joe\" Monday.\n\nReleased last week, the advertisement includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers. He's seen smiling in a court appearance and saying, \"I will break out soon and I will kill more.\"\n\nAn earlier version of the ad said, without evidence, that \"Democrats let him into our country.\" That claim was deleted from the current version.\n\nThe new edit still shows masses of people shaking at a fence, apparently trying to break it down, and ends with the tagline, \"Trump and Republicans are making America safe again.\"\n\nNBC was the first of the three companies to say it was stopping the advertisement Monday, apparently after a fierce online response.\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" NBC Universal said in a statement.\n\nMarianne Gambelli, Fox News' president of advertising sales, said the commercial was pulled on Sunday \"upon further review.\" Fox did not immediately say how many times it had aired on either Fox News Channel or the Fox Business Network.\n\nFacebook initially ran the ad but that was an error, company spokesman Andy Stone said, because it violates the company's policy against sensation content.\n\nFacebook is still allowing its members to post the ad in their news feeds, however.\n\nTrump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted that NBC News, CNN and Facebook had chosen \"to stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY.\" He said the media was trying to control what you see and think.\n\nParscale made no mention of Fox's decision.\n\nThe president's son, Donald Trump Jr., had tweeted over the weekend, noting CNN's refusal to air the advertisement, that \"I guess they only run fake news and won't talk about real threats that don't suit their agenda.\"\n\nCNN said through that it was made \"abundantly clear\" through its coverage that the ad was racist and declined to air it when the campaign sought to buy airtime.", "The brash shareholder activist Evelyn Y. Davis, who owned stock in more than 80 public companies and rarely failed to make her presence known at corporate-investor meetings, has died. She was 89.\n\nFor decades, Davis was notorious among executives at blue-chip companies for raising a ruckus at annual meetings, sometimes turning the typically staid affairs into yelling matches.\n\nSimultaneously confrontational and flirty, she would demand that a CEO resign, while letting on that she found the executive to be attractive.\n\nDavis relished attention, good or bad.\n\n\"There's no other woman like me!\" she would say. \"There's no other shareholder like me!\"\n\nDavis died Sunday in Washington.\n\nEvelyn Yvonne De Jong was born to a wealthy family in Amsterdam in 1929, two months before the stock market crash pitched the globe into the Great Depression.\n\nWhen World War II swept over Europe, Davis and some members of her immediate family, which had Jewish roots, were interned at a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, a detail confirmed by the International Tracing Service, a respected archive of Holocaust-era documents.\n\nDavis moved to the Baltimore area after the war with her neurologist father, finished her education, and began investing in the 1950s.\n\nIn a biography filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission when she sat on a panel about shareholder rights, she described herself as \"a four times Divorcee with NO children.\"\n\nStocks, she liked to say, were her children.\n\nAnd it seemed she would do anything to advocate and raise attention for what she believed to be the safest path for her investments. She wore a bathing suit to the General Motors meeting in 1970, donned hot pants for another company's meeting and put on a bandolier for a third.\n\nAt United Aircraft, she nominated baseball star Hank Aaron to the board. It was 1974, just after Aaron beat Babe Ruth's home run record.\n\nAs Davis got older, her outfits became less outlandish. She favored expensive suits, always showing up perfectly coiffed. But there was no polishing or toning down her candor. She'd interrupt other shareholders, speak over CEOs, and race to the microphone when the floor was opened for comments so that it was her voice that was heard first.\n\nAt a Home Depot meeting in 2007, she heckled then-CEO Frank Blake. \"You're a phony, Frank!\" she yelled. At Bank of America in 2010, she told CEO Brian Moynihan that he looked like her handsome first ex-husband (three more were to follow). The next year, she chewed out Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein for the regulatory fines that the bank had racked up. She told Blankfein, however, that it wasn't personal ... that he wasn't so bad-looking.\n\n\"That's manipulating the male ego,\" Davis said later. \"I'm very good at that.\"\n\nHer bravado paid off occasionally, and after extended campaigns. In 2005, Macy's mandated that board members stand for re-election every year instead of every three years.\n\nThat had been a 17-year goal for Davis.\n\nDavis consistently ensured her proximity to power. She got herself press credentials to cover White House briefings. When she bought a Jaguar, it was personally delivered by Bill Ford, the great-grandson of the company founder, and also an executive.\n\nShe pushed her annual newsletter, \"Highlights and Lowlights,\" onto the same CEOs she harangued, charging $600 a copy. She insisted that each executive buy two of them.\n\nShe liked to introduce herself as queen of the corporate jungle, and issue press releases about the latest proposals, and latest divorces, of \"Evelyn Y. Davis, Famous Shareholder Activist.\"\n\nIn 2012, when she was 82, Davis failed to attend a single shareholder meeting. And for the first time since 1965, she didn't publish \"Highlights and Lowlights.\"\n\nContacted by The Associated Press that year, Davis explained, \"I'm not so young anymore.\"\n\nNonetheless, in ensuing interviews with the AP, she wanted to be described as \"a woman of mystery and intrigue,\" and asked how dull shareholders meetings had become without her in attendance.\n\nThe inscription on a tombstone that Davis commissioned years ago reads: \"Power is greater than love, and I did not get where I am by standing in line, nor by being shy.\"", "Transcript for Midterms 2018: Why election results are likely to be contested in tight races\n\nThe fight over elected office doesn't necessarily stop after Election Day. Tight races across the country will likely be contested Wu and there's evidence that Americans are increasingly fighting over election results. Richard Hazen a professor of law on political science at the university in California Irvine came up with one estimate. By searching a database of legal cases for specific keywords he found an increase in election challenges. From there were at least 337. Such cases in 2016. Back in 1996 he found a 108.

Furman told lawyers to publicly file summaries of interviews lawyers conducted with key witnesses in the case.\n\n\"Public access to court documents is particularly important in this case given the public interest in it,\" Furman said just before testimony began.\n\nThe first witness \u2014 Duke University Professor D. Sunshine Hillygus \u2014 said there was considerable evidence that adding the question will depress participation by noncitizens.\n\nHillygus, who served six years on the scientific advisory committee for the census, said she has concluded plans by the U.S. government to take steps to prevent damage to the overall count by adding the question are unlikely to be adequate.\n\nThe decision, she said, \"violates the spirit\" of guidelines set up to protect the census and \"undermines not only the accuracy and completeness of the census ... but the integrity.\"\n\nThe trial stems from lawsuits brought by a dozen states and big cities, among others. They say the citizenship question will discourage immigrant participation and dilute political representation and funds for states that tend to vote Democratic.\n\nNew York Attorney General Barbara Underwood attended the trial Monday.\n\nFurman, who is hearing the case without a jury, has harshly criticized the federal government's efforts to delay or stop the trial. He called them remarkable because government officials insist a speedy resolution of lawsuits is necessary so census preparations can proceed.\n\nWhen he took the bench Monday, he acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court said Friday the trial can proceed over the objections of the Justice Department.\n\n\"It came down to the wire but here we are,\" Furman said.\n\nThe Justice Department insists Furman should decide the case based only on the administrative record rather than evidence gathered by the plaintiffs, which includes the deposition of Commerce Department officials and others.\n\nFurman said he will allow evidence to be submitted during the trial before he decides whether it is appropriate to consider it when he issues his opinion.\n\nIn a recent opinion, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas essentially invited Justice Department lawyers to request to stop the trial.\n\nWhen the high court ruled Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross did not have to submit to an immediate deposition, Gorsuch wrote a partial dissent. In it, Gorsuch \u2014 joined by Thomas \u2014 suggested that Furman delay the trial and await further Supreme Court guidance.\n\nFurman struck back in a written decision giving the trial a green light: \"It is the Government's conduct in this case, not the Court's review, that is 'highly unusual, to say the least,'\" he said, highlighting a partial quote from Gorsuch.\n\nGorsuch had written the trial would probe the Commerce secretary's \"mental processes.\"\n\n\"This is all highly unusual, to say the least,\" Gorsuch said.\n\nThree days after Furman ruled, the Justice Department returned to the Supreme Court, seeking to block the trial.", "Amid a wave of female candidates running for office, freshman state representative Ilhan Omar is on track to become the first Somali-American in Congress.\n\nThe former refugee, who was running as a Democrat in Minnesota's left-leaning 5th Congressional District, is projected to win, defeating Republican candidate Jennifer Zielinksi.\n\n\u201cI have always had a very social justice bent approach to everything that I do in my life,\u201d Omar said in an interview with ABC News. \u201cI am a former refugee who grew up in war and understand the kind of trauma that is associated with it.\u201d\n\nKerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBefore scoring her party\u2019s primary victory in August, she made history in Minnesota when she was elected to the state House in 2016, becoming the nation's first Somali-American legislator.\n\nOmar garnered the support of progressive backers including Justice Democrats, MoveOn, and the Bernie Sanders' legacy political organization, Our Revolution.

Above all, the European Commission is extending a hand to Italy and I would like Italy to grasp that hand.\"\n\nItaly's debt load is the second highest in Europe, after Greece. Many are concerned about financial turmoil in Europe if Italy loses control of its finances, but the government says a sharp increase in spending is needed to jumpstart economic growth.\n\nItaly has Europe's fourth-largest economy and the bloc would struggle to bail it out.\n\nEU Economy Commissioner Pierre Moscovici recalled that Italy has until Nov. 13 to submit a new budget plan. The European Commission will rule on that plan, as well as the others in Europe, on Nov. 21.\n\n\"When a member does not respect the rules it has an impact on the others,\" Moscovici said.\n\nAsked whether some deal or compromise could be found between Brussels and Rome, Moscovici said: \"No. We're not in a negotiation. We're not in a discussion. The rules are the rules.\"\n\nHe recalled that the cost of servicing Italian public debt is already equal to the country's entire spending on education \u2014 65 billion euros ($74 billion) a year, or about 1,000 euros per citizen.\n\nThe budget dispute leaves many uneasy. EU countries have agreed to allow the commission to supervise their budget plans and take legal steps against those who refuse. But countries still determine their spending priorities and Italy's government appears determined to go its own way.\n\nDutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra backed the budget supervision process but he would not speculate about what Italy might do or what response might be needed if it refuses to submit a new plan.\n\n\"This is a dialogue between the Commission and Italy.

Piles reeking of rotting waste spill out of dumpsters and climb waist-high as garbage trucks fail to appear for days and even weeks.\n\nOne of the most basic functions of city government \u2014 trash collection \u2014 has become a serious problem in one of Latin America's most spectacular cities, which celebrates the 500th anniversary of its founding next year.\n\nIn the Atares neighborhood just outside Old Havana, Daysi Boza, 71, sleeps with a stick laid across the bottom of her door to keep out rats that feed on the trash spilling from the four big garbage bins feet from her door.\n\n\"I can't even remember how many years this has gone on,\" she said. \"Every day it's filthy, stinking \u2014 a pigsty.\"\n\nThe root cause appears to be the cash crunch affecting Cuba's entire government, leaving infrastructure crumbling, suppliers unpaid and state-run businesses without the inputs needed to produce basic goods.\n\nCuban officials blame the six-decade U.S. embargo for strangling its economy. The government's critics point to the inefficiency and pervasive small-scale corruption in one of the word's last centrally planned economies.\n\nOfficials say Havana has fewer than half of the 100 garbage trucks it needs to conduct daily trash pickups for the city's 2 million residents. Many of those trucks, mostly Chinese-made, regularly are out of service due to a lack of spare parts.\n\n\"I'm surprised \u2014 I expect to see crumbling buildings, but not so much trash,\" said Rosario Aneas, a 38-year-old art professor from Spain on a short trip to Cuba. \"It's affects the image of Cuba, mars it, and it's a shame for such a beautiful city.\"\n\nAggravating the problem is the fact that virtually no Havana residents use trash bags, which are difficult to find and even when available are hard to afford on a state salary of about $30 a month.\n\nInstead of bags, people collect trash in plastic paint buckets that they empty into dumpsters that sit on most street corners in Havana. Because the bins are filled with loose trash, they spill over and reeking garbage piles up as soon as a truck misses a few days' pickups.\n\nThe problem is so serious that Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has gotten involved, saying at a recent meeting that his government should look for foreign investors to help fix the trash crisis.\n\nHis administration hopes to create a $100 million company controlled by the Cuban government with a minority share held by foreign investors to handle Havana's 2,400 tons of daily trash, earning money by recycling and producing energy from landfill gas.\n\nForeign Investment Minister Rodrigo Malmierca told The Associated Press recently that the government had negotiated with a Spanish business but the talks fell through and Cuba is now talking with other potential partners.\n\nThe trash problem worsened after 2010 economic reforms that allowed Cubans to buy and sell houses and start small businesses in their homes. Instead of paying for professional carting as required by the city, many works crews simply dump sacks full of rubble alongside the nearest trash bin.\n\nMany Habaneros dump their domestic trash on top of the rubble, creating mountains of foul-smelling refuse.\n\n\"Some people throw bags of trash from the fifth floor window,\" said Luis Alberto Martinez, a 50-year-old messenger.\n\nThe head of the municipal government said in May that along with new trucks, Havana needed 12,000 new dumpsters to handle the trash problem.\n\nDozens of Cuban have been arrested in recent years for stealing the big metal bins and cutting them up in workshops to make improvised tubes and other goods in a country with shortages of virtually every product.\n\nCuban authorities say they are hopeful that 60 trash trucks donated by Japan will arrive by the end of the year to help alleviate the problem.\n\nMeanwhile, Habaneros on every side of the trash problem are growing frustrated.\n\n\"People are really undisciplined,\" said Victor Leon, a city worker in a crew of six men, some prisoners on work release, picking up trash that had fallen on the street as a garbage truck emptied bins in the Cerro neighborhood.\n\n\"We're cleaning up around the dumpsters, but you'll see, in 45 minutes this will look just as bad.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAndrea Rodr\u00edguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP", "ABC News will be covering the 2018 midterms election using a custom-made 360-degree stage \u2014 complete with an augmented-reality experience.\n\nInterested in Midterm Elections?

The complicated dance requires collaboration between the editorial, studios and graphics teams as real-time data comes into ABC News headquarters from across the country.\n\nABC News\n\nThe AR images are projected \"thorough the combination of an optical tracking system mounted to our studio cameras communicating with our real-time 3D graphics system,\" Gargle said. \"There is a web of tracking markers, essentially reflective stickers, that have been applied to the lighting grid and the set pieces that are in the ceiling. The tracking system uses those markers in conjunction with sensors attached to the cameras to calculate where the camera is in 'space'. This data is sent to our graphics system, which maps the graphics to the proper place in 'real' space so it appears that the graphic is in the room.\"\n\nABC News\n\nThe team developed a three-dimensional image of the U.S. Capitol and seats within the House and Senate chambers to display real-time election result data.\n\nABC News has been experimenting with AR for a while now.

It has also become a haven for armed groups, including several from neighboring countries, which survive on looting and human trafficking.\n\nThe Netherlands and Sweden pushed for including \"planning, directing or committing acts involving sexual and gender-based violence\" as criteria for sanctions, citing the increasingly worrying problem in Libya especially against migrants trying to reach Europe.\n\nDutch Ambassador Karel Van Oostrom told the council after the vote that such violence \"is directly connected to the issues of peace and security we are discussing today.\"\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia strongly disagreed, saying sexual and gender-based violence is a crime that is dealt with by national governments and is considered at the U.N. Human Rights Council and the Commission on the Status of Women. It is not a threat to international peace and security that the Security Council should deal with, he said.\n\n\"We are under the impression that the countries pushing this into the Security Council agenda are attempting to gain domestic political capital through the imposition of sanctions regimes against other states,\" Nebenzia said. \"The facts of such crimes perpetrated against migrants in Libya only confirm our premise that the most effective means of combatting this scourge is eradicating the relevant criminal networks.\"\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador Jonathan Cohen said the resolution should have been adopted unanimously and \"be sending a clear message to the Libyan people \u2014 that we are united behind you and that we on the Security Council will hold Libyan spoilers to account for their actions.\"\n\nIn June, the Security Council voted unanimously to impose sanctions on six leaders of criminal networks engaged in human trafficking and migrant smuggling from Libya, and in September it slapped sanctions on Libyan militia leader Ibrahim Jadran for attacking Libyan oil facilities in the summer.\n\nThe resolution adopted Monday extended authorization for U.N. member states to board suspect vessels and return illegally seized oil to the Libyan government until Feb. 15, 2020.

Ted Cruz and Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke scraped their polarized bases for any last voters in a burst of final rallies in liberal big cities and Trump-loving suburbs.\n\nIn Texas, where nearly 4.9 million early voters has already surpassed turnout in the previous midterm elections , O'Rourke and Cruz delivered their anxious supporters similar warnings in a state unaccustomed to close calls: far bigger numbers were still needed.\n\n\"We're going to see tomorrow record-breaking Democratic turnout,\" Cruz told a crowd in Pearland, a typical Republican stronghold outside Houston, while imploring them to each get five people they know to the polls Tuesday.\n\n\"That's what it's going to take. Because we know the far-left is angry and they are coming after jobs, they are coming after freedom, they are coming after security.\"\n\nPolls have shown a surprisingly tight race in Texas, which hasn't elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 30 years. For Cruz, the stop in a Pearland megachurch was what he called his 48th campaign rally in six weeks \u2014 a defensive campaign blitz on Texas' conservative turf that even a year ago would've seemed unnecessary.\n\nBut O'Rourke's supercharged, expectation-defying campaign that took him to each of Texas' 254 counties and raised a blockbuster $70 million has made the race one of the most closely watched in the country heading into Tuesday's deeply divisive midterm elections, which President Donald Trump is calling a referendum on his combative presidency.\n\nFor nearly a year, O'Rourke has run as a genial and proudly liberal antidote to the Trump-era GOP and reaffirmed in the closing weeks of his underdog bid that he would vote to impeach, a position that even most Democrats have avoided.\n\nO'Rourke began his final full day of campaigning in Houston and Dallas, Texas' biggest Democratic cities, before making his way home to El Paso.\n\nHis last appeals to voters included more humane immigration policies at a time when Trump has sent troops to the border and issued dire warnings about a caravan of immigrants, mostly from Central America, walking through Mexico and slowly toward the U.S. border.\n\n\"At the time they seek to divide us and polarize us and scare us about one another it's precisely at that moment that Texas stands up,\" he said. \"Not as Democrats, not as Republicans, but as Americans and, as human beings, to rewrite this country's immigration policies.\"\n\nDemocrats have been shut out of statewide office in Texas since the 1990s and recent elections haven't even been close. But at the same time, turnout in Texas so far has also been nothing like recent elections.\n\nThe final tally Tuesday could be more in line with presidential years that typically draw higher levels of turnout. Nearly 9 million people voted in 2016, when Trump won Texas by 9 points, making him the first Republican presidential candidate in two decades to not carry the state by double digits.\n\nSingle-digit U.S. Senate races are even rarer in Texas \u2014 the last one happened in 1978.\n\nO'Rourke is planning to cast his own vote Tuesday in El Paso, where he has been a three-term congressman.

In his first outright criticism of the uprising, he said last month it was the \"wrong remedy that followed a wrong diagnosis.\"\n\nBut his comments at the youth forum provided his most detailed assessment of the uprising, which pro-government media routinely demonize as a foreign conspiracy to destroy the country.\n\nThe 2011 uprising was led by young, pro-democracy activists, and paved the way for Egypt's first free and fair elections, which were won by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group whose stalwart Mohammed Morsi was elected president in 2012. His rule proved divisive, and in 2013 el-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military overthrow of Morsi amid mass protests.\n\nSince then, the government has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands of Islamists along with some of the most prominent activists behind the 2011 uprising. Authorities have rolled back all the freedoms gained through the uprising, banning unauthorized protests and silencing most independent media. El-Sissi was re-elected earlier this year in a vote in which all potentially viable opponents were either jailed or withdrew under pressure.\n\nHe has defended his actions by saying they spared Egypt the fate of Syria, Yemen and Libya, where Arab Spring uprisings led to civil war.\n\nOn Sunday, he said the uprising created a \"massive vacuum that only the evil people can fill\" and warned against a repeat. He said Egyptians and others in the region would be better off under \"not so good\" rulers than living through chaos.\n\n\"Work, be patient, endure and suffer under the reality that you disapprove of, but don't ruin your countries because they will never return to what they once were,\" he warned.\n\nSince taking office, el-Sissi has slashed costly state subsidies on basic goods and introduced new taxes while spending billions of dollars on infrastructure projects. His economic reforms helped Egypt secure $12 billion in bailout loans from the International Monetary Fund, but have caused a steep rise in the prices of food, fuel and services.\n\n\"After all the effort we have done, all that we are hoping for is that we go back to where we were before 2011,\" he said.", "Three Girl Scouts who were killed in an alleged hit-and-run this weekend have been identified as police claim the 21-year-old suspected driver admitted to \"huffing\" right before the deadly crash.\n\nJayna Kelley, 9; Autumn Helgeson, 10; Haylee Hickle, 10, and her mother, Sara Jo Schneider, 32, were all killed when they were hit by a car while picking up trash along a Wisconsin county highway shortly before noon Saturday, said Lake Hallie police.\n\nThe driver had veered out of his lane, crossed over the center line and ultimately drove into a ditch, police said.\n\nAnother 10-year-old girl was struck and is in the hospital in stable condition, police said.\n\nAll members of the group -- seven children and five adults -- \"were in the ditch, not on the pavement or gravel shoulder at the time of the crash\" and were \"wearing green highly visible safety vests,\" police said.\n\nJeff Wheeler/Star Tribune via AP\n\nThe suspected driver, 21-year-old Colten Treu of Chippewa Falls, fled but later turned himself in several hours later, police said.\n\nTreu and his passenger, who also turned himself in, allegedly told police that right before the crash they \"had been intentionally inhaling chemical vapors,\" also known as \"huffing.\"\n\nChippewa County Wis.

Both men were dual French-Syrian citizens who lived in Syria.\n\nThe Syrian government never gave a reason for their detentions nor the specific causes of their deaths. Patrick Dabbagh was 20-years-old when he died weeks after his arrest; his father was 58, according to a death certificate that had November 2017 listed as when he died.\n\nMonday's announcement of the arrest warrant came from the International Federation for Human Rights, which brought a case on behalf of the men's' family in October 2016. At the time, the family only knew they were arrested and imprisoned by Syrian Air Force intelligence officers in November 2013.\n\nThe warrants name two of Syria's most powerful security chiefs: Gen.

The federal government had rescinded that ban, and the Trump administration is seeking to block California's effort as an imposition on federal prerogatives.\n\nThough net neutrality started off more than a decade ago as an insight into how to make networks work most efficiently, it has taken on much larger social and political dimensions lately. The issue has emerged as an anti-monopoly rallying point and even a focus for \"resistance\" to the Trump administration.\n\n\"Any time the cable companies and the Trump administration are on one side, it looks good for companies to be on the other side,\" Boston Law School professor Daniel Lyons said.\n\nBut the idea hasn't always been political or partisan. Net neutrality traces back to an engineering maxim called the \"end-to-end principle,\" a self-regulating network that put control in the hands of end users rather than a central authority. Traditional cable-TV services, for instance, required special equipment and controlled what channels are shown on TV. With an end-to-end network like the internet, the types of equipment, apps, articles and video services permitted are limited only to imagination.\n\nAnd the internet subsequently grew like nobody's business \u2014 largely because it wasn't anyone's business.\n\nBut as internet use expanded, so did the power of the big companies that offer internet service to the masses. It became clear that they could, and sometimes would, restrict what people did. The Associated Press found in 2007 that Comcast was blocking or slowing down some file-sharing. AT&T blocked Skype and other internet-calling services on the iPhone until 2009.\n\nLaw professor Tim Wu, now at Columbia University, coined the term \"net neutrality\" in 2003 to argue for government rules that would prevent big internet providers from discriminating against technology and services that clashed with other aspects of their business. Allowing such discrimination, he reasoned, would choke off innovation.\n\nBig telecommunications companies, on the other hand, argue that they should be able to control the pipes they built and owned.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission subscribed to the principle of net neutrality for over a decade and enshrined that as specific rules in 2015 under chairman Tom Wheeler, an Obama appointee. Among the rules: Broadband companies couldn't block websites and apps of their choosing. Nor could they charge Netflix and other video services extra to reach viewers more smoothly.\n\nOnce President Donald Trump took office, net neutrality became one of his first targets as part of broader government deregulation. The FCC chairman he appointed, Ajit Pai, made rollback a top priority.\n\nAnd thus net neutrality became increasingly political. As a vote loomed for months, the once-obscure concept was debated endlessly on talk shows and online chats. Big-time Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes tweeted a link to a story about saving net-neutrality on her lifestyle website. Actor Mark Ruffalo urged people to contact members of Congress by tweeting, \"Long live cute dog videos on YouTube! #RIPinternet.\"\n\nThe debate created strange bedfellows: Support for net neutrality comes from many of the same people who are also critical of the data-sucking tech giants who benefit from it.\n\nYet on net neutrality, these tech companies got to be the \"good guy,\" siding on the side of the younger \"digital first\" generation and consumer groups calling for more protection. No matter that these companies are keeping their own business interests at heart, as a net-neutrality rollback could mean higher costs for access to the \"pipes.\"\n\nPoliticians glommed on to the debate to appear consumer friendly.\n\n\"No politician will ever lose votes by supporting net neutrality,\" said Gus Hurwitz, law professor at the University of Nebraska and a member of the conservative group The Federalist Society. \"It's an ill-defined term that voters don't really understand other than that it is a scary concept they know they don't want to lose.\"\n\nMeanwhile, ISPs haven't done themselves any favors in appealing to the consumer. They've long had a reputation for bad service and high prices. Unlike the high-profile support for net neutrality, the opposition was limited to behind-the-scenes lobbying.\n\nNonetheless, the FCC rolled back the net-neutrality rules last December on a 3-2 party-line vote. The decision took effect in June.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear appeals from the broadband industry to strike down a lower court ruling in 2016 that was in favor of net neutrality. That effectively shut down an appeal that had already become largely moot when the FCC rolled back the rules. But in other arenas the fight is likely to drag on.\n\nSeveral tech companies including Mozilla and Vimeo are challenging the FCC's rollback decision in a federal appeals court. That's separate from the challenge to the California law, which is on hold until the tech companies' lawsuit is resolved. Oral arguments in the tech companies' case are expected in February.\n\nOregon, Washington and Vermont have also approved legislation related to net neutrality.\n\nAnd a Democratic takeover of the House in Tuesday's midterm elections could revive efforts to enact net neutrality into federal law, though Trump would likely veto any such attempts.\n\n\"Net neutrality is only the fifth round of a 12-round boxing match,\" Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives said.", "U.S. services firms expanded at a slightly slower rate in October, after achieving a record pace in September in a sign of the economy's strength and endurance.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management, which is composed of purchasing managers, reported Monday that its services index dipped to 60.3 in October, down from 61.6 in September.

He became a national symbol of the Communist era's brutality against its own people, most of whom who had simply fallen afoul of the regime.\n\nRomania had about 500,000 political prisoners under the Communist regime that was in power from 1947 until 1989, about one-fifth of whom died while in detention, according to historians.\n\nVisinescu died Monday at Rahova prison hospital, Bianca Filote, a spokeswoman for the Institute for Investigating the Crimes of Communism, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"He will forever be known as the torturer adopted by the communist Securitate secret police to kill. He ended the lives of defenseless human beings, physically and mentally,\" Andrei Muraru, who initiated the investigation into Visinescu's conduct in 2013, told the AP.\n\nVisinescu was convicted in 2015 for the abuse and killing of prisoners at Ramnicu Sarat prison in eastern Romania, where he was in command from 1956 to 1963. He was imprisoned in February 2016 after losing his appeal.\n\nFormer prisoners under Visinescu testified that they were denied access to medical treatment, heating, exercise and adequate food. They were held in solitary confinement and beatings were common. The prison housed members of Romania's intellectual, political and military elite.\n\n\"He annihilated his victims in a sadistic program of physical and mental alienation, total isolation combined with physical torture,\" said Muraru.\n\nDuring his trial, Visinescu showed no remorse and insisted he was only following orders. A judge and prosecutor asked him six times why inmates died under his command. He answered just once, suggesting they died of old age.\n\nAt his final hearing, he wept and pleaded: \"Let me die!\"\n\nMuraru, a historian who is now an adviser to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, said Visinescu would remain \"the unmistakable face of the torturer, who was able to hide for half a century due to the ... post-communist system that protected him.\"\n\nHis lawyer, Camelia Niculescu, said Romania's current authorities wanted her client to die in prison.\n\nFuneral arrangements were not immediately available.", "The widow of the late Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha has described a government decision to tear down her apartment building for a road as \"fascist.\"\n\nDita daily newspaper quoted 97-year-old Nexhmije Hoxha on Monday saying occupants were told to vacate the building within days.

It was a late twist to a saga that has contributed to the administration's unpopularity.\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, demanded Hans-Georg Maassen's removal from the BfV spy agency in September after he appeared to downplay far-right violence against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.\n\nThe haggling that followed reflected poorly on a coalition already notorious for squabbling. Its leaders first agreed to make Maassen a deputy interior minister, technically a promotion with a pay rise, but renegotiated the deal in the face of a backlash.\n\nThey then agreed to make him a \"special adviser\" to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer.\n\nOn Monday, Seehofer said that he was sending the 55-year-old Maassen into early retirement instead. That was prompted, he said, by the manuscript of a speech in which Maassen used \"unacceptable formulations\" that made continuing to work with him impossible \"in whatever function.\"\n\nSeehofer said that Thomas Haldenwang, Maassen's deputy at the BfV, will take on Maassen's duties until there is a decision on a permanent successor.\n\nGerman media reported that, in the manuscript of a farewell speech to European counterparts in mid-October, Maassen alleged that \"radical left-wing forces\" in the Social Democrats wanted to use his comments as an excuse to end a governing coalition they never wanted to join.\n\nHe also said that he was known as a \"critic of idealistic, naive and left-wing policy on foreigners and security.\" Seehofer said those remarks \"crossed a line.\"\n\nSeehofer, the leader of the conservative Christian Social Union party, had previously defended Maassen. He said he heard about the speech on Friday and was \"personally disappointed.\"\n\nThe saga started with Maassen's response to violent right-wing protests following the killing of a German man, allegedly by migrants, in Chemnitz.

Deben Tchoffo said the students abducted Sunday night were ages 11-17, and they were taken from Nkwen, a village near the regional capital, Bamenda, along with school staff that included the principal.\n\n\"It is rather unfortunate that this is happening, that 79 of our children and three of their staff can be picked up by terrorists,\" Tchoffo said. \"We have asked our military to do everything and bring back the kids alive.\"\n\nA video purporting to show the kidnapped students was posted on social media from a group of men who call themselves \"Amba boys,\" a reference to the state of Ambazonia that armed separatists want to establish in Cameroon's Anglophone North West and South West regions.\n\nIn the video, men who identified themselves as the kidnappers forced several boys to give their names and those of their parents. The boys also said they were taken by the armed men late Sunday and didn't know where they were being held.\n\nThe men in the video said they would only release the students once the goal of creating a new state is achieved.\n\n\"We shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\" the men said. The video could not be independently verified, but parents said on social media they recognized their children in the recording.\n\nFighting between the military and separatists increased after the government clamped down on peaceful demonstrations by English-speaking teachers and lawyers protesting what they said were their marginalization by Cameroon's French-speaking majority.\n\nHundreds have been killed in the past year.\n\nThe separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions as part of the strategy for creating a breakaway state. They have attacked civilians who do not support their cause, including teachers who were killed for disobeying orders to keep schools closed.\n\nThere have been kidnappings at other schools, but the group taken Sunday was the largest number abducted at one time in Cameroon's Anglophone regions. The separatists also have set fire to at least 100 schools and driven out students and teachers from buildings taken over as training grounds.\n\n\"These appalling abductions show just how the general population is paying the highest price as violence escalates in the Anglophone region,\" said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa. \"The abduction of schoolchildren and teachers can never be justified.\"\n\nAmnesty International expressed solidarity with the students' families and demanded \"that the Cameroon authorities do everything in their power to ensure all the pupils and school staff are freed unharmed.\"\n\nLast week, separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in southwestern Cameroon, allegedly chopping off their fingers because the men defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the North West region near its capital, Bamenda, when he was shot in the head amid fighting between separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes after President Paul Biya won a seventh term last month in an election the U.S. said was marked by irregularities.

The results Monday dashed the ruling party's ambitions for greater power nationally and showed the flaws of the party's courtship of the far right.\n\nIn mayoral races in 649 cities, towns and smaller municipalities, official results released Monday showed that Poland's ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, in power since 2015, won no big city and only a handful of the smaller cities. The largest city captured by the conservatives was Zamosc, population 65,000.\n\nMichal Szuldrzynski, a leading editor with the Rzeczpospolita daily, said Law and Justice's results in the mid-size cities \u2014 normally bastions of the political right \u2014 were \"catastrophic\" for the governing party. He argued in an opinion piece the results indicated that Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the ruling party have \"failed to regain a moderate center and build up support among the middle class.\"\n\nAmong the factors that have alienated many voters are Morawiecki's \"flirting with the most radical part of the electorate,\" with gestures and words meant to appeal to far-right nationalists, Szuldrzynski argued.\n\nHe also listed disputes with the European Union over rule of law issues and a controversial Holocaust speech law early this year that sparked a clash with Israel, which in his view was Poland's most serious diplomatic crisis since communism fell in 1989.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Donald Tusk, now head of the European Council, said in Warsaw that he was \"very surprised\" by the scale of Law and Justice's defeat in smaller cities. He said the result was a warning to the ruling party and a boost to the opposition Civic Platform party, which he used to lead.\n\nIn the first round of local voting on Oct. 21, an opposition coalition led by the centrist Civic Platform won outright in the capital, Warsaw, and in other key cities, including Wroclaw, Poznan and Lodz.\n\nIn runoff races Sunday, voters handed landslide victories to opposition politicians in other prestigious cities, including Krakow, Gdansk and Kielce.\n\nWhile the opposition celebrated Monday, ruling party leaders sought to keep the focus on the party's strong showing in Poland's regional assemblies two weeks ago.\n\nLaw and Justice \"won the local elections of 2018,\" the deputy culture minister, Jaroslaw Sellin, told TVN24. \"It won them like nobody has managed to do yet.\"\n\nThe mayoral results, however, clearly reflected the strong opposition of urban Poles to Law and Justice, which has been accused of violating democratic standards with attempts to take control of the courts and turn public media into a party propaganda tool. The Law and Justice government has also been in frequent conflict with the EU over democratic standards.\n\nThe results in Poland's mayoral races have proven a boost to Civic Platform and other opposition parties. However, many analysts warned that their relatively decent showing resulted largely from votes against the ruling party, and said that if the opposition wants a chance of governing the country it will need to increase its appeal. The opposition's defeat in some places to independent candidates seemed to reflect their vulnerability.\n\nOverall, the local election highlighted the deep political divisions in Poland.\n\nOn one side are urban, liberal Poles who feel that the ruling populists are destroying their country's hard-won democracy.\n\nOn the other are conservatives \u2014 often older, rural and less educated voters \u2014 who appreciate the ruling party's attempts to preserve traditional Catholic values and resist what they feel are corrupting influences from Western Europe.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMonika Scislowska in Warsaw contributed.", "Ferrari says its net earnings doubled in the third quarter thanks mostly to one-off tax benefit.\n\nThe sports car maker said Monday that net earnings were 287 million euros ($327 million) compared with 141 million euros a year earlier.\n\nThe company said earnings grew 5 percent when excluding the so-called patent box tax break, agreed on with Italian authorities, covering use of copyrights, patents, trademarks, design and know-how.\n\nDeliveries were up 11 percent to 2,262 vehicles driven by sales of the 812 Superfast and the Ferrari Portofino, with revenues flat at 838 million euros.\n\nEurope and Middle East sales were up by double digits to 1,005.

Five years on from the last, Bono says big strides in prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS are threatened by a slackening of global resolve.\n\n\"We could be at the dumbest moment ever, which is we're almost at the moon and we turn back,\" Bono told The Associated Press by phone from Dublin.\n\nAlmost 37 million people worldwide have HIV, with nearly 22 million of them receiving antiretroviral therapy, the most effective form of treatment, according to UNAIDS. The number of annual infections has fallen by almost half since 1996, to 1.8 million, and the number of deaths has halved since 2004.\n\nBono says the results are the product of \"incredible leadership from around the world\" that has made the elimination of the disease a realistic prospect.\n\n\"There's this gathering consensus and momentum \u2014 and now people are looking the other way, and it's just the wrong moment,\" he said.\n\nTo help draw attention back to the cause, Bono turned to two influential artists whose work, he says, \"has a social-justice core.\" The auction is curated by British architect David Adjaye, who designed the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and U.S. artist Theaster Gates, who runs artistic and social projects from his base on Chicago's south side.\n\nAdopting the theme \"light,\" the pair has assembled more than 50 lots from artists, architects and designers, including Ai Weiwei, Jeff Koons, Yinka Shonibare and Sean Scully. Design pieces include sneakers by Christian Louboutin; a curvy coffee table by the late Zaha Hadid; and a ring carved from a whole diamond, created by Apple Inc. design chief Jony Ive and industrial designer Mark Newson.\n\nAdjaye is offering items he's designed including a concrete speaker \u2014 in red, naturally \u2014 and Gates has contributed one of a series of tapestries made from strips of used fire hose.\n\n\"We wanted to re-shed light on this subject matter, metaphorically,\" said Adjaye, who also worries that the world's attention has strayed from AIDS, and other crises.\n\n\"I think our collective sense of civil society is very much under siege,\" he said. \"That creates a kind of 'not my problem' attitude, and I think we have to counter that.\"\n\nMoney raised by the auction will go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and to Gates' Rebuild Foundation, which works with deprived communities in Chicago.\n\nOne criticism sometimes made of charities like (RED), which has persuaded big companies including Bank of America, Starbucks and Apple to promote AIDS awareness, is that its work lets politicians and governments off the hook.\n\nBono argues that \"the point is to put them back on the hook.\"\n\n\"Making something popular makes the politicians have to pay attention,\" he said. \"And we're going to need that more than ever\" in an era of growing nationalism.\n\n\"Women are the rising category (of infections) at the moment, and whilst the world is looking the other way in this rather childish fight among strongmen across the world, these budgets are being cut and women are paying the highest price.\n\n\"It's really deeply upsetting for us all,\" he added. \"Because we were really getting excited. We thought, we're at the point of inflection. And now we hear, 'No, no. We're going to cut these budgets.' It's not just America. A lot of countries are putting themselves first.

Scientists raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.\n\nAs a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century.\n\n\"It's really good news,\" said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\"\n\nHigh in the atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. Use of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine, began eating away at the ozone. In 1987, countries around the world agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and businesses came up with replacements for spray cans and other uses.\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10 percent of the upper ozone layer was depleted, said Newman. Since 2000, it has increased by about 1 to 3 percent per decade, the report said.\n\nThis year, the ozone hole over the South Pole peaked at nearly 9.6 million square miles (24.8 million square kilometers). That's about 16 percent smaller than the biggest hole recorded \u2014 11.4 million square miles (29.6 million square kilometers) in 2006.\n\nThe hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next Southern Hemisphere spring, Newman said.\n\nThe ozone layer starts at about 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Earth and stretches for nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers); ozone is a colorless combination of three oxygen atoms.\n\nIf nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, Newman said.\n\nBut it's not a complete success yet, said University of Colorado's Brian Toon, who wasn't part of the report.\n\n\"We are only at a point where recovery may have started,\" Toon said, pointing to some ozone measurements that haven't increased yet.\n\nAnother problem is that new technology has found an increase in emissions of a banned CFC out of East Asia, the report noted.\n\nOn its own, the ozone hole has slightly shielded Antarctica from the much larger effects of global warming \u2014 it has heated up but not as much as it likely would without ozone depletion, said Ross Salawitch, a University of Maryland atmospheric scientist who co-authored the report.\n\nSo a healed ozone layer will worsen man-made climate change there a bit, Newman said.\n\nScientists don't know how much a healed ozone hole will further warm Antarctica, but they do know the immediate effects of ozone depletion on the world and human health, so \"it would be incredibly irresponsible not to do this,\" Salawitch said.\n\nAnd the replacements now being used to cool cars and refrigerators need to be replaced themselves with chemicals that don't worsen global warming, Newman said. An amendment to the Montreal Protocol that goes into effect next year would cut use of some of those gases.\n\n\"I don't think we can do a victory lap until 2060,\" Newman said. \"That will be for our grandchildren to do.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

He had dived into the water to give the woman her turn on the board when he was attacked, O'Connell said.\n\nThere were more than a dozen yachts in the harbor at the time. French-speaking tourists launched a dinghy from their yacht and rescued the man, O'Connell said.\n\nThey brought the victim to his own yacht, where most of the group had medical backgrounds, including two doctors.\n\n\"Despite their best efforts, the injuries were too severe,\" O'Connell told reporters.\n\nThe victim was taken by helicopter to the Mackay Base Hospital, 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the south, where he died.\n\n\"CPR was ongoing for a very long time and every solid effort was made to save that man's life,\" O'Connell said, referring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n\"They did everything imaginable to try to save the man. It's just \u2014 the injuries were so severe,\" he added.\n\nA 46-year-old tourist, Justine Barwick, was attacked on Sept. 19 while swimming from a yacht in Cid Harbor and is recovering.

We simply do not know why this is occurring and what is responsible for it,\"Gschwind said.\n\nThe species of sharks involved in the attacks have not been identified.\n\nPolice and fisheries boats were patrolling Cid Harbor on Tuesday and advising tourists on yachts to keep out of the water, O'Connell said.\n\nAuthorities killed six sharks in the Cid Harbor area in a week following the September attacks in a bid to reduce their numbers in the popular tourist location. Critics argued that killing sharks was not the answer.\n\nGschwind called for a science-based response to the latest tragedy.\n\nAustralia had not experienced a fatal shark attack since April 17 last year and it has averaged fewer than two deadly shark attacks per year in recent decades.", "The same storm system that dumped up to 16 inches of snow from Wyoming to Colorado, shutting down major roads, is heading for the Mississippi River Valley.\n\nInterested in Weather?

What could have been a nuanced and complicated battle for the midterms -- over policy disagreements, about who deserves credit for a booming economy, the direction of the country from here -- has come down to barbed wire and caravans, and the president's declaration that Democrats stand for \"more crime and less jobs.\"\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nIn outlining the choices this simply, Trump has motivated both parties to engage. Democrats hold an 8-point edge among likely voters in the generic ballot, according to the new ABC News/Washington Post poll -- on the cusp of what they would need to guarantee themselves the House on Election Day.\n\nTrump has done what he can to make the elections personal -- about himself and about the Democrats he's maligning.\n\nThis political era has been defined by the contradictions and complexities of the president. Yet the choice for voters remains as simple as he wants it to be.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks\n\n\"Text less.

Jones/Athens Banner-Herald via AP\n\nWe learned about the investigation in an abnormal and brief press release. Kemp's election officials immediately identified a suspect, the Democratic Party of Georgia, and then announced an investigation, adding the FBI and DHS were alerted, but provided no evidence of why Kemp's opponents were the sole suspect.\n\nKemp has made similar accusations in the past, in December of 2016, when he accused the Obama Administration's DHS of attempting to hack their systems.

It was reduced to a few walls and rubble, as various debris ended up strewn among nearby trees.\n\nThe family was staying in a second residence when the mansion exploded.

The debut installation opera \"Paradise Interrupted\" is an international co-production with New York's Lincoln Center Festival, the Spoleto Festival USA and the Singapore International Festival of Arts. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Gustavo Dudamel, who conducts in Taiwan for the first time, will perform in the venue's vineyard-style concert hall.\n\nThe center, which opened last month, was built over eight years at a cost of NT$10.7 billion ($350 million) on the site of a former military barracks in Kaohsiung, a southern city of about 2.8 million people. Residents still call the new center by the name of the military camp, Weiwyuing.\n\nPerformers are seeing the new venue as an opportunity.\n\n\"Not many people can say that they have performed\" at Weiwyuing, said Chloe Young, a member of the Sydney Dance Company. She said it was an honor to be dancing there. \"And I think it's really gonna boost my career, saying I performed in Taiwan, in an amazing theater, amazing facility, and I feel super super lucky.\"\n\nThe design by Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo reflects the port city's tropical location and maritime links. It includes an undulating white roof and a large public space with hoists and other cargo ship features.\n\n\"I think what is really unique is this roof, what was inspired by the banyan trees with the crown,\" said Francine Houben, the creative director of Mecanoo. \"I had to create a really new public space specifically for Taiwan, for Kaohsiung, that catches the wind of the ocean and the ventilation of the tropical space.\"\n\nThe concert hall has the biggest pipe organ in Asia with 9,085 pipes.

Initial results for 12 races showed it had won six seats, and the delayed result for the 13th race, for a lower house constitutency in western Chin State, gave it its seventh victory.\n\nThe results for Saturday's polls showed the NLD generally retaining support in the country's heartland, but yielding seats to parties representing ethnic minorities in the areas where they live, mostly in border regions.\n\nThe NLD won a landslide victory in the 2015 general election, when there was wide-ranging popular support to end decades of military rule. But minority groups have been disappointed that the government of NLD leader Suu Kyi has failed to meet their demands for greater autonomy and a halt to aggressive army activities in their territories.\n\nWhile the results of the small number of races have a negligible effect on the political balance of power, the contests were being watched for trends ahead of the next general election in 2020.\n\nThe return of voters to ethnic minority parties representing their interests had already been seen in another set of by-elections last year. What this year's polls seemed to underline was the danger to the NLD of a weak voter turnout, which was probably behind the upset defeat of an NLD candidate for a Yangon regional parliament seat.\n\nThat contest was won by a representative of the Union Solidarity and Development Party, the country's main political grouping after the NLD. The military-backed USDP won three seats in Saturday's polls.\n\nSuu Kyi's appeal with the country's Buddhist majority has not suffered much from a crisis involving 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority who fled a brutal army counterinsurgency campaign in the country's west.

He says he was tipped off by a concerned Georgia voter and does not believe the Democratic Party had anything to do with it.\n\n\"All Kemp has done is exactly what he wanted to do,\" Cross said, \"which is to make the narrative about the Democratic Party instead of everyone focusing on the fact that there is potentially a serious vulnerability in the system and that he just let it go.\"\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said Kemp's asking for the investigation is pure politics.\n\n\"This political stunt from Kemp, just days before the election, is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor,\" DeHart said.\n\nKemp has not commented beyond his office's initial statement saying that Democrats are under investigation, while offering no evidence.\n\nJohn Amis/AP\n\n4.

He said the U.S. \"unilateral\" decision affects the world.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nIsrael's prime minister is lauding the newly restored U.S. sanctions against Iran as \"historic,\" saying they will \"strangle\" what he described as Iranian state-sponsored terrorism.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu said Monday at parliament that the Trump administration's decision to restore sanctions was already having an effect. He called the move \"a big day for the state of Israel.\"\n\nIsrael has been a fierce opponent of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which the U.S. withdrew this year, saying the deal didn't rein in Iran's regional military activities.\n\nThe new sanctions against Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors come into effect Monday. The U.S. says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nChina says it regrets the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran but will continue to uphold the nuclear deal Beijing agreed to as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters on Monday that the accord \"should be comprehensively and effectively implemented\" despite the fact that the United States pulled out of it in May.\n\nHua says: \"We regret this decision by the U.S.\"\n\nShe added that the international community objects to unilateral sanctions such as those brought by the U.S.\n\nShe also said China stood with those nations that have vowed to keep the agreement alive despite the U.S. withdrawal, and said Iran has been \"strictly fulfilling its obligations\" under the accord.\n\nHua urged all sides to keep in mind \"long-term interests, fulfill their obligations and responsibilities and choose to stand on the right side of history.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n2 p.m.\n\nIranian officials say the country is being targeted by a cyberattack.\n\nTelecommunication Minister Mohammad Javad Azeri Jahromi and his deputy, Hamid Fatahi, both tweeted about the attack on Monday \u2014 the same day U.S. sanctions on the country once lifted by the nuclear deal resumed.\n\nThey blamed Israel for the attack and said it targeted Iran's communications infrastructure, without elaborating.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry declined to comment.\n\nIran previously faced a computer virus called Stuxnet, which destroyed thousands of centrifuges involved in Iran's contested nuclear program in 2011. Stuxnet is widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation, though neither country has acknowledged being behind the attack.\n\nGen. Gholam Reza Jalali, the head of country's military unit in charge of combatting sabotage, said last week that President Hassan Rouhani's cellphone was tapped recently.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:35 p.m.\n\nIran's foreign ministry is shrugging off the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran, saying it's nothing new and that the country has gone through a wider range of sanctions in the past.\n\nThe ministry's spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, says that Iranians \"have experienced more extensive sanctions\" and that they are \"not a new issue.\"\n\nHe also called the sanctions that went into effect on Monday \"fruitless\" and part of the U.S. propaganda and psychological war against Iran.\n\nHe claimed the sanctions would backfire and work against the United States and that \"many countries from Europe to Russia and China have opposed the sanctions.\"\n\nThe sanctions end all U.S. economic benefits America granted to Tehran for its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and in particular target Iran's vital oil industry.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11: 10 a.m.\n\nIsrael's defense minister is welcoming newly restored U.S. sanctions against Iran, saying they will deal a \"critical blow\" to Iran's military presence around the Middle East.\n\nAvigdor Lieberman said in a tweet on Monday that the Trump administration's decision to restore sanctions \"is the sea change the Middle East has been waiting for.\"\n\nIsrael has been a fierce opponent of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which the United States withdrew this year, saying the deal didn't rein in Iran's regional military activities.\n\nThe new sanctions against Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors, come into effect Monday. The U.S. says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11 a.m.\n\nIran has greeted the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions with air defense drills and an acknowledgement from President Hassan Rouhani that the nation faces a \"war situation.\"\n\nThe developments raise Mideast tensions as America's maximalist approach to the Islamic Republic takes hold.\n\nThe sanctions end all the economic benefits America granted Tehran for its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, though Iran for now continues to abide by the accord that saw it limit its enrichment of uranium. While for now not threatening to resume higher enrichment, Iranian officials in recent months have made a point to threaten that could resume at any time faster than before.\n\nThe new American sanctions particularly hurt Iran's vital oil industry, a crucial source of hard currency for its anemic economy. Its national currency has plummeted over the last year, sending prices for everything from mobile phones to medicine skyrocketing.", "SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son denounced Monday the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but defended the Japanese technology giant's investment fund, which includes Saudi money, as work that needs to be finished.\n\nSpeaking at an earnings news conference, Son called the death an attack on \"a precious life but also on journalism and the freedom of speech.\"\n\nSon is partnering with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and about half of his $100 billion Vision Fund, established in 2016, comes from the kingdom. The fund has been investing in various companies, solar projects and artificial intelligence.\n\nKhashoggi, a 59-year-old columnist for The Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Turkey on Oct. 2, although details are still unclear.\n\n\"It is a reality a horrible act has happened. But we cannot just turn our backs on our work,\" Son said. He said the investment in his fund came from the Saudi \"people.\"\n\nKhashoggi vanished after entering the consulate in Istanbul to pick up paperwork he needed to get married. His Turkish fiancee was waiting for him outside. A critic of the Saudi crown prince, Khashoggi had been living in exile in the United States.\n\nSon said he met with the prince and other Saudi officials during a recent visit and urged a thorough investigation. He said he prince had expressed concern about the killing.\n\nThe Japanese tycoon said nothing has been decided about a planned second phase for the Vision Fund, pending the results of the investigation.\n\n\"It is too early to say and we need to approach this cautiously,\" he said.\n\nSoftBank reported July-September profit of 542.6 billion yen ($4.8 billion), up almost five-fold from the previous year, helped by better results at U.S. wireless Sprint and British IoT company ARM.\n\nQuarterly sales rose 7 percent to 2.38 trillion yen ($21.1 billion).\n\nSoftBank's sprawling empire of technology investments encompasses telecommunications, financial-technology, solar energy, ride-booking services and the Pepper companion robot.\n\nIt also has stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and in Uber.\n\nSon had not commented earlier on Khashoggi's death. He started his news conference by addressing the killing, appearing more somber than usual.\n\nBut after the first few minutes, he switched the subject to the Japan Series win by the company's professional baseball team, the SoftBank Hawks.\n\n\"I want to express my gratitude, especially to the fans,\" he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nYuri Kageyama is on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nOn Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=en", "The Latest on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi (all times local):\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nFive months after quitting the U.N.'s top human rights body, the United States has resurfaced at a Human Rights Council venue \u2014 calling for a \"thorough, conclusive and transparent\" investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCharge d'Affaires Mark Cassayre said the U.S. condemned the killing of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month.\n\nThe United States joined several dozen countries to raise the Khashoggi killing during an examination of Saudi Arabia's record under a regular review process.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the 47-member council in June, accusing it of anti-Israel bias, among other things.\n\nCouncil spokesman Rolando Gomez said the review process falls under the council and that the U.S. has announced plans to participate throughout the current round that began Monday.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n12:30 p.m.\n\nA top Saudi human rights official has reiterated his government's \"regret and pain\" over the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nSpeaking at a regular review of the kingdom's record by the U.N.'s top human rights body, Bandar bin Mohammed al-Aiban, the president of the Saudi Human Rights Commission, emphasized that the monarchy had ordered an investigation to \"bring the perpetrators to justice in order to bear the fact to the public.\"\n\nThe killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month was likely to come up among representatives of more than 100 countries set to speak during the review of Saudi Arabia on Monday.\n\nOther countries, including China, Mexico, Chad and Monaco, are also due to be reviewed in coming days by the 47-member U.N.-backed body.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nA newspaper close to Turkey's government claims that a team from Saudi Arabia sent to help Turkish authorities investigate the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi worked instead to remove evidence of the slaying.\n\nSabah newspaper, citing \"trusted sources,\" said Monday that an 11-member team of Saudi investigators that arrived in Turkey nine days after Khashoggi was killed included a chemical expert and a toxicology expert.\n\nOn Saturday, the paper said Khashoggi's body \u2014 which still hasn't been found \u2014 was dismembered and removed from the Saudi Consulate in five suitcases.\n\nMeanwhile, Khashoggi's sons appealed for his remains to be returned so that he may be buried in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Sunday, the sons also said they hoped he did not suffer when he was killed.", "Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, was being questioned in his native Poland on Monday as part of a parliamentary investigation into a pyramid scheme that cheated thousands of Poles out of their savings during his time as prime minister.\n\nTusk was sworn in by the special multi-party commission that has already questioned dozens of state officials in its effort to pinpoint responsibility for the scam. Addressing him as \"prime minister\" the commission was focused on determining the scope of Tusk's authority over state security and other offices and the time when he was made aware of the scheme.\n\nThe scam, which was revealed in 2012, has raised questions about the effectiveness of the government during Tusk's term, from 2007-2014, with authorities allegedly failing to react in time to warning signals about the Amber Gold financial institution, which turned out to be a pyramid scheme.\n\nThe televised questioning was part of the conservative ruling party's efforts to discredit Tusk, a political foe who is still popular in Poland.\n\nThe commission's stern head, Malgorzata Wassermann, of the ruling Law and Justice party, on Sunday lost her bid for mayor of the city of Krakow in local elections.\n\nOne of the themes of the whole investigation has been the fact that Tusk's son Michal was employed by an airline owned by Amber Gold.\n\nProsecutors say some 19,000 investors lost over 850 million zlotys ($225 million) in what turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals in Poland.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday evening it was unknown if anyone was killed or trapped.\n\nFire officials deliberately brought down most of a third building due to concerns the unstable structure might cave on top of search crews and sniffer dogs combing the rubble of the other buildings. The late afternoon demolition released more dust clouds.\n\nAuthorities said one building had been condemned as substandard and was assumed to be unoccupied, but the other was inhabited. The government's housing minister, Julien Denormandie, said at the scene he couldn't rule out that people were trapped in the collapse.\n\n\"It's a race against the clock,\" Denormandie said. \"The urgent task is to determine whether there are people we can save.\"\n\nThick dust covered cars around the site near Marseille's famous Old Port. Amateur video broadcast on BFM-TV featured bystanders covering their mouths with their sleeves to avoid the dusty air.\n\nImages of the buildings before they collapsed, visible on Google Street View , showed that one had five floors and the other six.\n\nOne of the buildings was clearly in poor repair, with boarded-up windows and large visible cracks on the facade before it collapsed.\n\nSabine Bernasconi, the local mayor for that part of Marseille, said one of the buildings was subject to an evacuation order, but could not say for sure that squatters were not using it.\n\nThe regional prefecture urged people to avoid the area and make way for emergency services.", "Interest Successfully Added\n\nWe'll notify you here with news about AlertTag\n\nTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?", "Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans marched Monday in support of a new government led by the country's former strongman, highlighting the political polarization in the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\nThe rally near Parliament came amid a constitutional crisis sparked by President Maithripala Sirisena's move to oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replace him with ex-leader Mahinda Rajapaksa and suspend Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe has refused to vacate his official residence, insisting he is the lawful prime minister and that the president had no constitutional right to replace him. Thousands of his supporters have been keeping vigil.\n\nSupporters of Rajapaksa at the rally chanted \"Whose power is this? Mahinda's power!\"\n\nAs patriotic songs blared over loudspeakers, thousands shuffled through heavy rain toward a makeshift stage. Police and Sri Lankan special forces with semi-automatic rifles stood guard.\n\nPolice estimated 120,000 people attended the rally. State television reported there were at least 200,000.\n\nPradeep Kariyawasam, the head of Rajapaksa's party in Colombo, said that although Wickremesinghe continues to maintain he is the country's legitimate leader, \"the people are with us.\"\n\n\"Give people a chance to choose their government and not hide behind constitutional interpretations,\" he said.\n\nSirisena and Rajapaksa arrived at the rally amid loud cheers.\n\nSirisena told the crowd that the change he initiated was more than a personnel shift.\n\n\"I ousted a vision that is incompatible with our local culture and values, and that works according to foreign agendas,\" Sirisena said.\n\n\"For the past 3 \u00bd years, poor people were suppressed by Ranil Wickremesinghe's economic and political vision. Local thoughts were rejected and an extreme neo-liberal form of governance was carried out.\"\n\nHe was referring to Wickremesinghe's free-market economic policies and public-private partnerships with companies from China and India to operate strategic centers such as ports and airports.\n\nRajapaksa supporters have accused Wickremesinghe of selling Sri Lanka's assets, citing a 99-year lease agreement his government struck with Hong Kong conglomerate China Merchants Port Holdings Co. Ltd. last year to operate a failing port developed with Chinese debt during Rajapaksa's decadelong presidency.\n\n\"Foreign countries are trying to take our resources, take our land,\" said Mithra Kumara Jayasinghe, a wedding photographer at the rally who said he had voted for Rajapaksa the two times he was elected president, in 2005 and 2010, and when he lost a re-election bid in 2015.\n\nCritics of Sirisena's actions say Parliament was suspended to give Rajapaksa time to gather enough support to survive a no-confidence vote when lawmakers reconvene Nov. 14.\n\nParliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Monday that he won't recognize the new appointments until either side is able to prove it has a majority. It means that the speaker still recognizes a Wickremesinghe-led Parliament.\n\n\"I wish to emphasize that I am compelled to accept the status that existed previously until such time that they (the pro-Wickremesinghe lawmakers) and the new political alliance prove their majority in Parliament,\" he said.\n\nThe statement was fuel at Rajapaksa's five-hour rally. Lawmaker Susil Premjayantha told the crowd that electing a new speaker could be the first order of business when Parliament reopens, suggesting the party will bring a no-confidence motion against Jayasuriya.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press last week that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa's party is attempting to buy support in Parliament.

I trust you and you can always trust me,\" Rajapaksa said.\n\nEthnic minority Tamils in the country's north and east are still reeling from the effects of a 26-year civil war between Tamil Tiger separatists and government troops.\n\nRajapaksa is seen as a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict.\n\nTens of thousands of civilians were reportedly killed in the final months of the war in 2009, when government troops brutally crushed the rebels. Thousands more are still missing.\n\nSirisena came into power in 2015 promising to address the issues affecting the Tamils and investigate allegations of war crimes against both sides of the conflict, but has done little in either area. He was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during the civil war.\n\nAmong the crowd Monday was Basil Ros, 58, a fisherman from the village of Negombo.\n\nRos said a local lawmaker from Rajapaksa's United People's Freedom Alliance bused him and his wife in with many others, pledging to give them 1,000 rupees (about $5.80), food and alcohol.\n\nHe said he hadn't received any money yet.\n\n\"You can't trust politicians,\" he said. \"They might pay; they might not.\"\n\nAfter sacking Wickremesinghe, Sirisena announced that he made the replacement in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him.\n\nDetails of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nSirisena said at the rally that he would not be discouraged by resistance in Parliament, civil society and the international community to his actions.\n\n\"Even if there are threats, pressure and forces, I will only move forward and will not take a step back,\" he said.", "SoftBank Group Corp.

They include 15 members of an alleged Saudi \"hit squad\" that Turkey says was sent to Istanbul to kill the Washington Post columnist who had written critically of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia acknowledged last month that Turkish evidence indicates that the Khashoggi's killing at the consulate was premeditated, shifting its explanation in an apparent effort to ease international outrage over the death.\n\nOn Saturday, Sabah newspaper, which is close to the Turkish government, said Khashoggi's body \u2014 which still hasn't been found \u2014 was dismembered and removed from the Saudi Consulate in five suitcases.\n\nA senior official of Turkey's ruling party \u2014 and a friend of Khashoggi's \u2014 has suggested his body may have been dissolved in acid or other chemicals.\n\nTurkey's vice president, Fuat Oktay, told state-run Anadolu Agency that such reports need to be investigated.\n\nMeanwhile, two of Khashoggi's sons appealed for his remains to be returned so that he may be buried in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Sunday, the sons also said they hoped he did not suffer when he was killed.\n\n\"All what we want right now is to bury him in Al-Baqi (cemetery) in Medina with the rest of his family,\" Salah Khashoggi said.\n\n\"I talked about that with the Saudi authorities and I just hope that it happens soon,\" he said.", "A Danish woman considered the main suspect in a fraud case that caused a Danish government welfare agency to lose at least 111 million kroner ($17 million) has been arrested in South Africa.\n\nDenmark's top prosecution authority said Britta Nielsen was arrested Monday in Johannesburg, and Denmark will seek her extradition.\n\nProsecutor Thomas Anderskov Riis added her arrest was the result of cooperation between Denmark's Serious Economic and International Crime unit and a series of international authorities that he didn't name.\n\nNielsen appeared briefly in Randburg Magistrates' court in Johannesburg Monday and her case was scheduled to be heard on Thursday, according to South African media.

They pleaded not guilty, saying they were framed by police.\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape what U.N. officials and others charged was ethnic cleansing, or even genocide, by Myanmar security forces. The military denies the accusations.\n\n\"The appellate court will find many flaws with the verdict and sentence imposed by the trial judge,\" a Reuters statement quoted Than Zaw Aung, a lawyer for the reporters, as saying. \"It will finally provide Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo justice, declare their innocence, and make clear that journalism in Myanmar is not a crime.\" The appeal was dated Friday.\n\nReuters President Stephen Adler said in the statement that the court's ruling had ignored \"compelling evidence of a police set-up, serious due process violations, and the prosecution's failure to prove any of the key elements of the crime.\"\n\n\"Now is the time for Myanmar to uphold its stated dedication to rule of law, freedom of the press, and democracy by ordering the release of our colleagues, whether on appeal or by granting the families' request for a pardon,\" Adler said.\n\nThe appeal says the court improperly \"placed the burden of proof on Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, convicting them on the basis that they failed to prove their innocence.\"\n\nThe case drew worldwide attention as an example of how democratic reforms in long-isolated Myanmar have stalled under the civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power in 2016. Suu Kyi's rise after decades of military rule had raised hopes for an accelerated transition to full democracy, and her failure to end persecution of the Rohingya disappointed many former admirers.\n\nSuu Kyi also did not offer support for the freedom of press issues at stake in the case of the two Reuters journalists, despite what many observers saw as a seriously flawed prosecution.\n\n\"They were not jailed because they were journalists,\" Suu Kyi said in September at a meeting in Vietnam of the World Economic Forum. \"Sentence has been passed on them because the court decided they had broken the Official Secrets Act, so if we believe in the rule of law they have every right to appeal the judgment and to point out why the judgment is wrong if they consider it wrong.\"\n\nThe court declined to stop the trial after a policeman called as a prosecution witness testified that his commander had ordered that documents be planted on the journalists.

Ojeda's race in the southern portion of the state, a district where Trump won 73 percent of the vote, could pave a pathway for Democrats hoping to run competitive races in Trump country.\n\nOjeda, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, said he thinks the Democratic party -- the party that once helped put Kennedy over the top -- has lost its way in Appalachia.\n\n\"It's about finding the people in the areas that can relate to those people and supporting them.

My media person has spent literally her whole life with her aunt and uncle because of opioids,\" Ojeda said.\n\nIn 2016, West Virginia had the highest rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in the country, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\"None of us come from areas where wealth is really part of life,\" Ojeda said. \"We come up in these areas, and we've watched people struggle our whole lives.

Of course, in southern West Virginia we care a lot about coal, and infrastructure and all those other issues that are important to the entire country.\"\n\nAs a Democrat, Ojeda has found a way to appeal to Trump supporters, Democrats, and those who have shied away from politics.

When the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it under the wheels of a tractor.\n\nThe village is inside the core zone of the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nKilling a tiger in protected areas is illegal, and the reserve's director, Ramesh Pandey, said a case under the Wildlife Protection Act would be registered with police.\n\nVillagers said the tiger injured another person in an attack about 10 days ago.\n\nThe tiger is India's national animal and it is categorized as endangered under the Wildlife Protection Act. Tiger attacks in the country are common, with government data from last year showing an average of more than one person killed per day in conflict with a wild tiger or elephant over the previous three years.\n\nOn Friday, hunters shot and killed another man-eating tiger in western Maharashtra state, wildlife forest official Nagesh Gorle said. Officials blamed the female tiger for killing 13 people over the last two years.\n\nGorle said they had planned to capture the tiger but it attacked hunters even after being hit by a tranquilizer dart, he said.\n\nOfficials said the tiger had evaded capture at least four times and had terrified inhabitants living near vast swaths of forest where it mauled herders and farmers, along with cows, goats and horses.\n\nThe human conflict with tigers has gradually increased since the 1970s, when India started a tiger conservation program that carved out sanctuaries in national parks and made it a crime to kill them. Though methods for counting tigers have changed, a census suggests the population of about 1,800 tigers then grew to 2,226 in 2014.", "The U.S. re-imposed all sanctions Monday on Iran that once were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, grinding further down on the Islamic Republic's already-ailing economy in what President Hassan Rouhani described as a \"war situation\" now facing Tehran.\n\nIran ran televised air defense drills showing soldiers cheering the downing of a drone, but otherwise held back from any military response over U.S. efforts to curtail what Washington calls its \"malign activities\" across the Middle East. While previously warning it could ramp up its nuclear program, Iran still honors the atomic accord now limiting its enrichment of uranium, according to the United Nations.\n\nAs Iranian officials struck a martial tone, the strain could be felt on the streets of Tehran. It lurked in shops emptied by the country's rapidly depreciating currency. It could be felt in the lines at currency exchange shops. And it could be heard in the stress of the voices of people struggling to buy medicine.\n\n\"When the dollar rate went up, prices for medicine went up by 80 percent,\" said a man who identified himself only as Amidi, who suffers from mental illness and has a son with cancer. \"I can't buy my own medicine anymore. I haven't taken my medicine for two months, because I can't afford it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran's state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran's vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists in Washington the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\n\"Our objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and, indeed, around the world,\" Pompeo said. \"The Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlawed course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.\"\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of tearing up the nuclear deal, insists it does not seek \"regime change\" in Iran through the sanctions. It says It wants Iran to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nHowever, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his national security adviser John Bolton both have given speeches advocating overthrowing Iran's theocratic government.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. That caused prices of benchmark Brent crude to dip down from over $80 a barrel in recent days. It traded up over $73 a barrel Monday after the sanctions took effect.\n\n\"We have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don't want to drive the oil prices in the world,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"I could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\"\n\nRouhani, whose signature achievement was the nuclear deal, promised that Iran would still be able to sell its oil on the international market. Its national oil company has started selling crude oil to private companies who then can sell to anonymous buyers abroad as a means to get around the sanctions.\n\n\"We are in an economic war situation. We are standing up to a bullying enemy,\" Rouhani told government officials in televised remarks, invoking Iran's ruinous 1980s war with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \"Yesterday, Saddam was in front us; today Trump is front of us. There is no difference. We must resist and win.\"\n\nIranian state television broadcast video of air defense systems and anti-aircraft batteries in two-day military maneuvers underway across a vast stretch of the country's north. It included surface-to-air missiles shooting down a drone.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500 to $1. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nGholamali Khoshroo, Iran's U.N. ambassador, accused the U.S. of \"brazenly and boldly\" violating a U.N. Security Council resolution that unanimously endorsed the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions, and he called for \"a collective response by the international community.\"\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China regretted the U.S. decision, adding the accord \"should be comprehensively and effectively implemented\" despite the fact that the United States pulled out of it in May.\n\nEuropean nations still a part of the nuclear deal have sought to offer protection for its firms to continue trading with Iran. However, many international firms already have backed out of the country, fearful of facing American sanctions.\n\nThat fear also has kept shoppers out of the stores in Tehran.\n\n\"Check the shops here one by one. There are no customers,\" said Hossein Ahmadi, who sells purses. \"People have kept their money for rainy days out of fear of sanctions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there are fears of other threats. Iran's Telecommunication Minister Mohammad Javad Azeri Jahromi and his deputy, Hamid Fatahi, both tweeted about a cyberattack targeting the country's communications infrastructure, without elaborating. They blamed Israel for the attack and both referenced Stuxnet, which destroyed thousands of centrifuges involved in Iran's contested nuclear program in 2011. Stuxnet is widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation, though neither country has acknowledged being behind the attack.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the Iranian claim. Last week, Gen. Gholam Reza Jalali, the head of country's military unit in charge of combating sabotage, said Rouhani's cellphone was tapped recently.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Iran, lauded the sanctions as \"historic,\" saying they will \"strangle\" what he described as Iranian state-sponsored terrorism. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman tweeted that the U.S. decision to restore sanctions \"is the sea change the Middle East has been waiting for.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

He is often depicted drinking alcohol, smoking tobacco and following young women in a provocative manner.\n\nMimose Bernard, a 44-year-old believer, performs voodoo rituals for other residents in the slum from the beginning of October to Nov. 2. She says Baron Samedi is a good spirit who helped protect her with good health and good luck.\n\n\"I remember that I was 10 years old when I first invoked the Gede spirit,\" said Bernard, who lives with her child in a tiny home built from old metal sheets.", "A battery of corruption allegations and criminal charges against former President Cristina Fernandez hasn't fazed a strong band of hard-core backers, who have helped make her a leading \u2014 if undeclared \u2014 contender to regain power in next year's elections.\n\nHundreds of supporters, some waving signs saying, \"Strength, Cristina!\" thronged the street outside when investigators searched the former president's apartment recently.\n\nCries of support for Fernandez rise from crowds during protests against the austerity policies of the conservative who replaced her as president, Mauricio Macri.\n\n\"Now more than ever, soldiers of Cristina\" read a sign at a demonstration demanding improved conditions for disabled retirees.\n\n\"Many women voted for the government of Mauricio Macri and now they regret it,\" Teresa Rollano said while walking arm-in-arm with a friend who carried that sign. \"The people want Cristina because she represents the working class. She has given us all of our rights.\"\n\nA recent survey by local pollster Ricardo Rouvier & Associates said Fernandez is neck-and-neck with Macri in terms of support ahead of the October 2019 election.\n\nThat's remarkable backing for a politician who faces numerous formal investigations into alleged bribery, money laundering and criminal association during her own administration from 2007 to 2015 and that of her late husband Nestor Kirchner from 2003 to 2007.\n\nFernandez, now a senator, hasn't been convicted of any crimes \u2014 a first trial is scheduled to start in February \u2014 and she fiercely denies any wrongdoing, accusing officials of persecuting her to distract from the current economic crisis.\n\nBut the Argentine press has been filled with picturesque scandals: bags of millions of dollars in cash tossed over a convent wall, the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused Fernandez of a cover-up, the corruption conviction of her former vice president.\n\nPart of her strength stems from disenchantment with Macri, whose budget-cutting efforts have forced thousands out of public jobs, raised electricity bills and hiked bus fares without managing to revive the economy or rein in soaring prices. His decision this year to seek IMF aid to help has roused fears among those who blame the international agency for a devastating economic crash in 2001, when Argentina's government was forced into the largest debt default in history to that point and millions of Argentines were plunged into poverty.\n\nMany credit Kirchner and Fernandez for leading the country out of that crisis, even if Macri's backers blame Fernandez's policies for eventually creating the country's current woes.\n\nUnder Fernandez, \"I was able to buy a new car, fix my house and travel on a plane for the first time,\" said Gloria Buffarini, a hairdresser. \"I used to pay 600 pesos a month (about $16) for electricity. Now, it's 3,000 (about $80).\n\nFernandez's supporters credit her for nationalizing the pension system, keeping energy cheap through subsidies and redirecting revenue to the poor through handouts, and see her as a trailblazer for women's advancement.\n\nThe former president's appeal also flows from her leadership of a powerful \u2014 if often fragmented \u2014 populist tide in Argentine politics that originated with strongman Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s and from progressive social policies she passed in the face of opposition from powerful business interests.\n\nBut she also inspires deep animosity. Detractors blame her for endemic corruption and the deterioration of Argentina's economy, which was choked by restrictions on imports, exports and foreign currency exchanges in the latter part of her administration.\n\n\"Not since Peron has there been another leader who has generated such a situation of love and hate,\" said Mariel Fornoni of the Management & Fit consultancy. She said Fernandez has a \"hard core of followers who are going to vote for her no matter what she does.\"\n\nFernandez infuriates people like Patricio Canbelari, a language teacher, who said, \"Most want to see her arrested,\" and called her a \"white-gloved thief.\"\n\nFernandez's former public works secretary was arrested in 2016 when he was caught tossing bags containing more than $9 million over the walls of a convent. He later agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, joining other witnesses in accusing Fernandez and her son of overseeing a plan to skim millions of dollars from public works projects.\n\nJudges also are investigating allegations published by the newspaper La Nacion that a senior official's chauffeur kept detailed diaries of millions of dollars in cash payments, including some delivered to the presidential offices and to Fernandez's private home.\n\nFernandez, along with other former officials, also faces trial on charges that she covered up the role of Iranians in a 1994 terrorist bombing at a Jewish center in Argentina's capital. The prosecutor who first recommended charges against her, Alberto Nisman, died mysteriously of a gunshot wound four days later \u2014 a case that is still under investigation.\n\nFernandez's former vice president, Amado Boudou, is in prison, appealing a sentence for bribery and business incompatible with his public office. He was accused of using shell companies and middlemen to take over the only company with contracts to print Argentina's currency.\n\nFernandez's Senate seat grants her immunity from arrest but not from prosecution. That immunity could be lifted only by an unlikely vote of two-thirds of the country's senators. While a conviction might theoretically bar her from running for office, that would only occur after appeals were exhausted \u2014 a process that would take many years.\n\nFornoni said some Argentines believe that although corruption was rife during Fernandez's term, it exists in Macri's government as well.\n\n\"They say: 'They were probably corrupt, but I lived better,'\" Fornoni said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.", "Before the late-afternoon NFL games even kicked off, the writing was on the wall -- bookmakers from Nevada to New Jersey were taking a bath on a Sunday that will go down as one of the betting public's best.\n\nNevada industry sources estimated the state's sportsbooks lost in the range of $7 million to $10 million overall on Sunday.\n\nIn the early games, the books found themselves holding lopsided betting action on the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers, two popular picks that easily covered the spread. Their fate was sealed by the Kansas City Chiefs, the most heavily bet favorite on the board Sunday.\n\nKansas City closed as an eight-point favorite over the Cleveland Browns and won 37-21. Eighty-eight percent of the money wagered on the point spread at William Hill's sportsbooks in Nevada and New Jersey was on Kansas City.\n\n\"We were pretty much done at that point,\" MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood said. \"Disaster.\"\n\nIt was the third straight subpar weekend for the books, but Sunday was in a class by itself, an all-timer in some veteran bookmakers' eyes. Rood, a 25-year Las Vegas bookmaker, said it made his top 10 list of all-time costly Sundays. A sportsbook manager at Caesars Palace said it was one of the worst Sundays he could remember.\n\n\"Bad. Really bad,\" Caesars head of risk operations Jeff Davis said. \"We won one key decision today.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there was a best game [for the book],\" Station Casino sportsbook director Jason McCormick said. \"Maybe the Dolphins, which had the least handle of the day. Worst Sunday of the season.\"\n\nNormally, a day filled with favorites covering the spread is the recipe for success for public bettors. But favorites were only 6-5 against the spread on Sunday. It didn't matter.\n\n\"The public just nailed it,\" Boyd Gaming sportsbook director Bob Scucci said in an email. \"They had the big favorites -- Bears, Chiefs, Panthers and Vikings -- as well as the short 'dogs, Texans and Steelers. And a lot of the overs.\n\n\"By the time we got to the two biggest games -- Packers-Patriots and Rams-Saints -- there were so many parlays alive that we were going to lose no matter what.\"\n\nThe underdog New Orleans Saints beat the Los Angeles Rams 45-35, and the New England Patriots covered the spread in a 31-17 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe damage wasn't limited to Nevada. New sportsbooks in Mississippi and New Jersey also reported taking it on the chin Sunday.\n\n\"Welcome to sports betting,\" one longtime Nevada bookmaker said with a chuckle.\n\nBettors were in need of a hot stretch after a tough start to the season. Nevada sportsbooks won an all-time-high $56.3 million in September. Results for October will be released later this month.\n\n\"We took a big punch today,\" said Jay Kornegay, vice president of race and sports for the SuperBook at Westgate Las Vegas. \"[It] could snowball into Monday. Good thing is we'll be open on Tuesday.\"", "Tired, swollen and blistered feet are among the biggest challenges for the thousands of Central American migrants making their way through southern Mexico in hopes of starting new lives in the United States.\n\nThree weeks of pounding the hot asphalt of highways every day takes a toll, especially for those plodding along in flimsy flip flops. Whenever possible, the migrants discard damaged footwear, replacing them with donated shoes found at stops along the way or with spare pairs they carry in backpacks.\n\nThe most grueling days demand treks of more than 100 miles (160 kilometers). Migrants eager to find strength in numbers must keep that pace to remain with the group. And they do so in cheap shoes and sweat-drenched socks, which they eagerly peel off at the end of each day.\n\nBlisters are a nasty foe for migrant feet, young and old alike. Red Cross personnel at waystations bandage swollen feet or apply antiseptic to broken blisters. Children wince as their wounds are treated. Flies gather on open sores. The risk of infection is high.\n\n\"These are extreme conditions,\" says Ignacio Escotto, a Mexican vascular surgeon who specializes in treating extremities. Unrelenting contact with hot pavement will cause the feet to swell, he says, while dehydration and malnutrition wreak havoc on soft tissue. \"At the end of the day, this articulation must be painful.\"\n\nYet the migrants hobble through the pain, determined to reach the U.S. They grin and bear it as they limp along. Those who can no longer take it bow out of the caravan. The Mexican government says around 3,000 migrants have applied for refuge in Mexico in recent weeks and about 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nOn Sunday, 21-year-old Marisol Salamanca dug into a pile of donated shoes at a sports facility in Cordoba in search of a replacement for the sandals she has padded around in since leaving El Salvador several weeks earlier. \"I keep tripping and hurting myself,\" she said.\n\nDarwin Hueso, a 39-year-old-farmer from Honduras, was also thrilled to find fresh shoes, even though they were a bit tight and formal. The soles of the work boots he has been wearing for more than 21 days are inflexible and tough.\n\nAdan Lara Barahona, 62, a wiry rancher from Potrerillos, Honduras, dismissed the blisters on his feet as a minor nuisance. \"They are drying out already,\" he said, complaining instead of dizziness brought on by a severe respiratory infection.\n\nThere's no turning back for Lara Barahona, who says gangs killed his wife and two of his children seven months ago when he didn't pay them protection money.\n\nMany of the about 4,000 migrants in the caravan have now covered more than 800 miles since setting out from Honduras on Oct. 13, hitching rides on flatbed trucks when possible and they face another more than 800-mile trek to the nearest U.S. border crossing. Clamors have grown in recent days for buses to transport scores from the caravan to the Mexican capital, where the fatigued travelers hope to find respite and medical treatment. Those buses haven't come.\n\nThe group now finds itself in the Gulf state of Veracruz, traversing what some call the \"route of death\" because of the large number of migrants who have disappeared in the state in recent years. It is unclear what part of the U.S. border they will aim for eventually, but their latest overnight stay in Veracruz could be one of their last before they head to Mexico City, a potential launching spot for a broader array of destinations.\n\nInspired by their progress and outpouring of support from townspeople along the way, several smaller caravans of migrants have formed in Central America in recent weeks in an attempt to improve their odds of making it to the U.S.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Stevenson reported in Cordoba and AP writer Amy Guthrie reported from Mexico City. AP writer Sonia Perez D. in Cordoba contributed to this report.", "China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\nChinese and Indian diplomats have been careful not to overtly take sides in the political turmoil, which has seen President Maithripala Sirisena oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replace him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, and suspend Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe, meanwhile, has holed up at the prime minister's residence and insisted he is Sri Lanka's rightful leader.\n\nThe caution exercised by the Asian giants stands in contrast to calls from Western diplomats for Parliament to immediately be summoned for a floor vote on Rajapaksa's appointment and underscores the economic and military importance the countries place on the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\n\"They're hedging their bets,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director of the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center. India and China \"both have stakes in the global system and want to play a bigger role, so they have to signal they'll work with whomever.\"\n\nFor China, Sri Lanka is a critical link in its massive Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to use infrastructure projects to expand trade across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. It has handed out billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade.\n\nLocated just 23 kilometers (14 miles) off its southeast coast, India sees Sri Lanka as a bulwark in its military defenses to ward off potential Chinese incursions and also sees the island as a key partner for regional trade. India has grown wary of China's economic influence over Sri Lanka and was troubled by a 2014 port visit from a Chinese submarine and warship.\n\nSri Lanka's ties to both nations date back thousands of years. It was a stop along China's old Silk Road trade routes, where merchants picked up pepper, cinnamon, ivory and pearl.\n\nSri Lanka traces much of its genealogy and culture to India, with folklore saying the island's majority Sinhalese are descendants of an Indian prince banished there 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe nation's minority Tamils, meanwhile, are in part the descendants of more than a million tea and rubber plantation workers brought to Sri Lanka from southern India by British colonial rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nYet that hasn't always led to smooth relations. During Sri Lanka's decadeslong civil war, which pitted Tamil rebels against the government, India intervened in the 1980s by sending a peacekeeping force that quickly found itself engaged in battle with the rebels. They were asked to withdraw a few years later amid allegations of abuses against Tamils.\n\nChina filled the vacuum left by India, providing military assistance that helped the Rajapaksa-led government defeat the rebels in 2009. In 2012, China helped block a UN Human Rights Council resolution demanding that the Sri Lankan government investigate war crimes. It would later pass, but it prompted little action by Rajapaksa, who was in power from 2005 to 2015.\n\nChina is partly involved in the current crisis because of tensions over the billions of dollars of loans it has given to build a network of highways, the Hambantota seaport and airport in Rajapaksa's home district, and other projects. The most iconic of these has been the $1.5 billion port city being built on reclaimed land off Colombo's coast.\n\nSri Lanka's debt more than tripled during Rajapaksa's presidency, Sri Lankan Central Bank figures show.\n\nNew Delhi and other international critics have called the loans a debt trap.\n\nCentral bank figures , however, show that Sri Lanka's debt to India stood at 145 billion rupees (about $19.9 billion) in 2017 versus 135 billion rupees (about $18.5 billion) owed to China the same year.\n\nRajapaksa's defeat at the polls in 2015 was partly a reaction to all of that debt, said Gopalaswamy, the analyst.\n\nLikewise, Wickremesinghe, prime minster from 2015, saw his popularity begin to wane last year after his government handed over operations of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease.\n\n\"From a democracy perspective, there's been huge public resentment because the quality of these projects is questionable, there's little parliamentary scrutiny and no one knows where this money ends up,\" Gopalaswamy said.\n\nResponding to public outrage over the lease, China in July offered Sirisena a nearly $300 million grant that the president said could be used \"for any project of my wish.\"\n\nWith so much at stake, the Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, was among the first to congratulate Rajapaksa after he was appointed prime minister on Oct. 27. But that day, Cheng also visited Temple Trees, the official prime minister's residence, where Wickremesinghe has been holed up since his ouster.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that Cheng's visits to rival prime ministers was simply part of China's policy of maintaining \"friendly exchanges will all parties in Sri Lanka,\" repeating China's routine assertion that it doesn't interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nBut after the surprise win of an opposition candidate in the Maldives who campaigned on a promise to reduce China's role in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation, Sri Lanka's strategic position has increased. If projects in the Maldives are canceled, Sri Lanka would be China's main Indian Ocean link between Asia and the Seychelles, off the coast of East Africa.\n\nA spokesman for Sri Lanka's new government, Kehaliya Rambukwella, said Rajapaksa had spoken to Chinese officials about revising the terms of the Hambantota port lease.\n\nNew Delhi doesn't have many options for how to respond to the crisis, said G. Parthasarthy, a retired Indian diplomat and an expert on Sri Lanka affairs.\n\n\"We would like to see South Asia integrated much more closely with India, so we cannot be seen as taking sides,\" Parthasarthy said, adding that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe in separate visits to New Delhi last month.\n\nThe day after his ouster, Wickremesinghe met with Colombo-based diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Australia, the European Union and India, among others. Many issued statements calling for the country's constitution and democracy to be respected. Sirisena held his own meeting with foreign diplomats on Oct. 29.\n\nWickremesinghe said he hasn't received any official support from foreign powers, nor has he sought any.\n\n\"I agree with them that the constitution must be followed,\" he said.\n\nSince the crisis began, constitutional scholars have argued over whether Sri Lankan law allowed the president to remove the prime minster and appoint someone new.\n\nSirisena on Sunday ordered Parliament to reconvene Nov. 14 for a confidence vote on Rajapaksa. China and India will be closely watching to see if the vote eases or exacerbates the crisis.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo and Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.", "Thousands of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan arrived in the Mexican capital Monday and began to fill up a sports stadium, still hundreds of miles from their goal of reaching the U.S. a day before midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made their journey a central campaign issue.\n\nBy afternoon 2,000 or more had arrived at the Jesus Martinez stadium, which has a capacity of about three times that, and eagerly began sifting through donations of clothes, gave themselves sponge baths, lunched on chicken and rice under the shade of tents and picked up thin mattresses to hunker down for the night.\n\nThe inflow of migrants continued into the night, and four large tents set up for sleeping had filled. Much in demand were blankets to ward of the chill, a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat.\n\nMany people went to medical tents to get treatment for blistered and aching feet, illness and other maladies. \"Since we got here, we have not stopped,\" said Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City's public health department.\n\nMelvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was traveling with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He brought the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and \"she throws up everything she eats.\"\n\nSeveral thousand more migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, catching a lift from passing vehicles when possible.\n\nNashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the city's human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 migrants from the lead caravan and several smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it, for as long as necessary.\n\n\"We have the space in terms of humanitarian help,\" Ramirez said.\n\nAs U.S. election day neared, Trump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, even though such caravans have happened regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border when the migrants were still hundreds of miles to the south, threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are fleeing rampant poverty and violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence; others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support loved ones back home.\n\nAlba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she had walked for five hours and hitched a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 people. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.\n\n\"I looked for work, and nothing,\" Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn't do worse. \"And when one does find a little job they kill you for the money,\" she said.\n\nArriving in Mexico City, some migrants stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the journey.\n\nMany had struck out ahead of the larger caravan but intended to regroup in the capital. Oscar Ulloa, 20, an accountant from Honduras, said he arrived by bus from Puebla thanks to handouts from Mexicans. He expected the group would assemble and vote in the coming days on their next moves.\n\nThe 178-mile trek (286 kilometers) Monday from the Gulf state of Veracruz to Mexico City was the longest single-day journey for the group of about 4,000 migrants.\n\nBut there were obstacles on this latest stretch.\n\nTruck after truck denied the migrants rides as they trudged along the highway into the relatively colder November temperatures of central highland Mexico.\n\nAt a toll booth near Fortin, Veracruz, Rafael Leyva, an unemployed cobbler from Honduras, stood with a few hundred others for more than 45 minutes without finding a ride.\n\n\"People help more in Chiapas and Oaxaca,\" Leyva said, referring to the southern Mexican states the group had already traversed and where pickup trucks frequently stopped to offer rides.\n\nMigrants converged on tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so they could climb aboard. Such impromptu hitchhiking is precarious with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time.\n\nCesar Rodas, 24, had pushed a friend's wheelchair for 24 days across three countries. But he couldn't lift his friend and the chair onto a truck bed crammed with 150 people. Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nMany said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S.\n\nYuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there's a \"very low\" chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having at least three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through Mexico. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.\n\nThe presidents of Guatemala and Honduras, which have been under intense pressure from the Trump administration, called Monday for an investigation to identify the organizers of the caravan.\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that \"thousands\" of his countrymen have returned to Honduras. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales went further, calling for an investigation of people who \"promote or participate\" in the caravan, saying they \"should be judged based on international laws.\"\n\nMost of the migrants interviewed say they joined the caravan spontaneously to stay safe, and many were already on the road when it caught up to them. Activist groups that have been trying to help organize things appear to have emerged only after it formed and began moving north.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie contributed to this report.", "President Xi Jinping promised Monday to open China's growing consumer market wider at a fair designed to help counter charges that Beijing abuses the global trading system.

But the citizen had separately informed the Georgia Democratic Party, whose voter protection chief then sent an email to two computer security officials.\n\n\"If this report is accurate, it is a massive vulnerability,\" wrote the official, Sara Tindall Ghazal. Party officials provided the AP with the email, its recipients' names redacted.\n\nNeither Cross nor the state party went public.\n\nBut reporters for the online news outlet WhoWhatWhy obtained a copy of the Ghazal email and the email that Democratic Party officials received from the private citizen who discovered the flaw, Richard Wright.\n\nThey published a story Sunday just as Kemp's office released the statement accusing the Democrats of attempted hacking. \"While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cybercrimes,\" said Candice Broce, who works for Kemp.\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director at the state Democratic Party, said no one from Kemp's office notified the Democratic Party or asked any question about the correspondence before issuing its public announcement of an investigation. DeHart called it a \"political stunt\" to cover up the weaknesses in a system Kemp runs.\n\nWhoWhatWhy's story said five security experts had reviewed the Wright complaint and independently confirmed that the database is vulnerable to hacking.\n\nOne of those experts, University of Michigan computer scientist Matthew Bernhard, told the AP that anyone with access to an individual voter's personal information could alter that voter's record in the system.\n\nAnother computer security professional who reviewed the vulnerability \u2014 without attempting to probe it for fear of prosecution \u2014 is Kris Constable of PrivaSecTech in Vancouver, Canada. \"Anyone with security chops would have detected this problem,\" he said, \"so (the system) clearly has never been audited by any computer security professional.\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the matter. A representative for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the agency had been notified, but it deferred to Georgia officials for details.\n\nCross, the attorney who said he alerted the FBI, said Wright doesn't wish to speak publicly. Cross described Wright as a businessman with \"some background in software.\"\n\nThe Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the voting integrity lawsuit against Kemp, issued a statement decrying his outsourcing of the the voter registration database and electronic poll book voter check-in system to a third party, PCC Technologies.\n\n\"There are still immediate steps that Secretary Kemp and the State Election Board can take to mitigate some, but not all, of the risk for Tuesday's vote,\" the group said.\n\nEfforts to reach PCC for comment have not been successful.\n\nThe drama played out on a day Kemp campaigned alongside President Donald Trump in Macon. Trump made no mention of the issue at the rally and earlier, as he left the White House for Georgia, said he didn't know anything about it.\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud.\n\nAbrams, who would be the nation's first black female governor, has called Kemp \"an architect of voter suppression\" and says he's used his current post to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp counters that he's following state and federal law and that it's Abrams and her affiliated voting advocacy groups trying to help people, including noncitizens, cast ballots illegally.\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying about the possibility that the losing side will not accept Tuesday's results as legitimate.\n\nThe accusation is not the first from Kemp accusing outsiders of trying to penetrate his office. Immediately after the 2016 general election, Kemp declared that DHS tried to hack his office's network, an accusation dismissed in mid-2017 by the DHS inspector general as unfounded.\n\nEven before he was running for governor, Kemp faced criticism over Georgia's election system.\n\nGeorgia's centrally managed elections system lacks a verifiable paper trail that can be audited in case of problems. The state is one of just five nationwide that continues to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don't leave a paper trail.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp's office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia voters \u2014 6.7 million at the time \u2014 as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp's office laid the blame for that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp's behalf.\n\nIn the voting integrity case, a federal judge last month endorsed the plaintiff's arguments that Kemp has been derelict in his management of the state election system and that it violates voters' constitutional rights with its lack of verifiability and reliability.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Colleen Long and Jill Colvin in Washington and Ben Nadler in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "Already have an account? sign in\n\nCreate an ABC Account to get the most of your ABC experience\n\nSign Out\n\nAre you sure you want to sign out?\n\nBy signing out, you will not be able to resume watching content where you left off, enjoy cross-device viewing experience, or save your favorites to your My List.\n\nsign out", "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel \u2014 both hoping to get out from under U.S. economic sanctions \u2014 have agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations, North Korea's state media reported Monday.\n\nDiaz-Canel, who is in Asia on his first international tour since assuming office in April, arrived in Pyongyang with his wife on Sunday.
