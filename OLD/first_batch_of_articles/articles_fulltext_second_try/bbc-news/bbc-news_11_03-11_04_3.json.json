["Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata gets criticised a lot but he showed with his goals against Crystal Palace what he can do when he gets the right service.\n\nI have heard a lot of people say that this Chelsea team is missing a top-class striker, but they have one in the 26-year-old Spain international - they just need to use him in the right way.\n\nThe way they play would make it difficult for any centre-forward to be prolific, so I don't think it is fair to say that the reason Morata has struggled for goals since his \u00a360m move from Real Madrid in 2017 is all his fault.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'Fragile' Morata still needs to improve - Sarri\n\nAs we saw in Sunday's win over Palace, Morata comes alive when the ball comes into the box and, to get the best out of him, you need to put crosses in.\n\nAnd if you give Morata that service he will do well - we saw that at Juventus and Real and, even at Chelsea, he scored more headers in the Premier League last season than any other player despite having a difficult season.\n\nBut, under Maurizio Sarri, Chelsea don't seem to want to attack that way.\n\nYes, the statistics show they have made plenty of crosses this season but when you watch them you can see that their first intention is always to attack through the middle.\n\nTheir wide attackers - Eden Hazard, Willian or Pedro - like to dribble inside and hold on to the ball, and Morata does not know where to go. There is no space left for him.\n\nChelsea crosses from open play in Premier League games 2018-19 (and ranking) Average crosses per game: 12 (9th) Average successful crosses per game: 1.9 (19th) Crossing accuracy: 15.56% (19th)\n\nMorata makes a run, but the ball doesn't come\n\nMorata's goals in their 3-1 win against Palace mean he has scored five goals in his last six games for Chelsea in all competitions. He has five goals in total in the Premier League this season and has a better goals per minutes played ratio in 2018-19 than Tottenham striker Harry Kane\n\nWhen I watched them against Palace, Chelsea did not look to cross the ball immediately when they got in a position where they could do, even if it was the best time from an attacking point of view. Instead they did it eventually, if there was no other possibility left.\n\nThere was a good example of this in the first half when Marcos Alonso did not cross despite having enough time and space, and Morata was waiting in the Palace area.\n\nInstead Alonso waited and played the ball back so Chelsea could try and build something down the centre of the pitch.\n\nThat is great for, say, Willian, Hazard or Pedro - but it is a nightmare for a striker like Morata.\n\nHe needs that cross to be played in quickly because he is reacting to it. Instead, he makes his move forward but the ball does not come.\n\nWhen that keeps happening, it is easy to get lost. But when a cross did come against Palace, he was there to score the first goal, and his second of the game was a typical striker's goal from another ball into the box.\n\nHopefully this performance will give him the confidence boost he needs. The only thing he did wrong in the game was when he missed the chance to get his hat-trick when he ran clear at the end.\n\nHe had so much time, and was in a great position - and then by looking down at the ball, he as good as phoned the goalkeeper and said \"hello, I am going to chip it... now\" so the goalkeeper knew immediately what he was going to do.\n\nChelsea attack not focused around their striker scoring\n\nEden Hazard began the game on the bench after missing Chelsea's previous three fixtures with a back injury. He had been on the pitch for 91 seconds when he supplied the free-kick for Morata to put Chelsea 2-1 ahead\n\nLast season, the then Chelsea manager Antonio Conte loved to play on the counter-attack and Morata is not the quickest player.\n\nHe missed a few good chances and lost a lot of confidence - even his current manager described him as \"fragile\" after Sunday's game.\n\nBut his record for the Blues is still good, especially when you consider he does not play all the time, and also the way they are set up.\n\nWhether it is Morata or Giroud in the team, it is a difficult task to play centre-forward for Chelsea, and get goals.\n\nTheir attack under new boss Sarri is not focused around their striker scoring, whoever it is. Instead it seems to be about what Hazard, Willian or Pedro can do.\n\nI can understand that approach if they want someone up front just to hold the ball up, like Giroud can do, but it would benefit the whole team if they played to their striker's strengths in front of goal rather than just what they can offer outside the box.\n\nSeven of the 11 Premier League goals scored by the 6ft 3in Morata in 2017-18 were headers, as well as this goal in the FA Cup semi-final win over Southampton\n\nOf course it is great to have exciting forward players like Hazard, Willian or Pedro who have the ability to run at defences and cut inside, but you need variety - don't do it all the time.\n\nAt the moment, Chelsea are a little bit predictable. If all you do is cut inside and come down the middle, which is what they did for a long spell in the first half against Palace before they scored from a cross, it is easier to stop them.\n\nEven Hazard cannot inspire Chelsea title win\n\nOf course, Chelsea can rely on the brilliance of Hazard to get them out of jail sometimes. That is what happened when he came on in the second half and made the difference against the Eagles.\n\nOne of the other criticisms that is thrown at Sarri's side is that they rely on the Belgian too much.\n\nThey managed pretty well without him in their win over Burnley last week but, on Sunday, they needed him to give them that little extra and take the points.\n\nBut even with Hazard in the side, I don't look at Chelsea and see a side that can win the title. Manchester City are better than them, and Liverpool are further ahead too.\n\nAs well as improving in attack, I think Chelsea need to do a little bit more when they don't have the ball.\n\nThey sometimes back off a little bit and it gives the opposition the possibility to get out - they need to get better at penning teams in.\n\nBut you have to remember this is Sarri's first season and I am surprised he has done so well, so quickly.\n\nThe most important thing I have noticed is that the players are enjoying themselves playing under him, and I am looking forward to seeing what this team does next.\n\nRuud Gullit was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "Image copyright Reuters\n\nSeveral of Monday's newspapers suggest that sufficient progress could be achieved in the Brexit talks over the next few days.\n\nProgress in negotiations would allow EU leaders to resurrect plans for a special summit later this month to approve a deal, it is reported.\n\nThe Guardian quotes one Whitehall source as saying that, should enough ground be made, a tentative new date of November 22 is being floated for an emergency meeting.\n\nIt reports that EU officials have put the chances of a deal on the Irish border at \"50-50\" - and have warned that the competing red lines remain \"incompatible\" in key areas.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, ministers say Theresa May is determined to try to seal a deal at a November summit, meaning that she must win Cabinet support for an outline proposal within days.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that the prime minister's top Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, is preparing to go to Brussels this week to clinch a deal in principle.\n\nAnd the Mail quotes a Cabinet source as saying that Mrs May appears to be \"desperate\" to agree a deal this month to allow more time to get it through Parliament and avoid having to implement costly contingency plans for a no-deal scenario.\n\nArmed Forces recruitment\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Defence's decision to drop a requirement for Commonwealth nationals to live in Britain for five years before they can serve in the Armed Forces, is the lead for the Telegraph.\n\nImage copyright PA\n\nThe move is welcomed in the paper's leader column.

I noticed in the line-up during the minute's silence before the game that Schmeichel was still emotional from the awful events that took place at Leicester City Football Club last Saturday.\n\nNevertheless, it didn't stop the Dane from producing a first-class performance against Cardiff and a clean sheet.\n\nTheir chairman would have been proud.\n\nDid you know? In addition to his clean sheet and two saves, Schmeichel completed 25 passes against Cardiff, his second highest in a league game this season (26 v Newcastle).\n\nDefenders - Wes Morgan (Leicester City), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Rob Holding (Arsenal)\n\nWes Morgan: If ever a captain needed to keep his troops calm in an emotionally charged atmosphere then this was it. Wes Morgan was superb in defence against Cardiff and kept his team-mates focused on the job at hand.\n\nLeicester also returned to a style of football that suited them.\n\nNo more tippy-tappy nonsense and the ball from side to side, but serious counter-attacking football. That's Leicester.\n\nDid you know? Morgan made 11 clearances against Cardiff, his highest in a single Premier League match since making the same number against Manchester United in August 2017.\n\nVirgil van Dijk: There are some central defenders who are comfortable on the ball and some who prefer the battle. Virgil van Dijk can do both.\n\nThe Netherlands international battled like a Trojan against Arsenal but was still capable of producing a touch of class on the ball regardless of the chaos and the pressure of the moment.\n\nThat's one of the reasons Liverpool are doing so well. Is Van Dijk now the best central defender in the Premier League? I think he is you know.\n\nDid you know? In Liverpool's game against Arsenal, Van Dijk had the best passing accuracy (94.4%) of all players.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Arsenal 1-1 Liverpool: Draw is a 'logical' result - Jurgen Klopp\n\nRob Holding: In a team very different from the one Arsene Wenger tried to create prior to leaving Arsenal, there is a particular player who has surprised me a great deal.\n\nI've seen Rob Holding play for Arsenal but never better than when I saw him against Liverpool.\n\nIn a white-hot atmosphere, the defender was cool on the ball and played with a confidence and assurance I hadn't seen before.\n\nI said Unai Emery would get it together at Arsenal, I just didn't think it would be so soon. Damn!\n\nDid you know? Only Granit Xhaka (97) attempted more passes for Arsenal against Liverpool than Holding (81) - the defender also won 70% of his 10 duels in the game.\n\nMidfielders - James Milner (Liverpool), Paul Pogba (Man Utd), Felipe Anderson (West Ham), Erik Lamela (Tottenham)\n\nJames Milner: James Milner has taken the early lead for my Footballer of the Year. I must say that Eden Hazard is a close second but the way Milner is leading Liverpool through some very tricky games is very impressive.\n\nAgainst Arsenal the ball couldn't have dropped in front of a more cool-headed but utterly ruthless professional.\n\nWhatever happens between now and the end of the season I guarantee you Milner will be featuring in my TOTW on a few more occasions.\n\nDid you know? Milner's opener against Arsenal was his 50th goal in the Premier League with 14 of them for Liverpool, more than any other side he's played for in the competition.\n\nPaul Pogba: When you consider the entire Bournemouth team cost significantly less than Paul Pogba, you're perfectly entitled to think that Manchester United should have played Eddie Howe's Cherries off the park.\n\nThat perception couldn't have been further from the truth but, with a swivel of the hips and a beautifully flighted cross, Pogba made the difference.\n\nThe France World Cup winner's performances may not be pulling up any trees for United at the moment but they are saving Jose Mourinho's skin.\n\nDid you know? Pogba created four goalscoring chances against Bournemouth, his joint-best tally in a Premier League game this season (also four v Burnley).\n\nFelipe Anderson: West Ham were beginning to make hard work of this game at London Stadium. Fortunately for the Hammers, Burnley seemed to make life considerably more difficult for themselves, much to the delight of Felipe Anderson.\n\nThe Brazilian has looked impressive on the ball this season, however, against Burnley he looked just as impressive in front of goal.\n\nThis was an important win for West Ham. They can't be losing home games to Burnley.\n\nFelipe Anderson joined West Ham for a club record \u00a336m from Lazio in July\n\nDid you know? Anderson netted more goals against Burnley (two) than he did in his first 10 Premier League appearances for West Ham (one). Anderson is the first Brazilian player to score twice in a game for West Ham in the Premier League.\n\nErik Lamela: Last week I told you Erik Lamela had the ability to force Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to place Dele Alli onto the bench for a period of time.\n\nThe Argentine's performance against Wolves simply reinforced what I already knew. If Alli knows what is good for him he should treat the challenge as a compliment.\n\nCompetition for places has always been in the best interest of the team and the player on the bench can learn a lot. Mainly how to win his place back.\n\nDid you know? Lamela has had a hand in 11 goals in his past 12 appearances in all competitions (eight goals, three assists).\n\nForwards - Raheem Sterling (Man City), Alvaro Morata (Chelsea), Richarlison (Everton)\n\nRaheem Sterling: People who read my TOTW on a regular basis will know how good I think this lad can be. His performance against Southampton paid testimony to that.\n\nHowever, the thought of Raheem Sterling stalling on this contract extension offer with Manchester City is ill conceived. I honestly think Sterling can be the next Cristiano Ronaldo but to become the best in the world you need the best teacher or to be amongst the best players.\n\nCity already have the best teacher and their players are developing fast. If Sterling knows what's good for him he should stay where he is. At least for the time being.\n\nDid you know? Against Southampton, Sterling became the first English player to both score and assist two goals in the same Premier League game since Theo Walcott did for Arsenal against Newcastle in December 2012.\n\nAlvaro Morata: I was so furious with Alvaro Morata I nearly didn't select him for my TOTW. How does a player who is finding goals so difficult to come by decide to showboat when presented with a glorious chance to get your hat-trick?\n\nFor a player who has a reputation for missing chances, he cannot allow hat-trick opportunities to pass him by with such scant disregard for the goalkeeper.\n\nMorata took both his earlier goals against Crystal Palace in a professional manner - but the Spain international does not have the finishing power to be so flash in front of goal.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'Fragile' Morata still needs to improve - Sarri\n\nDid you know? Morata has scored four goals in his past four Premier League games - one more than in his previous 23 appearances in the competition combined (three).\n\nRicharlison: Richarlison is clearly loving it at Goodison Park. His first goal against Brighton was clinical, and his second majestic. He went around Lewis Dunk as though he wasn't there.\n\nThe Brazilian is becoming the sort of player he struggled to become at Watford.\n\nRicharlison was a good player at a good club at Vicarage Road. He's fast becoming a star at a big club at Everton.\n\nDid you know? Richarlison has scored six goals in nine Premier League appearances in 2018-19, one more than his total haul from 38 games last season.\n\nNow it's your turn\n\nYou've seen my picks this week.

No British trained horse, though, has ever won the 'race that stops a nation', first staged in 1861.\n\nThe list of close calls contains no fewer than eight second placings, three by the redoubtable Red Cadeaux, who was much-admired by Australians for his nearly-exploits and is buried at Flemington, the Cup's home track.\n\nAussie racing figures once lauded the globalising of one of their great sporting institutions, but now ponder whether it has become too international - 2017 saw eight of the first 10 home from outside Oceania. This year too, overseas challengers dominate the richest two-mile handicap in the world, worth in all A$7.3m (\u00a34.06m).\n\nYucatan, one of Irish champion trainer Aidan O'Brien's trio of raiders, heads the field, while six horses based in the UK are close up behind him in the big-race betting market: Magic Circle, Cross Counter, Muntahaa, Best Solution, Marmelo and A Prince Of Arran. Scotland-trained Nakeeta, fifth last year, has also made the trip.\n\nThe Ian Williams-trained Magic Circle has made a particular impact during the frenetic build-up in Melbourne. This is partly because he has won his only two races this year - the Chester Cup and the Henry II Stakes, Sandown, both in May - but also because of his colourful owner Dr Marwan Koukash.\n\nMagic Circle won at Chester in May\n\nThe multi-millionaire, formerly owner of the Salford Red Devils rugby league team, had to be persuaded in May not to collect the Chester Cup semi-naked. He has suggested he may do so in Australia. In news conferences, Koukash has been showing off a thong he says he will wear - with tie and shoes - to collect the Melbourne Cup.\n\nWilliams admits that Koukash - whom, he jokes, is \"a bloody nightmare\" to train horses for - has the local media riveted.\n\n\"The boss-man is certainly making himself very apparent and very well-known,\" he said.\n\n\"But look through all the banter, we've definitely got a serious contender, and it's great to be here not just for the day out but with a proper and serious contender.\n\n\"I think Magic Circle has quite an incredible turn of foot, and what he can do in the last four or five hundred metres of a race is something quite exceptional.\n\n\"He's a horse that's often slow into stride, so hopefully he can sneak into it down the back straight and get a nice position and then show his main asset, his finishing prowess.\"\n\nIt's considered a major plus that jockey Corey Brown, a two-time Cup winner, on Shocking in 2009 and then Rekindling, is taking the mount on Magic Circle, who looks to take to a new level Williams' already successful 120-horse, flat and national hunt operation, based just outside Birmingham.\n\n\"I think as a trainer you want to push the boundaries,\" said Williams. \"We've been very lucky to have lots of winners in the UK, and we've had winners in Dubai, but Melbourne is just an exceptional place to come\n\n\"There's the whole carnival feel and the hype, and yes it's the race that stops the Australian nation, but it has such worldwide coverage and prestige - I'm very excited to be here, and with a chance.\"\n\nAnalysis of the field\n\nYucatan, likely to be the shortest-priced favourite in more than a decade, is joined by Cliffs Of Moher - known in Australia as The Cliffsofmoher to avoid confusion with another Aussie horse - and Rostropovich as Aidan O'Brien looks to emulate his trainer-son Joseph, who won in 2017 with Rekindling.\n\nIf successful, Muntahaa and jockey Jim Crowley - easy winners of York's Ebor Handicap in August - would continue the most stellar of years being enjoyed by John Gosden, trainer of Enable and Roaring Lion.\n\nLikewise, Best Solution and Cross Counter look to continue the fine run of Sheikh Mohammed's Epsom Derby-winning Godolphin operation.\n\nBritish hopefuls back for more after finishing down the field in 2017 are Nakeeta (who was fifth) and Marmelo (ninth).\n\nA Prince Of Arran, trained at Newmarket by Charlie Fellowes, recorded a notable win in Flemington's Lexus Stakes on 3 November to ensure a place in the line-up.\n\nBest of the 'home team' may be ex-French hopeful Avilius, a Godolphin horse based in Australia under the care of James Cummings.

They had lost just once all season. It was a case of how much resistance Motherwell could put up.\n\nThe game was less than three minutes old when Harrison cut on to her right foot and picked a spot in the far corner. It was a horror start for Motherwell, but it was a moment of sheer class from the striker.\n\nAfter that, though, Motherwell fell apart. Rachel McLauchlan picked out Napier at the back post, who had an easy task to finish. And the game was all but over 16 minutes in when Harrison volleyed in her second after Motherwell failed to clear.\n\nNow memories drifted back to May, when Hibs put nine past Celtic to win the League Cup, and it was easy to wonder how many goals they would conjure up here.\n\nHarrison limped off clutching a hamstring before she could claim her hat-trick. Davidson replaced her and within three minutes raced on to a through ball to make it four.\n\nMotherwell's confidence was destroyed. Their energy levels evaporated. Napier took the ball past Emma Black and goalkeeper Autumn Farrell without breaking sweat, and only Welsh's intervention stopped the ball going over the line. Unfortunately for her, Welsh would concede an own goal a minute later, before Michie made it six.\n\nThe only temporary reprieve for Motherwell was the half-time break, and then it started again. Napier headed in a seventh. By the time the 18-year-old tapped in her hat-trick ,the celebrations were already muted.\n\nThe fact that there were 30 minutes were still on the clock was ominous for Donald Jennow's side, but Hibs began to get wasteful. None more so than McLauchlan, who probably deserved a goal for her performance, but fired over an empty net from two yards out. Ellis Notley headed off the bar in time added on.\n\nThe job though was done, and head coach Grant Scott claimed his second piece of silverware since taking charge of the Leith side.\n\nPost-match reaction\n\nHibs head coach Grant Scott: \"It's going to be difficult for Motherwell when we score so early. We've not lost a lot of goals this season.\n\n\"Motherwell deserve a stack of credit for getting here, and it's against a top side, so they shouldn't dwell on it too much.\"\n\nMotherwell head coach Donald Jennow: \"Hibs moved the ball at a pace from side to side that we're really not used to. I think it would be unfair to say it was just down to us; Hibs played incredibly well.\n\n\"That's the jump in level that my players need to get used to now, that when they make mistakes against this calibre of opposition, they're going to get punished more often than not.\"", "Image copyright PA Image caption Grace Freeman from the Wilfred Owen Association with the bugle the poet took from a dead German soldier\n\nThe centenary of the death of World War One poet Wilfred Owen was marked on Sunday with the sounding of a bugle he took from the battlefield.\n\nThe instrument was played at his graveside in Ors, northern France.\n\nElizabeth Owen, the widow of his nephew Peter, was among those who attended the \"moving\" ceremony.\n\nOwen died on 4 November 1918, seven days before peace was declared.

no other team has done so on more than six occasions in the same timeframe.\n\nAnd they threatened from the off, as Southampton had already been warned of their hosts' attacking quality several times, before Hoedt's attempted clearance ended up in his own net.\n\nAguero had already spurned one good chance before he turned in Sterling's cross for his 150th Premier League goal, after the England forward and Bernardo Silva linked up classily.\n\nDavid Silva then added his side's third in the 18th minute, his powerful volley from Sane's flick-on leaving McCarthy helpless, but before then the Blues had seen a number of dangerous attacks break down.\n\nThe home side eased off after this early blitz, which saw them enjoy 81% of the possession in the opening 20 minutes, with a fifth straight league win over Southampton already in the bag.\n\nLivewire Sterling shows his class\n\nRaheem Sterling has now contributed to 11 goals in nine Premier League outings this term\n\nIngs' penalty seemed to reignite the hosts' appetite for goals, as City began to push again, in large through the excellent Sterling.\n\nAnd it was the ex-Liverpool winger who netted their fourth, stroking in at the second attempt, after initially miss-controlling Aguero's pass.\n\nAfter being heavily involved in all three of their opening goals, Sterling's effort was richly deserved.\n\nThe England man was lively throughout, and although he could have done better with several half-chances, he illustrated his clinical side by powering in his 50th goal for the club on 67 minutes.\n\nHaving earlier set up Aguero's tap-in, Sterling again turned provider late on, as it was from his pass that Sane netted City's sixth.\n\nThe German's strike took his club's goal tally to 33 after the opening 11 Premier League games, meaning they are well on their way to matching last season's record-breaking tally of 106, although they had already netted 38 by this stage in 2017-18.\n\nSaints blown away\n\nFew would have given Saints much of a chance coming into this match, given the fact they were winless in their last eight visits to the Etihad prior to Sunday, and that proved to be the case.\n\nGuardiola's side were ruthless, punishing nearly every goalscoring opportunity in the opening stages.\n\nAnd although Ings' fifth goal of the season did provide them with a potential way back into the game, they never looked like producing any sort of comeback.\n\nChances were few and far between for Mark Hughes' side, although Ings did draw a good save from Ederson after the Brazilian had fumbled a powerful James Ward-Prowse strike.\n\nAnd City's goalkeeper also had to be alert shortly after, getting down low to keep out Ings' near-post header.\n\nBut they failed to mount a sustained period of pressure, and it was the home side that looked more likely to score throughout the second half, as the Saints' search for a second Premier League victory of the season goes on.\n\nMan of the match -

The chance to get his own back would come later.\n\nWhether Boyd carries too much timber is a debate that will likely run on, but what was clearly evident was how much his physical presence unsettled the Dons' defence.\n\nKilmarnock deserved a goal from the move that brought about the penalty - a rare glimpse of passing and flow that was started by guess who? Boyd.\n\nHis elegant flick sent Jordan Jones scampering down the left, and the Northern Ireland international had the wherewithal to pick out Stephen O'Donnell. Joe Lewis's save from the full-back was good but Shay Logan's challenge on Chris Burke with the ball rolling out of play was unnecessary.\n\nCue Boyd's revenge.

And this time the 20-year-old cleverly stuck out a foot to divert McGinn's straightforward shot past a despairing MacDonald.\n\nNeedless to say, the Aberdeen fans let Boyd hear their delight as he came off, and better was to come for the travelling fans.\n\nFerguson, deployed in a more attacking role with little yield, was presented with a free-kick opportunity 20 yards out and skidded a sumptuous finish in to the bottom right-hand corner.\n\nAnd where did Ferguson get to celebrate? In front of those jubilant away fans.\n\n'McInnes preserves winning record' - analysis\n\nIn the last eight days, Aberdeen have progressed to a League Cup final, beaten Hamilton comfortably at home, and been the first side to beat Kilmarnock in seven games.\n\nThis might be looked upon as a fortunate win, given Kilmarnock looked in control for the opening hour at least, but football matches can turn in the most unexpected ways.\n\nAnderson, not for the first time this season, has dug Aberdeen out of tight spot. His promise and potential is a positive, as is the burgeoning influence of Ferguson.\n\nKilmarnock will wonder how they didn't taken anything from this game, yet maybe it's not just meant to be against Aberdeen at Rugby Park - McInnes has won every time he's been here as Dons boss.\n\nThe hosts are still perched in the top six, though, somewhere Aberdeen are still striving to settle this season.\n\n'We were limp & half-hearted in first half' - reaction\n\nKilmarnock manager Steve Clarke: \"If you have as much control of a match as we had, you have to create a few more opportunities and get the second goal, which would have put the game to bed.\n\n\"I don't think that anyone could have seen Aberdeen scoring twice near the end because they only had two shots on target all afternoon. It's a tough one to take.\"\n\nAberdeen manager Derek McInnes: \"Kilmarnock played with far more intent, more aggression, the penalty epitomised how we were - Shay's Logan challenge was limp, half hearted.\n\n\"The only one for me who had a 90-minute performance in him was young Lewis [Ferguson].

He didn't seem to be enjoying the experience today, often looking rattled during heated exchanges.\n\nThe money trail was at the heart of the interview. Mr Banks looked most uncomfortable when probed about the relationship between his companies.\n\nDespite repeated questions, he insisted the funding he provided for the Brexit campaign came from his UK based company, Rock Services. But when Andrew Marr highlighted Mr Banks' own evidence to a committee of MPs - which apparently differed from this account - he appeared flustered.\n\n\"I haven't seen the actual transcript of that. I will go back and look at that, but I'm telling you that the source of the funding was Rock Services, \" he said..\n\nAlthough Arron Banks insisted that he had disclosed the accounts of his Isle of Man company, Rock Holdings, to the BBC, Andrew Marr replied that they were \"redacted\" and showed very little.\n\nThe questions about where the \u00a38m donation came from will linger. Arron Banks denies all wrongdoing, but as the criminal investigation now gets under way, he can expect an uncomfortable few months of financial scrutiny.\n\nWhere does the investigation go from here?\n\nThe National Crime Agency said: \"This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail.\"\n\nSeparately, the Metropolitan Police is examining whether to launch a criminal investigation into whether Leave.EU broke its \u00a3700,000 spending limits, after a file was handed to it by the Electoral Commission.

It was angst-ridden, but in a different way to the Six Nations slaughter in February.\n\nIt was a game they owned in the second half, a game where they passed up numerous kickable penalties in order to go for touch in the hope of getting five or seven points instead of three.\n\nUnderstandable, but ill-fated. Wales' defence was animalistic. Had Jonny Gray climbed aboard a combine harvester and driven it straight at the home forwards, they'd have found some way of stopping him.\n\nThey made double the number of tackles the Scots made and most of them came in the second 40 when the visitors virtually set up camp in their 22. Ross Moriarty made 18 tackles. Dan Lydiate made 21.\n\nOf the eight-man Welsh pack, six of them ended up in double figures for tackles made. In Scotland's pack, that number was just two.\n\nAmid this possession mountain, Scotland went close numerous times. Gray was an inch away but was done for a double movement as he tried to work the ball to the try-line. Pete Horne, after terrific ingenuity from his brother George, looked to have cracked the Welsh defence, but the TMO ruled otherwise.\n\nThose were the stand-out chances, but not the only chances. Scotland were repelled by superb defence, yes, but they didn't do themselves many favours either.\n\n'Hastings needs time to develop'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Davies scores on return to confirm Welsh victory\n\nThis was the biggest game of Adam Hastings' young life and he experienced how quick and how brutal life is at the top level, especially in the intensity of a Saturday in Cardiff.\n\nThe fly-half kicked too much ball away and missed the occasional overlap, but he has to learn somewhere, somehow. He has talent, but that talent needs time to develop. If Cardiff doesn't crush him, it'll make him stronger.\n\nThat second half saw huge performances from Hamish Watson and Ryan Wilson in the Scotland back row, but the damage had been done by then. Two missed tackles, two tries. There was no coming back from it.\n\nThe midfield was, until recently, deemed a land of plenty for Gregor Townsend, a position where his only concern was who to pick among his myriad options. That's not so much the case now.\n\nThere has always been issues surrounding Jones' defence, but they were camouflaged by the strength of his attack. And now? Getting exposed so badly, and less than a year out from a World Cup, will have come as a shock to the system for the Scotland management. For all his attacking nous, can Jones, a shoo-in for selection until now, be trusted in defence as Scotland head into a momentous season?\n\nThe runners and riders in midfield aren't looking so hot all of a sudden.\n\nDuncan Taylor, a certainty if he could ever catch a break from the rugby gods, is not expected back until June after rupturing his anterior and posterior crucial ligaments. Mark Bennett is also injured.\n\nAlex Dunbar is struggling to find his best stuff. Chris Harris had his own Cardiff horror-show earlier this year. Matt Scott is going well and Horne is still bang there, but with Jones revealing another side to his game and Taylor struggling to make Japan, this is not the area of strength it once was.\n\nThe remaining games of the autumn will be instructive. Finn Russell will return either next week against Fiji or the following weekend against South Africa and everything should look better. It'll look better still whenever Stuart Hogg returns.\n\nTownsend has cause for optimism going forward, but you could tell that Saturday hurt him. This was a chance to answer Gatland and his barbs after the February collapse, but it was a chance wasted.\n\n'Weir was a colossus'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'What an inspiration' - Doddie Weir given emotional ovation\n\nThe day threw up images of Jones missing those tackles, but the abiding memory for many will be the scenes before a ball was kicked. This was a game to honour Doddie Weir and the big man was a colossus.\n\nHe was on the pitch beforehand and back on the pitch afterwards. He spoke with class and humour. Surrounded by his family and cheered to the rafters by more than 60,000 supporters from both countries, he once again reminded us what real bravery is all about.\n\nIt's not about about tackle counts or ruck clearances, or having the nerve to land a late penalty to win a game. The way the big fella has faced up to his disease with an unbreakable smile on his face has awed the masses. Wales won the match, but Doddie Weir won every heart and soul in the place.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Watch: Serena Williams calls umpire 'liar' and 'thief'\n\nRoger Federer says fellow tennis great Serena Williams \"went too far\" in her outburst at the umpire during September's US Open final.\n\nWilliams received a code violation for coaching, a penalty point for racquet abuse and a game penalty for calling the umpire a \"liar\" and a \"thief\" during her defeat by Naomi Osaka.\n\nFederer said the incident could have been handled differently.\n\n\"I feel like Serena should have walked away,\" he told the Sunday Times.\n\n\"She did, but she went too far.

It cost like \u00a3100,000 but I just put it in the bin.\"\n\nMuch to the consternation of the band's label, XL Recordings, one assumes - given all that time and money spent shooting and editing the video for it all to go down the drain.\n\nLiam says he \"made a few calls\", however, and got director Walter Stern on board - having worked with him previously.\n\n\"Videos cost a lot more money in those days and I think we only had \u00a320,000 left, so I asked Walter if he could help us out.\n\n\"The reason why the video was black and white was because we couldn't pay for colour,\" he adds.\n\nHaving the menacing-looking Keith Flint perform in a disused London Underground tunnel in anything but black and white seems unthinkable now, but Liam promises it wasn't a conscious decision.\n\n\"This is how these things happen with our band, they're very spontaneous. None of it is pre-conceived or contrived in any way.

But there were also many cynics who cast doubt on the story. She felt compelled to check it out.\n\nLike all good stories, this one starts with a cup of tea in a friend's garden. We're talking, as we often talk, about houses - the impossibility, in this expensive corner of Sussex, of finding a home you can actually afford. Rents around here, even for the smallest two-bedroom house, average \u00a31,000 a month or more. In my case, as a self-employed single parent with two small children, every penny, and many a sleepless night, are spent keeping a roof over our heads.\n\nMy friend mentions some houses that a man left for low-income families to rent for three years at \u00a3300 a month.\n\nWe remark on the good humans; how stories like this are something we need to hear more and more. Later, scrolling through the shouty soapbox noise of Twitter, I decide to share this nugget of niceness. I don't expect anyone to respond - I don't use hashtags or copy anyone in. My normal tweets about Virginia Woolf and geeky lit events get barely a scattering of likes. I write:\n\nJust heard about a guy who died in my village + left 3 houses to the council, with the stipulation that they're for young families to rent for a fixed period of 3yrs with rent of \u00a3300 pcm (in an area where rent is \u00a31000+). Because we all need to talk more about the good humans.\n\nTalking about the good humans is something I feel we definitely all need to do. Especially on Twitter. But I had no idea how much Twitter agreed.\n\nI wake up the next morning to 5,000 likes. The rest of the day, my phone explodes, until I have to turn notifications off. I watch the number rise hypnotically, swiping down on my screen to see the tally go up, 100 more at each refresh. Night falls with 41K likes, 8,000 retweets and nearly 200 comments.\n\nThe comments seem to fall into three categories:\n\n1) People praising this stranger's random act of kindness (\"give him a sainthood\"), thanking me for sharing good news, pleased there's goodness in the world.\n\n2) People who think I've made it up (\"I'm filing this under things that didn't happen\") - a few put me forward for @DHOTYA, the Didn't Happen of the Year Awards.\n\n3) Cynics, sceptical about the council (\"Three lucky council officials\") or about the capitalist system (\"Three houses? He's the problem\" / \"How much was he charging when he was alive though?\"). Also random racists: \"They will give it to immigrants\" / \"The Somalis will be grateful.\"\n\nSomething which began as a local anecdote has suddenly become a story I have to prove. I find myself in the uncomfortable grey zone where something becomes \"true\" through popularity not fact. Despite having presented it purely as something I'd \"heard\", I feel compelled to uncover the truth as I watch comment after comment deride the landlord's kindness with cynicism.\n\nOther comments spur me on, such as: \"This man deserves a plaque memorialising his contribution\" and \"Shame you don't mention the benefactor's name so they can be acknowledged for this great act of kindness and generosity.\"\n\nSo I start asking around the village. I speak to the parish council, to the village history group, to people walking on the green. And the stories I discover reveal even more kindness than I expected.\n\nSt Mary's Church, Ringmer, 2014\n\nApril, four years ago, the village church. People of all ages and backgrounds have come to celebrate the life of a remarkable man. Ian Askew, 92 - Army captain and Military Cross winner, High Sheriff of Sussex, joint master of the Southdown Hunt, antiques dealer, churchgoer, star of many a local pantomime, philanthropist. A good-humoured, high-spirited bachelor, for whom his community became his family, dishing out money, often anonymously, to local groups and individuals in need.\n\n\"Ian could mix with everybody,\" recalls one local. \"He was well-known as someone who would talk with anyone, often popping into coffee mornings at the village hall and chatting with older residents. He had strong relationships with all his tenants, never raising rents or throwing anyone out. There are still people living on the old controlled rents on his estate.\"\n\nAskew lived alone in nearby Wellingham House but, finding it bigger than he needed, he let a charity have it for a peppercorn rent, and it became a home for people with learning difficulties.\n\nThe more I hear, the more I realise that Ian Askew may have died in 2014, but in the gifts he leaves behind he very much lives on.\n\nThe Brickworks, The Broyle, Ringmer, 1970\n\nThe stories take me further back still, to 1970, a few fields away from the church, where a large Victorian brickworks is making its final bricks. For nearly 200 years, a brickworks has stood here. The village, rich in Weald clay, has been renowned for its pottery since the Norman conquest - there are remains of medieval kilns scattered all over these fields. Bricks from this brickyard built every house on the pre-war Nevill estate in nearby Lewes. The clay pond will one day become part of an animal rescue centre, housing ducks that my children and I will spend many afternoons feeding.\n\nThe Bentley Estate, 1970\n\nNot far over the fields, in the sprawling Bentley estate, a man called Gerald Askew is taking his final breaths. Gerald is Ian Askew's brother. Between them, they own much of the area: Plashett Wood, where my children will, years later, go to forest school; Wellingham House, next door to my children's future nursery; Bentley, where we will go for my son's second birthday. They also own the brickworks. But now Gerald is dying, the kilns have stopped firing, and soon Ian Askew will come up with a plan for the brickyard house.\n\nThe Jubilee Cottages, 1977\n\nIan turns the house into two semi-detached cottages, to be let to young couples while they wait for years on the council housing list. He calls them the Jubilee Cottages, to mark the Queen's 1977 Silver Jubilee. He has seen the difficulties faced by families in need as they languish on the waiting list, and he wants to help them, by allowing them to rent his houses for the same price as a council house (then \u00a3100 or so per month) until they reach the top of the list. The cottages are managed by the district council until all housing stock is sold off. They are then placed into a protected trust, managed, to this day, by Ringmer parish council.\n\nImage copyright Ringmer Historical Society Image caption The cottages, above, in 1920 and 1960; and below, derelict in 1975 and restored in 2009\n\nContrary to Twitter's cynical assumption that the houses would be sold, rented out at an inflated price or reserved for council officials and their relatives, Askew's intention has in fact been honoured for four decades, and that shows no signs of changing. The houses are now rented out for three years, not two, as they were in the past, and though the rent appears to have tripled to \u00a3300 it has actually halved in real terms. Families apply to the parish, outlining their circumstances and their connection to the area. Many use the opportunity to save up for a deposit to get a foot on the precarious housing ladder.\n\nThe cottages are beautiful and remote, surrounded by fields and fresh air\n\nAs I try to find past tenants to speak to about the cottages, I am surprised to discover I recognise one of the names - a family I met in a swimming class years ago when we had babies of the same age. I ask them what the Jubilee tenancy meant to them.\n\n\"We were so grateful for the cottage and the generosity of the Askew family and the parish. It enabled us to start our married life without the strain of money worries, staying close to our families in an otherwise unaffordable location. Being at Jubilee enabled us to start our own business, as well as prepare for a family of our own, saving for a deposit for our first home where we now live. None of that would have been possible without this legacy.\"\n\nI visit the cottages. They are beautiful and remote, surrounded by fields and fresh air. Children's toys fill the garden. Above the front door, a stone is engraved with the details of Askew's gift and the date, 1977. These are sturdy family homes, built to last. A place that once made bricks is now helping young families save for bricks of their own.\n\nWhat would happen to people if they couldn't live here? They'd be forced to move 20 miles away or more. As the local housing office told me a few years ago: \"We simply can't house people in Lewes. You have to go further afield.\"\n\nImage copyright Ringmer Historical Society\n\nAt a time when private accommodation is unstable and expensive, and public housing barely exists, it's comforting to think that part of the gap is being filled in these informal, compassionate ways. Some of the Twitter comments highlight similar acts of philanthropy around the UK. More good humans, whom we should talk about. As someone says on Twitter, \"Was this in the news? It should be everywhere. Might encourage others to do the same.\" Another comment hopes Askew might \"start a new trend\".\n\nI discover that Ringmer is the village that kindness built\n\nAt present, there are so many gaps that people fall through. A young person tells me on Twitter: As a person at risk of homelessness, I applaud this man. There aren't enough houses. Though I am top priority, if the houses are not there, my choice is a B&B in the city which means a 2hr school run everyday, the streets, or living with my abusers.\n\nThe more I look, the more I discover that Ringmer is the village that kindness built. Ian Askew's gift here is not the only legacy of its kind, with some acts of philanthropy going back hundreds of years. In 1787, Miss Henrietta Hay left \u00a32,000 to be invested, the interest paid to elderly people in need in the parish in the form of small pensions. Her wishes have been carried out for over 200 years, with local residents receiving windfalls every year just before Christmas. Going further back still, to the 1690s, Dame Barbara Thomas and Sybilla Stapley bequeathed \u00a3200 to pay the salary of a schoolmaster at Ringmer Charity School. Teachers' salaries may have changed in the last 300 years, but the endowment still exists, donations still being made to support the village school. And Ian Askew's legacy lives on beyond Jubilee Cottages. His Charitable Fund still supports charities and organisations across Sussex.\n\nEvery Wednesday evening, as I put my children to bed, I hear the bellringers practising in the village church. I draw great comfort from it. I get chatting to a man who tells me that, a few weeks after Ian Askew's death, the bellringers marked what would have been his 93rd birthday - 9 May 2014 - by playing a \"Plain Bob Minor\".\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption St Mary's church, Ringmer\n\nI wouldn't have been listening then. I would've been in my old house, frustratedly searching for somewhere to live, to build a new life. Typing in criteria like \"garden\" and \"two bedrooms\", when all the while I should have been typing: \"A place that cares enough for bellringers to mark the birthday of a late good human.\"\n\nWe don't always know what we really want when we are trying to make a home\n\nBut of course there's no tickbox for such things. No compassion-o-meter to measure the small moments, tiny acts, tender stories and kind people sewn into the fabric of your area. The people who check in on sick neighbours or get groceries for the elderly, who lend you the pound for your shopping trolley, who help you get on to the bus with your pushchair, who smile at you warmly for no reason at all, who clear the snow from your winter path. In this case, the man who goes to coffee mornings, church services and village meetings, always listening out to hear what people need, then quietly making anonymous donations.\n\nWe don't always know what we really want when we are trying to make a home. For the people on Ian Askew's list for the Jubilee Cottages, it's clear though that they want somewhere safe for three years while they get themselves sorted. Where they won't be randomly evicted when the landlord sells, or ups the rent. Where they can feel some of the goodness that may have eluded them until signing that lease.\n\nCompared with the beautiful, chocolate-box villages around here, Ringmer is often seen as a budget suburb of Lewes, a concrete splodge in the South Downs. Outsiders rarely see beyond the centre of the village: chippy, offie, Dominos, McColls. Funeral parlour, pet shop. A shop that keeps changing - tanning salon, nail bar, dance studio, now empty. You have to dig a bit deeper to discover the independent bakery that bakes the best bread; the tiny public library, shut down this year by the council, only to be reopened as a community library by a tenacious group of locals; the community orchard full of local varieties of apples, pears and plums, planted on land donated by a local farmer and run by passionate volunteers.\n\nWhen I moved with my children into our Ringmer home, I wasn't looking for a community, and until now I didn't know I had one. But a random tweet has connected me to a village built on compassion and stories. A place of good humans.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nTheo had just turned 17 when he became homeless.

As a result he drives only about 4,000 miles a year.\n\nRather than pay an annual premium upfront, he has a policy that is effectively pay-as-you-go.\n\nImage caption John Leahy says he now thinks more about whether he really needs to drive somewhere\n\nHe reckons he will save between \u00a3100 and \u00a3150 this year, or around 20% of his annual premium.\n\nHe is also more aware of what each trip in the car really costs.\n\n\"I'm now of the mindset of thinking, 'Do I need to take the car?'\n\n\"Because not only will I be paying for the petrol, but I'll also be paying for the insurance.\"\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThis year Mr Leahy paid a fixed fee of \u00a3170, plus a \u00a350 deposit. That covers him for fire and theft, and includes a black box that monitors his journeys.\n\nThen he pays 3.4p for each mile he actually drives. At the end of each trip he gets a notification of the cost.\n\nThe firm that supplies his insurance - called By Miles - believes most people driving less than 7,000 miles a year are likely to pay less than they would with a conventional policy.\n\nTypically that will be city-dwellers rather than those who live in the countryside.\n\n\"It gives you that flexibility to do a fair comparison before you start a journey - to say, 'Shall I walk it, shall I take the bus, or shall I take the train?'\" says the company's chief executive James Blackham.\n\nPay by time\n\nAnother way to save money is to pay according to the time you spend driving. So you can now buy car insurance by the hour, the day, the week or the month.\n\nThis could be useful if you want to drive your partner's car, or give a friend a lift home from the pub.\n\nBut it is especially handy if you are a student, and perhaps want to drive your parents' car in the holidays.\n\nOr, like 24-year-old musician Alfie Jeffries, if you only drive once in a while.\n\nImage caption Musician Alfie Jeffries insures his van by the hour\n\nHe shares a van which he uses for the band.\n\n\"Sometimes I'll only need to go to a rehearsal, so I only need to insure it for a couple of hours,\" he says.\n\n\"Sometimes I don't know how long the rehearsal is going to be, so I'll insure it for an hour, and then whenever the rehearsal finishes, insure it for another hour to get back.\"\n\nHow it works\n\nHaving signed up, motorists send a picture of their driving licence, as well as a selfie with the car they want to drive.\n\nBuying an hour's insurance costs roughly \u00a310, with day cover costing between \u00a320 and \u00a330.\n\nHowever, anyone who drives more than a couple of times each month is likely to find it cheaper to buy a conventional annual policy.\n\nThe firm that supplies this temporary insurance - called Cuvva - does not supply black boxes to monitor whether you have stopped driving by the time the cover expires.\n\nThat leaves them open to criticism that motorists may drive faster to get to their destination, or even continue driving without insurance.\n\n\"At the end of the day they're breaking the law if they're not insured, and people know that pretty effectively,\" says Freddy Macnamara, the chief executive.\n\nDrivers get a 15-minute warning before the policy expires, and they can then pull over and extend the cover.\n\nCrowd insurance\n\nTechnology also now makes it possible for people to club together for insurance.\n\nA firm called Laka - named after the Hawaiian goddess of prosperity and hula dancing - puts cycling enthusiasts in groups of a thousand or so.\n\nThey pay nothing upfront. However, at the end of the month any claims are totalled up, and shared between the members.\n\nIn good months, when there are no claims, they will pay nothing. In bad months, when there are several claims, their liability is limited, meaning they might pay a maximum of \u00a340 or so.\n\nImage caption Rupert England saves money on his bike insurance\n\nRupert England is a keen cyclist who has seen the benefits.\n\nOver the last six months he has paid just \u00a322.50 in premiums, instead of \u00a3200 under a conventional policy.\n\n\"I love it. It's like the crowd insuring itself,\" he says.\n\n\"If somebody spends three or four grand on a bike, I know they'll take care of it. They're not the ones who are going to leave them around or abuse them. And for me there is a feeling that if there's a claim on the crowd, actually it is a genuine claim.\"\n\nGolf 'clubs'\n\nTobi Taupitz, the founder of Laka, believes the traditional insurance model is outdated.\n\n\"There is a huge conflict of interest: the more insurers pay out in claims, the less profit they make. Customers want the opposite,\" he says.\n\n\"So the two parties have different interests, and I believe that is where the negative public perception of insurance companies is coming from.\"\n\nHis own firm covers high-end equipment belonging to hobbyists, who typically take care of their possessions.\n\nHe foresees policies becoming available for those who own expensive musical instruments, golf clubs or jewellery.\n\nSo if you need insurance, it now pays not just to shop around, but to consider more radical forms of cover as well.", "Image caption John Duncan, pictured here with Nicola Sturgeon, supports independence because he wants to bring power \"closer to the people\"\n\nA US congressman has reiterated his support for Scottish independence as he prepares to stand down after 30 years.\n\nJohn \"Jimmy\" Duncan was the only high-level US politician to back the Yes campaign in 2014.\n\nThe Republican represents Tennessee in the House of Representatives, and claims to have \"more Scottish ancestry than any other member of Congress\".\n\nThe staunch supporter of Donald Trump is not seeking re-election in next week's congressional elections.\n\nMr Duncan, who is co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Scotland Caucus, said he supports Scottish independence on the condition that the country does not move \"too far to the left\".\n\nSpeaking to the Sunday edition of the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, he said his endorsement was born of his love of small-government politics and a desire to bring power \"closer to the people\".\n\nImage caption The Tennessee congressman has played a leading role in the annual Scotland Week celebrations in the US\n\nHe said: \"I was interviewed by Fox News [before the 2014 referendum] and I said I thought it would be good if Scotland became an independent country as long as they allowed free enterprise and didn't go too far down the socialist path.\n\n\"There was an article written in a publication in Tennessee about me one time and they entitled it The Independent Man.\"\n\nMr Duncan, has met First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and several other Scottish politicians over the years, and has been a congressman since 1988 - when he succeeded his later father, who had represented the same district since 1964.\n\nHe said working with the Friends of Scotland Caucus was one of the most enjoyable things he had done in his three decades as a congressman.\n\nMr Duncan said: \"About 15 years ago they called me from the Scottish section of the British Embassy and said that they had done some research and I had more Scottish ancestry than any other member of congress.\n\n\"They wanted to know if I would help to found a Friends of Scotland Caucus.

In August measures were imposed on a number of industries including trade in gold, precious metals and the automotive sector.\n\nThe US has made it clear it wants eventually to cut off Iran's oil trade entirely, but has allowed eight countries to maintain imports as a temporary concession to give them time to reduce imports. US allies such as Italy, India, Japan and South Korea are among the eight, the Associated Press reports.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The IMF has predicted that Iran's economy will shrink by 1.5% this year\n\nGetting around sanctions\n\nIn order to allow companies to trade with Iran and not face stiff US penalties, the EU plans to implement a payment mechanism - a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will enable these companies to avoid the US financial system.\n\nLike a bank, the SPV, would handle transactions between Iran and companies trading with it, avoiding direct payments into and out of Iran.\n\nSo when Iran exports oil to a country in the EU, the company from the receiving country would pay into the SPV.\n\nIran can then use the payment as credit to buy goods from other countries in the EU through the SPV.\n\nThe EU has also updated a statute - called a blocking statue - that allows EU firms to recover damages from US sanctions.\n\nSo will they hold?\n\nEven with the EU plan in place, the costs of doing any Iran-related business could still be too high for many companies.\n\nFor example, even if the shipping operator were to purchase oil through the SPV mechanism, the company insuring the cargo may still face the threat of secondary sanctions and the potential loss of all its business in the United States.\n\nIran's economy isn't directly reliant on the US financial system, says Richard Nephew, a sanctions expert and senior researcher at Columbia University.\n\n\"But the issue is that most of Iran's biggest trading partners do and that affects their readiness to put at risk their access to the United States to do business with Iran.\"\n\nHe says small or medium-sized companies are more likely than large companies to use the SPV.\n\nAnother problem is that the product used in the SPV to trade with Iran may also violate secondary sanctions, says Leigh Hansson, head of international trade and national security at Reed Smith. \"The transaction itself will be problematic.\"\n\nTemporary compromise?\n\nThe US had insisted on cutting exports to zero but that seems unlikely as it would increase the price of oil, says Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at Birmingham University.\n\nIn addition to the countries allowed to continue buying Iranian oil, the backing of China, Iran's largest trading partner, may also prove critical.\n\nThe last time international sanctions were imposed on its oil industry between 2010 and 2016, Iran's exports fell by almost a half.\n\nThere's no doubt exports will be affected this time around too, but it's also clear that Iran and its remaining business partners will be working hard to maintain trading links.\n\n\"Don't be disillusioned about how painful this will be,\" says Ellie Geranmayeh, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. But \"Iran has weathered multiple rounds of sanctions before.\"\n\nIranians will be forced into finding creative ways to sell oil, relying on their years of experience of life under previous sanctions.\n\nAnd to fill the gap left by lost European investment, Iran will be looking east to forge new links with Russia and China.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Image copyright BBC / Clarence House Image caption Prince Charles turns 70 on 14 November\n\nThe Prince of Wales took his sons litter-picking during their school holidays in Norfolk, his eldest son the Duke of Cambridge has revealed.\n\n\"We were there with our spikes, stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags,\" Prince William explained.\n\n\"We both just thought: 'Oh well this is perfectly normal, everyone must do it',\" he told the BBC.\n\nWilliam shared the childhood anecdote in a special 60-minute programme to mark his father's 70th birthday.\n\nThe BBC was given exclusive access to Prince Charles over the last 12 months to film Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70.\n\nIn the documentary, William spoke alongside his brother the Duke of Sussex as they watch a screening of a speech Charles gave in 1970, warning of the dangers of plastic waste.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption William and Harry praised their father the Prince of Wales in the documentary\n\n\"That's amazing, look how young he is,\" Prince Harry whispered.\n\nHarry then praised his father for doing \"an amazing job\" and guiding them \"without telling us what we should be doing\".\n\n\"I used to get taken the mickey out of at school for just picking up rubbish,\" he says, warming to the litter-picking theme.\n\n\"I didn't go out consciously looking for it.

It involves a man who betrayed his leader only now to return him to power, an alleged murder plot, and two men laying claim to a grand white mansion that is a symbol of political power.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the constitutional crisis gripping this island nation.\n\nWhat set off this crisis?\n\nThis is complicated because there have been many twists and turns.\n\nLast week Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena shocked the nation by sacking Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, dissolving the cabinet, and suspending parliament. He said they hadn't been getting on.\n\nThe president then - in what many saw as the bigger surprise - appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa, the man he defeated in the 2015 presidential election, as the new PM.\n\nMr Rajapaksa led Sri Lanka for a crucial period between 2005 and 2015 and oversaw the controversial end of the country's brutal decades-long civil war. His family dominated Sri Lanka while he was in charge - and members of his inner circle were accused of corruption, war crimes and saddling the country with billions of dollars of debt owed to China.\n\nThe family deny wrongdoing, and remain popular, especially in rural areas. But India, the EU and the US are not happy to see his return, correspondents say.\n\nTo be clear on the extent of this political U-turn by Sri Lanka's president, you have to go back to the 2015 election. Mr Sirisena was accused of betraying Mr Rajapaksa because even though they belonged to the same political party, he teamed up with Ranil Wickremesinghe to defeat him.\n\nNow that relationship has turned sour and Mr Sirisena has turned back to his old ally-turned-rival-turned-ally again.\n\nSo, Rajapaksa has taken office?\n\nNot exactly. Mr Wickremesinghe - the man who was sacked - is refusing to leave Temple Trees, the colonial-era bungalow that is the prime minister's official residence.\n\nHe says what the president has done is unconstitutional and that he remains the real prime minister. He wants parliament to be convened so MPs can vote on the matter.\n\nBut Mr Sirisena has not yet allowed this to happen - and analysts say that's because he knows no majority yet exists that would endorse Mr Rajapaksa as PM. The Sirisena-Rajapaksa alliance is however trying to turn Wickremesinghe loyalists over to their side with ministries and other concessions. Some in the ousted PM's party allege bribes have been offered, though MPs from Mr Rajapaksa's party deny this.\n\nHowever the wheels of government have not stopped turning amid this crisis - Mr Rajapaksa has begun work and sworn in a cabinet. He, not Mr Wickremesinghe, is listed as prime minister on the official government website.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Rajapaksa has immediately presented himself as the legitimate prime minister\n\nWhy are people worried?\n\nThe situation is tense and there has already been one deadly confrontation.\n\nMr Wickremesinghe's supporters have formed a protective crowd at Temple Trees - and Buddhist monks have also been called there to chant prayers, in a possible bid to deter police from using force to remove the sacked PM.\n\nA parliamentary vote could defuse the crisis - but even then, supporters from the losing side could take to the streets in anger.\n\nThere is also disquiet in some quarters about the implications of Mahinda Rajapaksa's return to power. Quite apart from the controversial end to the civil war he oversaw an era, which rights groups and UN human rights officials say, saw extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and the rise of hardline Buddhist nationalism. He has always denied any connection with illegal activity, but activists fear his return could mean none of the allegations will be properly investigated.\n\nWhat are the roots of the saga?\n\nIt depends on who you talk to.\n\nIn a long address to the nation over the weekend, President Sirisena said tensions had been building up between him and his PM for years. He called Mr Wickremesinghe both arrogant and stubborn.\n\nHe has also linked him to a controversial central bank bond sale, which is alleged to have led to the loss of 11bn Sri Lankan rupees ($65m; \u00a350m). The president also alleged that a cabinet minister was involved in a plot to kill him and that police had obstructed an investigation.\n\nHowever, if you were to talk to Mr Wickremesinghe, he would say the roots of this crisis lie entirely in what he sees as the illegitimate actions of Mr Sirisena.\n\nIt's true that many analysts say that the coalition government the two formed was likely to collapse because of the fractured relationship.\n\nBut the way it happened has taken many by surprise.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Supporters of Mr Wickremesinghe have been gathering outside the official residence he is refusing to leave\n\nSo is it even legal?\n\nA number of constitutional experts have said the sacking of Mr Wickremesinghe is not legal. Under the constitution, as amended three years ago, the president does not have the power to remove the prime minister, says constitutional expert Dr Nihal Jayawickrama.\n\nIn fact under the 19th Amendment, almost all of the president's executive powers were taken away, he says. This amendment was introduced by both Mr Sirisena and Mr Wickremesinghe.\n\nAccording to Mr Jayawickrama \"only parliament can constitutionally remove a prime minister\".\n\nThere is a provision that the person most likely to command the confidence of parliament should be named as prime minister, but Mr Wickremesinghe is the leader of the largest party and easily won a no confidence motion earlier this year.\n\nThe president has cited a part of the constitution that allows him to appoint a prime minister as the basis for his removal of Mr Wickremesinghe - but some constitutional experts have cast doubt on the validity of that argument.\n\nWhat is the context?\n\nSri Lanka is a country that spent decades sunk in a brutal and bloody civil war between the government and the separatist Tamil Tigers, which ended with accusations of human rights atrocities on both sides. Mahinda Rajapaksa was in charge when many accused the government of killing thousands of civilians hemmed into a thin strip of land at the end of the war - the army always denied this.\n\nEventually the country once again became a top tourist destination and achieved the semblance of stability - but this unprecedented crisis puts that reputation at risk.\n\nThe EU has already threatened to stop Sri Lanka's lucrative duty-free trade access to the world's biggest single market if it rows back on commitments to human rights and reconciliation between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities.", "Image caption The chemical causes tumours to glow pink under UV light\n\nA chemical that makes brain tumours glow pink could help surgeons to remove the cancer safely, a trial suggests.\n\nScientists gave people with suspected glioma a drink containing 5-ALA, a substance known to accumulate in fast-growing cancer cells.\n\nThe pink glow the chemical causes was found in people with the most aggressive cancers.\n\nResearchers hope it will make it easier for surgeons to distinguish between cancer cells and healthy brain tissue.\n\nTreatment for glioma, the most common form of brain cancer and the one that killed ex-Labour cabinet minister Dame Tessa Jowell, usually involves surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and the prognosis for patients is often poor.\n\nFor this new trial, 99 patients with suspected high-grade (fast-growing) gliomas were given a drink containing 5-ALA before surgery.\n\nResearch has previously shown that 5-ALA ends up in fast-growing cancer cells, because they lack an enzyme needed to break down the chemical.\n\nSurgeons used microscopes to help them look for fluorescent tissue while removing tumours from the patients' brains.\n\nDuring their operations, surgeons reported seeing fluorescence in 85 patients.\n\nOf these, 81 were confirmed by pathologists to have high-grade disease, one was found to have low-grade disease and three could not be assessed.\n\nIn the 14 patients in whom surgeons did not see any fluorescence, seven tumours were found to be low-grade gliomas while the other seven could not be assessed.\n\nStudy author Dr Kathreena Kurian, associate professor in brain tumour research at the University of Bristol, said: \"There's an urgent need to have something while the patient is on the table, while the neurosurgeon is operating, which will guide them to find the worst bits.\n\n\"The beauty of 5-ALA is that they can see where high-grade glioma is, while they're operating.\"\n\nImage caption Dame Tessa Jowell died in May this year\n\nThe researchers caution that the study looked at patients who were already suspected to have high-grade tumours, and a larger study in which more patients have low-grade disease would provide more information on the use of this technique.\n\nOther types of markers may need to be tested for detecting low-grade glioma cells, they say.\n\nNext steps could include testing the 5-ALA in children with brain tumours, or to help surgeons distinguish between tumour tissue and scar tissue in adult patients, whose brain cancers have recurred following treatment.\n\nDr Paul Brennan, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"Highlighting the more aggressive tumour cells in real-time could help doctors achieve the delicate balance between removing as much of the tumour as possible while preserving surrounding healthy tissue.\n\n\"The fluorescent marker may also ease the burden of follow-up treatment, as cancer cells left behind after surgery require additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy.\"\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence approved the use of 5-ALA for patients with brain tumours, prior to surgery, earlier this year.\n\nThe research is being presented at the 2018 NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow from 4 to 6 November.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter.", "Referee Lee Probert showed a yellow card to Demarai Gray after Leicester's 55th-minute winner\n\nLeicester boss Claude Puel accepts referee Lee Probert had to book Demarai Gray for taking off his shirt to reveal a tribute to the club's owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.\n\nGray's goal saw Leicester beat Cardiff 1-0 in their first match since Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash last Saturday.\n\nAfter scoring, Gray removed his jersey to reveal an undershirt on which the words 'For Khun Vichai' were emblazoned as a tribute.\n\nUnder International Football Association Board rules, all players who remove their jerseys during post-goal celebrations are shown automatic yellow cards.\n\n\"We played like professionals and it was important for the referee to be professional too,\" Puel said.\n\nDiscussing the incident on Match of the Day, presenter and former Leicester player Gary Lineker said: \"There has been a lot of talk on social media about it -

Around $8 billion could be spent on political advertising across all races this year, according to a prediction by Borrell Associates.\n\nBut with many feeling 2016 election left civility and truth in tatters, some voters are seeing attack ads differently.\n\nWe speak to independent voters who say they will vote next week for the candidate with the least aggressive ads.\n\nThis story came from a discussion by members of a BBC News Facebook group about the midterms.\n\nAnne, Dave, Claire and Martin live thousands of miles from each other on opposite coasts of America, but they all agree on one thing - they are sick and tired of negativity.\n\nAs non-partisan voters without loyalty to a party or issue, their opposition to attack ads will define how they will cast their ballot on Tuesday.\n\n\"They really are my kryptonite and they are getting worse,\" Anne Berriman, a stay-at-home mum, explains. During one short advert break last week, she counted six attacks ads.\n\nCharity worker Claire Crawford, 62, who lives near Atlanta, Georgia, agrees: \"I will prefer to vote for the candidate who rises above the 'dirty' politics.

The party in power is on attack.\"\n\nThe other small difference this year in comparison to previous elections it that with so many negative ads running, a candidate cut could through the noise by running a positive one, he claims.\n\nAds may play loose with the truth, but Dave argues they are useful tools for revealing who's pulling the strings.\n\nImage copyright Dave Miller Image caption Dave Miller is a software engineer in Washington state\n\n\"When I see an ad, I'll research who is funding it.

Ads make you do the homework and ask what are they hiding or what are they actually bringing to the table.\"\n\nBut Anne and Claire don't believe they are a good way of raising political issues or potential problems in a candidate.\n\n\"I don't take well to being badgered, lied to, or talked down to,\" Claire argues.\n\nImage copyright Martin McShea Image caption Martin McShea is a locomotive engineer in Lancaster, Pennslyvania\n\nAnne believes that the negativity of these ads contributes to low youth turn-out: \"That frightens me. You have to see the positivity, and if you don't, then you think what's the point?\n\nIf attack ads are prompting voters to research candidates, doesn't that make them effective tools? Anne says no.\n\n\"There are better ways to do it. A candidate could explain their own position on, for example, healthcare, and mention that their opponent has a different approach,\" she suggests.\n\nClaire agrees: \"I'd rather hear how a candidate truthfully and honestly plans to assist our state and citizens.\"\n\nBut those hoping for more positivity in American political advertising are likely to wait a long time say experts.\n\n\"It's going to get worse in 2020 - it's a one-way ratchet.

The crowd was consumed by the stillness.\n\nAnd then came the noise.\n\nOnce the game was under way, Leicester's supporters sang in memory of their owner and roared encouragement to their players. Cardiff's fans joined in. This was a rare, harmonious atmosphere.\n\nOn the pitch, this looked like any other match. In the stands, it was one like no other.\n\nAnd after a week of tributes, Leicester provided another with a courageous victory, clinched by Demarai's Gray's goal, which prompted emotional celebrations that will be etched in the club's history.\n\nBelow, we hear from fans, players and managers about the emotions on a day that few at Cardiff City Stadium will ever forget.\n\n'Today was hard but next week will be doubly difficult'\n\nDi Statham, of the Foxes Trust supporters' group, is a lifelong Leicester fan and was in the away end at Cardiff City Stadium.\n\nIt's been a very emotional day. We didn't know what to expect. The Cardiff fans were brilliant. In the minute's silence, you could have heard a pin drop. We really appreciated that.\n\nNot only the team but the whole Leicester squad came out for the minute's silence and after the game to applaud the fans. We won for Vichai and it was nice to see some of the Cardiff fans had stayed behind after the game as well. So thank you, Cardiff fans.\n\nToday was hard but next week [the first home game since the crash] will be even harder. It's Remembrance weekend as well. We always do a big thing about that, so next week is going to be doubly difficult as we remember the fallen.

The family atmosphere we've created has been shaken to its core, so it's been a tough week to get through.\n\nAll credit to the lads for playing. It was very odd for the fans to get to the stadium and whip up some enthusiasm, but we had to do it for Vichai and what he did for Leicester City. They called him The Boss but he was the best boss. He was such a nice chap and he did everything for the club and the fans.\n\nI must praise Cardiff and their fans, how they treated us before the game, giving away free food in the concourse and things like that. These things put it all in perspective.\n\n'I will never forget Cardiff's gestures'\n\nIan Stringer has been covering Leicester City for more than a decade, including their remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2015-16.\n\nI'll have a few abiding memories, and it has been emotional. I've never had to commentate on a game like that before in my life, and I've commentated on 600-odd matches.\n\nWhat got me was the Cardiff City flag which moved to the Leicester City end, and then the Cardiff fans took the Leicester flag to their end. I know Cardiff lost and there's a fallout from that with tactics and so on, but the gesture from the Cardiff fans to change flags, a flag with the Leicester City badge on it - let's not let that pass us by.\n\nI will never, ever forget the gestures of Cardiff City Football Club, who have been classy, dignified and magnificent.\n\n'It brought a lot of emotions to the fore'\n\nOsian Roberts has been part of Wales' coaching staff since Gary Speed's time in charge. Following Speed's death in November 2011, Roberts led the team for the tribute match against Costa Rica at Cardiff City Stadium three months later. Roberts was back at the ground for Leicester's win over Cardiff.\n\nIt was incredibly hard and days like this bring those emotions to the fore, especially in this stadium.\n\nThe players will have had a huge shock last weekend with this tragedy. And throughout the week they will have paid tribute and tried to deal with those emotions as individuals and as a group of players.\n\nI spoke to Leicester midfielder Andy King and he said, as we've been hearing from the other players this week, that they wanted to put on a performance that Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha would have been proud of.\n\nIn our match here, Gary Speed's memorial match, I remember players like Ashley Williams, the captain, coming in at half-time and saying, \"I can't move, I can't move my legs, they're like lead\".

But it was so difficult for our lads too, I've not seen anything like it really.\n\nWe had to have a word with them before the game to remind them they had to play the game. Nobody could fault the effort really - on another day we might have got something.\n\n'I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Cardiff 0-1 Leicester: Kasper Schmeichel 'immensely proud' of Foxes players\n\nLeicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel has been at the club since 2011. He was one of the first people on the scene of the helicopter crash and was in tears during the minute's silence before kick-off. He, along with the rest of the squad, flew to Thailand for the funeral straight after the match.\n\nToday was difficult. Coming out for the warm-up was tough. The first 10 minutes I couldn't steady myself, I was shaking a little bit. But it was nice to get a win to take to Thailand and hopefully we did his family proud.\n\nIt has been hard, we have tried for a few hours a day to be professional and train hard, but everyone wanted to play and win for his family. His family have been strong, the courage they have had. I feel just an overwhelming sense of pride of being part of the family that Vichai built and the extended family of Leicester City.\n\nEveryone grieves in different ways and the opportunity was given and we wanted to go to the funeral. We are a family and wanted to pay our last respects together.\n\n'The build-up wasn't easy to handle'\n\nCardiff centre-back Sol Bamba played in Saturday's game. He spent the 2011-12 season with Leicester in the Championship.\n\nVichai was a good man. I had the chance to meet him and he is a big loss.\n\nIt was difficult for us, the whole build-up wasn't easy to handle. But that is not an excuse, the gaffer warned us about this. Obviously we pay respects before and after, but during game we are professional.\n\nThe fans were magnificent all season, and in particular today, showing the whole football family sticks together.\n\n'We had to try to hold our emotions in'\n\nWes Morgan captained Leicester to their Premier League title triumph in 2015-16 and led the team at the Cardiff City Stadium.\n\nYou can see by our reaction at the end of the game how much we wanted to get the win and do it for the chairman.\n\nWe were very close to him. We know what his wishes were. He used to come down at home games, have a joke and a laugh, always say, \"Want win and three points\" and we did that today. It has not been an easy week, we had to try to hold our emotions in today and do the best we can.\n\nWe have a very emotional connection with the fans, so we stayed until the end and celebrated victory with them.", "Luis Suarez has scored five goals in his past two games\n\nBarcelona secured two late goals to beat struggling Rayo Vallecano in a remarkable game, extending their lead at the top of La Liga to four points.\n\nLuis Suarez put Barca ahead from Jordi Alba's cutback, but Jose Pozo equalised with an excellent 25-yard shot.\n\nSubstitute Alberto Garcia tapped home with his first touch as Rayo looked set for a second La Liga win of the season.\n\nBut Ousmane Dembele's sweet half-volley and Suarez's last-minute strike turned it round once again.\n\nLate drama takes Barcelona clear\n\nBarcelona are now four points above Atletico Madrid, who drew 1-1 at Leganes on Saturday afternoon, and Alaves, who visit Eibar on Sunday (11:00 GMT).\n\nFor a long time it looked as though they were going to suffer a first defeat against Rayo Vallecano since 2002 - but they have now beaten them for the 12th game in a row.\n\nWith Barca on the ropes, centre-back Gerard Pique played as an auxiliary forward and headed a cross into Dembele's pass for a late equaliser - before Suarez stabbed home Sergi Roberto's deep cross at the back post in the final minute.\n\nThat was his fifth goal in two games, having scored a hat-trick last Sunday in the 5-1 win over Real Madrid, and it means Barca have now won five games in a row in all competitions.\n\nRayo so unfortunate\n\nMadrid's third biggest team Rayo had looked on the verge of a famous win after turning the game around following Suarez's opener.\n\nMoments after missing a sitter, former Manchester City youngster Pozo fired a brilliant effort beyond Marc-Andre ter Stegen from outside the box.\n\nPozo had not been named in the initial line-up, with Alvaro Garcia due to start.

I tried to and thankfully it went our way.\n\n\"I didn't feel lucky, my intent was to wrap my arms, my intent is always to wrap my arms.

She was arrested after a police investigation.\n\nIn Wednesday's ruling, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd \"threatening to kill her\".\n\nWhy is this case so divisive?\n\nIslam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system.

So to miss tackles when they're only one or two phases into their attacking set is disappointing.\n\n\"Huw [Jones] is as disappointed as everyone else. It's a first game, we've got to make sure we improve over how we were there.\"\n\nTownsend also felt Scotland were \"flat in attack\" in the first half, until captain Stuart McInally finished off a rolling maul from a line-out to give them impetus before the interval.\n\nThe second half \"was much better\" according to the head coach, but the visitors had two further tries ruled out by the television match official, when Jonny Gray's double movement ended short of the line, and Peter Horne was adjudged not to have grounded the ball.\n\n\"You could say we're unlucky,\" Townsend said. \"Jonny is a millimetre away from the line and I think that was a toss of the coin whether Pete grounded it or not.\n\n\"But we had two or three other opportunities where we have to do better or be more accurate.

South Africa were penalised just inside the home half and full-back Daly clattered his kick over from 46 metres for an improbable 9-8 scoreline.\n\nConfidence began to flow. Farrell cut through before Henry Slade found Daly on his outside, but the full-back stepped inside and looked for Jonny May on the wing too late, and the chance was gone.\n\nItoje went on the charge and then May counter-attacked from deep, swerving through a maze of green shirts before setting Jack Nowell away to do the same.\n\nPollard stroked over a penalty of his own from distance to nick back the lead with 13 minutes to go but it was now all England, Daly again ignoring May on his outside but the wing then scything through, only for Brad Shields to spill the ball in the tackle three metres out as he looked for the pass back inside.\n\nThe chance came. England mangled the Springboks at the subsequent scrum and Farrell stroked over his third dead-eyed penalty to make it 12-11.\n\nIt had become a beautifully flawed thriller. Pollard clipped the outside of the right post with a huge penalty with four minutes to go and then his forwards thundered to within 10 metres of the England line.\n\nThey spurned the chance to work a drop-goal and paid the price when Farrell stripped Lood de Jager and the ball was cleared.\n\nWith the clock red Farrell then smashed into a tackle without seemingly using his arms. It looked like a penalty but referee Angus Gardner went to his TMO and decided it was legal, and somehow England were home.\n\nOwen Farrell (centre) reacts as the referee declares he did not make an illegal tackle at the end of the match\n\nReaction to England's win\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones: \"We got through 80 minutes, there was sharp resistance and toughness in our play so I'm really pleased with our boys.\n\n\"We stuck at it, we stayed in the arm wrestle.

making his first Premier League start since 22 September - cut an isolated figure in attack.\n\nKenedy broke clear of the Hornets' defence midway through the first half, but the Chelsea loanee's powerful shot was blocked by Mariappa.\n\nThe hosts improved after the break, with Perez scoring Newcastle's first home goal since a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal on 15 September.\n\nBenitez will hope the win proves a turning point for the Magpies, who host Bournemouth next Saturday.\n\nWasteful Watford\n\nWatford inflicted the Magpies' heaviest defeat at St James' Park last season, and manager Javi Gracia will feel his team should have registered another three points after a dominant performance in the North East.\n\nThe Hornets laid siege to the home goal in the first half but only managed one shot on target over the course of 90 minutes.\n\nDeulofeu - who scored his first goal since February in the 3-0 victory over struggling Huddersfield last weekend - missed a hat-trick of chances before the break.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Everton attacker scuffed a shot wide from close range before firing harmlessly off target from Doucoure's pass.\n\nHe then drilled a low effort into the side-netting as Newcastle somehow managed to go in to half-time with their clean sheet still intact.\n\nPereyra was unlucky not to break the deadlock shortly after the interval with a fierce shot that rebounded off the crossbar, but it wasn't to be for Gracia's men who slipped to their fourth league defeat of the season.\n\nMan of the match - Ayoze Perez (Newcastle)\n\nAfter entering the fray for the injured Yoshinori Muto, Ayoze Perez struck his first goal in 11 Premier League games for Newcastle to earn the Magpies a priceless victory\n\nPerez breaks his duck - the stats\n\nNewcastle earned their first victory in all competitions against Watford since a Championship game in February 2010, ending a run of five consecutive defeats against the Hornets.\n\nA league-high share, 57% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season have been headers (4/7).\n\nWatford mustered 16 shots in this match, but just one of these was on target - 13 of their attempts came in the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThree of Newcastle's seven Premier League goals this season have been scored from substitutes (43%).\n\nAyoze Perez scored his first goal in 11 Premier League games for Newcastle, since netting twice against Chelsea on the final day of the 2017-18 season.\n\nThis was Rafael Benitez's 50th win as Newcastle manager in all competitions, in his 116th game in charge of the Magpies.\n\nWhat the managers said...\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device We showed everyone today what we can do -

But it is not just him. For us to play well and score goals we need to do big work.\"\n\nIt was a deserved win for Everton, although it took a spirited second-half performance to finally overcome a well-organised Brighton.\n\nThe Seagulls were content to let Everton dominate possession in the opening stages, but were perhaps fortunate not to fall behind when Gylfi Sigurdsson spurned two early opportunities.\n\nEverton did eventually take the lead from a Brighton corner, with Sigurdsson leading the counter-attack from inside his own half before teeing up Richarlison, who finished first time beyond goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\n\nBrighton showed spirit to hit back almost straight away with a clever short corner routine, with Solly March's cross headed home by Dunk for his first goal since March.\n\nBut Everton were dominant after the break. Idrissa Gueye had already hit the post before Coleman drove Everton in front five minutes into the second half.\n\nIt was a lead Everton never looked like losing, and Richarlison put the game beyond doubt late on by capitalising on a loose pass by Dunk before rounding Ryan to score.\n\nRicharlison shines again\n\nAlmost exactly 12 months ago, Richarlison scored for Watford at Goodison Park in a 3-2 win for Everton that lifted the struggling Toffees out of the relegation zone.\n\nThe 21-year-old would score just once more that season, mirroring a dramatic dip in form for the Hornets that saw manager Marco Silva sacked in January.\n\nSilva and Richarlison were reunited at Goodison Park this summer and the Brazilian once again seems to be thriving under the Portuguese's stewardship.\n\nAfter beginning the season out wide, he has been deployed as a central striker in recent weeks and his two goals against Brighton mean he has now scored more goals this season than he did in the whole of the last campaign.\n\nSigurdsson is another player whose influence is growing after a difficult 2017-18. The \u00a345m signing from Swansea was pushed out to the left for much of last season but looks far more comfortable playing in a central position.\n\nThe 29-year-old had a 100% pass completion rate during the first half, which included running half the length of the field to tee up Richarlison for a fine opening goal.\n\nThis win was further evidence that Everton are starting to settle under Silva as they look to improve on last season's eighth-place finish.\n\nThe former Hull boss was even able bring on summer signing Yerry Mina in stoppage time for his Everton debut, with the Colombian defender finally fit again after suffering a foot injury at the World Cup.\n\nGlenn Murray has scored six of Brighton's 12 Premier League goals so far this season\n\nLack of cutting edge costs Seagulls\n\nBrighton went into this game full of confidence after three successive victories without conceding a goal.\n\nThey had less possession than their opponents in each of those three wins, so it was no surprise that they were content to sit back here.\n\nEven after falling behind, the Seagulls remained patient, willing to wait for their chance to counter-attack and threaten from set pieces.\n\nBut aside from Dunk's equaliser, which came from a quickly taken short corner, the visitors failed to truly test Jordan Pickford in the Toffees' goal.\n\nBrighton only managed three efforts on target all game, with Alireza Jahanbakhsh's late shot coming when the result was already beyond them.\n\nGlenn Murray has scored half of Brighton's Premier League goals this season and the 35-year-old needs more support if they are to maintain their position in mid-table.\n\nMan of the match - Richarlison (Everton)\n\nThe Brazilian put in a match-winning display that demonstrated why Marco Silva was so keen to sign him from Watford over the summer.\n\n'Our best performance of the season'\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Everton 3-1 Brighton: Best home performance of season - Marco Silva\n\nEverton boss Marco Silva: \"It was our best performance at home this season.

His assistant Garry Parker conducted the post-match media duties, saying Lennon \"has done enough talking over the last couple of days and left it down to me\".\n\nNever-say-die St Johnstone win again\n\nThis was a fiery battle that delivered a show-stopping finale.\n\nBoth teams played some fine stuff, but Hibs lacked the ruthlessness and precision to turn neat midfield play into goals.\n\nSt Johnstone were robust at the back and incisive up front. The powerful Tony Watt was a dynamic handful leading the line, with Drey Wright and Matty Kennedy sniping around him.\n\nLittle separated the teams in the first half, Martin Boyle driving high and wide for the hosts, before teenager Tristan Nydam thundered a vicious, swerving drive off the bar from 20 yards. Watt, galloping on to Wright's cross, flashed a header wide soon after the break.\n\nDaryl Horgan was a constant menace for Hibs but chose the wrong option too many times in the danger zone. Boyle, then Stevie Mallan, made Zander Clark work from distance as Hibs began to motor.\n\nNeil Lennon's troops looked poised to seize control of the contest, but then the drama begun.\n\nSwanson left his boyhood club in September after a largely fruitless year in Leith. Back at St Johnstone for a third spell, the script was written for the little substitute to strike a telling blow.\n\nIn the 66th minute, he jinked inside Bartley, hit the deck and won the penalty. His shot from 12 yards was well-placed, but desperately weak. Bodgan went the right way and flicked it clear.\n\nIt was St Johnstone's third missed penalty in three games, each squandered by a different player.\n\nHibs rallied, roused by their goalkeeper's feats, and set off again in pursuit of a winner, Jamie Maclaren going close with a volley then a header.\n\nBut it was St Johnstone - resilient, never-say-die St Johnstone - who pounced. Substitute Chris Kane was wrestled to ground by Darren McGregor, David Wotherspoon bent in a cracking delivery, and Shaughnessy steamed on to it and bulleted home.\n\nThree missed penalties, but four wins on the bounce and four clean sheets for Tommy Wright and his warriors.\n\nAdam Bogdan dived low to his right to deny Danny Swanson from the penalty spot\n\n'St Johnstone prove top-six credentials' - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's Brian McLauchlin at Easter Road\n\nAfter being struck by a coin during Wednesday's tumultuous Edinburgh derby, Hibs boss Lennon was serenaded by the home fans as he emerged from the tunnel. They didn't have much more to cheer about on a blustery afternoon in Leith.\n\nDespite dominating possession (62%-38%), Hibs rarely stretched a resolute St Johnstone defence and have now failed to score in back-to-back games.\n\nAs much as that may be down in part to poor decision-making by Lennon's midfield, a lot of credit must go to Wright, his tactics and the energy of his players.\n\nThe aftermath of what happened at Tynecastle may have left its mark on Hibs but after a fourth successive win and a fourth successive clean sheet, the Perth side are well worth their place in the top six.\n\n'We were terrible. Created nothing' - analysis\n\nHibernian assistant coach Garry Parker: \"We were very poor today. We created nothing going forward. We made poor decisions. I've never seen the team pass to the opposition so much. Terrible.\n\n\"Individual mistakes, decision-making, everything - there was nothing there.\"\n\nSt Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: \"Overall, we just about deserved it. We've a lot of quality and I think you saw that today. The Hibs fans were pretty quiet.\n\n\"We played some good football and I'm really pleased.

On this evidence, his side are still somewhat short as they were utterly bossed by Celtic.\n\nThe league leaders were, of course, missing several key players but the reigning champions dominated the play.\n\nEdouard fired a shot from the edge of the box high into the net to open the scoring, before Benkovic doubled the lead with a header - his first goal for the club.\n\nFrench striker Edouard then scored his second and Celtic's third, firing home a Kieran Tierney cross from close range.\n\nIn truth, it was far too easy for Celtic, who peppered the Hearts goal with further efforts. They eased up a gear to make it 4-0 after 65 minutes as Edouard turned provider for Forrest to lash home in the box.\n\nAnd there was sparkle in the build up to the penalty award for their fifth, Celtic sweeping forward before Forrest was brought down as he ran across goal. Ryan Christie dispatched the spot kick. In general, Celtic were in cruise control.\n\nHearts offered little in terms of any kind of threat. Steven MacLean fired in a close range shot and Ben Garuccio hit a post in the latter part of the second half, which was as good as it got for the away side.\n\nCeltic back to their best - analysis\n\nCeltic are now flexing their muscles and the momentum is clear to see. The form appears to be back to the level they established in Brendan Rodgers' first two seasons, which bodes well for their crucial home game against RB Leipzig in the Europa League on Thursday - one Celtic have to win if they are to make progress in the competition.\n\nAll in all, it was a tough afternoon for Hearts. Questions were always going to be asked about their strength in depth having lost key players to injury, and against the best in the Premiership they were found wanting. Their only real solace is that, for now, they remain top.\n\n'Our attacking play was unbelievable'- reaction\n\nCeltic manager Brendan Rodgers: \"Today typified our achievements over the past two and half years.\n\n\"We've been in European competition playing really difficult games and to produce what we've produced today shows our hunger and a sense that the team's back. Some of our attacking combination play was unbelievable.\"\n\nHearts manager Craig Levein: \"I felt, although we lost two goals in the second-half, I actually felt much better. To be fair to the players, they ran their socks off and put in a much better performance.\n\n\"We get a lot of players back [from injury] at the start of December.

First, he made a great save to tip over a powerful, curling free-kick from Ian McShane, then another smart stop as Ryan Edwards fired in a rising shot on the turn.\n\nHowever, there was a let-off for McGregor as he fumbled Edwards' shot in first-half stoppage time but Paul McGinn could only stab the loose ball wide from close range.\n\nRangers, who had scored just once in their previous three games, found it tough to find any passing rhythm before the interval.\n\nPlaying into a strong wind against spirited opponents, Gerrard's side struggled to retain possession. Ryan Kent did get a glimpse of goal but the winger dragged his shot wide of the far post.\n\nThe visitors started the second half in menacing fashion, with Alfie Jones making a good block from Eros Grezda after Samson had spilled a tame effort from Ovie Ejaria.\n\nFrom the resultant corner, Connor Goldson somehow failed to make contact right in front of goal after losing his marker.\n\nKent broke clear only to be thwarted by a great covering tackle from Paul McGinn and a raking strike from Grezda smacked against the base of Samson's near post.\n\nThat was followed by an almighty scramble in the home penalty box as Scott Arfield, Candeias and Ejaria all had efforts repelled by frantic defenders.\n\nSt Mirren's brave resistance was broken when Candeias looked up from the apex of the area and his delivery flew into the opposite top corner. A shot? A cross? Candeias did not care as he celebrated with fans behind the goal.\n\nRangers continued to press and were rewarded further by an emphatic strike from Morelos, which whistled beyond Samson.\n\nMorelos scored his 14th of the season in stoppage time\n\n'St Mirren raise levels for big game again' - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's Jane Lewis at The Simple Digital Arena\n\nSt Mirren looked like they might just hold on and Oran Kearney's players defended heroically at times, but they were outdone by a stunning Candeias strike, whether it was meant or not.\n\nThe worry for the Paisley side is perhaps a failure to put in such performance during every game. They threw themselves into this match, just as they did in Kearney's first game in charge against Celtic, but have yet to win a point since then and have now scored just twice in eight games.\n\nNext up is Dundee at Dens Park; a massive game, Kearney admitted as much and insists his players will be even more aware of a need to be up for it.

It's Brenda, a 26-year-old single mother who lives Kibera, Africa's largest slum, and perhaps the toughest neighbourhood on earth, where hundreds of thousands of people live in a space not too much bigger than London's Hyde Park.\n\nEach day, Brenda leaves her home here to catch a bus to the east side of Nairobi where she, along with more than 1,000 colleagues in the same building, work hard on a side of artificial intelligence we hear little about - and see even less.\n\nIn her eight-hour shift, she creates training data. Information - images, most often - prepared in a way that computers can understand.\n\nImage caption Brenda lives in Kibera, considered Africa's largest slum\n\nBrenda loads up an image, and then uses the mouse to trace around just about everything. People, cars, road signs, lane markings - even the sky, specifying whether it's cloudy or bright. Ingesting millions of these images into an artificial intelligence system means a self-driving car, to use one example, can begin to \"recognise\" those objects in the real world. The more data, the supposedly smarter the machine.\n\nShe and her colleagues sit close - often too close - to their monitors, zooming in on the images to make sure not a single pixel is tagged incorrectly. Their work will be checked by a superior, who will send it back if it's not up to scratch. For the fastest, most accurate trainers, the honour of having your name up on one of the many TV screens around the office. And the most popular perk of all: shopping vouchers.\n\n\"You get to do something unique,\" Brenda told me when I visited the tiny home she shares with her daughter, brother and mother.\n\n\"With my work that I'm doing, I believe I'm working for something that is going to help someone in future.\"\n\nSlum school\n\nBrenda does this work for Samasource, a San Francisco-based company that counts Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and Yahoo among its clients. Most of these firms don't like to discuss the exact nature of their work with Samasource - as it is often for future projects - but it can be said that the information prepared here forms a crucial part of some of Silicon Valley's biggest and most famous efforts in AI.\n\nImage caption For eight hours a day, Brenda trains data used for artificial intelligence\n\nIt's the kind of technological progress that will likely never be felt in a place like Kibera. As Africa's largest slum, it has more pressing problems to solve, such as a lack of reliable clean water, and a well-known sanitation crisis.\n\nBut that's not to say artificial intelligence can't have a positive impact here. We drove to one of Kibera's few permanent buildings, found near a railway line that, on this rainy day, looked thoroughly decommissioned by mud, but has apparently been in regular use since its colonial inception.\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, this building was the dividing line between stone-throwing rioters and the military. Today, it's a thriving hub of activity: a media school and studio, something of a cafeteria, and on the first floor, a room full of PCs. Here, Gideon Ngeno teaches around 25 students the basics of using a personal computer.\n\nWhat's curious about this process is that digital literacy is high, even in Kibera, where smartphones are common and every other shop is selling chargers and accessories, which people buy using the mobile money system MPesa.\n\nImage caption Images have to be painstakingly annotated - cars, roads, signs... even the sky\n\nBut much of Africa has leapfrogged the desktop PC era. The keyboard and mouse combination is a foreign, cumbersome experience. One Samasource team member told me how she'd often observe trainees look away from their PCs and pick up their phone when asked to search for information on the internet.\n\nThe course taught here is designed specifically for those wanting to go on to work at Samasource or another digital economy company. It costs 500 Kenyan shillings - around $5. That's a not insignificant amount for people who often live below the poverty line. The company used to offer the course for free, but without the financial commitment, I was told attendance (and concentration) was sketchy at best.\n\nNow the biggest challenge, Ngeno said, was noise - as we spoke, a group of eager children did exactly what you'd expect of them when handed a selection of musical instruments. Outside, a market thronged with activity.\n\nA campus fit for California\n\nIn contrast, the Samasource office is in a part of Nairobi that reassures you this is a city on the up. The company occupies four floors of a business park building, with vast banks of computers being used for the job of training data.\n\nImage copyright Samasource Image caption The data is used to help automated systems \"recognise\" objects in the real world\n\nIf you didn't look out of the windows, you might think you were at a Silicon Valley tech firm. Walls are covered in corrugated iron in a way that would be considered achingly trendy in California, but here serve as a reminder of the environment many of the workers come from: around 75% are from the slum.\n\nMost impressively, Samasource has overcome a problem that most Silicon Valley firms are famously grappling with. Just over half of their workforce is made up of women, a remarkable feat in a country where starting a family more often than not rules out a career for the mother. Here, a lactation room, up to 90 days maternity leave, and flexibility around shift patterns makes the firm a stand-out example of inclusivity not just in Kenya, but globally.\n\n\"Like a lot of people say, if you have a man in the workplace, he'll support his family,\" said Hellen Savala, who runs human resources.\n\n\"[But] if you have a woman in the workplace, she'll support her family, and the extended family. So you'll have a lot more impact.\"\n\n'It would never work'\n\nThat balance isn't just among those doing the entry level work, either. In San Francisco's Mission District, in an office far more modest than what the firm has in Kenya, Samasource's chief executive Leila Janah beamed when talking about how the firm's management team is majority female.\n\n\"It's extremely unusual in Silicon Valley more broadly, but especially within artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We just think of it as normal. It's a competitive advantage.\"\n\nImage caption Leila Janah, right, was at first criticised for wanting to outsource jobs away from the US\n\nFounded in 2008, Samasource received a frosty reception in its early days. In recession-hit America, outsourcing a large number of jobs to the developing world was not seen as a welcome idea. It arguably still isn't.\n\nThose who did like the concept worried there were too few people with the digital skills necessary to do the work to a standard the tech giants would accept.\n\n\"Very smart people in the tech world, and in the world of big philanthropy said this was a wonderful idea, but that it would never work,\" Janah recalled. Today, Samasource is the largest organisation of its kind in East Africa, and also has facilities in Asia and North America.\n\nCheap labour\n\nJanah touts the company's record for accuracy and security as the major reasons why Google et al come to them for this work. But of course, there's an obvious motivation for these companies to use workers in parts of the world where wages are rock bottom, and where locals are desperate for steady work.\n\nSamasource targets those currently earning around $2 a day, or less, in the so-called informal economy of odd - or dangerous - jobs. Samasource instead provides a living wage of around $9 a day. That's an improvement, but still a pittance for Silicon Valley.\n\nImage caption Gideon Ngeno teaches basic digital literacy right in the heart of Kibera's slum\n\n\"Yes, it's cost effective,\" Janah said. \"But one thing that's critical in our line of work is to not pay wages that would distort local labour markets. If we were to pay people substantially more than that, we would throw everything off. That would have a potentially negative impact on the cost of housing, the cost of food in the communities in which our workers thrive.\"\n\nThen of course, there's a question of what happens if the work is no longer needed. Samasource's main business is, after all, in providing data for automated systems. What if the process of creating that data becomes automated as well?\n\n\"That's the billion dollar technology question that everyone is paranoid about,\" Janah said.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of hype around that. But if you actually talk to data scientists, the minds behind these algorithms, you'll find the machine is much further behind than most people realise.\n\n\"We're going to need training data for a long time.\"\n\n'It has changed my everything'\n\nBeing a data training expert is boring, repetitive, never-ending work.

According to census data, this group makes up just over 60% of the total US population.\n\nWomen, although half the US population, make up around 20% of those elected.\n\nThe largest minority ethnic groups - Hispanic, Asian and African Americans - are also significantly under-represented in Congress.\n\nThese figures are derived from profile data collected by the US Congressional Research Council and show the current participation of different population groups.\n\nChanging representation over time\n\nLooking back over the past few decades, it's clear that participation for all these groups is on the rise, with a noticeably rapid increase in the participation of women over the past two decades.\n\nThe rise in minority representation has been slower, although over the past five years there has been a significant rise in the number of Hispanic Americans elected to Congress.\n\nFor both ethnic minorities and for women, representation in elected government has often been historically associated with granting these groups the right to vote, or the changing of electoral laws to make it easier to participate.\n\nToday there are 45 Hispanic Americans and 48 African Americans serving in Congress.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected to the Senate, he was only the fifth African American senator.\n\nWomen in Washington\n\nIn 1992, there was a significant increase in participation, with 54 women elected to Congress, a 69% jump over the previous term. At 107, the total number of women serving today is far fewer than if they were fully represented as a proportion of the total population.\n\nFor the 2018 mid-term elections, an unprecedented number of women are standing, with more than 250 in the running for Congressional office following the selection of candidates in the primaries.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The \"Pink Wave\": How women are shaping the 2018 US elections\n\nBarriers to participation\n\nFirst brought into legislation in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson, the Voting Rights Act and its many subsequent amendments have sought to end discriminatory voting practices across the United States, and there has been a significant increase in African American participation since then.\n\nPrior to this, there were many examples of historical barriers to participation, restricting minority candidates from standing for election or restricting voting rights for specific minorities.\n\nAll-white primary elections were one method used in the early 20th Century by the Democratic Party in the southern US, to restrict largely African American and Hispanic candidates from participation - limitations which continued until the 1940s.\n\nAnd it wasn't until 1975 that amendments to the Voting Rights Act made it a requirement that voting material be offered in a minority language if required by 5% of the voting population in an area. This was particularly important for the participation of the Spanish-speaking community, and therefore the success of Hispanic candidates in elections.\n\nThe issue of barriers to voter registration for minority groups continues to be a highly contentious issue.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Ammar Campa-Najjar, the first Latino Arab-American to run, is hoping to represent California in the House\n\nFor the Asian American community, voting only came with changes to the Immigration Act in 1952, which allowed Asians citizenship rights - including the right to vote - for the first time.\n\nThere are currently 16 Asians (including Indian and Pacific Islanders) in Congress.\n\nIn this year's mid-term elections there are more than 60 Asian Americans running for Congress, with many more running at governor, state and local levels.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dave Min is running to represent California in the House\n\nNative Americans in Congress\n\nThe Native American community was not granted citizenship of the United States until 1924. However, even then, not all were allowed to vote, because many states made laws denying Native Americans that right. It was another 40 years before every state agreed - New Mexico being the last, in 1962.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service reports at least 14 people of Native American descent have served in Congress, including two current House representatives - Tom Cole, of the Chickasaw tribe in Oklahoma, and Markwayne Mullin, of the Cherokee tribe, also in Oklahoma.\n\nImage copyright Getty Image caption Deb Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, is running to represent New Mexico for the Democrats in the House\n\nWill 2018 break new ground?\n\nIt's certainly true that women, Hispanic, Asian and African Americans are increasingly represented in Congress. However, the make-up of the US legislature still fails to reflect America's population as a whole.\n\nAs for the increasing diversity of candidates seeking office, this is harder to measure, but there are clear indications that a greater number of women and minority groups are standing for election, even if many ultimately fail to win office.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Gary Neville was head coach at Valencia from December 2015 to March 2016\n\nFormer Manchester United captain Gary Neville saying Tottenham have been \"spineless and soft\" for much of his life was \"rude\" and uncalled for, says ex-Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas.\n\nDuring a discussion on Sky Sports, Neville said Spurs teams had been \"flaky\" and \"pathetic\" for 30 years.\n\nBut the 43-year-old added the current side is the \"toughest, most resilient\" Tottenham team he has seen.\n\n\"I felt he sounded like a privileged kid, almost,\" Jenas told the BBC.\n\nThe former England player, who made 203 appearances for Tottenham, told the Football Daily podcast: \"What I mean by that is Gary Neville only knows what life is like at the best football club in the world, under the best manager in the world.\n\n\"And that obviously bred success for a number of years and he lived it year in, year out.\n\n\"At other clubs, there are different variants that you're bringing in to the fold, which has a negative impact on the team.\"\n\nNeville, speaking on Monday Night Football, said: \"Tottenham Hotspur, for 30 years of our lives, were spineless and soft, flaky, rubbish.\n\n\"You could be 2-0 down against them and think you would win 5-2.\"\n\nBut he praised Mauricio Pochettino's current side, and described chairman Daniel Levy as the \"best operator in football\".\n\nFormer Spurs boss Harry Redknapp described Neville's criticism as an \"absolute disgrace\".\n\nAnd Jenas said he felt Neville would have learned from his time managing Valencia, who sacked him after less than four months in the role.\n\n\"I actually felt like the one thing he would have gained from his experience as a manger is what life is like outside that Manchester United bubble,\" he said.\n\n\"At other clubs, players are striving to be at the best clubs in Europe.

What have you just done?\n\n\"But every bit of it came from Sheridan. Just watching the level of honesty she performs with made me immediately go, 'I want to write something.'\"\n\nThe demo became Are You Just Sleeping, a beautifully sad song about death and loss, which forms the centrepiece of Sheridan's second album.\n\n\"Are you just sleeping? Will you wake up?\" she sings with a notable wobble in her voice. \"We've still got plenty of things to talk about\".\n\nAs she sings, the Bafta-winning actress is remembering her much-loved father, Colin, who died of cancer two years ago.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sheridan Smith with her father Colin at the 2011 Olivier Awards\n\nSmith was performing in the West End hit Funny Girl when he was first diagnosed; causing her long-standing problems with anxiety and depression to \"snowball\".\n\nAfter a few shaky performances, she stepped away from the show for two months amid a flurry of tabloid stories about her health; and has kept a relatively low profile since.\n\nAre You Just Sleeping is not just a tribute to her father, but an important part of her recovery. She recently sang it at Bentley Top Club in Doncaster, a venue where her parents' country and western band The Daltons used to gig in the 70s - and the response was overwhelming.\n\n\"There were all these people I've known and grown up with - like, all my dad's mates - and you could see them all in their own little worlds of grief because, you know, that song will hit everyone,\" says Sheridan.\n\n\"Everyone's been through it. And I have to say, since my dad died, people have just stopped me in the street and given me a cuddle and say, 'Oh God, I lost my dad too'.\n\n\"So out of all of that horrible stuff that happened in the press, people have actually been really lovely.\"\n\nAmy, best known for co-writing Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud, is full of praise for Sheridan's decision to release the song.\n\n\"For what it's worth, I think you're brave as hell,\" she tells the star.\n\n\"There are multiple people in Sheridan's position who'd have done another covers album and smashed it, and that would have been cool. But with this, now, you've opened up a whole new window and that's pretty badass.\"\n\nImage copyright East West Records Image caption Sheridan first found fame on the TV sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps\n\nIt's certainly a bold step: Sheridan's self-titled debut album was crammed full of standards like Mad About The Boy and Anyone Who Had A Heart. It sold 140,000 copies, making it 2017's second-biggest debut by a British female artist after Dua Lipa.\n\nInstead of copying the template for the follow-up, though, she decided to dig deeper.\n\n\"I was feeling ready to open up about a lot of things,\" she says. \"I wanted to get away from the eyes and teeth.\"\n\nHer record label brought in songwriters Amy Wadge and Eg White (Adele, James Blunt) to shape the songs, while Jimmy Hogarth (Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Suzanne Vega) helped Sheridan find a more confessional, Dusty-In-Memphis setting for her vocals.\n\nBut in a twist of logic that could only make sense in the music industry, the bulk of A Northern Soul was written behind Sheridan's back.\n\n'Own worst enemy'\n\nUnbeknownst to her, that gig in Edinburgh doubled up as a fact-finding mission, set up by record label executive Paul Samuels.\n\nHe sent Amy to the gig to get to know the actress; then invited her to write songs based on her observations.\n\n\"Paul didn't tell me it was happening,\" laughs Sheridan. \"So I was in the bar afterwards giving it large and blabbing away about myself, not realising what was about to come!\n\n\"But actually it meant I was able to be myself and say things like 'I'm a disaster' and talk about hitting rock bottom and all those things that Amy's genius brain then took and turned into songs.\"\n\nSure enough, the album delves unflinchingly into the actress's fragility and insecurities: \"I'm a disaster, a runaway train, my own worst enemy,\" she sings on Rock Bottom; while Ain't It Funny depicts a stage performer who crumbles when the curtain falls.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Prior to working with Sheridan Smith, Amy Wadge [L] penned hits for Ed Sheeran and Camila Cabello\n\nThe lyrics are so close to the bone that Amy decided to stay away when Sheridan was presented with the music.\n\n\"This is her life and these songs are so intimate - so it was entirely up to Sheridan to decide which ones she wanted to keep,\" she explains.\n\nThe actress, however, was instantly bowled over.\n\n\"When Paul came to play me the songs, he was really nervous I might get offended,\" she says, \"but it was the opposite: I was just crying my eyes out going, 'This is amazing'.\"\n\nTurning to Amy, she says: \"It was like you'd gone into my brain. You got me so much. These are my inner thoughts.\"\n\n\"But the thing is, it all came from you,\" replies Amy, \"So when you say, 'you got into my head,' it's like, 'No, you actually told me that!'\"\n\nAt this, the duo crease up in laughter - as they do throughout the interview, swapping anecdotes about Dolly Parton, Amy's kids and Sheridan's spanx.\n\nThat spirit is captured in the first single, Priceless. \"One of a kind, I'm quite a find, I'm priceless,\" purrs the singer over a vamped-up Motown stomp.\n\n\"I feel a bit weird singing Priceless because it's meant to be quite empowering for women - but at the same time, I feel a bit of a twit going, 'I'm priceless!'\" says the singer.\n\n\"It's just so not in my personality. I'm not Sasha Fierce or whatever Beyonce's alter ego is called.\"\n\nFor the record, she says her own alter ego would be \"Nightmare Nancy\" - the sort of character who ends up dancing on the tables and singing Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 at a late-night karaoke bar.\n\n\"That used to be me, she guffaws. \"These days I like to keep Nightmare Nancy out of trouble.\"\n\nStill, that infectious, life-affirming spirit is part of the star's appeal. It was undoubtedly a factor in her rise from the National Youth Music Theatre to National Treasure - a journey that she made without any formal acting training, it's worth noting.\n\nIt's also enabled her to make brave choices with her roles, sometimes in the face of criticism.\n\nTake, for example, her hit musical Legally Blonde.\n\nSheridan was cast to play pampered Beverly Hills fashion student Elle Woods when the show transferred from Broadway - but her idiosyncratic take on the character mystified the American producers.\n\n\"I remember them going, 'Sheridan! Shut your legs!' 'cos I'd be sat like a bloke,\" she laughs. \"They didn't get how I was being quite tongue in cheek and sending it all up.\n\n\"And I kept saying, 'Just wait til the audience gets in'. Because I know what British audiences are like - if I played it straight without giving it a bit of side-eye, a bit of shade, they wouldn't accept it.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sheridan says she \"can't wait\" to see Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde 3\n\nSheridan's instincts paid off. The show, which faltered in New York, was a major hit in the UK.\n\n\"What redeems this flamboyantly preposterous show is that its tongue stays permanently in its cheek,\" wrote The Times' Benedict Nightingale in his first-night review, unwittingly endorsing Sheridan's character choices.\n\nThe role won Sheridan the first of two Olivier Awards, while she received a Bafta for her portrayal of Charmian Biggs, wife of the Great Train Robber Ronnie, in 2012.\n\nSince then, she's wowed audiences by playing Cilla Black (whose voice she studied for three months), won praise for her Hedda Gabler, and will soon be seen in Jimmy McGovern's Care, about a single mum whose life is turned upside down when her own mother develops dementia.\n\nThroughout it all, the 37-year-old has worn her roles like psychological armour.\n\n\"The thing about playing characters is that you don't have to look at yourself, ever,\" she says. \"I obsess over researching the person and their mannerisms. I lose myself in their psyche and I hide behind that all the time.\"\n\nThe album offers no such safety net.\n\n\"This is like holding a mirror up,\" she says, chewing on her nails. \"I was scared of what I was going to see.\"\n\nBut as so often happens, the reality was more forgiving than the expectation.\n\n\"Inside, you're thinking, 'no-one will ever understand this madness.' Nightmare Nancy is going off in my head like a bomb.\n\n\"But hearing Amy's writing and sitting with these beautiful songs, it made me emotional in a lovely way\u2026 It made me realise, 'I'm actually just a normal girl who's been struggling.'\"\n\nA Northern Soul is out now.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

At just 53, he made it abundantly clear he wasn't ready to go.\n\nIn life his strength and resilience made him a formidable, inspirational character. But in dying, his stubbornness was hard to navigate.\n\nAn incident in his final days left Brittany with feelings which many family carer-givers experience - but few admit to.\n\nHer confession highlights the emotional complexities of caring for someone at the end of their life.\n\nShe's not alone. Looking after ill relatives is a task which many will face, as populations live to increasingly older ages.\n\nMore than 90 million Americans currently care for family with chronic conditions, while in Britain, informal care at home for people aged over 65 is predicted to increase by 87% by 2032.\n\nImage copyright Brittany Fortner Image caption Kendall, 53, ran a property business in Springfield, Missouri where he lived with his wife Carol, 52\n\nKendall Fortner was first diagnosed with throat cancer two and a half years ago. He received treatment but after two remissions, the family knew it was terminal in October 2017.\n\n\"I would describe him as a visionary. He really made a difference. We did everything together - he was a wonderful father and we were all really close to him,\" Brittany, 32, explained shortly after her dad died.\n\nIn September she spent 10 days in the family home where Brittany's mum Carol, a nurse, was caring for him, along with Brittany's siblings Terra and Christian.\n\nBy then Kendall was so weak that he couldn't stand, and Brittany sat with her dad, sometimes chatting to him, but mostly just spending time together.\n\nImage copyright Brittany Fortner Image caption Left to right: Kendall, Carol, Terra, Brittany and Christian\n\n\"When I arrived, he could still recognise me. He wanted to hold my hands, which we did for several hours, while he drifted in and out.\n\n\"At some point he said he wanted to sit 'presidential style' in his chair. He gathered us together to tell us how much he loved us and how proud he was. He gave us all a hug. He was so ill that this took 10 minutes.\"\n\nKendall's sleeping was erratic and, still awake one early morning, Brittany asked him to take his morphine so they could sleep.\n\n\"I looked him in the eye and told him I loved him, and he said it back to me. I didn't know it, but that was the last time he was aware enough to know who I was. He became comatose and we thought that was it.\"\n\nTwo days later Kendall woke up. That's when the confusion started.\n\nImage copyright Brittany Fortner Image caption Brittany Fortner, 32, works in medical finance in Arizona\n\n\"He started talking like he hadn't in months - he hadn't been very chatty because of the tumour,\" Brittany explains.\n\nKendall couldn't recognise his surroundings. \"He said we had to get him out of there. He wanted to go outside and tried to get out of the chair, which was very dangerous.\"\n\nTrying to calm him down, Kendall's family found his shoes and put them next to him.\n\nKendall had been prescribed very strong painkillers to manage the throbbing pain from his tumours, and not eating was causing serious bone and muscle ache. But the medication, coupled with his body beginning to shut down, was making him delirious and confused.\n\nCharacter changes, delirium, confusion and agitation are normal, but usually extremely difficult for family members to manage, as highlighted in a recent Reddit post about families losing patience or lashing out at relatives.\n\nThese periods of \"great confusion\", when he seemed nonsensical, scared Brittany. But as well as alarm, her feeling of frustration - even irritation - became palpable.\n\n\"As his child, it was so hard to see this man who had been so intelligent that you could ask him anything, starting to babble.\n\n\"I depended on him for advice. When I was a grown adult, I even had to tell him to stop buying my car insurance. He just wanted to take care of us.\n\n\"To switch from that to him being so dependent, was truly heartbreaking.\n\n\"Suddenly he said, 'I figured it out. I'm not mentally with it',\" Brittany says.\n\nKendall refused to take any more painkillers. \"We kept trying to offer him medicine. He would firmly say no and clamp his mouth shut.\"\n\nThis began a cat and mouse game of balancing Kendall's deteriorating health with his wishes to remain mentally present.\n\nImage copyright Brittany Fortner Image caption Kendall lived with his wife Carol in Springfield, Missouri\n\nThis reaction is common, especially in younger patients who feel medication is something they can influence in the face of losing so much control of their lives, explains Jane Kaschak, a nurse at Valley Hospice in Ohio.\n\n\"One of the hardest things for a family care-giver is deciding when the benefits of medication are worth the burden on the patient. It's a fine line to walk,\" she says.\n\nShe advises care-givers to think about how they want their own death to be, adding that hospice care in America can help people struggling with end-of-life care.\n\nWhen the morphine lost its effect, Kendall's clarity of mind returned. Brittany's mum Carol could do things like reading aloud to him, a tradition the couple had performed for decades.\n\n\"As a nurse, I feel strongly about the individual's right to self-determination, but I knew he was in pain despite his denial,\" Carol explained.\n\nKendall spent the following day sleeping in fits and starts, as the family tried to manage his wishes and symptoms.\n\nNot normally a man with a quick temper, Kendall became enraged when he was too weak to drink from a glass, and instead needed liquid squirted into his mouth with a plastic syringe.\n\n\"His anger was shocking to see. He said we were babying him but he was so weak,\" Brittany explained.\n\nThe family didn't agree about what they should do. Brittany's mum wanted to keep administering medicine, but Brittany's brother thought he had had too much.\n\n\"We didn't want to force him, but we would see him coming down from a bit of a high, and to see his frustration and anxiety during those moments was horrible,\" says Brittany.\n\n\"As much as possible, I would respect his wishes. However, as his cognitive ability declined, his quality of life took precedence over his wishes,\" Carol explains.\n\n\"I felt bad for praying he would just go to sleep in the middle of the night when he was so combative and I was so exhausted.\"\n\n\"It's a moral line,\" adds Brittany. \"We knew his wishes were not to have it but he was in such bad shape when he didn't take it.\n\n\"We just had to try to support him without making him angry at us.\"\n\nImage copyright Brittany Fortner Image caption Kendall Fortner died on 27 September 2018 aged 53\n\nIn the end the family reached a compromise. If Kendall was alert and refused medicine, they didn't force him to take it. But when he was asleep, they administered the painkillers.\n\nBrittany eventually had to return home to Arizona for work, and spent their final night together observing and sitting with her dad. \"I had real feelings of frustration and guilt about how to care for him in those last days,\" she says.\n\nWhen Kendall died two days later, Carol said the most difficult emotional response was guilt, particularly as he \"fought so hard to hold on to life\".\n\n\"I felt guilty for medicating him such that I knew I had sedated him, but I knew it was in his best interest.\"\n\nFor Brittany, the experience made her realise that she wants her loved ones to know exactly what her wishes are regarding medication.\n\n\"I don't feel I'll be able to make a competent decision under the influence of pain and medicine.\n\n\"I want to try to make it clear, so no one is questioning what I want.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know has been affected by the issues in this story, the organisations listed here may be able to help.\n\nHelp for Cancer Caregivers and Cancer Support Community provide information and resources for families in the US.\n\nMarie Curie provide help and support to terminally ill people and their families in the UK.

But the sentence was not made public.\n\nThe victim in that case, named Javier, has denounced Ramos's \"impunity\".\n\nImage copyright Diocese of Astorga Image caption Bishop Juan Antonio Men\u00e9ndez has vowed to eliminate child abuse involving priests\n\nHowever, the man who oversaw the La Ba\u00f1eza cases, Bishop of Astorga Juan Antonio Men\u00e9ndez, said he had carried out an \"exhaustive investigation\" into Ramos, adding that the sentences had been decided by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nJustice and the Church\n\nAccording to an investigation spanning three decades by El Pa\u00eds newspaper, Spanish criminal courts have found priests guilty of sexual assaults on 33 occasions involving 80 minors.\n\nOnly three of Spain's 70 bishoprics routinely pass on information on cases of abuse to the country's criminal justice system, the paper says.\n\nEmiliano \u00c1lvarez remembers priests inflicting beatings during the day \"for the slightest thing\".\n\n\"Then at night, this horrible panic once the lights went off because you knew you wouldn't be able to stay awake all night. It was complete torture.

A beef ban had been enforced by Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Two leading and outspoken rationalists had recently been murdered elsewhere in the country.\n\n\"It is important to recognise that there was never a golden age in our history as an independent nation of complete tolerance or freedom of speech,\" Guha said. \"There have always been curbs and pusillanimity by politicians and governments. But we are certainly becoming more intolerant, there is more violence.\"\n\nNow Guha himself has become a target of the intolerance he spoke about.\n\nBarely a fortnight ago, he announced that he was joining an ambitious private non-profit university in the western city of Ahmedabad as a professor of humanities. (Ahmedabad University's top leadership includes historian Patrick French, the biographer of Nobel Prize-winning writer VS Naipaul.)\n\nOn Thursday, Guha tweeted that he would not join the new position due to \"circumstances beyond his control\".\n\nHe has not spoken about why he decided to change his mind. College authorities have not yet responded to queries by journalists. Not surprisingly, this outraged many:\n\nA senior journalist bemoaned the state of affairs when a celebrated intellectual could not teach in an institution of his choice:\n\nGuha responded cryptically, highlighting the irony of his situation:\n\nNow it appears that Guha was hounded out by the Hindu right wing in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and widely regarded as BJP's bailiwick.\n\nA leader of the the student wing of the local BJP told the Indian Express newspaper that they had met an Ahmedabad University official and told him they didn't want Guha to teach in the city.\n\n\"We said we want intellectuals in our educational institutes and and not anti-nationals,\" he said, adding that they had quoted \"anti-national content\" from his books to the official.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Guha's most recent work is a two-volume biography on Mahatma Gandhi\n\nThe complaint said that Guha's writings \"have encouraged divisive tendencies, alienation in the name of independence of the individual, freeing terrorists in the name of independence of the individual, and separating Jammu and Kashmir from the Indian union\".\n\nThey also referred to him as a Communist.\n\nThe complaints make it very clear that the students hadn't read Guha's work.\n\nGuha is an eclectic personality. An economist by training, he has written acclaimed books on ecology, cricket, post-independence India and, most recently, an extraordinary two-volume biography of Mahatma Gandhi. He has taught at Stanford and the London School of Economics. Though an Indian classical music aficionado, he also counts The Beatles' Hey Jude as one of his favourite songs. Prospect magazine listed him as one of the world's most influential thinkers.\n\nGuha has been, at once, an outspoken critic of Hindu nationalist politics (Narendra Modi's BJP and the right wing) and dynastic politics (the main opposition Congress party led by Rahul Gandhi). A sought after commentator on TV news, he has kept away from India's rabble-rousing channels.\n\nIn the past Hindu right wing groups have demanded an essay on Ramayana by the late poet and scholar AK Ramanujan be dropped from the history syllabus of Delhi University, sent a legal notice to a newspaper for publishing a story on Hindu terrorism and forced a top publisher to recall and destroy copies of a book on Hinduism by a prominent American scholar, Wendy Doniger.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hindu right-wing groups have in the past taken issue with prominent historians\n\nNo single party in India has a stellar record in defending liberal values.
