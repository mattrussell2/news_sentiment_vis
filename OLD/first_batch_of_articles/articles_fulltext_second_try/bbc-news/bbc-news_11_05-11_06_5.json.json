You could tell in their win over Scotland, as it was their passing combination which led to each of Wales' two tries.\n\nFor the first, centre Parkes found himself in the unusual role of scrum-half. With characteristic efficiency and understatement he fed fly-half Anscombe, who in turn set George North surging over the line.\n\nFor the second Parkes was again in a different position, popping up at first receiver where, once again with minimal fuss, he found Anscombe, whose delayed pass set Jonathan Davies racing clear.\n\nBoth were impressive scores, both the products of a partnership years in the making.\n\nThey may have only started playing international rugby together this year but Wales' incumbent 12 and 10 first lined up in the same side almost a decade ago.\n\nThat was in New Zealand, where they were both born, first with Auckland and then with Super Rugby side Blues.\n\nFrom there, however, they took off in different directions, with Parkes signing for Southern Kings in South Africa and Anscombe staying in New Zealand to join the Chiefs.\n\nThe fly-half, whose mother is Welsh, then moved to Cardiff Blues in 2014 and made his debut for Wales the following year.\n\nIt was a longer route to the red jersey for Parkes, who also came to Wales in 2014 to sign for Scarlets, but not with an immediate view to playing international rugby.\n\nHe had to wait three years for that, and after becoming eligible under the three-year residency rule last December, he scored two tries on his debut against South Africa.\n\nParkes is now an established figure in the Welsh midfield and, in Anscombe, he has a familiar voice calling the shots by his side at fly-half.\n\n\"Chicken [Anscombe] and I are pretty good mates,\" says Parkes.\n\n\"We played for four years together at Auckland in the ITM Cup. We also had one season at Auckland Blues together before he went to the Chiefs and I went elsewhere.\n\n\"It's a good relationship and one we're enjoying.

He's a pretty calm head.\n\n\"If someone had told me this four years ago, we would never have believed them.\n\n\"Hopefully we can continue to carry on our partnerships and hopefully when we get the ball in our hands, we can cause a bit of trouble.\n\n\"We will grow our combinations. We can be pretty excited about taking on the Wallabies next week.\"\n\nWales have endured a miserable decade against Australia, losing their past 13 games against them, often by painfully narrow margins and will face them in the pool stage of the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n\nHaving never faced the Wallabies for Wales, Parkes is free of any of the psychological baggage that such a losing run may bring.\n\nAnd having only played in one of those defeats, Anscombe is relatively unscarred compared to some of his team-mates.\n\nWales will be desperate to finally halt that sequence and, given their New Zealand upbringings, Anscombe and Parkes have a little added motivation to get one over Australia.\n\n\"They're the dirty ones on that side,\" Parkes jokes.\n\n\"They're competitors aren't they, the Australians. I grew up fascinated by the Aussie cricket side and the amazing era they had.\n\n\"There was their rugby team as well at that time with John Eales, George Gregan and Stephen Larkham. They are a very good, skilful team, one who are getting better and better at the moment with each match.\n\n\"It would be very nice [to win], wouldn't it? I can't speak too much about what's gone on beforehand, but with the big year that's to come it would be nice.\n\n\"The boys would be absolutely stoked.

allegations that its officers committed crimes to prosecutors, Holyrood's justice committee has been told.\n\nCriminal allegations against serving police officers should be passed to the Crown Office for investigation.\n\nHowever, MSPs heard claims this did not always happen.\n\nIn one incident someone being \"unlawfully detained\" by officers was said to have been treated as a \"quality of service complaint\".\n\nThe Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) claimed the example was one of several where Police Scotland had \"failed to refer criminal allegations against officers to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service as required\".\n\nFor non-crime classifications, the force can investigate the allegation itself without having to pass it on.\n\nPunched in the face\n\nThe Pirc commissioner, Kate Frame, told the justice committee that \"incompetence\" or \"more sinister factors\" could be responsible for the police failures, which meant that the Crown Office was unable to pass the cases to Pirc for an independent investigation to be carried out.\n\nPolice Scotland has strongly denied Ms Frame's claims, with Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs insisting: \"The assessment of criminality is subjective and undertaken in accordance with the Lord Advocate's Guidelines.\n\n\"Police Scotland categorically rejects the assertion made by the commissioner that any failure to report matters is due to 'sinister aspects'.\"\n\nDuring the committee meeting, Ms Frame highlighted a number of cases, including an allegation of someone being punched twice in the face by an officer being recorded as \"excessive force\" instead of assault.\n\nMs Frame also claimed that: \"There is another example of an allegation of rape, that was recorded as incivility.\"\n\nHowever, Pirc later clarified that: \"What the commissioner was referring to was that in the course of an alleged rape investigation a complaint was made against a serving police officer which was categorised by Police Scotland as 'incivility'.\n\n\"After the Pirc's intervention, the matter was reported by Police Scotland to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) as an 'attempt to pervert the course of justice' by a serving police officer.\"\n\nImage copyright PIRC Image caption Kate Frame said she was concerned that Police Scotland was often able to investigate serious allegations against its own officers\n\nThe commissioner said she had only found out about the cases because the complainers were unhappy with the way the police investigations were carried out, and had approached Pirc to ask for a complaint handling review.\n\nMs Frame said: \"At that stage we were able to refer the matter to the Crown Office for their instructions in relations to the criminality involved.\n\n\"Had the complainers not had the option of coming through the complaint handling process we would have been none the wiser.\"\n\nShe also said she was concerned about the \"level of police discretion which continues to allow them to investigate some of their own actions\".\n\nMs Frame added: \"I think there is maybe a combination of factors that have contributed to it, either by the way of incompetence or other more sinister aspects.\"\n\nBut she told the committee it was \"very difficult to assess\" how widespread the issue was, because she only finds out about \"the complainers who come to us after the event, and some may very well not\".\n\n'Fair and rigorous'\n\nPolice Scotland said it deals with more than 6,000 complaints annually, and that all complaints against the police are fully recorded and \"subject to fair and rigorous investigation\".\n\nACC Spiers said: \"Every complainer has a right of recourse in circumstances where they are dissatisfied, and are provided by Police Scotland with details of how to seek further action.\n\n\"It is notable that only 5% of complainers seek these further steps through Pirc.\n\n\"Incidents are referred to Pirc in line with current legislative requirements and over the last year 421 matters were referred to Pirc with 36 of them investigated.\n\n\"This demonstrates a commitment to a high level of transparency whereby over 90% of matters referred are not subject of further investigation by Pirc.\"", "Scotland's last meeting with Fiji ended in a 27-22 defeat in Suva

It was another excellent performance, the team attacked very well. We have not qualified but made a good step to finishing first in the group phase.\"\n\nThis season's European campaign started badly for City with a 2-1 home defeat by Lyon and they then conceded in the opening minute of their second game against Hoffenheim.\n\nHowever, City fought back to win that match 2-1 and this latest victory has put them on the brink of reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League for a sixth successive season.\n\nThey dominated against the Ukrainians as a hat-trick from Gabriel Jesus, including a bizarre penalty, and goals from David Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling gave City a 6-0 win, eclipsing their 5-0 away success against Steaua Bucharest in the first leg of a play-off tie in August 2016.\n\n\"After the first game against Lyon, we were then down against Hoffenheim, so the situation was so dangerous but since then we have got three wins and we still need more points to get to the next stage,\" added Guardiola.\n\nThe Spaniard won the Champions League twice as a coach with Barcelona and is hoping to repeat that with City this year after taking them to the last 16 in 2016-17 and then the quarter-finals last season.\n\nHow the goals went in\n\nCity captain Silva opened the scoring with a tap-in after Mahrez had twisted to create space for a low cross, before the hosts doubled their lead in strange circumstances.\n\nSterling fell over as he kicked the ground under no challenge and referee Viktor Kassai wrongly awarded the penalty, which Jesus converted for the first of his three goals.\n\nThere was no doubt about City's third goal as Sterling ran at the visiting defence and curled a shot past goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nRaheem Sterling's second-half goal was his seventh club goal of the season\n\nKassai did get one penalty decision correct as Silva was clumsily brought down by Taras Stepanenko before Jesus scored his second penalty of the evening to make it 4-0.\n\nMahrez then did well to control a pass from Ilkay Gundogan on his chest and shooting past Pyatov for City's fifth goal, before Jesus sealed his hat-trick from Mahrez's pass.\n\nThat looked to have been enough to take City into the knockout stages before Hoffenheim's late equaliser cut the celebrations short.\n\nA laughable penalty\n\nThe main talking point came in the 24th minute when Kassai - who refereed the 2011 Champions League final, in which Barcelona beat Manchester United 3-1 - stunned both City and Shakhtar by awarding a penalty.\n\nEngland international Sterling had raced into the area and was a few yards clear of Shakhtar defender Mykola Matviyenko. As goalkeeper Pyatov came off his line to narrow the angle, Sterling went to shoot but kicked the ground and tumbled over.\n\nSterling did not appeal for a penalty and Pyatov started laughing when he saw it had been given. City boss Pep Guardiola appeared to tell the fourth official that it was the wrong decision.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Sterling could have told referee it wasn't a penalty - Guardiola\n\nSpeaking to BT Sport about the penalty incident, Sterling told BT Sport: \"I went to chip the ball and don't know what happened. I didn't feel contact. I scuffed the ball. Apologies to the ref.\"\n\nGuardiola suggested that a video assistant referee - not yet used in Champions League games - would have helped, adding: \"We realised it wasn't a penalty. We don't like to score in that situation.\n\n\"You know VAR and what it is - the referee must be helped because they don't want to make mistakes. The game is so fast these days. It takes 10 seconds for somebody to say something to the referee.\"\n\nJesus converted the spot-kick - his first goal in seven club appearances - to end the game as a contest and from then on it became a question of just how many they would score.\n\nThe Premier League leaders won 3-0 away against Shakhtar on 23 October and they doubled that score against opponents they completely outclassed.\n\nRaheem Sterling kicked the turf, well clear of defender Mykola Matviyenko...\n\nSterling fell over, but did not appeal for the penalty\n\nShakhtar Donetsk goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov could not believe the decision from referee Viktor Kassai\n\nGabriel Jesus converted the penalty for his first Champions League goal of the season, although his second and third were not far behind\n\nCity able to rest players before Manchester derby\n\nCity face a Premier League home derby against Manchester United on Sunday and Guardiola, with that on his mind, left Sergio Aguero and Leroy Sane on the bench, with Vincent Kompany and Benjamin Mendy not in the squad at all.\n\nGuardiola was also able to take off goalscorer Silva, Kyle Walker and Fernandinho and give Danilo, Gundogan and Fabian Delph some much needed game time.\n\nCity are two points clear at the top of the Premier League as they look to retain their title, while United, who fought back from a goal down to beat Juventus 2-1 away from home in their Champions League match on Wednesday, are seventh domestically, nine points behind Guardiola's side.\n\nPenalty decision 'ridiculous' - what they said\n\nShakhtar coach Paulo Fonseca laughed when he was asked about the first penalty decision after Sterling had kicked the floor.\n\n\"It is difficult to speak about a penalty after a result like that, but it's ridiculous, that's all I can say,\" said Fonseca.\n\n\"Everyone saw it, but it is not because of the penalty we lost the game.\"\n\nSix goals again for City - the stats\n\nManchester City have scored six (or more) goals in back-to-back games in all competitions for the first time since November 1987 when they followed up a 10-1 second-tier win over Huddersfield Town with a 6-2 win at Plymouth in the now-defunct Full Members Cup.\n\nCity midfielder David Silva has scored three goals in the 2018-19 Champions League, his best tally in a single season in the competition. He has scored in three successive Champions League games for the first time.\n\nGabriel Jesus is the first player to score two penalties in a Champions League game for an English club since Wayne Rooney did so for Manchester United against Otelul Galati in October 2011.\n\nJesus is the third player to score a Champions League hat-trick for Manchester City after Alvaro Negredo and Sergio Aguero (twice).\n\nManchester City's Riyad Mahrez has had a hand in seven goals his six starts at home in the Champions League (three goals, four assists).\n\nThis 6-0 victory ended a run of three consecutive Champions League defeats for Manchester City at the Etihad, and was their biggest ever win in any European competition in their history.", "Image copyright SNS Image caption Mike Towell died in hospital the day after the Glasgow fight in 2016\n\nThe mother of Mike Towell has told an inquiry his life could have been saved if he had been given a brain scan in the weeks before his death.\n\nThe boxer went to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee complaining of severe head pains a fortnight before he collapsed in the ring in September 2016.\n\nAlso giving evidence, Mike's girlfriend told a fatal accident inquiry that he was treated for a migraine on that occasion.\n\nShe said he suffered a seizure in May.\n\nThe 25-year-old fighter from Dundee collapsed in the ring in Glasgow, after losing a bout in the fifth round to Welshman Dale Evans on 29 September 2016.\n\nHe died 24 hours later after suffering a bleed in the brain.\n\nA fatal accident inquiry, being held in Glasgow, heard that on 11 September Mike was \"in agony\" at Ninewells Hospital's A&E unit, complaining of severe head pains that began while he was sparring at a gym.\n\n'He wouldn't have boxed'\n\nMike's mother Tracey Towell, 53, told counsel Emma Toner that her son would not have fought if a brain scan had revealed something was wrong.\n\nMrs Towell said: \"He loved his son very much, he would never have taken a chance like that.\"\n\nMs Toner asked how likely it was that he would have stopped boxing, in light of evidence that he had previously ignored medical advice.\n\nMrs Towell replied: \"Yes, if they had said there's something going on there in your brain, he was a coward that way.\n\n\"He was a tough lad, and a boxer but he was also a coward that if he thought there was something going on in his head he wouldn't have boxed.\"\n\nDuring cross-examination, counsel for NHS Tayside, Mark Fitzpatrick, put it to Mrs Towell that she did not know what criteria doctors apply to decide if someone needs a scan.\n\nShe agreed but said: \"We do know he had a bleed to the brain afterwards\".\n\nShe was asked if she or her son were able to judge how important a scan was in deciding whether or not to box.\n\nShe said: \"I felt it was important, he should have got a scan and it may well have saved his life and it would have stopped him boxing, yes.\"\n\nImage copyright Spindrift Image caption Tracey Towell gave evidence at an FAI in Glasgow\n\nMike Towell's partner Chloe Ross told the inquiry that she witnessed him having a seizure in May 2016, four months before he died.\n\nThe 26-year-old said her boyfriend woke up during the night \"vibrating\" and bit his tongue during the episode.\n\nShe was asked if she knew what was happening and said: \"I assumed it was a seizure, but I have never seen one before.\"\n\nMiss Ross - mother to Mike's son Rocco - told the inquiry how she phoned an ambulance when he didn't respond to her shouts.\n\nHe was taken to hospital on that occasion.\n\nThe inquiry then heard about a sparring session in Edinburgh at the end of July 2016, when Mike wasn't happy after going up against three separate fighters who did three rounds each, but he did eight.\n\n\"Not normal\"\n\nMiss Ross said: \"I would say he started getting sore heads from then.

However, the key words in the offence are \"with intent\".\n\nSo the critical question would be whether you told the offensive joke with the specific intent of causing anyone present harassment, alarm or distress - and that they did indeed suffer one of those things.\n\nA joke that was simply offensive and in bad taste would not be sufficient for a prosecution.\n\nProsecutors would have to prove that the joke-teller specifically intended someone in the audience to suffer harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nProsecutors would be very aware of the general and powerful right to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThere have been few, if any, prosecutions of people telling offensive jokes in public.\n\nWhat if I share my video or message on social media?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSharing a video on social media could possibly amount to a public order offence.\n\nAgain the key words would be \"with intent\" - what was the intent behind the posting?\n\nIf the prosecution can prove that it was done to cause a person harassment, alarm or distress, and that someone has suffered one of those things, it is possible that posting could amount to a public order offence under Section 4a.\n\nIs there a difference between sharing the message on a closed group like WhatsApp and more widely on social media like Twitter?\n\nThe size of the potential audience doesn't necessarily matter.\n\nPosting on a closed WhatsApp group of generally likeminded people would considerably reduce the risk of a prosecution.\n\nHowever, if the person posting intended to harass, alarm or distress one of the group, an offence might be made out.\n\nAgain it will not be enough if a person was simply offended by the post.\n\nThere is also a specific offence under the Communications Act 2003 of sending on a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character; or causes any such message to be so sent.\n\nThis can and has been used to prosecute those posting grossly offensive messages online and on social media.", "Image copyright West Mercia Police/Family Handout Image caption Derek Whyteside died after being assaulted\n\nA stepfather looking for two stolen bikes was murdered by a 16-year-old armed with a cricket bat, a jury has heard.\n\nThe teenager \"crept up behind\" Derek Whyteside in Telford, Shropshire, attacking him with a full swing of the bat, Stafford Crown Court was told.\n\nMr Whyteside, 42, suffered a skull fracture and died two days later.\n\nThe accused denies murder.

Whenever these satellites have been in storage, there is a health review,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\"The instruments are switched on and tested and we see whether there has been a degradation. The European Space Agency (Esa) and industry did a tremendous job to put all the spacecraft parts - in terms of payload module, service module and instruments - into a shape where they're ready for launch.\"\n\nAll three platforms in the Metop series were purchased from European industry at the turn of the millennium. It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems.\n\nMetop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana\n\nThe satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft \"cousins\" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator.\n\nThe polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights.\n\nThe introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence.\n\nEumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation).\n\nThese spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms.\n\nImage caption The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought\n\nThe British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS). It will have significantly improved performance.\n\nThe first Metop-SG pairing is set to roll out at the end of 2022.\n\nThese are interesting times in satellite meteorology because we are starting to see very small spacecraft being launched to monitor the state of the atmosphere. The new platforms are shoebox-sized, versus the 4-tonne Goliaths like Metop.\n\n\"New space\" companies - good examples would include Spire and Orbital Micro Systems - are looking to sell weather data and forecasts to private clients.\n\nDr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, told BBC News that his agency was evaluating the data from smallsats but it was too early to say how these novel systems would eventually fit into the general observing system.\n\n\"One should be careful not to make simple comparisons between the quality of a smallsat with a big sat,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the illusion is created that you can just replace the big ones with the small ones. Smallsats provide what they are designed for - to be small, to be quick and for there to be many of them. Their measurements are therefore complementary to the more precise data from classical satellites like Metop.\"\n\nMetop-C lifted off on a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Kourou spaceport on schedule at

Salmond was informed about the allegations and does not \"have a relevant case as a matter of law\".\n\nReference was also made to a dispute over whether one of the complaints had been raised informally prior to the formal complaint being logged in January.\n\nThe government had previously denied that there were any recorded complaints regarding Mr Salmond before January 2018.\n\nJudge

serious doubts about the future of Allied Healthcare.\n\nThe CQC said it was concerned about its prospects from the end of this month, but the firm said the move was \"premature and unwarranted\".\n\nThe company provides services, such as help washing and dressing, to more than 13,000 people across the UK.\n\nThe CQC just has responsibility for England, where 9,300 people rely on Allied Healthcare services across 84 council areas, more than half the total.\n\nThe regulator has written to all the affected local authorities as they would have responsibility to step in if services are disrupted.\n\nFinancial difficulties\n\nAllied Healthcare announced earlier this year it was struggling with debts blaming low fees paid by councils, but it did manage to restructure its finances on that occasion.\n\nBut the CQC has now said the company had only be able to confirm it had funding in place until 30 November.\n\nThe regulator said it had a legal duty to warn councils that business failure was likely and services could stop as a result in its view.\n\nIt does not mean failure will definitely happen, just that as things stand it is deemed likely.\n\nThe BBC understands there has already been an offer made from a new lender that could secure the firm's immediate future.\n\nThis is the first time a notice like this has been issued to a whole provider - previous warnings have just related to individual services.\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library\n\nAndrea Sutcliffe, from the CQC, said: \"I understand this is a very unsettling time for everyone who uses Allied Healthcare's services, their families and loved ones, and staff.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with Allied Healthcare and all of our partners to make sure appropriate action is being taken in the interests of people's continuity of care if this proves necessary.\n\n\"It is of course possible that the company is able to avoid service disruption, and if that is the case, we will revise our position accordingly.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said there was currently no disruption to any services provided by Allied Healthcare, and that local authorities were being given time to ensure continuity of care for people using services.\n\nBut a spokesman for Allied Healthcare said the company was \"surprised and deeply disappointed\" by the move.\n\nHe said it was \"premature and unwarranted\" as there was no risk to services because financing had been secured.\n\n\"The CQC has disregarded these assurances in spite of the robust evidence we have provided,\" he added.\n\nThe news comes just weeks after the UK Homecare Association, the umbrella group for providers, warned services were being put at risk because councils were trying to get care \"on the cheap\".\n\nIts report said only one in seven local authorities were paying a fair price for care, forcing a number of firms to pull out of contracts.", "Sergio Sette Camara thanked

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Correlations between screen time and lack of sleep are \"extremely modest\", says the report\n\nThe amount of time children spend on devices has little effect on how long they sleep, a study from Oxford University suggests.\n\nIt runs counter to previous research that suggested excessive screen time was linked to children failing to get sufficient rest.\n\nThe survey concluded that the relationship between sleep and screen use in children was \"extremely modest\".\n\nBut one UK GP said the findings did not tally with his clinical experience.\n\nThe study, conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute, relied on data from a 2016 US study into children's health, in which parents from across the country completed surveys about their households.\n\nThe children's \"digital screen time\" was based on answers to two questions about the weekday habits of children aged between six months and 17 years:\n\nhow much time they spent on computers, mobile phones, handheld video games and other electronic devices\n\nhow much time they spent in front of a TV watching programmes and other content as well as playing video games\n\nThe findings indicate that the tech-abstaining teenagers slept only slightly longer than their counterparts who had spent much of their day in front of a screen.\n\nFor example, teenagers who had not been in front of a screen for any part of the day got a total of eight hours and 51 minutes of sleep.\n\nThose who had spent eight hours of their day glued to a screen got eight hours and 21 minutes of slumber.\n\nThe sample size for the survey was more than 50,000 youngsters from every state in the US.\n\n'Mini case of jet lag'\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, said every hour of screen time was linked to between three to eight fewer minutes of sleep a night.\n\nScreens are now a fixture of modern childhood and both professionals and parents are increasingly expressing concerns that the amount of time children devote to devices affects their physical and mental health.\n\nWhen it comes to sleep, there are concerns that children take devices to bed and continue to use them when they should be sleeping.\n\nOthers have expressed worries about the role the blue light emitted from such devices plays on sleep habits and a related hormone.\n\nThe US National Sleep Foundation has told parents that it is important to stop children using electronic devices before bedtime \"because the blue light emitted from these screens can delay the release of sleep-inducing melatonin\".\n\n\"This is an especially big problem for teens whose circadian rhythms are already shifting naturally, causing them to feel awake later at night. The end result: sleep-deprived or poorly rested kids who have essentially given themselves a mini case of jet lag,\" it writes on its website.\n\n'Imperfect data'\n\nBut the study author thinks other factors should be considered.\n\n\"Focusing on bedtime routines and regular patterns of sleep, such as consistent wake-up times, are much more effective strategies for helping young people sleep than thinking screens themselves play a significant role,\" said study author Prof Andrew Przbylski.\n\nProf Przbylski told the BBC that many of the studies suggesting links between screen time and lack of sleep had very small sample sizes and need \"much larger studies\" to find conclusive evidence of a problem.\n\n\"Because the effects of screens are so modest, it is possible that many studies with smaller sample sizes could be false positives - results that support an effect that in reality does not exist,\" he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that the data used in the study was \"imperfect\" because it relied on reports from parents. A further study into the time that children turn off their devices before bedtime will be published shortly.\n\nMany of the large technology firms, including Apple, Google and Facebook, have introduced dashboards allowing people to keep a check on the amount of time they spend on screens.\n\nSome leading technology executives have banned their own children from using devices.\n\nThe late Apple chief Steve Jobs's young children were notably not allowed iPads.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates banned phones until his children were teenagers.\n\nAnd Tim Cook, Apple's current leader, has said he would not let his nephew join social networks.\n\nOne UK GP, Rangan Chatterjee, said the Oxford University study was \"welcome\" but that he did not plan to change his advice to parents, which was to turn off devices an hour before bedtime.\n\n\"The more research on this area, the better because screens are here to stay,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"But the findings don't replicate what I see in clinical practice which is that the use of screens right before bed has a significant impact on the quality of sleep.\"", "In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats. The Democrats have only gained one Senate seat in Nevada.\n\nHowever, three Senate seats have yet to declare. Races in Arizona and Florida have not been called and voters in Mississippi will return to the polls later this month for a runoff, after no one candidate in the special election race took more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThere was talk before the election of a rising \"blue wave\" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country.\n\nThe Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller.\n\nOne Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district.\n\nThe Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts.\n\nThere will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.\n\nClick on the box below for detailed results, provided by AP.

In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted.\n\nSome 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014.\n\nHow the mid-term elections broke records\n\nDemocrat gains\n\nIn the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats.\n\nBoundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016.\n\nThey also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state.\n\nWho voted how?\n\nCompared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women.\n\nWhile minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat.\n\nAnd in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates.\n\nPresident Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.\n\nProduced by Daniel Dunford, Tom Calver, Will Dahlgreen, Maryam Ahmed, Nassos Stylianou, Ed Lowther, Clara Guibourg, John Walton and Irene de la Torre Arenas.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Foakes came to the crease with the score 103-5\n\nFirst Test, Galle (Day one) England 321-8: Foakes 87, Curran 48; Perera 4-70 Sri Lanka: Yet to bat Scorecard\n\nDebutant Ben Foakes says he was \"inspired\" by a video message from former captain Alastair Cook as his unbeaten 87 helped England recover from another batting collapse on day one of the first Test against Sri Lanka.\n\nPoor shot selection saw the tourists slip to 103-5 before lunch in Galle.\n\nBut wicketkeeper Foakes' 184-ball knock took England to 321-8 at the close.\n\n\"I don't know who asked him to do it, but it was awesome,\" Foakes, 25, said of the Cook video.\n\n\"We all sat down and watched it, it was inspiring and got us pumped up.\n\n\"He's still lingering around,\" the Surrey player joked.\n\nFoakes said that in the video Cook was \"talking us through everything about making your debut\" as England began their first Test since 2006 without their record runscorer.\n\nHe was only brought into the squad as a late replacement when Jonny Bairstow was injured during the one-day series.\n\nSam Curran scored 48 in a 200-ball partnership of 88 with Foakes, who also put on 61 with Jos Buttler and 54 with Adil Rashid.\n\nFoakes was one of two England debutants in the team - along with opener Rory Burns, who took Cook's place at the top of the order - while bowler Stuart Broad was left out.\n\nBurns was out for nine in the third over and when four more wickets fell in the morning session it looked as though England could be bowled out for a small total.\n\nBut Foakes, Buttler and Curran showed greater patience than the top order and guided their team to a much-improved position, which gives England a platform in the match on a spinning wicket.\n\nFoakes turns tables on opening day\n\nFoakes is England's third wicketkeeper in their past three Tests\n\nFoakes came to the crease for the first time in Test cricket shortly before lunch despite batting at number seven, having seen the top order perform poorly before him.\n\nIn comparison to those that came and swiftly went before him, he was mature, calm and accumulated runs carefully early in his innings.\n\nAt first batting alongside Buttler, he blocked good deliveries and was content to work the ball into the outfield, so it was not until his 44th ball that he hit his first boundary.\n\nFoakes hit boundaries all around the wicket as he grew into his innings and was especially impressive in the way he rotated the strike by using his feet to nudge the ball into the leg-side off the spinners.\n\nWhen Buttler edged Perera behind England were 164-6 but once again Curran showed his worth as a batsman at number eight.\n\nAs he did in the summer series against India, his defence looked solid and he also hit three big sixes from loose deliveries from the spinners.\n\nCurran fell to mystery spinner Akila Dananjaya, edging to first slip Dinesh Chandimal when playing expansively, but Rashid then added a 38-ball 35 to help England to a score that arguably means they had the better of the opening day.\n\nInspired to try cricket? Find out how to get into cricket with our inclusive guide.\n\nAttacking approach leads to familiar collapse\n\nBefore the Test, captain Joe Root said his team needed to be \"bolder\" and more \"courageous\" in their approach and in the morning session they seemed intent on playing in an attacking manner.\n\nThey lost two wickets in two balls in the third over, with Burns caught down the leg side and number three Moeen Ali bowled first ball, both dismissed by seamer Suranga Lakmal.\n\nThat brought captain Root to the crease and he looked keen to advance down the pitch and attack, hitting four fours in nine balls early on in his innings.\n\nRoot put on 62 from 81 balls with opener Keaton Jennings, with the run rate at one stage above five an over.\n\nThe England captain's method of coming down the pitch to Sri Lanka's spinners proved to be his downfall though, as he advanced to left-arm spinner Rangana Herath but yorked himself and was bowled for 35.\n\nJennings was also busy at the crease and played a number of conventional and reverse sweeps in reaching 46 from 53 balls - his highest score since being recalled to the team in the summer - but was then out playing a poor cut shot to a ball that went on to hit leg stump from Dilruwan Perera.\n\nThe off-spinner then claimed the wicket of Ben Stokes as the all-rounder also tried to sweep but left his stumps exposed and was bowled around his legs for seven.\n\nAnalysis\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social\n\nOn the subcontinent, I have no idea why you would go for this risky approach. It's like playing against Barcelona with no centre-halves.\n\nThe biggest culprit is the captain Root. He's too good. When he plays in that frantic fashion, it sends a signal to the rest of the team that this is how to play.\n\nHe has not sent the right message to his team.\n\nHe does not need to take so many risks. Just sit in a bunker and play your shots when you can.\n\nRoot hit five fours in his 35 before being bowled\n\nPerera steals show on Herath's big day\n\nMuch of the attention of the home fans at the famous Galle ground was on Herath, who is playing in his 93rd and final Test at the age of 40.\n\nHe was given a guard of honour by the Sri Lanka team before play and when he bowled his first over of the day fans let off fireworks outside the ground.\n\nThe wicket of Root was the left-arm spinner's 100th at his home ground, making him just the third bowler to take 100 Test wickets at one ground following England's James Anderson (Lord's) and former Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan (Kandy, Galle, and Colombo).\n\nHerath bowled tidily for his 1-78 from 25 overs but it was off-spinner Perera who carried the greatest threat, finishing the day with 4-70.\n\nBut Sri Lanka let their promising position slip and there were further issues for the hosts when their captain Chandimal spent time off the field in the afternoon and evening sessions after appearing to injure a groin muscle when fielding in the outfield.\n\nHerath is the only current player to have played a Test in the 20th century\n\n'I tried to embrace the nerves' - reaction\n\nEngland's Ben Foakes, speaking to BBC Sport: \"That was awesome. A week ago I didn't even have cricket on my radar, things happened really quickly. To find out I was playing yesterday and for it to go well was amazing.\n\n\"All I tried to do was embrace the nerves, embrace the excitement, don't see it as a negative.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about the scoreboard when I came out to bat. I had my own thing going on, it could have been any score. Once I got off the mark, it was all good. It got easier to bat as the day wore on and I took advantage.\n\n\"I think a lot of it depends on how the wicket deteriorates. These could be very useful first-innings runs. You just have to wait and see how the game goes.\n\n\"I haven't got the energy not to sleep, I'll pass out soon so I think I'll be all right.\"", "Image copyright Bennetts Associates Image caption An artist's impression of the refurbished theatre in the capital\n\nEdinburgh's King's Theatre is to close for two years for a \u00a320m facelift.\n\nInitial designs for the 112-year-old, A-listed building include removing 200 seats, from 1,300 down to 1,100, to provide more hospitality.\n\nA fundraising campaign, launched by actor patron Brian Cox, promised to deliver a modernised, more sustainable theatre by 2023.\n\nIn 2012 the theatre had a \u00a32.6m refurbishment including a new roof and a revamped foyer.\n\nThe works include removing the back rows of the upper circle to create a roof top hospitality and studio space.\n\nThe box office, refitted six years ago, will be replaced with another caf\u00e9 bar.\n\nManagement argue it makes sense to have fewer better seats in a sustainable, modern theatre able to host more kinds of performances.\n\nThey have already secured almost half the funding needed.\n\nProductions will transfer to the Festival Theatre for the duration of building work from 2021 to 2023.\n\nImage copyright Bennetts Associates Image caption Backstage, hospitality and studios will be upgraded as part of the refurbishment\n\nDuncan Hendry, chief executive of Capital Theatres, said: \"The King's Theatre holds a special place in the hearts of many people from Edinburgh and further afield.\n\n\"The King's really is 'Everyone's Theatre' and throughout this exciting redevelopment project we hope people will help us secure the future of their theatre.\n\n\"In early 2019 we will provide ways in which people can engage with, give opinion and support the project.\"\n\nImage copyright Bennetts Associates Image caption Fundraisers want to deliver a more modern, sustainable theatre\n\nDonald Wilson, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener, said: \"The King's Theatre has been a firm Edinburgh favourite for over a century and the council is proud to pledge \u00a34m towards its redevelopment.\n\n\"From some of the most talented community stage groups in the country and children's shows, to theatre directly from London's West End, the 'Grand Old Lady of Leven Street' has always been Edinburgh's theatre for everyone.\n\n\"This essential investment drive will help all of us enjoy a night at the King's for many more years to come.\"", "Image caption The scene of the fire on Monday morning\n\nThree people have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a huge blaze involving fireworks ripped through a former cattle market.\n\nThe fire broke out in Nottingham's cattle market at about 18:00 GMT on Sunday, engulfing several buildings and destroying businesses.\n\nNottinghamshire Police said the blaze \"involved fireworks set off nearby\".\n\nAbout 100 firefighters tackled the fire, which was brought under control on Monday morning.\n\nTwo men, aged 18 and 25, and a 25-year-old woman were taken into custody on Tuesday afternoon before being released under investigation.\n\nEarlier police issued an image of two men and a woman caught on CCTV that they wanted to talk to about the fire.\n\nThe force said its initial investigations into the blaze had \"determined it was started deliberately\".\n\nImage copyright @malone_msm Image caption People living near the Meadow Lane area were asked to keep windows and doors closed\n\nFour premises have been destroyed and another nine were damaged to varying extents.\n\nThe worse affected include Bed City, SB refrigeration, Fresh N Fruity and D&B Carburetters.\n\nAbout 200 animals had to be rapidly moved from an exotic pet business and a man was apparently bitten by a snake in the process - the only injury reported following the blaze.\n\nA lizard was so large it had to be moved in a shopping trolley, an eyewitness added.\n\nImage copyright BBC/Google Image caption Drone footage captured the extent of the damage\n\nNottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said tackling the blaze was \"a real challenge\", with densely-packed buildings, gas cylinders and a limited water supply.\n\nA high pressure pump had to be used to get water from the nearby canal.\n\nRoads were closed in the area and shifts at a nearby Royal Mail distribution centre were disrupted, which affected deliveries in parts of Nottingham.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Drone footage of Nottingham Cattle Market fire\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

thrown to the wolves in the UK,\" said the trumpet player, who has worked with George Michael, Tina Turner and Bruno Mars.\n\nHis comments coincide with research published by the Musicians' Union (MU) suggesting poorer children are priced out of learning musical instruments.\n\nChildren in low income households were half as likely to take music lessons.\n\nThe report suggests only 19% of children from families earning less than \u00a328,000 learned a musical instrument, compared with 40% of those in high-earning households.\n\nThis is despite similar levels of interest from both groups of children.\n\nThe report also suggests higher-earning parents were twice as likely to want their children to learn an instrument.\n\nChildren from poorer backgrounds who did learn an instrument were found to be half as likely to receive private lessons, with almost double the number saying they were self-taught, compared to their more affluent peers in households earning more than \u00a348,000.\n\nIn response, a Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The department has invested \u00a3300m in music hubs between 2016-2020, to give every child the chance to learn an instrument without any cost to them or their families.\n\n\"Just last month, analysis showed that through music hubs over 700,000 children learnt to play instruments in class together last

So what?\"\n\nThe background\n\nThe UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.\n\nSince then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data.\n\nFor its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to \"micro target\" voters.\n\nThe ICO said this had been the \"most complex data protection investigation\" it had ever carried out, with \"an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public\".\n\nIt said it had uncovered a \"disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy\".\n\nThe investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts.\n\nThe ICO said it had identified \"serious breaches of data protection principles\" and would have issued a \"substantial fine\" if the company had not already been in administration.\n\nThe report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum.\n\nIt said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a \"view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes\", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned.\n\nFines for Banks\n\nElsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance.\n\nBoth organisations face fines of \u00a360,000 for emails which breached data laws.\n\nThe ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent.\n\nIt also imposed a \u00a315,000 fine for a separate \"serious\" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database.\n\nA final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data.\n\nThe Vote Leave campaign\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Leave campaigners celebrate the referendum result in June 2016\n\nVote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ.\n\nThe ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws.\n\nIt said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had \"transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects\".\n\nBut it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered \"electronic marketing communications\" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules.\n\n\"We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,\" it added.\n\nRemain campaigners\n\nThe ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign.\n\nThis includes looking at \"the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker\", as well as \"inadequate third party consents\", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said.\n\nIt also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about \u00a3100,000.\n\nThis was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign.\n\n\"We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,\" the report added.\n\nDid this affect the referendum?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Remain lost the EU referendum by 51.9% to 48.1%\n\nThe ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be \"transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process\".\n\n\"We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,\" it said.\n\n\"But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.\"\n\nHow wide are the ICO's concerns?\n\nThe ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet.\n\nAlthough its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.\n\nThe watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning.\n\nSpecifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained.\n\nIn addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice \"enshrined by law\" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used.\n\nThe regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data.\n\nIt said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies.\n\nAs a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed.", "Image caption Mr Pettitt died as a result of multiple

molecule that protects Earth from ultraviolet rays that can cause skin cancer, eye problems and crop damage.\n\nHow was it being damaged by humans?\n\nThe chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) effectively began eating away at the ozone.\n\nCFCs were found in things like spray cans, fridges, foam insulation and air conditioners.\n\nAs a result, in 1985 a gaping hole in the ozone over the South Pole was discovered.\n\nHow bad did it get?\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10% of the upper ozone layer was depleted.\n\nBut since 2000, it has begun to increase again by about 3% per decade, according to the UN report.\n\nHow did things turn around?\n\nAn international agreement called the Montreal Protocol made sure that businesses came up with replacements for these damaging products. 180 countries signed up to it.\n\nIn signing the protocol, those countries agreed to phase out chemicals like CFCs.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nSo it's all better now?\n\nNo.\n\nIt's not a complete success yet, according to the University of Colorado's Brian Toon, who was not part of the report.\n\n\"We are only at a point where recovery may have started,\" he said, pointing to some areas of the ozone that haven't repaired.\n\nThere are also concerns that increasing emissions of some chlorine-containing chemicals could still slow down the progress made in healing the ozone layer.\n\nThese are normally made in China to go in to paint stripping products and to create PVC and they are unregulated.\n\nBut many experts are seeing it as a major step forward.\n\n\"It's really good news,\" said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre.\n\n\"If ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\"\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.", "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Salvini is both Italy's interior and deputy prime minister\n\nItaly's populist deputy PM Matteo Salvini has brushed off news of his break-up publicised by his former girlfriend on Instagram on Monday.\n\nElisa Isoardi, a TV host who had been in a relationship with Mr Salvini for three years, made the announcement as he flew to Ghana to discuss migrants.\n\nHe later dismissed it, saying Italians \"did not care\".\n\nHe was named interior and deputy prime minister in the new populist coalition government earlier this year.\n\nMs Isoardi's post on Instagram features an intimate selfie of the couple.\n\nQuoting a line from contemporary poet Gio Evan, Ms Isoardi writes: \"It's not what we have given each that I miss, but what we still had to give to each other.\"\n\nShe adds: \"With immense respect for the true love that was, thank you Matteo.\"\n\nThe relationship with Mr Salvini ended two and a half months ago, but Ms Isoardi, who hosts a cookery show on Italian television, had decided to go public now, she told Chi magazine in an interview.\n\n\"Why did we break up?

There are also widespread allegations of human rights abuses, including arbitrary killing, rape and burning of land.\n\nThe Rohingya are seen as illegal migrants in Myanmar (also called Burma) and have been discriminated against by the government and public for decades.\n\nThe new report was commissioned after the UN accused Facebook of being \"slow and ineffective\" in its response to the spread of hatred online.\n\nThe 62-page independent report from non-profit organisation Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) found that the platform \"has become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm\" in Myanmar.\n\n\"A minority of users are seeking to exploit Facebook as a platform to undermine democracy and incite offline violence.\"\n\nIt said Facebook should more strictly enforce its existing policies on hate speech, introduce a \"stand-alone human rights policy\" and better engage with authorities in Myanmar.\n\nThe report - which only briefly referenced the Rohingya specifically - also warned that the 2020 elections presented a serious risk of further human rights abuses and warned Facebook to prepare now for \"multiple eventualities\".\n\n'Facebook is the internet'\n\nNick Beake, BBC Myanmar correspondent, Yangon\n\nFor many in Myanmar, Facebook is the internet.\n\nAfter five decades of stale state propaganda, along came a feast of colourful, interactive news. But as UN human rights experts found, ultra-nationalist Buddhists seized on Facebook as a powerful means of inciting violence against Muslims.\n\nOne frightening example came back in 2014 when a fake online story about a Muslim man who'd apparently raped a Buddhist woman sparked deadly clashes in the second city of Mandalay.\n\nFacebook has since admitted it didn't do more to stem a torrents of racist posts over the years that followed.\n\nIn August this year, the same UN experts concluded the inflammatory material Burmese people had been exposed to day in, day out had played a role in enabling the military's purge of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state - an attack which the UN believes was genocide.\n\nFacebook's product policy manager, Alex Warofka, said in a statement: \"We agree that we can and should do more.\"\n\n\"We have invested heavily... to examine and address the abuse of Facebook in Myanmar.\"\n\nHe said Facebook was \"looking into\" setting up a human rights policy and was making it easier to report and remove violent or inciting content.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women\n\nMr Warofka said the company now employs Burmese language specialists to review potentially sensitive content.\n\nMuch of Myanmar communicates online using the Zawgyi font, which is not easily translated into English and therefore using it makes it harder for bad content to be detected.\n\nFacebook has removed Zawgyi as a language option for new users and is supporting Myanmar's transition to Unicode - the international text encoding standard.\n\nFacebook has already banned several Myanmar military and government figures it said had \"inflamed ethnic and religious tensions\".", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ashley Roberts (left) and Katie Piper (right) with Stacey Solomon at the launch of her Primark collection last month\n\nPrimark has blamed three periods of unseasonable weather for sliding sales over the past year.\n\nThe fast fashion retailer, owned by Associated British Foods, said sales fell 2.1% for the year to 15 September at stores open more than 12 months.\n\nThe decline compared with a 1% increase for the previous year.\n\nAs well as the cold snap at the start of this year and the summer heatwave, trading was also hit by an unusually warm autumn in Europe in 2017.\n\nHowever, total Primark sales were up 5%, driven by opening 15 new stores in nine countries totalling another 900,000 sq ft of trading space.\n\nIn the UK, like-for-like sales rose 1.2% and the chain won a \"significantly\" bigger share of the clothing market, but sales in Europe slid 4.7%.\n\n'Bold move'\n\nPrimark is unusual in not selling online and uses its website to direct customers to one of its 360 stores.\n\nABF chief executive George Weston told the BBC it had no plans to change: \"We don't see the business need to go online... it's too costly at our price points.\"\n\nSophie Lund-Yates, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said Primark \"continues to open up new stores, which given the challenges other bricks and mortar retailers are facing looks a bold move - but it's working\".\n\n\"Overall sales growth is continuing despite declining like-for-like sales, and a popular summer range means margins and profits continue to climb.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nABF's retail operations accounted for just under half of its \u00a315.6bn in revenues, which were up 1% from last year, with the remainder divided between its sugar, ingredients, grocery and agriculture divisions. Adjusted pre-tax profit rose 5% to \u00a31.37bn.\n\nMr Weston said strong profits at Primark and the grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses more than offset the decline in returns from sugar, which was caused mainly by low prices following EU rule changes.\n\nPrimark plans to open another one million sq ft of retail space in the next financial year, including a huge 160,000 sq ft store in Birmingham that will become its biggest outlet.\n\nThe city centre store had been due to open before Christmas, but that has been pushed back to the spring.\n\nAfter its store in central Belfast was destroyed by fire in August, the retailer will open an outlet in Commonwealth House in the city and plans to restore the damaged Bank Buildings in the longer term.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Primark's Belfast store was destroyed by fire in August\n\nThe chain plans to open large new stores in Bordeaux, Brussels, Utrecht and Milton Keynes in 2019, along with its first in Slovenia - Primark's 12th territory.\n\nIt is also aiming to enter more central and eastern European markets and has signed a lease in Warsaw for its first store in Poland.\n\nThe company now has nine stores in the US after opening in Brooklyn in July. That site has been trading \"very strongly\" and ABF said it was \"very pleased with our US performance in the second half of this year\".\n\nNew stores will open in New Jersey next year and another in Florida in 2020, while more are planned.\n\n'Wardrobe rethink'\n\nMeanwhile, a barometer of UK retail spending found sales growth was almost flat in October.\n\nThe British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor found like-for-like sales rose by just 0.1% compared with the same month last year.\n\nPaul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \"Grocery sales - which have been a ray of light - actually showed signs of restraint. However, clothing sales were more promising, with the colder weather towards the end of the month prompting a wardrobe rethink.\"", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "The Cliffsofmoher (left, in training) was euthanised after breaking down early in the Melbourne Cup\n\nLast year's Derby runner-up The Cliffsofmoher suffered a fatal injury in the Melbourne Cup won by Cross Counter.\n\nCross Counter became the first British-trained horse to triumph in the 158th running of Australia's famous race.\n\nBut The Cliffsofmoher, trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien, was put down after sustaining a fractured shoulder.\n\nThe five-year-old is the fifth horse in the last six years to die after being injured in the two-mile race.\n\nJockey Ryan Moore was not injured.\n\n\"It is with sadness that we confirm The Cliffsofmoher had to be humanely euthanised after sustaining a fractured right shoulder during the running of the Melbourne Cup at Flemington,\" said Racing Victoria spokesman Jamie Stier.\n\n\"The horse received immediate veterinary care.

Consumers in Northern Ireland have a separate energy regulator and already have a price cap.\n\nMore than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs because they have never switched or have not done so recently.\n\nFive million customers who have pre-payment meters, or are judged to be vulnerable, already have their energy costs capped.\n\nThe government introduced legislation earlier this year to establish the price cap following concerns about how efficiently the energy market was working.\n\nHow much will households save?\n\nHow much you save will depend on how much energy you use, which tariff you are on, if you have both gas and electricity, and how you pay for your energy.\n\nThe cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less.\n\nHouseholds using a typical amount of gas and electricity will save about \u00a376 on average, while those on the most expensive tariffs will save about \u00a3120.\n\nBut experts say households could still save more money if they switch supplier, and take out a fixed price tariff. Savings of up to \u00a3285 a year are possible, according to the government.\n\n\"While the price cap will ease the financial burden for some households, people shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security that it will mean they are getting the best deal,\" said Alex Neill of Which?\n\n\"Switching is still the best way to save money on your energy bills.\"\n\nWhat will happen to the cap next year?\n\nOfgem will review the tariff in February, and then adjust it in April and October each year. It has said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower than \u00a376.\n\n\"Unfortunately, any joy that long-suffering households feel today is likely to be short-lived,\" said Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySupermarket.\n\n\"Ofgem is attempting to protect consumers by launching this cap with a \u00a376 savings message, but it's simply not sustainable. The cap will be reviewed again in February, when market forces look likely to dictate it will rise significantly.\"\n\nOfgem said that customers could be confident that any rise in the cap \"would only reflect changes in the actual costs of providing the gas and electricity they use rather than supplier profiteering\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWill the cap lead to less switching?\n\nThose who have argued against the introduction of a price cap have said it will be counter-productive, as it will lead to fewer people switching - where the potential savings are greater.\n\nOfgem has admitted that is a concern.\n\n\"It will probably lead to less switching,\" Dermot Nolan, the chief executive of Ofgem, told the BBC's Today programme.\n\n\"But if you choose not to switch you can still get a fair level of protection.\"\n\nHow long will the cap last?\n\nThe cap may not last long. Ofgem will review its effect on the energy market in 2020, and the secretary of state will then decide whether to extend it by another year.\n\nWhat is actually being capped?\n\nThe cap is on the unit price of energy, and the standing charge.\n\nSo the cost of electricity - for those on default tariffs - will be capped at 17p per kWh. Gas will be capped at 4p per kWh.\n\nDual fuel users will pay no more than \u00a3177 a year for a standing charge; electricity-only users will pay no more than \u00a383, and gas users \u00a394.", "FOOTBALL GOSSIP\n\nRyan Christie is poised to agree a new long-term deal at Celtic, with his contract up next June.

The Buddies' average height this term is just 178.14cm (5ft 10in) - the fourth-shortest among all of the European teams studied.\n\nThe average height of all Premiership players this season stands at 181.35cm (5ft 11in)- almost three-and-a-half centimetres shorter than the Danish Superliga, which has the tallest average player height.\n\nOf the leagues examined, the Scottish top-flight sits among the small fry in 25th.\n\nOn average, Kilmarnock have selected the oldest players in the division this season. Even with veteran striker Kris Boyd spending more time on the bench than the pitch, Steve Clarke has routinely used 34-year-olds Kirk Broadfoot and Chris Burke, as well as Gary Dicker, Jamie MacDonald and Scott Boyd, all of whom are 32.\n\nA lack of experience might be hurting struggling Dundee, who have fielded the youngest players on average. Captain Glen Kamara and vice-captain Cammy Kerr are both just 23, while Celtic loanee Calvin Miller and summer signing Benjamin Kallman are only 20.\n\nThe Scottish top flight falls almost exactly between the greatest average age, belonging to Turkey's Super Lig, and the lowest, the Croatian First Football League.\n\nThe Football Observatory defines a \"club-trained\" player as a footballer who has \"been in the employer club for at least three seasons between the ages of 15 and 21\".\n\nHibernian top the chart as the team who has given the greatest percentage of its playing minutes to club-trained players.\n\nTeenage defender Ryan Porteous has featured in seven of Hibs' 11 Premiership games this season, while 20-year-old Oli Shaw has played in eight. Seasoned campaigners Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson and Steven Whittaker all progressed through the club's academy.\n\nHearts gave plenty of game time to young prospects such as Harry Cochrane and Anthony MacDonald last term. But, given the arrival of 16 new recruits this summer, it is perhaps unsurprising Craig Levein's league leaders have given the lowest percentage of playing minutes to club-trained players.\n\nAgain, Scotland's top flight is pretty much in the middle, with Slovenia's PrvaLiga offering the biggest average chunk of match minutes to club-trained players and the Cypriot First Division the smallest.\n\nAny footballer playing outside \"the association where he grew up\" is defined by the Football Observatory as an \"expatriate\".\n\nThis season, Motherwell have given the greatest percentage of game time to expatriates. Only four of the starting XI that lost to St Johnstone last month, for example, are Scots.\n\nNewly-promoted Livingston have given just 10.07% of their match minutes to expatriates this season. Only seven of their 25-strong first-team squad are from somewhere other than Scotland.", "Image caption\n\nThe Daily Record says predator Jim Torbett was brought to justice \"by one of his victims from beyond the grave\".

Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on.\n\nInstead, he was the first to fall.\n\nMr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee.\n\nIn West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power.\n\nIt also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter.\n\nHow has voting unfolded?\n\nAfter months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force.\n\nAround 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source.

That led some to argue for closer co-operation, while others cited it as evidence of the need instead for stronger national border controls.\n\n\"Europe is going to be our security backyard forever,\" Sir John Sawers, a former head of MI6, told the BBC.\n\n\"And we need to be able to work very closely with our European partners in order to maximise our own security.\n\n\"And their security benefits our security.

The real co-operation on operations - counter-terrorism or cyber or hostile states - goes on bilaterally and always has.\"\n\nGCHQ, for instance, would have a liaison in Paris who could ensure information relevant to the protection of France would be shared quickly.\n\n'Need our help'\n\nOfficials in Europe and the UK are also aware that intelligence and security is a relative British strength and other countries will not want to be cut off from Britain's contribution.\n\n\"The thing that is driving the quality of those relationships currently is the darkness of the threat and the common concern about it,\" Andrew Parker, the current head of MI5, told the Intelligence and Security Committee last year - with his comments included in its annual report.\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Officials in Europe and the UK are aware that intelligence and security are a relative UK strength\n\n\"Half of Europe is scared of terrorism and the other half is scared of Russia and both halves want us to help them\u2026 That will not change with Brexit,\" he said.\n\nThe only significant EU intelligence sharing body is INTCEN, which shares analysis of the threats with policymakers.\n\nSome European intelligence officers say that even though Britain is an intelligence powerhouse, there are areas - such as North Africa - where other European services may have better insights.\n\nBecause Britain is a net giver rather than receiver of intelligence, particularly in MI5's counter-terrorism experience and GCHQ's extensive collection of communications and cyber activity, there was discussion in government early last year about using what some called the \"security surplus\" as a bargaining chip in negotiations.\n\n'Bargaining chip'\n\nBut the former intelligence officers caution against playing the security card.\n\n\"The Brexit negotiation is not a zero-sum game,\" argues Sir John, who was chief of MI6 until 2014.\n\n\"Security co-operation can help create an atmosphere in which the EU-27 and the UK can see that it is in everyone's interests to maintain a climate of co-operation.\n\n\"If either side try to use it as a bargaining chip or a point of leverage it's likely to be negative on both sides,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Robert Hannigan: \"As an institution, the EU's role is extremely limited\"\n\nTheresa May's letter to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, setting out her stall on Britain's position surprised some within the intelligence community with its language, and the three serving British intelligence chiefs together expressed concerns, according to one official.\n\nMr Hannigan, who left GCHQ before the letter, also cautions against playing the security card in upcoming trade negotiations.\n\n\"I've never thought this was realistic or indeed ethically sound,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"I mean how could you possibly think of withholding material that might stop a terrorist attack in exchange for fish quotas or something.

Two characters. One stage. One interval-free show. Copious amounts of red paint.\n\nThose are the ingredients that make up Red, a play about US artist Mark Rothko which returned to the West End this summer, nearly a decade on from stints at London's Donmar Warehouse and on Broadway.\n\nThe recent production, a recording of which can be seen in cinemas across the UK on 7 November, saw Alfred Molina reprise his role as Rothko.\n\nInstead of acting opposite Eddie Redmayne as he did in 2009, though, he had a new face on stage with him.\n\nThe role of Ken - Rothko's young assistant - was taken by Alfred Enoch, perhaps best known as Dean Thomas in seven of the eight Harry Potter films.\n\nImage copyright Johan Persson Image caption Enoch has appeared in Sherlock, Broadchurch and How To Get Away With Murder\n\n\"It seems to be a play which speaks to the idea of mentors and mentees, teachers and pupils, fathers and sons,\" director Michael Grandage told the BBC earlier this year.\n\n\"It seems to be saying something that I've long believed in, but nobody ever talks about much, which is that the young person can give the older person in that relationship as much information as the [older person can to the young].\n\n\"I think when we talk about a mentor, we assume everything goes in one direction. This play rather brilliantly investigates the idea that when two people are in a room, one young and one old, both learn from each other.\"\n\nIt would be easy to assume Red is just a high-brow play about some nice paintings. But it has complexity at its core.\n\nSet over the course of two years in the late 1950s, the play sees the relationship and dynamic between its two characters develop and change significantly.\n\nThe Sorkin-esque, quick-fire dialogue remains perhaps one of the most notable things about John Logan's script.\n\n\"For me, it's not so much the amount of dialogue, it's the speed of thought of the characters,\" said Enoch when we met.\n\nImage copyright Johan Persson Image caption Molina (left) is known for his roles in Chocolat, An Education and Spider-Man 2\n\n\"They think fast and they talk fast, and they can turn ideas on a sixpence. So it's a challenge just maintaining that mental energy, that nimbleness.\"\n\nAdded to which, there's a great deal of physical movement for a play entirely set in Rothko's studio.\n\n\"As much as it's this thrilling exchange between two bright people, it also shows you what it is physically to be an artist, to be in the studio, mixing paint, stretching the canvas, making a frame,\" Enoch said.\n\nThe actor admitted it was tricky to master the craft of being an artist, while having intense conversations at the same time.\n\n\"It was quite a lot to get the hang of because you're doing these two things at the same time. That's what these characters are capable of, they're fluent in both of them.\"\n\nMolina said his main reason for returning to Red was \"getting to work with a fantastic actor, in a beautiful theatre, and doing it in the West End - which was really a bit of unfinished business.\"\n\nThe actor, who has starred in such films Chocolat, An Education and Spider-Man 2, said the relationship at the core of the play was what originally attracted him to the show.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Eddie Redmayne, who won a best actor Oscar in 2015, played Ken in a previous production\n\n\"These are very bright men who can talk and think very quickly, and they're not afraid of their thoughts. They don't think twice because they don't have to think twice,\" he said.\n\n\"They're so sure about what they believe and how they perceive things, and that's why there's this wonderful tension between them.\n\n\"It starts off with Rothko being a bit of a bully, telling Ken this is the way things are.\n\n\"Then of course the relationship changes and Ken starts to evolve and become his own person, and he then can challenge Rothko on his own terms.\"\n\nSpeaking near the end of Red's run in July, Molina promised audiences who see the play in cinemas would see \"an accurate capture of the theatrical experience\".\n\n\"The important thing to remember is we're not performing for the cameras,\" he told the BBC. \"We're playing to the audience, full-throated with everything we do normally.\n\n\"The audience are not expecting to see a movie. They go because they want to have a similar experience to the audience seeing it live.\n\n\"But it has the added bonus that we will have a record of it. It'll be nice to see it again when we're all in our dotage, to stick in the DVD player if we still have DVDs then.\"\n\nImage copyright Johan Persson Image caption Reproductions of Rothko's signature works featured in the show\n\n\"For me it means we get to reach a bigger audience with a piece of work I couldn't be prouder of,\" said Enoch, who has since gone on to take over from Jodie Whittaker in BBC thriller Trust Me.\n\n\"The fact that people are going to see it in other countries, that people I know in the States will be able to watch it, is really exciting.\"\n\nMolina admitted he would be \"sad to see the play go\" and that the recent run had felt like \"a bit of an end of an era\".\n\nOne thing neither actor will miss, though, is going home each night covered in red paint - an inevitable result of their characters' fast and furious brushwork.\n\n\"When you have a shower after it looks like you've got a head wound,\" said Enoch, who admitted he had \"fallen flat on his ass\" more than once while performing at the Wyndham's Theatre.\n\n\"My local pharmacy's going to see a real drop in soap sales,\" remarked Molina with a chuckle. \"They're going to feel it back at the warehouse.\"\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that first ran in May 2018.

The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has been given unique access inside Europe's largest burns unit, to see how they help survivors recover.\n\nUnder anaesthetic, Adele Bellis lies on an operating table at St Andrew's Centre at Broomfield Hospital as more than a dozen members of staff prepare for surgery.\n\nShe has had so many operations over the last four years, since her ex-boyfriend paid a man to throw sulphuric acid over her, she has lost count.\n\nThis time surgeons make a series of diagonal cuts along the scar on the right-hand side of her neck, before stitching back up the area .\n\nThe aim is to relieve the pressure and improve her range of movement - before, it had been difficult for Adele to turn her neck.\n\nA CO2 laser is used to make multiple small holes across the scar to help improve the appearance.\n\nAfter an hour in theatre, it has proved a success. Yet it is only the latest step in a long, ongoing journey.\n\nThe original attack took place in August 2014.\n\nAdele had been sitting at a bus stop on the phone to her friend, when she noticed a man in a tracksuit.\n\n\"He had a black scarf around him, covering his mouth. He was lightly jogging, shaking a bottle,\" she explains.\n\nThat was when the attack happened, causing life-changing burns to the right-hand side of her body and face.\n\n\"From there it went into a blur, I was running in and out of traffic,\" she remembers.\n\nImage caption The unit has its own 24-hour operating theatre\n\nAdele was rushed to hospital in Suffolk for emergency treatment, before being moved to the specialist burns unit, the St Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery and Burns, in Essex.\n\nThe advice at this stage was simple - \"keep washing and washing\".\n\nOnly once the wound has reached a normal pH, can further treatment be carried out.\n\nA pH strip test was used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of the wound and the best course of treatment, and - when the time came - surgeons removed all the dead, burnt skin and placed donor skin on top.\n\n\"Then I had skin grafts done,\" she says. \"It was taken from my thigh and used on the side of my head, my hand, my arm, my chest.\"\n\nImage copyright Adele Bellis Image caption Adele has had numerous skin grafts as part of her treatment\n\nFollowing surgery, the scars require round-the-clock care, using special garments to place constant pressure on them to stop the skin becoming raised and lumpy.\n\n\"During my recovery I had a mask I had to wear 12 hours a day, a big plastic one,\" Adele explains.\n\n\"Then I'd have pressure garments while I was asleep which would go over my head. That was constant for 18 months.\"\n\nThere are no mirrors in the burns unit, so Adele was not able to properly see her appearance until she left six weeks later.\n\n\"Patients' perception of their own image is quite strong, and when they've undergone a trauma they might not be expecting what they actually look like,\" surgeon Mr Quentin Frew explains.\n\nImage caption Mr Frew says many acid attack survivors choose not to go to A&E\n\nAdele is one of many patients being treated at the St Andrew's Centre, with 24 dedicated burn beds and a 24-hour operating theatre.\n\nDemand for its services is increasing.\n\nIn the past five years, more than 500 patients have been admitted to hospitals across England from assault by corrosive substances, new figures obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme show.\n\n\"The people we see here are only the tip of the iceberg really,\" says Mr Frew.\n\n\"A lot of patients may not come to A&E.\n\n\"They may treat themselves due to the fact of either embarrassment, or being worried about repercussions from gangs or members of family.\"\n\n'Your world view changes'\n\nIt is not only the physical ramifications the unit looks to treat, but the mental scars as well.\n\nMaria Lawford, a senior counsellor at its Psychology Therapy Service, explains that \"a trauma means that everything is thrown into the air, particularly with an acid assault\".\n\nShe adds: \"Your whole world view kind of changes very quickly, immediately, and your sense of safety in the world is compromised.\"\n\nImage copyright Adele Bellis Image caption Adele says she can't imagine herself without her scars\n\nAdele says her counselling helped build her determination to not let her ex-boyfriend \"ruin my life\".\n\nShe had been the victim of domestic abuse, she explains.\n\n\"He basically controlled me, manipulated me, and when I didn't want to be with him I ended it.\n\n\"I just don't think he wanted anyone else to have me, so in his mind - and by attacking me with acid - no-one would want me. So that's why he paid this guy to do it.\"\n\nThe ex-boyfriend is now in prison.\n\nAdele says she has vowed to have \"a normal life again\", but it is not only her that has been affected.\n\nWhile the incident has brought her closer with her family, she says her father is \"like a broken man now\".\n\nShe continues to remain upbeat, however.\n\nImage copyright Adele Bellis\n\n\"Every time I come to hospital it's a positive thing because I know it's a step closer to helping me, and helping my scars,\" she says.\n\n\"The acid attack is always going to be with me. It's always going to be my past no matter what.\n\n\"I can't actually imagine myself without scars,\" she adds.\n\nIn fact, as a testament to her continued recovery, she has begun to embrace them.\n\n\"My new scars represent the new me,\" she says. \"The new strong me.\"\n\nFollow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Singer Aretha Franklin in 1970\n\nA long-awaited Aretha Franklin documentary will premiere in New York City - 46 years after being filmed.\n\nAmazing Grace was shot by director Sydney Pollack in 1972, but it spent decades in an unedited form.\n\nYears of legal complications followed, and now it will finally debut at the DOC NYC festival on 12 November, with the support of the singer's estate.\n\nThe \"queen of soul\" - known for hits like Respect and Think - died of cancer in August, aged 76.\n\nThe film Amazing Grace was only finished in 2011 because of technical problems.\n\nAfter that, Franklin and her lawyers blocked the film's release repeatedly, once suing producer Alan Elliot for using her likeness without her permission.\n\nLegal clearance finally came after the singer's death, when her family members were open to seeing the film.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aretha Franklin: In her own words\n\nIt was filmed over two nights at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, when Franklin recorded her Amazing Grace album.\n\nHowever, Pollack - who later won an Oscar for Out of Africa - made a mistake during the 1972 recording.\n\nBy not using clapper boards, an essential tool to match sound with footage in a pre-digital age, he made the 20 hours of raw film frustratingly hard to edit.\n\nThe Warner Bros studio, which financed the shoot, ultimately gave up, according to the New York Times.\n\nElliot secured the film's rights in 2007, a year before Pollack died.

These are carried out when there are fears that a child is at risk of significant harm.\n\nIn such cases, the stakes couldn't be higher.\n\nSocial workers, police and other agencies, involved in these investigations, will all remember the deaths of children such as Victoria Climbi\u00e9 in 2000 and Baby Peter Connelly in 2007.\n\nBoth were known by the authorities to be at risk but still died at the hands of people close to them.\n\n2. Domestic violence is behind nearly half the cases\n\nIn nearly half of the cases, where social workers carry out an assessment, domestic violence is a factor. The next most common issue is mental health problems.\n\nOf the children then placed on child protection plans, the concern in most cases is that the child is being neglected.\n\nThat is a failure to meet their basic needs, which could, for instance, mean they don't have enough food, the home is cold and they have nowhere to sleep.\n\n3. Funding has dropped since 2010...\n\nThroughout the era of austerity, while councils have made cuts elsewhere, they maintain they have tried to protect spending on children's services.\n\nBut once inflation is taken into account, the money available to protect children has still fallen significantly. That combined with increasing demand and more complex cases has led to councils overspending their budget for children's services.\n\nWith finances so tight, money has often been concentrated on statutory services, which protect children at risk of neglect or abuse.\n\nThis has meant cuts to the early intervention teams, who might have been able to ease future pressures.\n\nIn the last month's Budget, the government announced an extra \u00a384m for children's services over five years.\n\n4. ...but the number of social workers has increased\n\nFinding and keeping front-line staff in this high-pressure world is a constant issue for local authorities.\n\nThe most up-to-date figures show a slight increase in the number of social workers but a third will have been with their current local authority for less that two years and 15% will change jobs during the year.\n\nThere are a high number of vacancies, with an average of 17% of posts empty. Many of these roles are taken on by the more than 5,300 agency social workers in the system but that comes at a cost.\n\nAgency staff are paid more than council staff and figures collected by the BBC show between 2012-13 and 2016-17 local authority spending on these temporary staff nearly doubled, reaching \u00a3356m.\n\nIt is money cash-strapped councils can ill afford. Even more importantly, frequent changes in social worker are damaging for a child. It is much harder to learn to trust the person there to help you, if they keep changing.\n\n5. Children in care have increased by a quarter\n\nMost children that social workers are involved with will remain with their families but the numbers removed from their home and taken into local authority care have risen by 24% in a decade.\n\nOf the more than 75,000 children looked after by the state, most will have faced abuse or neglect.\n\nOther reasons for a child being in care include family dysfunction or because their family is in acute distress. A small number of children will be there because of their disabilities.\n\n6. Most children in care are older\n\nMost children in the care system are older, with the largest single group aged between 10 and 15.\n\nBoys are slightly more likely to be in care than girls. According to official statistics, an increase in the number of boys has largely been driven by a rise in unaccompanied asylum seeking children, who are more likely to be male.\n\nAlthough most children in care are white (75%), the slight over-representation of children from non-white backgrounds is also thought to reflect the rise in young asylum seekers.\n\n7. There is a North-South divide...\n\nThere is something of a North-South divide when it comes to the number of children looked after by councils.\n\nFor instance, in Blackpool out of every 10,000 children there will be 184 in care.\n\nThat compares with 34 in every 10,000 in Windsor and Maidenhead, part of the Prime Minister Theresa May's Berkshire constituency.\n\n8. ...and there are divides within communities\n\nTalk to social workers and many will say they are seeing families facing real financial hardship, with austerity and welfare cuts playing their part in pushing people into crisis.\n\nThat's reflected by research that found children living in the poorest areas were at least 10 times more likely to be taken into care than those in the most affluent parts of the country. It is a pattern that is repeated across all the nations of the UK.\n\nThe Child Welfare Inequalities project concluded deprivation was the largest single factor in families becoming involved in child protection.\n\nIn the most deprived areas about one child in every 60 was in care, compared with one in every 660 in the wealthiest areas.\n\nWith poorer areas spending more money on those in care, the team also concluded these authorities had seen more cuts to preventative services.\n\n9. Most children are with foster parents...\n\nNearly three-quarters of children being looked after by councils live with foster parents, which costs local authorities about \u00a31.7bn a year .\n\nSince the 1960s, government policy has moved away from residential children's homes.\n\nFoster carers play a vital role but there aren't enough of them. A review published in February 2018 said that the shortage depended on what part of the country a child was in and the availability of foster carers able to take on the most challenging young people.\n\nOf the children who are not fostered, about 4,000 are placed with their own parents under supervision and nearly 8,000 spend time in children's homes, secure units or living semi-independently.\n\n10. ...and children are likely to return to families\n\nAlmost a third of the more than 31,000 children who left care in 2017 returned to their families.\n\nAbout 14% were adopted, after spending an average of two years in care.\n\nFor 12% of the children, there were special guardianship orders, where a relative took on their care. The number of adoptions has fallen since its peak in 2015, which followed a high profile push to increase numbers by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nMost of the children who were adopted in 2017 were aged between one and four years old. Only 1% of adopted children were aged 10 or over, even though this represents the largest age group of children being looked after by councils.\n\n11. Children often face difficulties after care\n\nAbout a quarter of children who cease to be looked after when they reach their 18th birthdays continue to live with their foster parents but the future for many care leavers is difficult. Of the 18- to 21-year-olds who stayed in touch with councils, 40% were not in education, training or employment.\n\nAlthough half of care leavers were in some form of education, training or employment, only 6% went to university. That compares with 33% of all 18-year-olds. It's also estimated that about a quarter of inmates in youth prisons have spent time in care.\n\nAdditional research by Ben Butcher and charts by Visual Journalism Unit.", "Image copyright Allan Atulinda Image caption Zarake Maria Goretti says the paramilitary force will give her job security\n\nUganda's government is a creating a new security force to combat soaring levels of crime, but critics fear it could become a law unto itself, writes the BBC's Patience Atuhaire from the capital Kampala.\n\nZarake Maria Goretti sits on the grass after giving her blood samples for her medical check-up.\n\nThe 22-year-old is one of thousands who turned up at an open-air ground, usually used for trade fairs in Kampala, to apply to join the new civilian militia, known as Local Defence Units (LDUs).\n\nAbout 6,000 LDUs are currently being trained to help the security forces curb crime following a wave of high-profile murders.\n\nCritics have memories of the last time a civilian militia existed.

About 20 women were killed in a space of four months in and around Kampala, causing fear and shock.\n\nMachete-wielding gangs also wreaked havoc in some city neighbourhoods.\n\nA former security chief, who asked to remain anonymous, put the insecurity down to the economic downturn.\n\n\"Young people are educated but have no jobs. Some have had to turn radical for their own survival.\n\n\"Criminal gangs like Kifeesi who operate in the city are a result of this alienation,\" he said.\n\nKifeesi is said to have its headquarters in the Katwe slum of Kampala, and its members are notorious for breaking into people's cars when they are stuck in traffic jams and hitting them with iron bars before robbing them.\n\nThe president has expressed concern about the failure to hunt down criminals.\n\n\"It is clear that the intelligence has been weak in the cases where the murders have been committed, like in the cases of [the prosecutor] Kagezi and the others.

Israel, like many Gulf Arab countries, worries about Iran's ambitions and sees it as a destabilising force in the Middle East.\n\nTehran has been directly involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and supports rebels fighting in Yemen and militant groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nThe Trump administration - which also seeks to contain Iran - strongly supports closer ties between US allies in the Gulf and Israel.\n\nPalestinians wary\n\nHowever, Palestinians are alarmed by the new alliances, developing as President Trump promises to present his \"Deal of the Century\" plan to end their conflict with Israel.\n\nThey fear his administration is looking to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others to pressure them into accepting a peace agreement that does not meet their long-standing demands.\n\n\"This kind of attempt to normalise Israel within the region, without Israel normalising its relationship with Palestine and remaining as an occupying power, is counterproductive and dangerous,\" says Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) official.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas (right) visited Oman just days after the Israeli prime minister\n\nShe suggests the latest developments threaten the legitimacy of the Arab Peace Initiative - which the 22 members of the Arab League signed up to in 2002.\n\nIt offers Israel normal diplomatic relations with Arab states only in exchange for its full withdrawal from Arab lands it captured and occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.\n\nCurrently, Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries to recognise Israel.\n\nThe Israel-Palestinian peace process has long been stalled and last year, there was a further set-back.\n\nThe Palestinians - who want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state - rejected President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nThey cut off ties with Washington, saying it was not an honest peace broker.\n\nStill, the US Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, is continuing his shuttle diplomacy around the wider region - and he was enthusiastic about the Israeli prime minister's Oman trip.\n\n\"This is a helpful step for our peace efforts & essential to create an atmosphere of stability, security & prosperity between Israelis, Palestinians & their neighbours,\" he posted on Twitter.\n\nArab street\n\nAnalysts suggest the pivotal role ascribed to Saudi Arabia in reviving the peace process has been thrown into doubt by the shocking murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nHowever, in another remarkable move, comments by Mr Netanyahu on Friday seemed to show tacit support for the powerful Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who has been accused of having a role in Khashoggi's death - something the kingdom has denied.\n\nHe said Mr Khashoggi's killing was \"horrendous\" but should not be allowed to lead to upheaval in Saudi Arabia \"because the larger problem is Iran.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Israel said Saudi Arabia's stability must be preserved, following the murder of Jamaal Khashoggi\n\nBahrain welcomed this \"clear position\" from Israel, just as it had previously supported Oman receiving the Israeli leader.\n\nAll these signs of a regional shift are popular with ordinary Israelis and even Mr Netanyahu's political rivals have praised his advances in the Gulf.\n\nHowever, the Arab public - for whom the Palestinian issue remains very emotional - will be far harder to win over without a peace agreement.\n\nSo for now, Arab states are unlikely to fully embrace Israel.

But what about other countries - what preparations have they made?\n\nFor any country that does a lot of trade with the UK, customs is of primary concern.\n\nBut it is worth pointing out that nearly all customs issues are dealt with at a European level by the European Commission, so any measures that might be taken in places such as Calais would depend in large part on what gets decided by the EU as a whole.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFrance\n\nThe European Commission's role doesn't mean that French customs hasn't been taking steps to prepare for Brexit. An additional 250 members of staff have been recruited this year - a number that will rise to about 700 by the end of 2020.\n\nFrench customs has also produced some detailed online information (in French) for businesses on how to prepare for Brexit in all its potential forms.\n\nLast month, the French government published a draft bill emphasising \"no deal\" would result in reinstating \"checks on goods and passengers to and from the UK\" as well as inspections of food, plants and live animals.\n\nThe French senate is debating what to do about Brexit, on Tuesday.\n\nThe draft bill would give the government (rather than parliament) the power to introduce new measures by emergency decree if it needed to avoid or mitigate the consequences of a hard or no-deal Brexit.\n\nBut politicians representing channel ports are warning that chaos and long queues would be unavoidable and both the French government and the EU need to take further steps to avoid that happening.\n\nThe draft bill also focuses on citizens' rights in the event of no deal, including what would be the legal situation of UK nationals resident in France. The bill also raises the possibility of other UK nationals needing visas to visit France.\n\nAny emergency legal measures introduced to ease the situation would, the bill says, depend on the UK taking reciprocal steps, which the UK government has already indicated that it would do.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nGermany\n\nGermany has produced less detailed information in public than France, which has caused some frustration among business leaders and opposition parties.\n\nThe federal government has a special Brexit cabinet though, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, and she has spoken about the importance of the government making \"suitable preparations\" for no deal.\n\nShe told German MPs last month that those included managing the status of an estimated 100,000 British citizens in Germany, many of whom have lived there for years, as well as Germans living in the UK.\n\nBehind the scenes, Germany is making many of the same preparations as France, including the recruitment of additional personnel to deal with a less open economic relationship with the UK.\n\nBut the German authorities emphasize that their priority remains an agreement on an orderly exit, saying that no deal would be the worst outcome for both sides.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nThe Dutch have been busy.\n\nThis letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs to the House of Representatives sets out many of the steps that have been taken, including the planned recruitment of more than 1000 staff in customs and food safety agencies.\n\nIn information published online, the government admits that a no-deal Brexit could hit the Netherlands hard but could also produce some opportunities for Dutch businesses.\n\nIt notes that the European Medicines Agency is relocating (whether there is a deal or not) from London to Amsterdam.\n\nThe government is currently assessing how a hard Brexit with no transition period could affect the supply of medicines and medical equipment, and how any risks can be limited.\n\nMore details of government preparations for Brexit in the Netherlands can be found here.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIreland\n\nThe Republic of Ireland, by all accounts, was preparing for Brexit long before Brexit actually happened.\n\nAnd it's clear that a no-deal Brexit would raise serious questions for the Irish economy.\n\nAt the moment, the Irish government is doing more public events on Brexit than the UK government, including a series of road shows involving senior politicians entitled Getting Ireland Brexit Ready.

In the event of no deal, a protocol on Gibraltar, due to be attached to the Brexit withdrawal agreement, would not come into effect.\n\nThe authorities in Gibraltar, however, point out that on one crucial issue - customs - the challenges are not as acute as they would be at UK borders, because Gibraltar is already outside the customs union.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, has said his government will step up the pace of its no-deal contingency planning if there is still no agreement on the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 1 January 2019 - three months before Brexit is due to happen.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Video\n\nPro-democracy activist Luc Nkulula, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, died in a fire at his home in June.\n\nNkulula, a fearless campaigner, had to put up with regular beatings and arrests, and his friends suspect the fire was started deliberately - an investigation blamed a faulty solar panel.\n\nHe helped found La Lucha, a group of young people fighting for a more democratic country.\n\nBut the authorities seem to stand in their way at every turn.\n\nThis film is produced by BBC Africa Eye.", "Image copyright Dumfries and Galloway Council Image caption A public inquiry is to be held into the flood protection project on the Whitesands\n\nA public inquiry has started into \u00a325m proposals to tackle long-standing flooding problems in Dumfries.\n\nFour weeks have been set aside to hear evidence about the Whitesands scheme.\n\nDumfries and Galloway Council's administration has said it would provide protection as well as boost regeneration in the area.\n\nHowever, opponents have voiced concerns about the impact on riverside views, the cost of the scheme and the loss of parking spaces.\n\nImage caption The River Nith regularly flows into nearby streets, car parks and businesses\n\nJohn Dowson of the Save Our Sands campaign said: \"This is the day where we look into what will be a town-changing decision.\n\n\"If we don't get it right for the next 100 years Dumfries will be changed for that period of time.\n\n\"All we want at the end of the day is for the council to show a little bit of respect to the community, come and speak to us in a meaningful way and try to agree on a solution for the Whitesands that really everyone can sign up to.\"\n\nHe said his group would be happy to see further discussions over the scheme but would continue to fight the plans even if the inquiry found in favour of the project.\n\nThe history of River Nith flooding in Dumfries goes back for decades and problems in the Whitesands area have become an almost annual occurrence in recent years.\n\nImage copyright Dumfries and Galloway Council Image caption The council has said the investment could help boost regeneration in the area\n\nThe latest attempt to tackle those issues is based on a \"raised walkway\" concept with a combination of walls, glass panels and flood gates providing flood protection.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts to get the local authority to drop the plan but it has now reached public inquiry.\n\nIt will look at the visual and heritage impact, the effect on tourism and parking and community engagement as well as technical matters.\n\nIt has been scheduled to run until 7 December.\n\nThe inquiry will ultimately decide whether to take the scheme forward, modify it or abandon it entirely.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Giancarlo Rinaldi, BBC News south of Scotland reporter\n\nImage caption Opponents have criticised the cost of the scheme and its impact on parking and views\n\nThe start of the public inquiry was greeted by a suitably damp day with rain spattering the windows of the Easterbrook Hall.\n\nEarly evidence was, as the chairman admitted, \"a bit anoraky\".\n\nYet there were some skirmishes between opposition campaigners and the QC representing Dumfries and Galloway Council that hinted at the battle to come.\n\nThey will have four weeks and hours of evidence to get their teeth into in the days ahead.\n\nAt the end of that, the Scottish government will have the unenviable task of trying to answer a question that has vexed Doonhamers for years.\n\nHow do you solve a problem like the Whitesands?", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright PA Image caption Supporters from across the creative industries accompanied Sir Lenny to 10 Downing Street\n\nSir Lenny Henry delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street in an attempt to increase the number of women, BAME and disabled people working in film and TV.\n\nThe letter calls for tax relief to help boost diversity behind the camera.

such as a failure to take up paid work - claimants can lose benefits for as long as three years.\n\nThe committee's report recommended the maximum period for such sanctions should be two months for the first failure to comply and four to six months for subsequent breaches.\n\nIt also warned that children risked becoming \"collateral damage\" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare.\n\n'Extreme hardship and distress'\n\nWithout clear evidence that sanctions were driving a return to work by single parents, it was \"hard to justify\" their inclusion in the system, the report said.\n\nThe committee received more than 500 responses detailing claimants' experience of the sanctions regime, which included cases of \"extreme hardship and distress\".\n\nThese included a wheelchair user who \"sofa-surfed\" with friends or slept in a college library for a year when her entire benefit was wrongly taken away.\n\nAnd the committee heard from a man who was sanctioned when he missed a job centre appointment three days after being taken to hospital suffering from severe epileptic seizures.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 'Benefit sanctions harmed my mental health'\n\nAnother respondent, a single parent named Samantha, told the MPs she was sanctioned after childcare problems meant she had to move from full-time to part-time work.\n\nShe described how her monthly income fell from an average of \u00a3800 per month to \u00a3300, leaving her relying on food parcels from friends.\n\nFrank Field, who chairs the committee, said he had heard accounts of \"terrible and unnecessary hardship\" from people who had been sanctioned.\n\nThe committee said that ministers had \"no idea\" how many people were suffering as a result of the sanctions regime, because of an \"unacceptable\" failure to adequately evaluate its impact.", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nThousands of children are having their tonsils removed unnecessarily, costing the NHS millions of pounds each year, according to experts.\n\nThey found seven in every eight children given tonsillectomies were unlikely to benefit from the operation.\n\nNHS England has already said it plans to cut back on this surgery, along with other \"ineffective\" treatments, where the harms outweigh any gains.\n\nChildren may be given a tonsillectomy after several bouts of bad sore throat.\n\nBut Prof Tom Marshall and his team at the University of Birmingham found few who had the procedure fitted any of the main criteria:\n\nmore than seven documented sore throats in a year\n\nmore than five sore throats per year for two successive years\n\nthree sore throats per year for three successive years\n\nOver-treated\n\nThey looked at the UK medical records of more than 1.6 million children between 2005 and 2016.\n\nThey found that out of more than 18,000 children who had had their tonsils removed during this time, only 2,144 (about 12%) had had enough sore throats to justify surgery.\n\nAlmost one in 10 had suffered just one sore throat before being offered the surgery, they report in The British Journal of General Practice.\n\nTwo or three children per 1,000 underwent tonsillectomy annually between 2005 and 2016 - but fewer than one in eight of them met the recommended criteria.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers estimate that 32,500 of the 37,000 child tonsillectomies in 2016-2017 in the UK were unnecessary, costing the NHS \u00a336.9m.\n\nProf Marshall said that while a tonsillectomy might be justified for those most severely affected, \"research suggests children with fewer sore throats don't benefit enough to justify surgery, because the sore throats tend to go away anyway\".\n\nAlthough complications from the surgery are rare, they can be severe.\n\nNHS England said: \"This study shows why the NHS, the medical profession and patients are working together to phase out operations that don't work or are inappropriate, which means better patient care and a more efficient use of taxpayer funding.\"\n\nENT UK, which represents surgeons, said the profession carefully considered which children should be offered a tonsillectomy, as per guidelines, but using clinical judgement.\n\nA spokeswoman said another common reason for offering tonsillectomy is a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea, where enlarged tonsils block the airways.\n\n\"There is also evidence from the literature that following the introduction of evidence based guidelines and a reduction in tonsillectomy surgery from 2011, there is an increasing rate of admissions of patients in the UK with complications of acute tonsillitis, including peritonsillar abscess and deep neck space infections which have a significant morbidity, small but definite mortality, and a significant cost to the health economy.\"", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nWomen whose body clocks mean they are \"morning people\" have a lower risk of developing breast cancer, say UK researchers.\n\nThe team at the University of Bristol says the reason why still needs to be uncovered.\n\nIt adds the findings are important as they may affect every woman's risk.\n\nExperts said the study presented at the NCRI Cancer Conference in Glasgow added to a growing understanding of the importance of sleep in all health.\n\nBody clock\n\nEverybody has a body clock, which governs how the body works in a roughly 24-hour pattern. It's also known as a circadian rhythm.\n\nIt affects everything from when we sleep, to our mood and even our risk of a heart attack.\n\nBut not everybody's clock tells the same time.\n\nMorning people or \"larks\" are early to rise, peak earlier in the day and are tired earlier in the evening.\n\nEvening people or \"owls\" find it harder to get up in the morning, are productive later into the evening and prefer to go to sleep late.\n\nTake our quiz to find out whether you are a morning type, or an evening owl.\n\nAnd this is involved in breast cancer?\n\nThe researchers think so. They used a clever new way of analysing data - called Mendelian randomisation.\n\nThey looked at 341 snippets of DNA (the instructions for the human body) that control whether we are likely to be a lark or an owl.\n\nThey used this knowledge to perform an experiment on more than 180,000 women in the UK Biobank project and nearly 230,000 women in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium study.\n\nThey showed people genetically programmed to be \"larks\" were less likely to have breast cancer than those programmed to be owls.\n\nBecause these bits of DNA are set at birth and are not linked to other known causes of cancer, like obesity, it means the researchers are reasonably confident body clocks are involved in cancer.\n\nHow big is the effect?\n\nAround one in seven women in the UK will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.\n\nBut this study only looked at a small, eight-year snapshot of a woman's life.\n\nIn that time it showed two in 100 owls developed breast cancer compared with one in 100 larks.\n\nDr Rebecca Richmond, one of the researchers from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: \"The findings are potentially very important because sleep is ubiquitous and easily modified.\n\n\"Previous research has looked at the impact of shift work, but this is showing there may be a risk factor for all women.\"\n\nAge and family history are some of the main risk factors for breast cancer. According to Cancer Research UK, around a quarter of cases might be preventable.\n\nSo will a good night's sleep stop me getting cancer?\n\nIt's not that simple.\n\nDr Richmond said it was said it was still too soon to give clear advice to women.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"We still need to get at what makes an evening person more at risk than a morning person\u2026 we need to unpick the relationship.\"\n\nIs it something about the body clock itself? Or do \"owls\" cause damage by living out of time with their body clocks in order to get up and go to work? Does the body clock affect hormone levels to alter cancer risk, or the immune system, or metabolism?\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions.\n\nAre the researchers right?\n\nScience is never 100% sure, but this fits with an emerging picture.\n\nThe World Health Organization already says disruption to people's body clocks because of shift work is probably linked to cancer risk.\n\nDr Richard Berks, from Breast Cancer Now, said: \"These intriguing results add to the growing body of evidence that there is some overlap between the genetics of when we'd prefer to sleep and our breast cancer risk, but more research is required to unravel the specifics of this relationship.\"\n\nSimilar studies have revealed a role for sleep preferences and mental health, including schizophrenia risk.\n\nCliona Kirwan, consultant breast surgeon and researcher at the University of Manchester, said: \"The use of Mendelian randomisation in this study enables the researchers to examine the causal effect on breast cancer of different sleep patterns.\n\n\"These are interesting findings that provide further evidence of how our body clock and our natural sleep preference is implicated in the onset of breast cancer.\"\n\nThe findings have been published on researchers' website bioRxiv but have not yet gone through scientific peer review.\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "Image copyright Science Photo Library\n\nA rising number of patients are facing long waits for key NHS tests as UK hospitals struggle with staff shortages, a BBC investigation shows.\n\nTests such as scans and biopsies are crucial for diagnosing illnesses.\n\nBut tens of thousands of patients are waiting weeks - sometimes months - for them, leading to potentially harmful delays before treatment can start.\n\nFigures obtained by the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act suggest a lack of radiographers is a key cause.\n\nThey carry out scans and ultrasounds which can detect problems such as tumours, heart disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nBut the data provided by hospitals show one in 11 posts are unfilled.\n\nIn total, 124 NHS trusts and boards across the UK - four in five of those asked - responded to the BBC's request for information.\n\nThe figures provided showed there were 14,067 funded posts in April, but 1,283 were vacant.\n\nThe Society of Radiographers said the shortages were causing significant delays in diagnosing illnesses.\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to display this content.

But at what cost?\n\nOne day, your office windows will be harvesting energy from the sun, while the lamp-post down in the street is storing energy in its concrete.\n\nVertical wind turbines will spin as traffic whooshes past, and pavements and roads will generate small amounts of energy from all those commuter feet and heavy buses and lorries pounding down them.\n\nFleets of driverless taxis will give back surplus energy to the grid, and cities generally will make much more efficient use of the energy they consume.\n\nThat, at least, is the vision of many technologists, environmentalists and city planners.\n\nBut how realistic is it?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Concrete lamp-posts could become batteries, storing the energy they need to work all night\n\nNew materials certainly show promise. Cement mixtures made from power station waste could turn buildings in to batteries, for example.\n\nThese potassium-geopolymetric (KGP) composites are cheaper than ordinary cement and can store electricity. A six-metre tall lamp-post made from KGP and equipped with a small solar panel could hold enough energy to power itself throughout the evening, researchers say.\n\n\"We have shown that KGP cement mixtures can be used to store and deliver electrical energy without the need for expensive or hazardous additives,\" says Lancaster University professor Mohamed Saafi, who is heading up the research.\n\nImage copyright Lancaster University Image caption Could these little cement blocks help power the cities of the future?\n\nLarge numbers of buildings made with KGP could be used to store and release excess energy - smoothing demands on urban electricity grids.\n\nNew materials are also helping to make solar panels cheaper and more cost-effective to make.\n\nSolar is the most common renewable energy source in cities as costs have continued to tumble - from about \u00a33 a watt a decade ago to 40p a watt now.\n\nIn the UK more than one in three firms is already producing some of their own electricity, mostly using roof-based solar panels.\n\nBut making silicon-based solar panels is very energy intensive, requiring temperatures of 1,400C and above. The silicon needs to be 99.9999% pure.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Solar power is the most common form of renewable energy in urban areas\n\nBut panels made from a class of materials called perovskites can be made much thinner, more cheaply and much lower temperatures, says Nitin Padture, professor of engineering at Brown University in the US.\n\nAnd as they are partially transparent they could also be used for windows.\n\nThe drawback is that most of them contain lead, a toxic metal. But one option Prof Padture and his team are now studying is replacing the lead with titanium.\n\n\"Titanium is quite common but no one had thought of using it to replace lead in perovskite solar panels,\" he says.\n\n\"We're not looking to replace existing silicon technology just yet, but instead we're looking to boost it.\"\n\nImage copyright Brown University Image caption A thin layer of perovskite containing titanium can make more efficient solar panels\n\nWhen it comes to wind - the other most common renewable energy source - conventional turbines don't work well in built-up areas because wind directions vary greatly.\n\nSo researchers Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani have come up a spherical wind turbine to address this problem of varying winds. Their O-Wind turbine, which has now won the UK's 2018 James Dyson Award, is a spherical device that spins when wind hits it from any direction.\n\nAnother solution from Turkish firm Devici Tech is to use vertical wind turbines along roads where they can be powered by the slipstream from passing traffic.\n\nIt says its Enlil turbines, currently being tested in Istanbul, can handle the power needs of two homes. The turbines can also incorporate solar panels and earthquake sensors, the company says.\n\nImage copyright dyson Image caption Yaseen Noorani and Nicolas Orellana with their wind turbine\n\nImage copyright Deveci Tech Image caption Vertical wind turbines on the streets of Istanbul\n\nBut not all urban energy-harvesting projects seem to make commercial sense.\n\nIn France, for example, engineering firm Colas has been pioneering photovoltaic roads at sites across the country, as well as in the US and Japan.\n\nColas's first site, a single-lane 0.6-mile route in Normandy, cost \u00a34.3m. By comparison, one mile of a two-lane road in the US costs up to \u00a33.8m.\n\nAlso there's a question over how good at energy producing they are. The solar panels are flat on the ground rather than angled towards the sun, and can be blocked by heavy traffic, as well as snow, mud or water.\n\nImage copyright Wattway Image caption One km of road could provide the electricity for public lighting in a town of 5,000 inhabitants, says Colas\n\nIn 2014, a small 70m solar bicycle path was built in Amsterdam for \u00a32.6m. It produced 3,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity in its first year.\n\nBut for that money the city could have simply bought 65 million kWh of electricity on the open market.\n\nAnother technology struggling to justify itself commercially is piezo-electricity.\n\nIf you squeeze certain materials such as quartz, you can make electricity flow through them. So cars and lorries trundling along special road surfaces equipped with piezo-electric devices could generate energy. Pedestrians could do this on specially-made pavements.\n\nIn 2009, Israeli firm Innowattech experimented with energy-capturing roads, and now a US firm, Pyro-E is to demonstrate similar technology on a short stretch of road in Fresno, California.\n\nYet while it is technically feasible, it is currently prohibitively expensive.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nSome calculate that in the US, a kilometre of a two-way street would need 13,000 piezoelectric devices, adding $400,000 (\u00a3307,000) to construction costs. Even without considering the manufacturing or installation costs, it would take about 12 years to earn back this amount.\n\nUK firm, Pavegen, has developed electricity-generating pavements that can produce two to four joules of energy with each step you take.\n\nIts pavements, which cost about \u00a32,350 per sq m, have now been installed in more than 200 locations worldwide, such as transport hubs and shopping centres, the company says.\n\nImage copyright Pavegen Image caption Trying out a Pavegen pavement in London.

With an atmosphere largely consisting of carbon dioxide and temperatures that vary between 20C and -125C, the Red Planet isn't exactly ideal for human occupation.\n\nWe'd have to adapt to living almost entirely within sealed habitats - so outdoors-y types need not apply.\n\nBut there is perhaps a bigger issue in play. Colonising Mars would provide humankind with a lifeboat, ensuring our species' survival if some giant catastrophe were to befall civilisation - let's say an asteroid strike, or an ecological breakdown.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Director and producer Ron Howard says the original space race demonstrated how much humans were capable of\n\nIt's something that several big names - such as SpaceX founder Elon Musk - are thinking hard about.\n\nThrough a hybrid of drama and documentary, National Geographic's Mars series explores how humans would establish themselves as an interplanetary species. Season two of the series begins on 11 November.\n\nMars' Oscar-winning executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are responsible for a long list of hit Hollywood movies, including Splash, Cocoon, A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13, as well as landmark television series such as From the Earth to the Moon, which told the story of the space race.\n\nRon Howard told BBC News that while he's a big fan of space exploration, he was not initially sold on the importance of settling Mars.\n\n\"When I first began the series a couple of years ago, I thought it was a great idea to do an adventure about going to Mars and we should make it as real as we possibly could,\" Mr Howard says.\n\nImage copyright Dusan Martincek Image caption The series explores conflict between scientific and commercial interests in a burgeoning Mars colony\n\n\"But I wasn't sure I believed in the idea of going to Mars. I knew I believed in the idea of space exploration\u2026 and any show that advocated that was making a statement that was healthy and positive for human beings - to inspire their imaginations to look outward.\n\n\"But as I have gone through the process of working on the show and interviewing some of the big thinkers, I now really do believe in it strategically - I don't mean that from a military standpoint, I mean it from the point of the ongoing evolution of the human species\u2026 I not only believe it's viable, I'm a big supporter.\"\n\nSeason one of Mars followed the crew of the spacecraft Daedalus, as the astronauts attempted to create a pioneer settlement on the Red Planet in 2033. Season two is set nine years later and follows the fortunes of the first fully-fledged colony. The script tackles the everyday challenges of the settlers, including the first births on the Red Planet, outbreaks of disease and mechanical breakdowns.\n\nIt also documents the tensions between scientists who want to study the planet and private companies who want to profit from its natural resources.\n\n\"Here in our show, we have interests that are not entirely aligned in the expedition. Private sector vs this international group of scientists. And it hasn't all been worked out on Earth; they each have their agendas and their orders. It's in the fine print that the conflict develops,\" said Mr Howard.\n\nImage copyright NAtional Geographic Image caption An outbreak of disease strikes the colony in season two\n\nThe series features an international organisation that is responsible for the scientific exploration of Mars. Indeed, many experts have argued that spreading the effort and cost of a real-life crewed Mars mission between countries is the only viable course of action if we want to get there anytime soon.\n\nYet, with US support for the International Space Station proposed to end in 2024, and reliance on the Russian Soyuz rocket for flights to the space station to cease in coming years, it might seem that we're approaching the culmination of an unprecedented era of international co-operation in human spaceflight.\n\nViewpoint: When will we send humans to Mars?\n\nViewpoint: Should we send humans to Mars?\n\nAsked what would be needed to make a real Mars settlement a success, Mr Howard told me: \"I think if there's a lesson in our season, it's that the more co-ordinated human beings can be internationally, both in terms of scientific exploration, national interests and corporate interests, the more alignment the better.\"\n\nThe documentary segments of season one featured some high-profile real-life stories, such as the daily operations of Musk's SpaceX and astronaut Scott Kelly's year-long mission aboard the International Space Station in 2015/2016. Mr Howard said he thought it would initially be more difficult to find case studies for season two, but found plentiful material at one of Earth's last frontiers - the Arctic. Here, the interests of oil-drilling abut with those of scientific researchers and environmentalists on a regular basis.\n\nImage copyright SpaceX Image caption The series drew on real-life plans from SpaceX to send humans to Mars; this shows the huge prototype fuel tank for a rocket\n\n\"Exploring various aspects of the parallel stories where industry and science are clashing, and the ecology of the planet is at risk, aligned beautifully with what it would take to begin really settling on Mars, where human beings are having to really impact their environment.\n\n\"So it turned out to be very interesting and useful. Also, because we learned a lot in season one, I think we did a better job of targeting the documentary material that would support and reinforce the drama of the scripted material, so I think the whole thing is even a little bit more seamless. If audiences respond well to this season, and we do more seasons, we're already understanding that there are some great ways to keep applying the documentary side to the ongoing adventure of colonisation and beyond.\"\n\nElon Musk has outlined his real-life plans for Mars colonisation in some detail. Though there is no firm timeline, he envisions a fully reusable transportation system that would take 80 days to get to Mars. His rocket and spaceship combination would stand 122 metres tall - bigger than the Apollo-era Saturn V rocket - and carry 100 people at a time.\n\nMusk has said he believes a Mars colony would need about a million people to make it self-sustaining - one of his ultimate hopes.\n\nImage copyright Dusan Martincek Image caption The colonists run a gamut of challenges as they strive to make humans an interplanetary species\n\nImage copyright NAtional Geographic Image caption The scientists have established a colony known as Olympus Town\n\nMr Howard said the series drew on some of the engineering ideas proposed by SpaceX, Nasa and other sources. \"The spaceniks can probably see it's its own style of hybrid. We didn't use any props from other movies, so we had to create everything. We did our own designs and for our production team, on a TV budget, it was probably like throwing together your own blueprint for going to Mars.\"\n\nSpeaking about the new series to a small group of journalists, Mr Howard explained why he thought space exploration had such enduring appeal: \"My fascination started as a boy witnessing the space race and all that was accomplished.\n\n\"It made the whole world feel like human beings were capable of so much more and there was so much to look forward to. So between the mystery of space and the drama and excitement and thrill of humankind's ability to explore it and actually experience it - it has just captured our imagination.\n\n\"One of the things I learned from working on Apollo 13 and interviewing so many of the astronauts who went on the Moon and walked on the Moon - they were so matter of fact about it.\"\n\nHe added: \"To them it was just proof it was possible to go, and that was the next horizon.

It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016.\n\nA key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia.\n\nVirginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic \"blue wave\".\n\nDemocratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine.

A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost.\n\nIn neighbouring Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested\n\nThe campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December.\n\nIn a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district.\n\nPolls also close in South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary.\n\nA Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause.\n\nAt 19:30, polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nWhat happened at 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT)\n\nThis was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate.

Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have high hopes in Pennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district.\n\nRepublican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (\u00a3107m).\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do American voters care about?\n\nPolls also closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Tennessee.\n\nIn Missouri, two-term Democratic Sen Claire McCaskill hopes to keep her seat against Republican Josh Hawley.\n\nFirst polls closed in Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, where Democrat Rashida Tlaib hopes to become the first Muslim woman in Congress, New Hampshire and South Dakota.\n\nAt 20:30, polls closed in Arkansas.\n\nWhat happened at 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT)\n\nPolls closed in Texas. One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher.\n\nThe race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades.\n\nHe's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely. It would suggest there's been a big swing to the Democrats nationwide if he gets over the line.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Apathy isn't the only reason why so many Americans don't vote\n\nPolls close in Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nIn Minnesota, Republican Rep Erik Paulsen faces a big challenge from Democrat Dean Phillips in the Twin Cities suburbs (3rd district). Mrs Clinton won in the area by nine points.\n\nYou're doing well if you're still keeping up. You might have the state of play now in the Senate and the House, but don't bet on it.\n\nWhat happened at 22:00 EST (03:00 GMT)\n\nPolls closed in Iowa, and a key race to watch is in Des Moines (3rd district), one of the areas that swung for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Mr Trump two years ago. Republican Rep David Young faces Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner.\n\nIn Nevada, Republican Sen Dean Heller faces Democrat Rep Jacky Rosen, and Democrats are optimistic about winning this seat.\n\nPolls also closed in Montana, and Utah. First polls close in Idaho and North Dakota.\n\nJon Tester's attempt to keep his Senate seat in Montana has irked the president personally - Mr Trump said he has never forgiven the Democratic senator for raising questions about his personal doctor, Ronny Jackson, when he was in the frame to be secretary of veterans' affairs.\n\n23:00 EST (04:00 GMT)\n\nWe've hit the west coast. If you don't know which party has had a good night so far, you've probably been napping.\n\nPolls close in California, and it will be interesting to see how traditionally Republican areas will vote. One of the key races is taking place in the 45th district, in Orange County. Mitt Romney won there in 2012 but Mrs Clinton was favoured here in the last election. Republican Rep Mimi Walters faces Democrat Katie Porter, a law professor.\n\nPolls also close in Oregon and Washington.\n\n00:00 EST (05:00 GMT)\n\nPolls close in Hawaii.

Hydropower only supplies approximately 6% of US electricity.\n\nDams are now being removed at a rate of more than one a week on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe problem, say the authors of this new paper, is that governments were blindsided by the prospect of cheap electricity without taking into account the full environmental and social costs of these installations.\n\nMore than 90% of dams built since the 1930s were more expensive than anticipated. They have damaged river ecology, displaced millions of people and have contributed to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases from the decomposition of flooded lands and forests.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Elwha river dam in Washington State was removed in 2011\n\n\"They make a rosy picture of the benefits, which are not fulfilled and the costs are ignored and passed on to society much later,\" lead author Prof Emilio Moran, from Michigan State University, told BBC News.\n\nHis report cites the example of two dams on the Madeira river in Brazil, which were finished only five years ago, and are predicted to produce only a fraction of the power expected because of climate change.\n\nIn the developing world, an estimated 3,700 dams, large and small, are now in various stages of development.\n\nThe authors say their big worry is that many of the bigger projects will do irreparable damage to the major rivers on which they are likely to be built.\n\nOn the Congo river, the Grand Inga project is expected to produce more than a third of the total electricity currently being generated in Africa.\n\nHowever, the new study points out that the main goal for the $80bn installation will be to provide electricity to industry.\n\n\"Over 90% of the energy from this project is going to go to South Africa for mining and the people in the Congo will not get that power,\" said Prof Moran.\n\n\"The people that I study in Brazil, the power line goes over their heads and goes 4,000km from the area and none of the energy is being given to them locally.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Hoover dam at Lake Mead in the US has seen water levels decline in recent years\n\n\"The nice goal of rural electrification has become completely subverted by large-scale interests who are pushing this technology, and governments are open to being convinced by them that this is the way to go.\"\n\nThe report points our that the large installations on these great rivers will destroy food sources, with 60 million people who live off the fisheries along the Mekong likely to be impacted with potential loss of livelihoods greater than $2bn. The authors also believe that dams will destroy thousands of species in these biodiversity hotspots.\n\nIn Brazil, which gets 67% of its electricity from hydropower, the response to reduced water capacity because of climate change is to build more dams.\n\nWith the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, a temporary halt to building new hydro projects is likely to be overturned. Plans for 60 new dams are already in place.\n\nThe authors say that with huge pressure on countries to press ahead with renewable energy developments, a mix of energy sources including hydro is the most sustainable approach.\n\n\"Large hydropower doesn't have a future, that is our blunt conclusion,\" said Prof Moran.\n\n\"To keep hydropower as part of the mix in the 21st Century we should combine multiple sources of renewable energy,\" said Prof Moran.\n\n\"There should be more investment in solar, wind and biomass, and hydro when appropriate - as long as we hold them to rigorous standards where the costs and benefits are truly transparent.\"\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Mark Hughes in action for Wales against Czechoslovakia in 1987\n\nMidfielder Matt Smith faces the prospect of playing three games in five days after being called up by Wales - but that seems almost trivial compared with the feat of the country's former striker Mark Hughes over 30 years ago.\n\nOn 11 November 1987 Hughes played matches for Wales and Bayern Munich in two countries on the same day.\n\nSo Smith being asked to play for FC Twente between Wales internationals against Denmark on 16 November and Albania on 20 November seems simple compared to the adventure of current Southampton boss Hughes.\n\nIt included a crucial European Championship qualifier against Czechoslovakia, a private jet flight across Europe, a dash in a Lada car and a German Cup second-round replay against Borussia Monchengladbach.\n\nHughes and Wales were hoping to qualify for the 1988 European Championship finals.\n\nThey lost 1-0 in Denmark the previous month - their first defeat of the campaign - and needed to win in Czechoslovakia to secure qualification for the following summer's finals in West Germany.\n\nThey faced a talented Czech side managed by the great Josef Masopust and which featured the likes of Ivo Knoflicek, a young Tomas Skuhravy and future West Ham United goalkeeper Ludek Miklosko.\n\nWales manager Mike England's preparations were far from ideal.\n\nIn the era before international breaks, the Football League would only sanction games to be postponed that involved England internationals, meaning the Wales boss spent an anxious weekend awaiting news of any injuries.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'They whisked me away in a souped-up Lada' - Mark Hughes recalls two games in one day\n\nSo while club versus country issues were all too common for Wales' beleaguered manager, the then 24-year-old Hughes managed to satisfy both parties on this occasion.\n\nHughes joined Bayern Munich early in November 1987 on a season-long loan from Barcelona, and the German giants' cup game at their Olympiastadion home was kicking off a few hours after Wales' game in Prague on Wednesday, 11 November.\n\nHughes recalled in a 1989 BBC Wales interview that the idea of playing in the two games was hatched by Bayern's colourful general manager Uli Hoeness, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1974.\n\n\"He knew I was playing for Wales on the Wednesday night, the same night as this big cup game,\" Hughes said.\n\n\"In passing he said 'what time is the game?'

Nobody has been convicted of the 17-year-old's murder.\n\n\"I'll never forget the moment I found out what had happened to Michael.\n\nI'm playing on my PlayStation 4, driving one of my favourite cars, when my mum comes in from work.\n\n'Did Daddy tell you what happened to Michael?' she asks me.\n\nI drop my controller on to the floor.\n\nI tell my mum I want to go to the place where it happened - where Michael was stabbed. I go to my room to get changed. I pick out a random tracksuit and slap on some trainers. Then someone comes to pick us up to take us to Betts Park.\n\nImage copyright Tristan Bejawn Image caption Jhemar near the spot where Michael died a year ago\n\nWe arrive at the park. I'm seeing the forensic team. I'm seeing my dad crying. I don't think I've seen my dad crying before.\n\nThe ambulance team say it isn't a normal knife that killed him. Even they look overwhelmed.\n\nIt doesn't feel real.\n\nI'm so angry - I want to find the people who did this. But then I think to myself, 'I'm not God, I'm not a parent, I didn't give life'.\n\nMichael and I hadn't spoken in a year. He'd faced his own problems, and I know he had a lot of anger.\n\nBut I also know he was leaving the negative things behind. He was working hard at college and trying to better himself.\n\nHe was studying engineering. I'm doing an aeronautical engineering course at college, so we could've buss mechanical jokes together.\n\nHe was the most loyal person I know. I think that's why I'm so loyal. He always had my back, no matter what.\n\nHe died on a Thursday, and I had a phone call organised with him on the following Sunday.\n\nThen we were going to see each other at Christmas. I was looking forward to playing PS4, catching up and hearing about how he was getting on.\n\nMe and Michael always used to play PlayStation games like GTA 5, and talk about the cars on them.\n\nWe were both keen to get our own cars. It was a regular conversation we would have with my dad. We'd speak about what cars we would get when we passed our driving test.\n\nWe're a family of transport gurus. My dad's a bus driver, and I've always dreamed of being a pilot.\n\nRecently, I went to look at cars with Jerome, my younger brother. We went to different showrooms across London. It was upsetting that Michael wasn't there with us.\n\nYou know what the worst thing about this is? It's that I didn't get to speak to Michael before it happened.\n\nIf I could speak to him now, I'd ask him what he was planning to do with his life.\n\nImage copyright Tristan Bejawn\n\nI think if I'd spoken to him before he was taken from us, I'd feel more at peace.\n\nRight now, London is a shambles. You've got loose-headed teenagers running around with knives and guns, thinking it's normal. But you can't always blame them, cause they're products of their environment.\n\nI'm only 16, but I know someone who has had a gun held to their head. I know of someone who was kidnapped. I know about a guy who was stabbed 23 times because of where he lived.\n\nEvery day when I leave my front door, I think about how I might not make it home.\n\nHow crazy is that?\n\nRecently I was sat in my front room and I heard a gun sound outside - it went \"ch-ch-BOW!\" - and two more shots followed.\n\nAnd you know what? It didn't even surprise me. I thought, 'Rah, when did hearing gunfire become normal in my head?' Then I found out the person who had been shot was someone I had played football with a few days before.\n\nAnother time I went shopping with Jerome to buy our mum something for Mother's Day. We saw someone pull out a samurai sword in the middle of the road and chase after someone else, who managed to get away.\n\nMy 13-year-old brother and I nearly witnessed a murder right in front of us.\n\nImage copyright Tristan Bejawn Image caption Jhemar at the BMX track - one of his passions\n\nWhen I speak to youngers - such as the boys I mentor - I tell them they shouldn't have a knife.\n\nI ask them why they feel the need to carry a knife. It makes them think harder about their actions. I say to them, 'You know you can use your hands and feet to defend yourself?'\n\nAnd I tell them that if the other person has a knife, 'Run'.\n\nRunning is actually smart, you know. And carrying a knife doesn't make you a big man - it really doesn't.\n\nAt the end of the day, when someone is stabbed, it doesn't just harm them, it also harms their family, their community.\n\nThe 'postcode wars' are getting worse, and messing it up for everyone. If you're a young person in London and you wear a tracksuit, you can't just roam around the area you've grown up in anymore.\n\nI was robbed last year, not far from where I live. I handed my phone over because I didn't know if they had a weapon on them. I don't think they even wanted the phone, it was just to make a statement.\n\nThese were Jhemar's own words - as told to his mentor Ciaran Thapar.\n\n\"As a youth worker, I have met many strong, resilient young men and women who overcome the barrier of normalised violence in their social environment,\" says Thapar.\n\n\"Jhemar is one of these people - despite everything, he remains positive about his future, and determined to contribute to his community and wider society.\"\n\nBut voices like his are rarely heard. \"Usually the focus is on violent crimes, perpetrators and direct victims, rather than the perspectives of those who rise above the trappings of inner-city life,\" says Thapar.\n\nSome boys do stupid stuff, just for their reputation.\n\nThe thing is, society tells you that you need money. Social media, music, films, advertising - they say you need money, you need to buy things. Money is the motive.\n\nSo why are adults so confused when some yute is drug-dealing? He's got no money, his mum's broke, his dad's broke, maybe his parents ain't even there, and maybe the kid is paying the bills.\n\nThen you've got the idiots that choose that lifestyle.\n\nWhat are they doing?\n\nIf you have food on the table and a loving family and you still wanna sell drugs and do violence, then your screws have fallen out, fam.\n\nAlso, when we get stop-and-searched by police, it can create more tension.\n\nNot long ago, I was walking through Clapham where I went to school, and two police cars came down the road towards me and stopped. Five officers got out. One of them grabbed my bag and demanded I open it. So I asked him calmly and politely to please take his hand off my bag. He did, and I showed him that I only had school folders and a tub of Vaseline inside.\n\nImage copyright Tristan Bejawn Image caption Jhemar and his father Michael Jonas\n\nWhy did they need so many grown men to speak to me, a teenager? Why did the policeman feel like he could put his hands on me like that? Is he my dad?\n\nI've learned to communicate in those situations. But not everyone is capable of that. It makes you feel violated and some people lose their temper.\n\nAt the same time, people always complain about police, and that's not good either. It's frowned upon in my community to join the police force, and that's just as bad.\n\nWe need better relationships with police to make things safer.\n\nEveryone says that in London there are all these opportunities for young people. It's true. But they don't realise that opportunities aren't available for teenagers who need the most attention.\n\nI don't mean a 'shove-police-sirens-in-their-face' type of attention.\n\nI mean appropriate care that will mould their character - like having a mentor or counsellor they can speak to.\n\nBoys and girls need help to find something they are passionate about, something creative to keep them active, because school doesn't work for everyone.\n\nMe? I try not to be a product of my environment. I keep myself to myself. I stay busy.\n\nI've always had the support of those around me - family members, mentors, teachers. I'm thankful for that.\n\nI've got church. I enjoy making music. I do all kinds of sports. I'll take myself off to the swimming pool, or the BMX track. When I'm riding, I'm taking in that fresh air, applying myself and concentrating.\n\nI'm on the youth board for the Mayor's Fund For London. When we meet, we think of ideas for helping young people.\n\nIn January, I went to Parliament to a discussion with MPs about how to stop knife crime. It was hella mad sitting in one of those committee rooms with the high ceilings! It made me feel like I was a step closer to helping the world.\n\nI've started college this year.

Have you ever questioned why children sit down to learn? Originating from Victorian times, pupils sat at desks formed in rows. In most modern day schools, little has changed.\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nPhysically active learning involves fusing movement with traditional learning activities. While a common approach in reception classes, in most schools, seated learning dominates from Year One. Yet, physically active learning is suitable for all ages and can take a variety of forms. So what are the benefits?\n\nImproved focus\n\nLogic would suggest that introducing physical activity into the learning experience may disrupt children and negatively impact their learning. Yet, combining movement and learning improves behaviour and focus in the classroom.\n\nPerforming as little as four minutes of exercise in the classroom setting can improve a child's behaviour and increase their focus for the following lesson. International research found that after three years of physically active learning, pupils were still more attentive following the activity.\n\nImproved academic performance\n\nAfter one active lesson, a child can improve their Maths performance by as much as 16%. Research from around the globe supports the use of physically active learning over longer periods of time. If your child learns in an active way, after two years, they could be four months ahead in maths and spelling compared to traditional seated classroom learning.\n\nMore active\n\nChildren move more when learning in an active way. In a 45-minute lesson, physically active learning can contribute an additional nine minutes more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, when compared to a seated classroom lesson. What's more, this contributes nearly one third of the in-school 30-minute recommendation. Not only can increased physical activity benefit academic performance and physical health, it can also improve mental health.\n\nImplementing change\n\nPopular classroom-based approaches include active learning videos such as Super Movers, answering the register by performing a particular movement and learning challenges placed on boards in different corners. Outside of the classroom, active spelling relays or number challenges in the playground aid the learning of the core National Curriculum subjects. Beyond more formal learning opportunities, exploring fields and woodlands provides a fantastic way to combine movement with learning outside.\n\nThe benefits of physical active learning are recognised at the highest level. Recently, the National Association of Head Teachers passed a motion to encourage all schools to adopt physically active learning. Is your local school involved?\n\nSuper Movers aims to get children moving throughout the day with lots of free, easy-to-use video resources and great football-inspired incentives like a visit from the Premier League Trophy. Brain Booster routines star famous faces and cover key areas of Numeracy and Literacy. They can be used in the classroom or at home to help children feel refreshed and energised whilst learning.

Iran denied being behind that attack.\n\nThe US has also accused Iran of direct involvement in plotting or carrying out attacks - from bombings to assassinations.\n\nAccording to a report by the US State Department, since 2012, Iran has spent $16bn on proxy groups in the region as well as support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIran accepts neither the US allegations, nor its designation as an exporter of terror.\n\nWhat could the sanctions' impact be?\n\nThe US reinstated a raft of sanctions in August, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant.\n\nMore than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iran gripped by despair as country faces economic turmoil, drought\n\nThe Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments has confirmed it will cut off links with some Iranian banks, isolating Iran from the international financial system.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration has granted temporary exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil - China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.\n\nThis is significant as China and India are among Iran's largest trading partners.\n\nEven before the US sanctions were reimposed, Iran's economy had had a difficult year, with its currency, the rial, plummeting against the dollar, driving up the price of basic goods.\n\nMr Trump's national security adviser John Bolton announced on Monday that even more measures could follow soon.\n\nHardliners smell blood but Rouhani is safe for now\n\nBy Kasra Naji, Special Correspondent, BBC Persian\n\nThe sweeping US sanctions will be debilitating to the government's day-to-day running of the country.\n\nThey will also be disastrous for ordinary people who are already reeling under the weight of rising prices, shortages, and the rapidly falling value of the rial.\n\nAll this will put President Rouhani under considerable strain.\n\nIran's hardliners see a chance to force a change of government, arguing extraordinary conditions require extraordinary solutions.\n\nBut the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not so sure. Taking on the running of the country under these conditions could be a poisoned chalice for him and for the hardliners he supports.\n\nHow do other countries see the sanctions?\n\nThe UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all promised to support European firms that do \"legitimate business\" with Iran.\n\nThey have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties.\n\nHowever, analysts doubt this will lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran, given the importance of the US to global trade.\n\nMr Pompeo said more than 100 international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions.\n\nAnd even if firms can use the SPV, any US company it does business with could face punishment.\n\nAnother signatory to the nuclear deal, China, has said it regrets the re-imposition of sanctions and that its lawful trade with Iran should be respected.\n\nIsrael - Iran's long-time foe in the Middle East - called the move a \"courageous, determined and important decision\".", "Media playback is not supported on this device George North bursts through to score opening try\n\nAutumn Test: Scotland v Fiji Venue: Murrayfield, Edinburgh Date: Saturday, 10 November Kick-off: 14:30 GMT Coverage: Watch on BBC One, listen on BBC Radio Scotland, text commentary on the BBC Sport website\n\nFiji's \"whole team is dangerous\", says prop WP Nel as Scotland look to get their autumn series on track.\n\nGregor Townsend's side lost 21-10 to Wales in Cardiff on Saturday and host Fiji in the first of three Murrayfield internationals in November.\n\nIt will be Fiji's first visit to Edinburgh in nine years and they were victors when the sides last met in Suva in 2017.\n\n\"It's definitely not a team where it's just going to happen,\" said Nel.\n\n\"We need to be at our best on Saturday.\n\n\"Their whole team is dangerous, they are all good ball players and if I take it two years back when we played them, even their set-pieces are very good.

We could definitely be a bit better in that area.\n\n\"We functioned well as a line-out and I thought we stopped their line-out drive really well, so that was a plus from us. The scrum was a bit mixed; on our ball it was pretty good, gaining two penalties. On their ball it wasn't as good, conceding two penalties, so it was a bit of a mixed bag.\n\n\"Fiji have some fantastic and extremely dangerous individual rugby players, some of the biggest men you'll see on a rugby field as well.

John McDonnell tells Newsnight a temporary customs arrangement with the EU would be 'the worst of all worlds'\n\nLabour would vote against a government plan designed to resolve the impasse in the Brexit negotiations on Northern Ireland, the shadow chancellor said.\n\nJohn McDonnell has told Newsnight that Labour would reject any customs arrangement with the EU unless it was established on a permanent basis.\n\nTheresa May hopes to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland through a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement.\n\nMrs May plans to have an agreement with EU leaders by the end of this month.\n\nSuch a move from Labour would raise the chances of Parliament rejecting her withdrawal agreement.\n\nIt is understood the prime minister believes that an agreement with EU leaders needs to be reached no later than the final week of November to allow it to pass parliamentary hurdles in Westminster and Strasbourg.\n\nThat means a deal needs to be agreed with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier by around 21 November to give the EU a week to prepare for an emergency summit of EU leaders.\n\nMrs May is due to brief the cabinet on Brexit on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe prime minister's customs arrangement is known informally in No 10 as a customs union.\n\nDowning Street is facing calls from ministers for the UK to be allowed to end it unilaterally, a demand that has been rejected by the EU and Dublin.\n\nThe No 10 initiative for an all-UK customs arrangement is designed to replace an EU proposal to create separate customs territories for Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The prime minister has rejected this on the grounds that it would lead to an internal UK border down the Irish Sea.\n\nAsked by Newsnight whether Labour could vote for a deal in which the whole of the UK was placed in a customs union with the EU for a temporary period, Mr McDonnell said: \"I can't see it because I think it would be the worst of all worlds. What I'm getting from business leaders, trade union leaders and others is they want permanence, they want stability.\"\n\n'Let us negotiate'\n\nLabour, which has advocated UK membership of a customs union for the past year, has said that it would vote down the prime minister's Brexit deal unless it passes six tests set by the party.\n\nThese include delivering the \"exact same benefits\" as the UK enjoys as a member of the single market and the customs union.\n\nThe shadow chancellor's remarks to Newsnight show that he wants permanent membership of a customs union to apply in all circumstances. This includes what is intended by No 10 to be a temporary \"backstop\" period after the end of the transition period in December 2020, if a future trading relationship has not been finalised by then.\n\n\"If the government says 'well a customs union for a couple of years or maybe customs union until we decide there won't be one,' well actually, that doesn't give the stability for investment for anyone,\" McDonnell said.\n\n\"What I'm worried about is Theresa May comes back from Europe waving a piece of paper - and it won't be Winston Churchill, it'll be more like Neville Chamberlain. What we'll see is peace in our time that will then disintegrate over time.\n\n\"I'd rather she just came back and told us. If she can get a deal that protects jobs and the economy we'll vote for it, but it can't be half in half out.\n\n\"If she can't deliver, we can't vote for it - move to one side and let us do the negotiations.\"\n\nThe shadow chancellor indicated that if Parliament rejects a Brexit deal proposed by Theresa May, the EU might be prepared to renegotiate with a new UK government.\n\nLabour believes that if Parliament votes down a Brexit deal a general election should be held.\n\n\"All the messages that we get back over this whole period is that our European partners desperately want what we want: a deal that will protect their jobs and their economies in the same way that we want to,\" he said.\n\n\"If they recognise the deal is unacceptable to Parliament I think that opens up a vista of the opportunity of real negotiations... In the EU you negotiate on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect. You don't negotiate on the basis of banging on the table, threatening to walk out every five minutes.\"\n\nWatch the full interview on Newsnight on Monday, 22:30 on BBC Two or online.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "A senior Turkish official has told the BBC that Saudi experts visited Istanbul consulate after journalist's death.

His abuse lasted nearly three years.\n\nImage caption Andrew Gray with his sister Michelle\n\nTorbett's methods in grooming and abusing Andrew bore an eerie similarity to those he deployed with Kenny Campbell - \"trumped up\" awards for playing, currying favour and trust with his family, and attacks in Torbett's car, flat and workplace.\n\nA month after the documentary was broadcast, the BBC tracked Torbett down to California and put Andrew and Kenny's claims to him in a dramatic confrontation, in which another former Celtic Boys Club player, William Gilbert, attempted to stop us from filming.\n\nMr Gilbert accompanied Torbett every day during the trial.\n\nImage caption The BBC tracked down Jim Torbett to California\n\nImage caption William Gilbert, who was with Mr Torbett throughout the trial, attempted to stop us filming in California\n\nIt is not clear whether Torbett lied about his previous conviction in order to obtain entry to the US, but within hours of the confrontation being broadcast, US Homeland Security visited Torbett and escorted him to the airport.\n\nHe was picked up on arrival in the UK by Scottish police and was arrested and charged with abusing several boys, including Kenny and Andrew.\n\nThe Background: Free to Abuse Again\n\nTorbett had two stints at the Boys Club, the first from 1966 to 1974.\n\nHe returned to the Boys Club in about 1978 and stayed until a series of Daily Record stories revealed abuse claims against him in 1996.\n\nHe was jailed for two years in 1998 for abusing three former Celtic Boys Club players, including former Scotland international Alan Brazil, between 1967 and 1974.\n\nFormer Boys Club chairman Hugh Birt told the trial Torbett's first spell had ended in 1974 because he was kicked out by its then honorary president Jock Stein, after allegations of child abuse emerged. The police were never called.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to three additional sources close to the events in 1974 who support Birt's version of events.\n\nBut the \"official\" version of Torbett's departure can be found in the archives of the Celtic View, the sanctioned, in-house magazine for Celtic FC.\n\nImage caption The Celtic View magazine marked Torbett's exit in 1974 with a piece praising his success\n\nImage caption An extract from the Celtic View article in 1974\n\nDated November 1974, the report is headlined: \"Jim bows out\u2026after another season of glory.\"\n\nIt states that Torbett was leaving for his own personal and business reasons and is a glowing tribute to his time at the Boys Club.\n\nThe then editor Jack McGinn told the BBC last year that all stories published in the magazine were done so in good faith, and denies allowing a false article to be published.\n\nImage caption Jim Torbett was jailed in 1998 for crimes leading up to 1974\n\nIn 1998, Torbett was jailed for his crimes leading up to 1974. No allegations had been made about his second stint, until last year.\n\nBut if Torbett was kicked out in 1974 for abuse claims, why was he allowed to return to the club, free to abuse again?\n\nHugh Birt, who died five years ago, told the court in 1998 that he attempted to prevent Torbett returning to the Boys Club and raised the issue with Celtic board members, including Kevin Kelly, the son of former chairman Robert Kelly.\n\nImage caption Celtic director Kevin Kelly (pictured) said he was unaware of Torbett's prior offending\n\nTwo other sources told the BBC that when Torbett was allowed to return to the Boys Club in the late 1970s, Kevin Kelly would have been aware of the previous claims of abuse against Torbett.\n\nMr Kelly and Jack McGinn, a Celtic FC director from 1981, worked with Mr Torbett at his Trophy Centre business from 1986 and 1998 respectively.\n\nTheir associations with the company continued long after Torbett was jailed in 1998 for abuse.\n\nImage caption Jack McGinn also denied knowing about the allegation about Jim Torbett\n\nMr Kelly strongly denies being aware of allegations concerning Torbett when he returned to the Boys Club, and told the BBC that he was not aware of any previous allegations against Torbett until his court case in the 1990s.\n\nJack McGinn also denies any previous knowledge of Mr Torbett's offending prior to his second spell at the Boys Club.\n\nBoth Mr Kelly and Mr McGinn said that if they had been aware of Mr Torbett's prior offending, they would have done all they could to prevent him returning to Celtic Boys Club.\n\nBut it seems clear that had Jim Torbett been prevented from returning to the Boys Club, Kenny Campbell and Andrew Gray would not have been subjected to the grooming and sexual abuse which formed the biggest part of this trial.\n\nThe Trial\n\nImage caption Kenny Campbell got to face Torbett in court\n\nThe trial lasted more than two weeks and featured evidence from four men who said they were abused by Torbett, although the Crown withdrew the charges relating to one of those men.\n\nKenny Campbell was the first witness to take the stand. Because of his previous association with the BBC, Torbett's defence sought to have the two BBC journalists involved in the programme banned from the courtroom for his evidence. The motion was repelled by Judge Beckett.\n\nIn two days of emotionally fraught evidence, Kenny described how Torbett had first groomed then abused him. When asked if he could see his abuser in the courtroom, he pointed towards the man in the dock - his former mentor, Jim Torbett.\n\nKenny got his wish and faced his abuser in court, but Andrew Gray did not get that opportunity.\n\nAndrew, who would have been 43, had suffered from mental health problems since he was a teenager.\n\nAhead of the trial he had gone to visit his best friend in Australia for a few weeks to alleviate the pressure, but broke his neck in a freak swimming pool accident.\n\nImage caption Andrew Gray's sister Michelle promised to tell his story after his death\n\nHis sister Michelle Gray travelled to his bedside while he was on life support.\n\nShe recalled: \"He had said, please get me out of here and get me back to Scotland as soon as you possibly can, words to this effect, so that I can make sure Torbett gets put away for the rest of his life.\n\n\"And there was a communication made between [us] where we basically [said] if he didn't make it, that I would come back to Scotland and make sure people heard his story and do all I possibly can to make sure that Jim Torbett was convicted of the crimes that he committed and make sure this never happens again to any other football-mad child.\"\n\nAndrew died 16 days later after his family took the decision to switch off his life support machine. Michelle was at his side.\n\nShe added: \"It's really important that we go\u2026 and we get justice for him because he's not here.\n\n\"We'll never hear his voice again. We'll never be able to embrace him. We'll never be able to tell him how much he's loved but we can do this for him.\n\n\"I would like [Tobett] to know the pain and suffering that he caused Andrew.\n\n\"I would like him to also know that he destroyed his life and he is indirectly responsible for his death, that the course of actions that took place over the last 25/30 years and more so the last 18 months would never have happened if he had not done what he done to my brother.\"\n\nDuring the trial Kenny and Andrew were described as liars and fantasists by Torbett, who produced as a defence witness William Gilbert, the man who tried to shield him during our confrontation in California.\n\nMr Gilbert had accompanied Torbett every day during this trial. When it was his turn to give evidence, his answers, according to the advocate depute, seemed \"rehearsed\".\n\nThis jury, rightly, did not get to hear about Torbett's previous conviction. But when they were sent to consider their verdict on Monday, they had to decide whether Andrew, Kenny and another man had told the truth about what they said their football manager - a man who had been entrusted with their care - had done to them as children.\n\nThe jury decided that they had.\n\n'Separate and distinct'\n\nCeltic FC told the BBC last year the Boys Club was a \"separate and distinct\" organisation.\n\nThe two clubs are separate legal entities, but decades of Celtic View magazines, and never before seen footage obtained by BBC Scotland, shows how the two clubs were intertwined.\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Jim Torbett, with Jock Stein sitting in front, from a boys club event in about 1973\n\nImage caption Celtic legends Jock Stein and Billy McNeil handing out awards at a Celtic Boys Club prize-giving in 1973\n\nCeltic legends Jock Stein and Billy McNeil are filmed handing out awards at a Celtic Boys Club prize-giving in about 1973, while Torbett looks on.\n\nThe distinction, though correct legally, rings hollow to the survivors of Torbett's abuse.\n\nKenny Campbell said he felt hurt and angry at Celtic's statement last year.\n\nHe said: \"It made me really, really angry to be honest with you.

I am so optimistic.\"\n\nTottenham trailed to Luuk de Jong's towering header, powered past goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga, in for suspended Hugo Lloris, after 61 seconds.\n\nThey were then frustrated by a superb display from PSV keeper Jeroen Zoet, who kept them at bay with a mixture of brilliance and good fortune, utilising all parts of his body to make a succession of crucial saves.\n\nAnd then, with time running out Kane, as so often before, came to their rescue, leaving their fate in their own hands but with tough tasks to come in their final two games.\n\nThe England striker brought the disgruntled home fans alive with a low shot that finally broke the defiant resistance of Zoet - then fashioned a victory that looked unlikely for such a long time when his close-range header was deflected past Zoet by substitute Trent Sainsbury with one minute left.\n\nKane the hero once again\n\nTottenham's second goal took a heavy deflection off Trent Sainsbury\n\nSpurs may still be outsiders to make progress from Group B - they may need to win both their remaining fixtures - but it is thanks to their captain fantastic Kane that they are still in a position to navigate a route through to the knockout phase of the Champions League.\n\nThis was a tough, attritional night for Spurs, who were nowhere near their best and confronted by opponents in the Dutch champions who got exactly what they wanted with that early goal and set about protecting it as if their lives depended on it.\n\nPochettino's side were off colour and even the hugely popular manager felt the fury of the home gallery when his decision to substitute the dangerous Lucas Moura with Erik Lamela was greeted by loud jeering around Wembley.\n\nIt was approaching crisis time for Spurs as PSV held out but once again it was Kane who was their man of the moment, shrugging off what had been a sluggish personal performance up to that point to ensure he was the architect of what may yet prove to be a crucial win.\n\nKane was the predator in the box for the first and then produced the header that took that vital deflection off Sainsbury to end what had been a night of frustration in sheer elation. It also ended PSV's hopes of qualification.\n\nA word of praise, too, for keeper Gazzaniga, given the vote over Michel Vorm in Lloris's absence. He produced crucial saves when needed and certainly played his part in keeping Spurs in the hunt for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nSpurs must improve to survive\n\nSpurs and their fans greeted the final whistle with a mixture of elation and relief as they fashioned a turnaround that was starting to look increasingly unlikely to revive their fading Champions League aspirations.\n\nPochettino and his players know, however, that they simply must move their game on to another level if they are to get the results they need at home to Inter Milan and then that most daunting of tasks, away to Barcelona, to go through into the knockout stage.\n\nIt will be far from easy, but Spurs have matters in their own hands. If they beat Inter next time out by two goals - or a scoreline better than 2-1 - they will go into their trip to Spain knowing they need to match Inter's result at home to PSV to progress.\n\nThis was a victory that was a tribute to persistence rather than high quality in a Wembley atmosphere subdued by the struggles, for much of the time, of the home team and the swathes of empty red seats in a crowd of 46,588 that was down on the night's capacity of 51,000 and meant barely half the seating was used.\n\nWembley has been a somewhat eerie place for Spurs in their past two games, against Manchester City in the Premier League and for this game but their difficulties in the Champions League have been very much of their own making.\n\nLate goals away to Inter and PSV cast aside winning positions that would have made their lives so much easier.\n\nThe good news for Pochettino and Spurs is that they are still in with a fighting chance but Wembley must be a cauldron against Inter and they simply to have to find other gears if they are to make the most of this late reprieve.\n\nWembley pitch not perfect\n\nWembley's playing surface - such a talking point for the home defeat by Manchester City - at least looked better. The pitch did not appear as cut up and the NFL markings, visible when they played City just a day after the Jacksonville Jaguars v Philadelphia Eagles clash, had been removed.\n\nThis was not, however, a game that flowed and the battle-hardened PSV coach Mark van Bommel demonstrated a colourful command of English to describe its condition in very straightforward terms.\n\nVan Bommel said his players were complaining after training at Wembley, although the pain of this late defeat may have coloured his view.\n\nSpurs will not be complaining - but they will hope it is soon back in peak condition, especially for the pivotal last home Champions League group game against Inter Milan.\n\nMan of the match - Harry Kane (Tottenham)\n\nWhat they said\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"The team deserved the victory. We won and suffered a lot. It was a massive effort so I was pleased. We played a lot in eight days. Now we need to try to recover for Saturday [at Crystal Palace].\n\n\"The team is growing up. We have the character of never giving up, which is so important.\"\n\nPSV Eindhoven manager Mark van Bommel: \"We fought like lions. After one minute we got a goal and we tried to defend it until the end.\n\n\"It's a very difficult group. We played four games and three times we've been leading. Our fans were behind us for the entire match; they were the only ones I could hear singing.

However, it has remained fairly static since 2010.\n\nAlmost two-thirds (61%) of England's adult population is either overweight or obese, according to NHS England, as classified by their Body Mass Index (BMI). That's up from 53% in 1993.\n\nBMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height.\n\nFive-a-day\n\nSince 2003, the government has been urging people to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nNHS England's own figures show that the percentage of the adult population reaching the target hit a 30% peak in 2006, when the message was still fairly fresh.\n\nSince then, it's declined to 26%.\n\nThis is still a little above the 24% level measured before the five-a-day target was introduced.\n\nBy international standards, the UK ranks reasonably well. Out of the 34 countries that are members of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), the UK has the eighth highest proportion of the population eating at least one portion of fruit per day (63%) - compared to the OECD average of 57%.\n\nStill, about three out of four members of the public still aren't getting five portions of fruit and vegetables - which the NHS recommends on advice from the World Health Organization.\n\n150 minutes a week\n\nThe World Health Organization says adults aged 18 to 64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week.\n\nSince 2011, the NHS in England has been promoting this message. So, are more of us doing what we're meant to?\n\nThe latest Health Survey for England, for 2016, shows 66% of men aged 19 and over are meeting the guidelines - unchanged since 2012.\n\nFor women of the same age, the figure was 58% - up from 56% in 2012.\n\nSmoking\n\nSuccessive governments have campaigned to reduce smoking, with the NHS's Smokefree campaign offering advice and support to people trying to give up.\n\nThe Labour government banned smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces in England in 2007.\n\nThe result is a marked decrease in the number of smokers.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, 16.4% of adults currently smoke, compared with 19.9% five years ago.\n\nHealth warning\n\nIt is very difficult to directly link the perceived success or failure of public health campaigns with outcomes, because there are many different factors at play.\n\nChanges in law, habits and tastes may all contribute to changes in attitude which may affect lifestyle choices. For example, some of the decline in smoking could be attributed as much to the rise of the e-cigarette as anything else.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Image copyright Alan Simpson\n\nA pedestrian who was being treated in hospital after being hit by a cement mixer in Edinburgh has died.\n\nThe 88-year-old woman was knocked down by the truck at about 13:15 on Friday in Great Junction Street.\n\nShe was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary by ambulance but died on Monday.\n\nThe road was closed for about three hours for an investigation.

Belichick pulled off another masterstroke by deploying Cordarrelle Patterson in an unfamiliar running back role, which reaped rewards with 61 yards and touchdown.\n\nThe major disappointment is Rodgers and Brady have only met twice. A third meeting could only happen this season in the Super Bowl, and with the Packers struggling at 3-4-1 that looks hugely doubtful.\n\n\"If you play long enough, and you have the sustained greatness that Tom has had, there's going to be a lot of records,\" Rodgers said of Brady. \"He's been the gold-standard at quarterback for two decades.\"\n\nNFL week nine: Saints end Rams' unbeaten run\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Hekker denied fake field goal success\n\nThe New Orleans Saints won their seventh game in a row and ended the only unbeaten record left in the NFL with a pulsating 45-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams at a deafening Superdome.\n\nDrew Brees piled up 346 yards and four touchdowns as the Saints held off a ferocious fightback from the Rams, who climbed off the floor when trailing by 21 points just before half-time to level at 35-35 in the fourth quarter.\n\nNew Orleans hit back again, though, and a 72-yard touchdown from Michael Thomas, who had a monster game for the Saints, gave his side the victory as they showed themselves to be genuine Super Bowl contenders.\n\nBoth sides excelled with some exquisite attacking play as the game lived up to the huge pre-game hype, and this could be the NFC title match come January.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs remain on a roll, with Patrick Mahomes enjoying the best start to a quarterback career ever with three more touchdowns in a comprehensive 37-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns.\n\nMahomes now has 29 touchdowns for the season, and running back and Cleveland native Kareem Hunt enjoyed his return home with a hat-trick of touchdowns in another high-powered attacking performance from the 7-2 Chiefs, who average a whopping 36 points every game.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Carolina Panthers' Curtis Samuel takes a double reverse into the end zone\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers are unlucky to be in the same division as the Chiefs, but they look a serious AFC wildcard challenger after moving to 6-2 for the season by earning a fine 25-17 victory on one of the toughest road trips there is - at the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers gained revenge on bitter rivals the Baltimore Ravens as they responded to defeat earlier in the season with a 23-16 victory that really puts the home side under pressure in the AFC North play-off race.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers are becoming a real force, and they scored a team record 35 first-half points during a 42-28 success over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to earn their fifth win in six games.\n\nCam Newton's Panthers are now standing at 6-2 and look at least good enough for a wildcard spot while they're still in touch with the New Orleans Saints in the NFC South.\n\nA ferocious Minnesota Vikings defence is finding its feet again and they had a team record 10 sacks as Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford endured a miserable night during a comprehensive 24-9 victory for the Vikings.\n\nMinnesota is now on 5-3-1 just behind the 5-3 Chicago Bears after they enjoyed a thumping 41-9 victory over the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhat's left in week nine?\n\nTennessee Titans @ Dallas Cowboys (01:15 GMT)\n\nBoth teams are struggling for form after losing their last games to slip to 3-4 so far this season, so both will be desperate to even out their records with a win in this prime-time match-up in Texas.\n\nThe teams have also had a bye week off to try and figure out a way forward - Dallas have brought in wide receiver Amari Cooper from Oakland but they'll still be looking at star running back Ezekiel Elliott to do the damage against Tennessee's stout defence.\n\nStats of the week\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Minnesota Vikings sack Matthew Stafford 10 times for new franchise record\n\nPatrick Mahomes has had the best first 10 games of any quarterback ever in the NFL, with the Kansas City star throwing 29 touchdowns and 3,185 passing yards.\n\nThe Vikings defence had a team record 10 sacks on Matthew Stafford - who'd previously only suffered as many as seven sacks in a single game.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger threw a touchdown pass, ran in a touchdown and also kicked a punt during their win in Baltimore - that's the first time a player has done all three since John Elway in 1989.\n\nMiami Dolphins running back Frank Gore moved up into sixth place in the NFL's all-time rushing yards list as he moved above Hall of Famer Barry Sanders.\n\nNew Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara became just the second player aged 23 or under to score three touchdowns in three separate games in a single season.\n\nSaints receiver Michael Thomas also had a huge game with a team-record 211 receiving yards against the Rams.\n\nThe Houston Texans are in great form after winning six in a row following an 0-3 start.

It sounds like he pulled himself out,\" Gase said. \"So I've just got to find out kind of what happened there.\"\n\nBrady the GOAT\n\nIt's been a major subject of discussion in the NFL for years now but Tom Brady may just be the best player the league has ever seen, let alone the best quarterback.\n\nBrady beat the pretenders to his throne in Aaron Rodgers on Sunday, it what was billed as a 'Battle of the GOATs' (that's Greatest Of All Time). Packers QB Rodgers only has one Super Bowl to his name but has a much loftier reputation in terms of talent, but he was unable to mastermind a win in New England.\n\nBrady may not be the perfect physical specimen, but he's still operating at a high level at the age of 41, and he has the one talent that all quarterbacks would love - and that's the ability to win games. It's not always perfect, it's not always pretty, but Brady gets the job done - there's surely no more argument about who the real GOAT is in the NFL is there?", "South Africa coach Stuart Baxter\n\nSouth Africa coach Stuart Baxter handed a surprise recall to midfielder Thulani Serero as he named his squad for this month's key Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria.\n\nSerero is included despite the Vitesse Arnhem star telling Baxter last year he would not travel for Bafana Bafana matches unless guaranteed a starting berth.\n\n\"The sofa in Arnhem is more comfortable than the South African bench.

O'Dea hit the Motherwell bar with a header and, more to the point, used his experience to solidify the Dundee backline.\n\nDerby County manager Frank Lampard needed a bit of persuading to allow his 21-year-old left-back to leave on loan. The Aberdeen fans are starting to understand his reluctance to let Lowe go to Pittodrie. A powerful and quick presence down the left and his talents were on show again at Rugby Park.\n\nMidfielders - Drey Wright, Lewis Ferguson, David Turnbull, Callum McGregor\n\nFormer Colchester winger Wright has added an extra dimension to Saints' attacking play. But he's also willing to track back and take on defensive duties when required. Wright was the best player on the pitch as the Perth team made it four wins on the bounce by clinching a late victory at Easter Road.\n\nI did say when teenager Ferguson left Hamilton after only 15 first-team appearances that he would make an immediate impact at Aberdeen. He's done just that. Ferguson is consistently one of the Dons' best players and on successive Sundays has scored the goals which took the team to the League Cup final then won them three crucial Premiership points.\n\nMotherwell have a history of producing young talents who flourish in the first team, and Turnbull is already looking like the next to shine. The 19-year-old midfielder enjoyed scoring his first top team goal against St Mirren on Wednesday. So much so, he hammered home another one against Dundee three days later. It was the sweetest of strikes from 30 yards out.\n\nMcGregor has always been a neat footballer who can play in a variety of positions but he's currently revelling in a deeper midfield role with Scott Brown and Olivier Ntcham missing. The Scotland international moves the ball quickly, enjoys pulling the strings and his influence in the Celtic team is growing game-by-game.\n\nWinger Jones was unlucky to end up on the losing side against Aberdeen. The Northern Ireland international never stops running with the ball and is a constant attacking threat for Killie.\n\nAttackers - James Forrest, Odsonne Eduouard\n\nCould Forrest be the answer to Scotland's striking shortage for the crucial upcoming Nations League double header? It's not the ideal solution but he's played the position before for Celtic and his goal against Hearts on Saturday was his ninth of the season.\n\nWith little room and minimal backlift, Edouard unleashed a stunning strike at Celtic Park on Saturday which clipped the underside of the crossbar on its way past Hearts keeper Zdenek Zlamal. A close-range finish gave the French youngster a double on the day, seven goals in seven games and 11 for the season so far.", "Richard Johnson retired from first-class cricket in 2007 after taking 528 wickets at an average of 28.58\n\nSurrey have appointed Richard Johnson as assistant coach after the former England bowler was released from his contract at Middlesex.\n\nThe 43-year-old has agreed a three-year deal at The Oval and will focus on supporting the club's bowling attack.\n\nJohnson, who played three Tests and 10 one-day internationals in 2003, joined Middlesex's coaching staff in 2010 and had 14 months left on his contract.\n\n\"This is an excellent chance to be part of something exciting,\" he said.\n\nSurrey won the County Championship title by 46 points under head coach Michael Di Venuto in 2018.", "Image copyright LAS Image caption A fundraising page set up to pay for repairs raised \u00a310,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared online\n\nThree men and a woman have been charged with criminal damage after an ambulance was smashed up while football fans celebrated England's quarter-final win over Sweden at the World Cup.\n\nThe car was taken out of service when it was damaged after the match on 7 July in Borough High Street, London.\n\nMore than \u00a310,000 was raised through a crowdfunding page to pay for repairs.\n\nThe four defendants are due to appear at Camberwell Magistrates' Court on 22 November.\n\nA JustGiving page set up by Millwall Supporters' Club raised twice its target of \u00a35,000 after photos of the damaged car were shared across social media.\n\nHowever, a Skoda dealership offered to fix the car for free, so the donations were instead put towards restoring an old ambulance, London Ambulance Service (LAS) said.\n\nThe four people facing charges are:", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Paris ambulances took to the city's ring road - very slowly - on Monday morning\n\nThe main Paris ring road was slowed to a crawl on Monday morning as hundreds of ambulances, sirens blaring, protested at changes to conditions.\n\nSome 500 ambulances had already gathered in Paris before rush hour on Monday as part of a day of action.\n\nA new regulation means that hospitals and clinics - rather than individual patients - will now choose which ambulance service to use.\n\nMany small operators say that means they will no longer be able to compete.\n\nFrench media report that up to 2,000 ambulances are expected in total throughout the day.\n\nNews outlet France Bleu reported that there were some 400km (250 miles) of traffic jams in the Ile-de-France region by 09:00 local time (08:00 GMT).

Such instances can cause erratic airspeed readings, which in turn can confuse pilots and affect the way in which the aircraft is flown, possibly leading to accidents.\n\nIn 2009, for example, an Air France flight went down off the coast of Brazil. Blocked pitot tubes triggered a chain of events in which the pilots became confused and disorientated and lost control. In every other respect the aircraft was working perfectly.\n\nThese are still early days in the investigation and more information is needed. But if unreliable airspeed readings were a factor, key questions will be: what was the cause - poor design or poor maintenance procedures, for example - and why previous problems were apparently not rectified.\n\nWhat is the problem with the instruments?\n\nLogs obtained by the BBC have already shown that on the Boeing 737 Max's penultimate flight, airspeed readings were unreliable.\n\nBut Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee now says there were also problems on the previous two flights, as well as the final, fatal journey.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Distraught relatives demanded answers at an emotional meeting with Indonesian authorities\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Lion Air founder Rusdi Kirana bowed his head to those there\n\nThey did not say whether the problems stemmed from a mechanical or maintenance issue, or whether the faulty meter was a factor in the crash.\n\n\"Currently we are looking for the cause of problem,\" said investigator Nurcahyo Utomo, Associated Press reported.\n\n\"Whether the trouble came from its indicator, its measuring device or sensor, or a problem with its computer. This is what we do not know yet and we will find it out\".\n\nIndonesia's government ordered an inspection of all the country's Boeing 737 Max planes following the crash.\n\nWhat do we know about the final flight?\n\nThe jet plummeted into the Java Sea - no survivors have been found, nor has the body of the Boeing 737.\n\nThe plane was making a one-hour journey to the western city of Pangkal Pinang when it went down.\n\nThe pilot had asked air traffic control for permission to turn back to the airport but then contact was lost.\n\nVictims' relatives are still waiting to receive the remains of loved ones. Scores of body bags have been gathered but so far only 14 individuals have been identified.\n\nSearch teams are also still trying to find the plane's cockpit voice recorder.", "Chris Henry applauds the Ulster supporters after what turned out to be his final appearance against the Scarlets on 1 September\n\nUlster's former Ireland flanker Chris Henry has announced his retirement from rugby union at the age of 34.\n\nHenry played 184 times for Ulster after his debut against Harlequins in January 2009, making his final appearance against the Scarlets in September.\n\nHenry made his Ireland debut against Australia in June 2010 and went on to earn 24 caps.\n\n\"My career has physically taken its toll and so, for my wellbeing, I will be retiring immediately,\" said Henry.\n\nThe back-rower is the third Ulster forward to announce his retirement in recent weeks, following the news that both Peter Browne and Jean Deysel were quitting the game.\n\nHenry is currently celebrating his Testimonial Year in recognition of 10 seasons of service to Ulster Rugby.\n\nHe played for Malone RFC, Wallace HS and Ballymena RFC, before earning provincial and international honours, and has recently been turning out for Malone again.\n\n'Right time to retire'\n\n\"After a great deal of thought and in-depth discussions with family and friends, I believe that now is the right time to retire from the game I love,\" explained Henry in an open letter published by Ulster Rugby.\n\n\"No matter how much I would love to finish the season with this talented group, my career has taken its toll physically, and so for the wellbeing of myself, my loving wife and my family, I will be retiring immediately.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud to be a one-club man, and I want to thank Ulster for giving me the chance to achieve my dream.\n\n\"The honour of putting on the white and green jersey is something I will always cherish.

The 11 most popular players make up the final XI, listed here in batting order:\n\n1. Rory Burns - selected by 91% of users\n\nAfter leading Surrey to the Division One title - scoring 1359 runs at 64.71 - the left-hander looks the ideal candidate to replace Alastair Cook at the top of the order. There have been some questions about his technique, but his numbers alone are enough to warrant him being given an opportunity.\n\n2. Keaton Jennings - 53%\n\nDespite his struggles after being recalled in May - he has scored 192 runs in 10 Test innings - 53% of people still want Jennings in the side. 50% want the left-hander to open, whilst another 3% want him to come in at three.\n\n3. Joe Denly - 77%\n\nMore than three-quarters of people who selected a team want Denly to make his Test debut at the age of 32. 53% want the Kent player to open, with another 24% seeing him coming in at three - making him the most likely candidate to bat at three in this team. His leg-spin could also be a crucial asset for England.\n\n4. Joe Root - 99%\n\nThe captain has made no secret of his desire to bat at number four, rather than three. Some 64% of readers agreed that was Root's best position - he averages 52.90 from 47 innings batting there. 35% of users placed him at three.\n\n5. Ben Stokes - 96%\n\nStokes struggled for form slightly during the summer, only averaging 25, but he's still a resounding selection in the middle order. He fared much better with the ball, taking 17 wickets, and his extra pace and bounce could be useful on Sri Lankan pitches.\n\n6. Jos Buttler - 92%\n\nWhat a year it has been for Buttler. Handed a second chance at Test cricket by national selector Ed Smith, the 28-year-old amassed 510 runs at 46.36 this summer, making him one of the first names on everyone's team sheet.\n\n7. Moeen Ali - 87%\n\nAfter initially missing the start of the Test summer following a poor winter in Australia and New Zealand, Moeen took 14 wickets in four matches to book his place on the plane and in this team. His flexibility to bat anywhere in the order could also be crucial throughout the series.\n\n8. Sam Curran - 59%\n\nThe 20-year-old proved to be a revelation with bat and ball in the summer. The left-hander scored 292 runs at 36.50 and took 13 wickets at 23.23 to just edge Chris Woakes out of the side.\n\n9. Adil Rashid - 82%\n\nHis controversial return to the Test team perhaps didn't work out as many hoped - the leg-spinner struggled for form in taking just 10 wickets in eight innings at 30.89 - but in sub-continental conditions, 82% of people have placed their trust in Rashid.\n\n10. Stuart Broad - 66%\n\nThere have been rumours Broad might get rested with one eye on next summer's Ashes - and a potential desire for England to field three frontline spinners - but 66% want to see England's second most successful wicket-taker add to his 433 Test wickets in Galle.\n\n11. James Anderson - 96%\n\nWho else could it be? Anderson became the most successful pace bowler in Test history by wrapping up victory at The Oval in the final Test against India. The 36-year-old will be hoping to add to his 564 Test wickets.\n\nWho missed out?\n\nJonny Bairstow misses out with the ankle injury he picked up playing football during a warm-up in the ODI series. If fit, he'd have featured in the team after 61% picked him.\n\nChris Woakes would secure 12th man duties after being picked by 52% of users. He averages 61.77 with the ball in overseas conditions, compared to 23.33 in England, which may have persuaded users to leave him out.\n\nJack Leach is an option for Bayliss and Root if England decide to play another spinner. 32% of people included the Somerset spinner, who took 30 Championship wickets at 24.07 last season, in their side.\n\nOllie Pope, who made his Test debut in the summer, was selected in 33% of teams while Surrey team-mate Ben Foakes was selected in just 9% of teams after being called up as cover for the injured Bairstow.\n\nOlly Stone, who is yet to make his Test debut, was selected in 16% of teams.", "Image copyright Sottish SPCA Image caption Leo is one of the cats found with unexplained injuries\n\nThe Scottish SPCA has appealed for information after reports of cats being found in Dalmally, Argyll, with unexplained injuries.\n\nScotland's animal welfare charity believes the injuries have possibly been caused by snares.\n\nIt has asked the public for information to help explain the injuries.\n\nThe charity's inspector, Yvonne Inglis said: \"There is a possibility these are from snares but we have yet to discover any in the area.\"\n\nShe added: \"Most recently we were alerted to Leo, a one-year-old cat who had to have one of his hind legs and part of his tail removed.

This could shape the direction of the Republican party over the next two years.\n\nEither way, we can expect these mid-terms, like all others, to be a referendum on the president.\n\nThe parties of presidents who have low approval ratings tend to do poorly in the mid-terms - and President Trump's are very low indeed.\n\nThis is one reason Democrats, with the House of Representatives in their sights, are optimistic this year.\n\nOne race to watch\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nThere are plenty we could have picked here - any of the close Senate races in Tennessee, Missouri or Arizona for example - but if there's one race that sums up the 2018 mid-terms, it is the close race for governor in Georgia.\n\nLike in a number of other states this year, Georgia could see a significant first: Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams would become the first female African-American governor in the US if she won.\n\nHer Republican opponent Brian Kemp is Georgia's secretary of state. His office has been behind the cancellation of 1.5m voter registration applications in four years, and has been accused of voter suppression, one of the hot-button issues this year.\n\nAs with the divisive race for governor in neighbouring Florida, the Georgia contest has also been laced with racist undertones (or even overtones). Just last week, the Washington Post reported, voters in Georgia received a fake robocall purporting to be from Oprah Winfrey \"asking you to make my fellow Negress Stacey Abrams the governor of Georgia\".\n\nOur correspondent Courtney Subramanian spent time in Georgia looking at how the bitter race has played out.\n\nOne guide\n\nThe first polls will close at 23:00 GMT on Tuesday (that's 18:00 on the east coast of the US).\n\nWe'll be bringing you coverage live online, on TV and on radio as the results come in.\n\nHow can you find out where to read, watch and listen?\n\nOne game\n\nThere are plenty of possible outcomes on Tuesday, and therefore plenty of possible consequences.\n\nIf you want to see what those consequences are, choose a scenario right here...", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What do people really think of the announcement that the Spice Girls are going on tour?\n\nThe Spice Girls have announced their first tour for a decade, with six UK stadium dates in June next year.\n\nMelanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Chisholm revealed details of the reunion tour in a video on social media on Monday.\n\nVictoria Beckham, however, will not be taking part.\n\nThe girl group will kick off the tour at Manchester's Etihad Stadium on 1 June 2019, with tickets for all dates going on sale on Saturday at 10.30 GMT.\n\nThe foursome will also perform in Coventry, Sunderland, Edinburgh and Bristol, finishing at London's Wembley Stadium.

Admit it, you used to send nudges, didn't you?\n\nThe verb 'google' didn't make it into the Oxford English Dictionary until after Cook's first Test, and you'd have received strange looks if back then you had used words like twerk, selfie or yolo - all later entrants during Cook's career.\n\nThe political world is much different in the post-Cook era compared with how it was before his debut.\n\nBack in March 2006, Tony Blair was UK Prime Minister and George W Bush was President of the United States.\n\nAt that time, Donald Trump was best known as a man who built and renovated hotels. In the lead up to Cook's debut, Trump was appearing in his fifth of 14 series as the host of the US version of The Apprentice.\n\nFew other than The Simpsons predicted Trump would be US President by the latter stages of Cook's career.\n\nDonald Trump released a book in 2006 titled How to Build a Fortune: Your Plan for Success From the World's Most Famous Businessman\n\nMusic was different too.\n\nChico Time by X Factor contestant Chico Slimani went to number one during Cook's first Test, while Tony Christie and Peter Kay had been nominated for a Brit Award a month earlier for (Is This The Way To) Amarillo.\n\nGreat times.\n\nOther UK number ones that year included SexyBack by Justin Timberlake, Shakira's Hips Don't Lie and Nasty Girl by Notorious B.I.G featuring Puff Daddy.\n\nAmerican rapper Puff Daddy had five different names during Cook's England career - Diddy, Puff Daddy, Swag, Sean Combs and Love, if you're wondering.\n\nOn TV, Shayne Ward was the X Factor's most recent winner after beating Andy Abraham and Journey South in the final of the second series.\n\nBack then viewers had never heard of One Direction, Little Mix, Leona Lewis or Leon Jackson - remember him?\n\nOver on Strictly, Cook's former Essex team-mate Darren Gough had recently won the third series.\n\nBlack suits, as modelled here by Irish boy band Westlife, were in at the Brits in 2006\n\nWhat about cricket?\n\nThe cricketing record books looked different when Cook began his career too.\n\nOn the day of the England opener's debut, West Indies' Brian Lara held the record for most Test runs on 11,204, with Allan Border second and his fellow Australian Steve Waugh third.\n\nSince then, Lara has been knocked down into seventh place with India's Sachin Tendulkar top on 15,921 and Cook himself in fifth.\n\nWhen Cook's career began, the umpire decision review system had not been introduced and there had only been six Twenty20 Internationals. The Indian Premier League did not exist.\n\nFifty-eight players have made their England debut in the 162 matches since Cook's debut, from Ian Blackwell and Monty Panesar - who made their first international appearances in the same game - to the last newbies of the Cook era, Sam Curran and Ollie Pope.\n\nCurran was just seven years old when Cook made his debut.\n\nAnyone feel old?\n\nCook [far right] played under five England Test captains and also led the side in 59 matches", "Image caption Two men have been arrested over the fatal stabbing in Samos Road, Bromley\n\nTwo men have been arrested over a fatal stabbing in south-east London.\n\nThe victim, believed to be 22, was found in Samos Road, Anerley, Bromley, at 12:30 GMT on Sunday.

[Even as] I reached out and grabbed him by the arm, I still thought it was a doll,\" Mr Hutt told local outlet the Whakatane Beacon.\n\n\"His face looked just like porcelain with his short hair wetted down, but then he let out a little squeak and I thought, 'oh God, this is a baby and it's alive'.\"\n\n'It wasn't his time'\n\nMr Hutt, who was staying at Murphy's Holiday Camp, located in the coastal town of Matata, was out on a nearby beach on 26 October at about 06:15 New Zealand time (17:15GMT).\n\nAccording to the Herald, Mr Hutt would usually head straight from the camp to fish on the beach, but decided on that day to fish at a different spot - 100m to the left.\n\nAfter checking his fishing lines, he spotted the boy floating in the water.\n\n\"He was floating at a steady pace... if I had been just a minute later, I wouldn't have seen him,\" Mr Hutt said.\n\n\"He was bloody lucky, but he just wasn't meant to go, it wasn't his time.\"\n\nYou might also be interested in:\n\nMr Hutt's wife, Sue, alerted the camp's staff who informed them that there was only one couple staying with a baby.

It's the first time they've been here,\" Rebecca Salter, the co-owner of Murphy's Holiday Camp, told the BBC.\n\n\"Hutt, who is a fisherman and one of our regulars, spotted the baby. [They brought the baby to us], we wrapped him up in towels and Sue went to inform the baby's parents.\"\n\nThe baby had escaped from his parents' tent by undoing the zipper, and then made his way into the ocean.\n\nThe baby's mother \"screamed\" when she was informed that her baby was found in the water - the couple later thanked the Hutts before returning home.\n\n\"It came as a shock to everyone. It was a very, very lucky result... it could have been a very tragic incident,\" said Mrs Salter. \"It's a freakish miracle.\"\n\nWhakatane Police confirmed to the BBC that they attended the emergency, adding that the baby was now \"okay\".", "England have not won a Test series in Sri Lanka since 2001\n\nSri Lanka v England, first Test Venue: Galle International Stadium, Galle Dates: 6-10 November Time: From 04:30 GMT Coverage: Live text commentary and The Cricket Social programme on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nI have been touring for almost 30 years and have never previously known a situation in which 16 of a 17-man squad could be picked.\n\nThat, really, is where England are as they get ready for Tuesday's first Test against Sri Lanka. It is going to be a revealing few weeks.\n\nIt has been 12 years since England last played a Test match without Alastair Cook walking out to open the batting. We know they will get pitches that are going to spin a lot - and Sri Lanka won their last Test at Galle, against South Africa, by 232 runs so you need real strength in the top order.\n\nWhat they will miss most is Cook's resilience. Cook playing in conditions that are not easy. Cook with his patience and discipline.\n\nEveryone talks about Kevin Pietersen's brilliant 186 in Mumbai in 2012 - and rightly so, as it was a staggering innings - but who was at the other end? It was Cook, who scored a brilliant hundred and shared a 206-run partnership that set up a 10-wicket win.\n\nThat is the way people are going to have to play here: give nothing away, bat for as long as you can. It won't be easy. There will be a lot of pressure on, men around the bat, and that's where Cook was so good.\n\nEngland had Cook for so long and now it's Keaton Jennings. If Cook hadn't retired, you have to wonder if Jennings would have made this tour - and suddenly he is the senior opener.\n\nIt looks as though it will be Jennings and Rory Burns to open the innings. They did so in both of England's warm-up matches and I saw them doing some close-to-the-wicket catching practice on Sunday. Their partnership will be crucial.\n\nThe first three, as a whole, is totally up in the air. No-one is really sure who is coming in behind them.\n\nJoe Root has never wanted to bat at three - he's always wanted to bat at four. It doesn't suit England to have Root batting at three if he doesn't want to - and he came in at four in England's final Test innings of the home summer, with Moeen Ali at three.\n\nSo what do England do? Does Moeen bat at three? Does Joe Denly do that and bowl leg-spin? Denly's stock seems to have fallen over the practice days, but how much can you take away from such little practice?\n\nThe top three is where teams get good starts or find themselves in a lot of trouble early, with the opposition all over them. Whoever it is who ends up batting one, two and three has got a major responsibility.\n\nIt is also a huge task for England's spinners. They have a very inexperienced Jack Leach, who I think they're going to have to play - despite him only playing in the final warm-up game - and he will have to bowl better than he did on his debut in Christchurch.\n\nEngland's preparation for this series has been two warm-up matches lasting two days - and one of those days was washed out.\n\nIt's deeply worrying for the future of Test cricket - it's totally inadequate.\n\nWe say it every time we go away, and we say it often when teams come to England, though I think England are more generous than some. It is a joke. You can't expect people to play Test cricket in totally alien conditions with that sort of preparation.\n\nThere was a time last year when scrapping the coin toss to reduce home advantage was discussed. To me, that was simply hiding the fact the batsmen, particularly on tour, aren't having the opportunity to get used to the conditions. It is hopeless.\n\nIf the International Cricket Council is serious about Test cricket - and it is serious enough to back the World Test Championship, which begins in 2019 - then the series within that competition should include two four-day matches against proper opposition. That is only fair.\n\nI have been in Galle since Friday and the weather has been mixed, to say the least. It can be beautifully sunny, then you can have a massive downpour out of nowhere. There are storms forecast for the week of the Test match.\n\nThere are no floodlights at Galle, so you cannot play through low, dark cloud. This could be a match in which not a huge amount of cricket is played.\n\nThe Cricket Social will be on air from 07:00 GMT throughout the Test series in Sri Lanka, and will be streamed on the BBC Sport website and app.", "A man is in a critical condition in hospital after the car he was driving left the road and crashed into a tree.\n\nThe crash happened on the A827 between Kenmore and Aberfeldy at about 16:20 on Sunday.\n\nThe 22-year-old suffered serious head injuries and was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow.

Mr Xi said the Chinese economy was \"a sea\". Storms can overturn a pond, he said, but never a sea.\n\nThe US has imposed taxes on about half of Chinese imports into the US so far this year - making it more expensive for American consumers to buy them - and has threatened to target all imports.\n\nThe White House says the tariffs are a response to China's \"unfair\" trade policies, which Mr Trump blames for helping to create a huge trade deficit, and its alleged intellectual property theft.\n\nIt also wants China to give American companies better access to its markets.\n\nMr Xi promised to take steps to boost imports, by cutting tariffs, facilitating customs clearance and reducing \"institutional costs\".\n\nHe did not make clear which countries' imports would benefit from the lower tariffs, and whether the US was on this list.\n\nChina would also \"continue to broaden market access\", Mr Xi said, adding that openness had become a \"trademark of China\".\n\n\"China's door will never be closed, it will only open still wider.\"\n\nMr Xi also said China would speed up negotiations on both a China-EU investment agreement and a regional China-Japan-South Korea free trade deal.\n\nAmong the high-level delegates at the expo is UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox.

Birds perched on the branches chirp away as a cool breeze blows our way.\n\nThe ground beneath the canopy is almost bare but Mr Kariuki has planted napier grass, some arrow roots and maize a short distance away.\n\nThe grass is fed to his dairy cows and they, in turn, provide manure for the farm.\n\nMr Kariuki says the trees are organic and grow as in the wild - he does not need to spray pesticides or apply commercial fertiliser.\n\nHe was the first famer in the area to plant avocados more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"I used to work as a clearing and forwarding agent at the airport in the 1980s, that's where I learnt about avocado exports.\"\n\nLuckily for him, his father worked at the Agricultural Research Institute near their village.

And he does not need to do much: \"We prune the trees once a year.\"\n\nHe hires casual workers to pick the fruits when they are ready and exporters collect the harvest from the farm.\n\nSmall-holder famers like Mr Kariuki produce most of the avocados sold in and outside Kenya.\n\nMore and more of them are uprooting traditional cash crops like coffee and tea and planting avocados instead.\n\nTargeting the Chinese market\n\nA long rainy season has meant the production was good for farmers like Mr Kariuki.\n\nBut exporters - like Lucy Njeri - are not as happy.\n\n\"It hasn't been a good season in terms of sales,\" says the 30-year-old business and marketing graduate, who runs Saipei Foods with her husband.\n\nImage caption Exporter Lucy Njeri says the avocado market has been saturated this year\n\nAt their packing house near Nairobi's main airport, about 35 workers dressed in green or black branded uniforms receive fruits from delivery vans.\n\nThey then sort and clean them, load the conveyor belt, weigh the fruits before packing them into small carton boxes ready for export.\n\nMs Njeri says she has exported more than 1,200 tonnes of avocados this season, mostly to Europe.\n\n\"Much as we've had a consistent supply, the market has been saturated and the prices weren't as good as we expected,\" says Ms Njeri. \"But such is business.\"\n\nYet forecasts say saturation in the near future is unlikely.\n\nWhile noting an oversupply in 2018, the CBI predicts that new avocado markets such as China will likely tilt the scales.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\"Avocado plantations worldwide are expanding fast but they take time to reach full capacity and catch up with demand,\" the trade body says in its latest report on the crop.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta is due to travel to China in November for an imports fair, where he is expected to sign trade deals on avocados among other commodities, according to The Star Newspaper. He will be accompanied by horticultural farmers and traders.\n\nKenya has recently overtaken South Africa to become Africa's biggest avocado producer, but globally, its market share is dwarfed by countries like Peru, Chile and Mexico.\n\nBut local awareness of the crop's potential is growing.\n\nImage caption Avocado exports from Kenya have shot up in recent years\n\nA Kenyan agronomist, Bernard Kimutai, set out to recruit 10,000 new farmers to grow avocados during the onset of the long-rains season in April.\n\n\"I very nearly hit the target,\" he told the BBC six months later.\n\nAs more and more farmers turn to growing the green fruit, Mr Kariuki is wasting no time in increasing his share, and now plans to plant 300 more trees on his farm.\n\nHe earns about $0.10 for each fruit, which is then sold for around $10 per plate in cities like New York and London.\n\nIt is a huge difference in price, but that means the avocado benefits many more people as it travels from the farmer to the consumer somewhere else in the world, even if that is only an hour's drive away at Le Grenier \u00e0 Pain.", "Image caption Billboards are still being seen on the streets of Edinburgh despite the new ban\n\nA citywide ban of on-street advertising boards has come into force in Edinburgh.\n\nThe ban, approved by city councillors in May, aims to create \"safer, more accessible streets\", particularly for those with disabilities such as sight impairment and mobility difficulties.\n\nEnvironmental wardens will be used to make sure the ban is not flouted.\n\nThe council said enforcement action would be taken against those who ignore the rules.\n\nTransport and environment convener Lesley Macinnes said: \"This is ultimately about opening up our streets for all members of society, creating welcoming, clutter-free spaces where people can move freely.\n\n\"We've heard from lots of different groups about the mobility issues caused by the presence of temporary, moveable structures such as advertising boards, so it's clear that action needs to be taken if we are to live in a truly equal, accessible city.\"\n\nPublic consultation\n\nThe ban follows a public consultation with stakeholders, including Living Streets, Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and the Edinburgh Access Panel, along with traders' associations, Business Improvement Districts and community councils.\n\nA spokesman for RNIB Scotland said: \"We very much welcome this move by the City of Edinburgh Council to help make the streets of the capital more accessible to visually impaired people.\n\n\"A vital element for any successful 21st Century city must be inclusivity.\n\n\"A city that is open and welcoming to everyone, residents and visitors, no matter what needs or disabilities they may have.

But even in this area famous for its wax palms, the trees are few and far between.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\"The trees live for up to 200 years and because of their long lifespan, their decay will only be seen by younger generations,\" Mr Bernal told the BBC.\n\n\"This is why so many Colombians do not realise our national tree is dying out.\"\n\nImage copyright Felipe Villegas/Instituto Humboldt\n\nSince 1989 the number of trees in the region has declined by 78% and there are now only about 2,000 palms left in the Cocora Valley, a group of scientists which has been monitoring the population says.\n\nThe wax palms are not only a tourist attraction but a key component in the region's ecosystem. The fruits produced by the trees feed a large number of insects, birds and mammals.\n\nBut according to Mr Bernal, the palms in the Cocora Valley are at risk. Much of the valley's once lush dense forest has been cut down to make way for cattle grazing.\n\nThis poses problems for the seeds of the wax palm. They either get burned in the sun or they get eaten by the cows.\n\nImage copyright Lucy Sherriff Image caption Cows eat the seeds and there are no new saplings to replace those trees which have reached the end of their lifespan\n\nAlthough the living trees are relatively healthy, when they start to decay naturally there are no young saplings to take their place.\n\nNew threats\n\nThe Quind\u00edo Wax Palm grows in very few areas in Colombia. Apart from the Cocora Valley they can be found in Tochecito, an area in Valle del Cauca province.\n\nThe little-known Tochecito is thought to hold the largest number of trees - an estimated 70% of the national total.\n\nImage copyright Rodrigo Bernal Image caption In Tochecito the density of wax palms is higher than in the Cocora valley\n\nBut the fact that parts of the area were occupied by the now largely disbanded Farc guerrilla group means that research there was almost impossible. Scientists hope the number of trees may actually be bigger.\n\nMr Bernal and his fellow scientists have turned their attention to Tochecito in the hope that they can preserve its wax palms before it is too late.\n\nWith the area now safer and more accessible following the 2016 peace deal with the Farc rebels, farmers are moving back and the scientists fear for the future of the national tree.\n\n\"We predict we could see half the wax palm population disappear in as little as 50 years' time,\" says Luis Santiago Castillo Mart\u00ednez of the Humboldt Institute, an environmental research organisation.\n\n\"Tochecito is our best opportunity to protect the palms,\" he says of the 42 sq km (16 sq mile) area.\n\nUphill struggle\n\nThe palm trees are legally protected under a law passed in 1985 which prevents their branches being cut off for use during religious celebrations such as Palm Sunday but there are few repercussions for those who completely fell the trees.\n\nTochecito currently belongs to 40 private landowners and Mr Bernal along with the Humboldt Institute has been asking the Colombian government to declare the area a national park, but so far with little success.\n\nImage copyright Felipe Villegas/Instituto Humboldt Image caption The landowners could be key to the palms' conservation\n\n\"The most we could achieve was to encourage the owners to declare their farms private reserves,\" says Mr Bernal.\n\nUnfortunately there is a loophole to that status, he adds.\n\n\"This just means your land is a protected area but it's an empty status as you can use your land however you see fit. If these landowners decide they want to clear their land, they can.\"\n\nMr Bernal and his fellow scientists have for years been urging the government to buy up the land - a move they estimate would cost $10m (\u00a37.7m) - but so far no action has been taken.\n\n\"It's not a huge amount. It's cents for a nation like Colombia. The government has the authority to buy this land, and protect the trees, but refuses to do so. It is incredibly frustrating,\" he says.\n\nImage copyright Felipe Villegas/Institute Humboldt Image caption The wax palms have so far been thriving on the steep hillsides in Tochecito\n\nColombia's 58 national parks are managed by the National Parks Systems and while the number of areas designated as protected in Colombia has been growing, the budget has only increased by 3% each year over the past four years, Wilfredo Cuestas says.\n\nMr Cuestas oversees the budget of the body managing Colombia's national parks. \"Although the budget for each fiscal year has not been cut, the allocations made are not enough to cover our needs,\" he told the BBC. \"The money assigned is for basic operations,\" he said, pointing out that more than double that amount was needed to sustain its work.\n\nMr Castillo also thinks money is key: \"The first step to protecting the palms will be to allocate the proper amount to the environmental sector.\"\n\nMr Bernal and his fellow scientists have developed a management plan to save the species but the budget cuts mean their strategy is unlikely to be enacted.\n\n\"I'm so disappointed,\" Mr Bernal says. \"This tree is beloved by Colombian people, everyone knows it is our national tree, But nobody knows we are about to lose it.\"\n\nUpdate 7 November 2018: The government body overseeing Colombia's national parks has since responded clarifying its budget and our article has been updated to include that.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters demonstrated outside the former US embassy in Tehran on Sunday\n\nThe US unleashed its \"toughest ever\" sanctions against Iran on Monday, a move that has already sparked mass protests in the oil-rich nation.\n\nThe Trump administration reinstated all sanctions removed under the 2015 nuclear deal, targeting both Iran and states that trade with it.\n\nThey will hit oil exports, shipping and banks - all core parts of the economy.\n\nThousands of Iranians chanting \"Death to America\" rallied on Sunday, rejecting calls for talks.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani has vowed to sell oil and break the sanctions.\n\nThe military was also quoted as saying it would hold air defence drills on Monday and Tuesday to prove the country's capabilities.\n\nThe demonstrations took place on the 39th anniversary of the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, which led to four decades of mutual hostility.\n\nBefore travelling to a campaign rally for the US mid-term elections, President Donald Trump said Iran was already struggling under his administration's policies.\n\nHe called the sanctions, \"very strong\", saying: \"We'll see what happens with Iran, but they're not doing very well, I can tell you.\"\n\nWhat started this?\n\nWashington re-imposed the sanctions after Mr Trump in May pulled out of a 2015 accord aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nWashington also says it wants to stop what it calls Tehran's \"malign\" activities including cyber attacks, ballistic missile tests, and support for violent extremist groups and militias in the Middle East.\n\nImage copyright Huw Evans picture agency Image caption Donald Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal in May\n\n\"We are working diligently to make sure we support the Iranian people and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the Islamic Republic of Iran's malign behaviour is changed,\" US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"That's the goal, that's the mission, and that's what we will achieve on behalf of the president.\"\n\nWhat could the impact be?\n\nThe US has been gradually re-imposing sanctions, but analysts say this latest round is by far the most significant.\n\nMore than 700 individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft are now on the sanctions list, including major banks, oil exporters and shipping companies.\n\nMr Pompeo said more than 100 big international companies had withdrawn from Iran because of the looming sanctions.\n\nHe also said Iranian oil exports had dropped by nearly one million barrels a day, choking the main source of funding for the country.\n\nIn addition, the Brussels-based Swift network for making international payments is expected to cut off links with targeted Iranian institutions, isolating Iran from the international financial system.\n\nHow have EU states reacted?\n\nThe UK, Germany and France - which are among the five countries still committed to the nuclear pact - have all objected to the sanctions.\n\nThey have promised to support European firms that do \"legitimate business\" with Iran and have set up an alternative payment mechanism - or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) - that will help companies trade without facing US penalties.\n\nHowever, analysts doubt this will materially lessen the impact of sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnd in recent days US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US would \"aggressively\" target any firm or organisation \"evading our sanctions\".\n\nWho is exempt?\n\nThe Trump administration has granted exemptions to eight countries to continue importing Iranian oil, without naming them.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US would not dominate Iran\n\nThey are reported to include US allies Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, along with Turkey and China.\n\nMr Pompeo said the countries had already made \"significant reductions in their crude oil exports\" but needed \"a little bit more time to get to zero\".\n\nHe said two would eventually stop imports and the other six would greatly reduce them.\n\nWhat has the reaction been in Iran?\n\nThe US sanctions are timed to coincide with the anniversary of the siege of the US embassy on 4 November 1979 , which took place soon after the fall of the US-backed shah.\n\nSome 52 Americans were held hostage in the embassy for 444 days. Iran and the US have been enemies ever since.\n\nHardliners hold protests to commemorate the siege every year but on Sunday, protesters also vented their fury about the sanctions.\n\nIranian state media said millions turned out in towns and cities, swearing allegiance to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although the BBC was unable to independently verify this figure.\n\nIt followed a fiery speech from Ayatollah Khamenei on Saturday, in which he warned the US would not \"re-establish the domination\" it had over Iran before 1979.\n\nHowever, some Iranians have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration with the regime, with the hashtag #Sorry_US_Embassy_Siege attracting more than 19,000 tweets.\n\nOne user tweeted in English: \"Over the past 40 years, the Islamic regime of Iran tried to present the US and Israel as Iran's enemies.

Often, it is still these \"progressive\" causes that appeal to younger activists.\n\nBut today, civil society involves an increasingly diverse mix of people and political goals, with those on the right gaining traction.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Thailand's military rulers have benefited from the support of citizens' groups\n\nMany of these conservative groups share a belief in \"traditional\" values - those often associated with:\n\nreligious beliefs\n\ncommunity\n\nnational identity\n\nprotection against immigration\n\nsupport for the family unit\n\nOf course, there is also much that divides conservative civil society. While most groups favour democracy and work within mainstream politics, a small number are more disruptive and sometimes even violent - as is the case among groups on the left.\n\nWhatever the differences, research by Carnegie Europe shows that there are many countries where conservative civil society has had a key role in shaping domestic events:\n\nThere are many other places where conservative groups have grown in influence - from those in Georgia opposed to closer links with the EU, to Ugandan groups against greater gender equality.\n\nIn the US, anti-abortionists and right-wing groups including Patriot Prayer - which has been linked to the alt-right but argues that it campaigns for freedom and unity - have staged numerous high-profile demonstrations since Republican President Donald Trump took power.\n\nIn Europe, the French youth movement G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire has been described as the equivalent of the American alt-right, while Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) alarmed the German government during its rapid rise.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Kim Kataguiri (centre) has now been elected to Brazil's Congress\n\nThe differences between the groups are important - demonstrating that they can't all be treated as one.\n\nNeither can they be regarded as simply a voice for older conservatives or those who feel excluded by social trends.\n\nThese movements are attracting many younger activists in many countries.\n\nOne of the groups behind Jair Bolsonaro's campaign, the Free Brazil Movement, has three million followers on Facebook and more than one million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nOne of its best-known faces, 22-year-old Kim Kataguiri, recently became the youngest ever member of Brazil's Congress.\n\nIn Thailand, a group of students known as Cyber Scouts has been accused of monitoring other citizens' social media comments, in their role backing the military regime and its campaign for traditional and royalist values.\n\nSimilar alliances between young people active on social media and conservative groups have been seen in countries including Morocco and Tunisia.\n\nSuch developments have seen right-wing civil society move into a space that was, until recently, dominated by liberal and progressive causes.\n\nIt is likely to mean a fierce rivalry between groups on the left and right as they battle to be heard not only by politicians but by society as a whole.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nIt is based on The Mobilization of Conservative Civil Society, by Richard Youngs - a senior fellow in the Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program at Carnegie Europe, which focuses on EU foreign policy and on issues of international democracy.

They named it Flash Pack, as an abbreviation of \"flash backpacking\", and scraped together \u00a315,000 to fund its launch.\n\nBut when their website opened for business on January 2014, with just one listing - an adventure holiday to Sierra Leone - success was not immediate.\n\n\"The first six months of the business was excruciating,\" says Radha. \"You hear about all these overnight successes, but that really didn't happen with us.\n\n\"We sold one holiday to Sierra Leone, but then had to refund the person as we couldn't get anyone else on the trip.\"\n\nMore The Boss features:\n\nBusiness at London-based Flash Pack was about to dramatically improve though, after Lee came up with a marketing idea that he hoped would go viral.\n\nWith the 2014 World Cup due to start in Brazil in June, he had an idea for a very specific photo.\n\n\"I'd seen a picture of some workmen at the very top of Christ the Redeemer, the iconic [mountain top] statue of Jesus, in Rio de Janeiro, and the views of the city looked amazing,\" says Lee.\n\n\"I knew if I could just get up there and take a selfie it would go viral.\"\n\nSo Lee convinced the Brazil Tourist Board to let him do just that, and he took his photo 738m (2,421ft) above the city.\n\nJust as he had hoped, the photo did indeed go viral, with 50 million engagements on social media.

It is - he says - \"probably\" the last bout of his career. So in his latest column, he talked BBC Sport through the seven photographs which illustrate a remarkable boxing journey.\n\n'Chasing a different kind of dream'\n\nBellew (left) with brothers Craig, Westley and Liam at their Liverpool home\n\nThe little fatty on the left - me - had eyes on playing for Everton Football Club rather than fighting in the ring.\n\nI knew about boxing as my dad could fight. He had a successful security firm in Liverpool and I'd see him come back from a jog before shadow boxing in the back yard. I'd watch and replicate what he was doing, as kids do. It's funny how things turn out.\n\nThis, at about nine or 10, was when I'd say my life was forming. My dad left, my oldest brother was about to move out and so the family was evolving.\n\nEvery spare second away from school was spent at youth clubs with mates. When my family changed, friends became my family and I had a group of 8-10 mates I still speak to now.\n\nBack then, between getting clips around the ear for pestering my older brothers, I was chasing my dreams. Football dreams that is.\n\n'It was all to impress my dad'\n\nBellew with his father Anthony\n\nFrom those early years, everything I have done or become was to try to impress my dad.\n\nI was going to work on nightclub doors with him at 16 purely to impress him, to show him I could be like him. I was a big boy but had the face of a fat child.\n\nI remember being asked to guard a DJ box at a club and Paul Ince, the former Liverpool player, and his mates were dancing around by me so I had to keep them in check.\n\nThis photo is fitting as in every moment I've had in competition since the age of 15, dad has been by my side, my greatest supporter. I guess it's rare but even though I come from a broken home, I still believe I have the most amazing father.\n\nIf I wasn't training or working I'd go with him to his office and watch him work. I am so proud of him for how hard he grafted having come from very little.\n\nI am so thankful to be able to say all my dad does now is tell people about me. It wasn't easy, he always pushed and believed I could do more, more, more. That can be hard to follow but thankfully I have used his faith and proven him right.\n\nHow to drag 4lbs out...\n\nTony Bellew with 5lbs to go to make his 12st 7lbs limit and training with Carl Froch (right)\n\nI've put 16lbs on in 24 hours between weigh-in and fight. I know someone who has added 26lbs.\n\nThese images really showcase an opponent like no other, one I faced time and again - the weight cut I had in making 12st 7lbs at light-heavyweight. That's three stone lighter as a 30-year-old man than I was at the age of 15.\n\nIn the image on the left I still had 5lbs to go. Where did I lose it from? I don't know.\n\nBefore I fought Adonis Stevenson in 2013 I had 4lbs to shift in a morning before weighing in. I had zero energy left to train, so the nutritional adviser said the only way was to drag it from my body in a hot bath full of salts.\n\nI can remember getting in, it was so hot it was burning me. I watched stand-up comedy - it was Kevin Hart - on my iPad. I'd laugh and then seconds later be crying. I honestly thought I was having some kind of breakdown.\n\nOften I'd stop and think 'what am I doing?' I was chasing a dream no-one else could see and you'll always look like a lunatic until you achieve it.\n\nIt's absolutely crazy when I look back at what I used to do to my body but it formed years of my life which helped get me to where I am now. Still though, I look at these images and wonder how that bag of bones is me.\n\n'My dad beat Creed'\n\nBellew starred alongside Sylvester Stallone and Michael B Jordan in Creed\n\nGetting into character to become 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan for the Creed film was surreal. To this day, my youngest son Carter watches the film and thinks it's the only fight I've actually had. It's not 'my dad beat David Haye', it's 'my dad beat Creed'.\n\nI thought the phone call proposing the role was a joke and told the guy on the other end I wasn't in the mood for a wind-up as I'd just watched Everton get hammered. That day changed my life in some ways though.\n\nEverything I was earning at this stage of my career I was re-investing in property, believing that would go right for me. I always wanted the flashy things - the Rolls-Royce or a posh watch - but I would never live beyond my means. Even now the money is there I still can't bring myself to splurge on those things.\n\nBellew says Sylvester Stallone guided him throughout the filming of Creed\n\nCreed helped massively financially and there were spin-offs, though I still can't believe that part of my life happened.\n\nThe film set opened my eyes, mainly the time it takes to do anything. All you're waiting to hear at the end of the day is 'check the gate' as when you hear those words from a director they mean you're very close to it.\n\nWhen I got home I regretted doing the movie but when I saw the way it turned out on screen I was so, so impressed and my boys love it.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Tony Bellew picks his top boxing films for BBC Sport\n\n'That's enough now son, stop'\n\nBellew with Everton chairman Bill Kenwright and with the WBC world cruiserweight title in the Goodison Park changing rooms\n\nHugging Bill Kenwright after the greatest night of my career will stay with me. I was just so happy I could share it with him. The Everton chairman had a big role in my career.\n\nHe made my night at Goodison Park - where I beat Ilunga Makabu to win the WBC world cruiserweight title - happen. I owe him a massive debt. When we last spoke he said: \"That's enough now son, stop.\"\n\nDuring my career, I had access to Everton's training complex to do strength and conditioning work with trainer Dave Billows. Ten years on from linking up, Billows is still training me.\n\nNot many outfits in the Premier League would help like that. I can recall often sitting in an ice bath and the former Everton striker Yakubu would just come in, look at me and say: \"You are crazy.\"\n\nI try to speak to Mr Kenwright regularly and once this career is over will continue to do so. A while back he said to me: \"Let's do Goodison Park again son. It'll be massive - bigger than last time.\"\n\nI just say: \"No, I never want to go back.\" It was the night the dream came true and I don't ever want to tarnish it. But the chairman is just someone I love - just a really, really good person.\n\n'She rejected me three times'\n\nBellew with wife Rachael and children Corey, Cobey and Carter\n\nI've known Rachael since she was nine but was 18 when I met her - I was working on a nightclub door and saw her waiting to come in. I thought 'wow, she's changed'.\n\nI tried to chat to her but got rejected. A week later I was out with friends, saw her, and tried again, only to get another 'no'. Weeks later I tried again, telling her I only wanted to take her to the pictures, and she said 'no' but went away and did some research on me.\n\nShe put up with all the nonsense of me telling her I'd be world champion. I was representing my country at the time, travelling and earning \u00a3350 a week.\n\nThe minute she got pregnant I identified I couldn't earn money doing door work, I had to do things a grown-up way. So I turned professional and lost money for two years because of injury. Putting it bluntly, I was broke.\n\nAfter 16 professional fights, I was British champion, had just lost a world-title shot narrowly and was skint.\n\nI don't know if it's luck, fortune or what, but it's worked out. All I have learned is to believe in yourself.\n\nRachael and the kids - Corey, Cobey and Carter - mean the world and more to me. They are the focus now as I contemplate calling time.

But China has pledged to invest $60bn (\u00a346bn) in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption China is set to have invested $60bn in Africa at the end of 2018\n\nCountries in deepest debt to China\n\nMost of China's loans to Africa go into infrastructure projects such as roads, railways and ports.\n\nIn 2015, the China-Africa Research Initiative (CARI) at John Hopkins University identified 17 African countries with risky debt exposure to China, potentially unable to repay their loans.\n\nIt says three of these - Djibouti, Republic of Congo and Zambia - remain most at risk of debt distress derived from these Chinese loans.\n\nIn 2017, Zambia's debt amounted to $8.7bn (\u00a36.6bn) - $6.4bn (\u00a34.9bn) of which is owed to China.\n\nFor Djibouti, 77% of its debt is from Chinese lenders. Figures for the Republic of Congo are unclear, but CARI estimates debts to China to be in the region of $7bn (\u00a35.3bn).\n\nShould Africa be wary of Chinese debt?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Xi with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (left) and Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang.\n\nFewer strings attached?\n\nCompared to institutions such as the IMF, World Bank and Paris Club (a group of 22 creditor nations not including China), loans from China are seen by some as much quicker, cheaper, and come with fewer strings attached.\n\nThe United States in particular has been highly critical of China's approach.\n\nEarlier this year, ahead of a visit to Africa, the then US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said China's lending policy to Africa \"encouraged dependency, utilised corrupt deals and endangered its natural resources\".\n\nChina's response was forthright. Its ambassador in South Africa, Lin Songtian, said China was proud of its influence in Africa and that Mr Tillerson's comments were part of a smear campaign by the United States.\n\n\"China is just like any other lender,\" says Gyude Moore, a former Liberian Government official. \"China's strategic interest is in African countries paying back debts.\"\n\nThere are many examples of China supporting programmes to help with debt repayments, says Mr Moore, who's currently a visiting fellow at the Centre for Global Development.\n\nAnd ultimately, it is up to African nations themselves to accept or reject Chinese loans.\n\nBut a severe lack of infrastructure, and the desperate need for modern transport links in many of the poorest countries, make China's ready offer of substantial loans for such projects often difficult to turn down.\n\nAnd what's clear is that Africa's debt problem is far wider than its relationship with China.\n\nHowever, China's increasing involvement with the continent and its commitment to providing loans for large-scale projects, mean that any solution to Africa's debt problems must address its relationship both with Beijing and with private Chinese companies operating on the continent.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nSend us your questions\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "Image caption The criticism being levelled at many universities is that they are not providing value for money\n\nToo many graduates in England are being left with big debts for too little payback, MPs are warning.\n\nNearly half of recent graduates were not working in graduate roles in 2017, the Commons education committee says.\n\nIts chairman Robert Halfon also highlights the excessive pay of some university vice-chancellors, saying that is not value for money.\n\nThe government is reviewing post-18 education and funding to see how it can ensure that value.\n\nThe Augar Review, which is due to report early next year, is looking at the system under which students take out tuition fee loans to fund courses costing \u00a39,000 a year.\n\nBut the committee warned that the scope of this review, which has been limited by the government, means there is a risk it \"will fail to overhaul the system\" in a way that will benefit graduates and students.\n\nThe government has said the review's recommendations must be consistent with the government's fiscal policies, must not affect taxation or cover the earlier pre-2012 loans system.\n\nThe report, Value for Money in Higher Education, said the committee was encouraged by an increase in information on the kind of outcomes graduates can expect.\n\nBut it warned: \"The graduate premium varies greatly depending on where and what a student studies.\"\n\nMr Halfon said: \"The blunt reality is that too many universities are not providing value for money, and that students are not getting good outcomes from the degrees for which so many of them rack up debt.\"\n\nThe report quotes a recent National Audit Office report which said bad decisions on courses could \"lead to poor financial outcomes\".\n\nThe MPs' committee report said: \"There is still a long way to go before students have access to robust data on graduate employment which will inform their choices.\"\n\nIt points to Office for National Statistics data showing 49% of recent graduates were not working in graduate roles across the UK in 2017.\n\nThe report also highlighted how students from poorer backgrounds are far more likely than their wealthier peers to go to lower-ranking universities.\n\nHere, opportunities for better-paid employment tend to be more limited.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Hard work... but for what reward?\n\nAnd it recommended: \"Higher education institutions must be more transparent about the labour market returns of their courses.\n\n\"This is not simply a measure of graduate earnings but of appropriate professional graduate-level and skilled employment destinations.\"\n\nIt should be obligatory for universities to publish this information, it said.\n\nMr Halfon calls for strict criteria on acceptable levels of vice-chancellor pay to be enforced.\n\nA new voluntary code covering senior staff pay was published by universities in the summer.\n\nUnder this code, institutions must provide meaningful explanations if pay diverges from the code.\n\nMr Halfon said: \"Too many institutions exist where vice-chancellors and senior management earn excessive amounts that does not represent value for either the student or the taxpayer.\n\n\"Self-regulation should be out of the question, and the Office for Students must enforce strict criteria on acceptable levels of pay that could be linked to average staff pay, performance and other measures.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Education said government reforms had seen \"record rates\" of disadvantaged 18-year-olds attending UK universities.\n\n\"That's why we are pleased to see universities and further education colleges planning to spend more than \u00a3860m on measures to improve access and outcomes for disadvantaged students,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Not everyone is smiling about their student experience\n\n\"We know that what you study and where you study really matters and we are introducing and developing digital tools that provide data on graduate outcomes that will begin to revolutionise how students choose the right university for them.\n\n\"We are also reviewing post-18 education and funding, which will look at how we can ensure greater value for money for both students and taxpayers.\"\n\nDisadvantaged students\n\nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner said universities must focus on value for money and supporting disadvantaged students.\n\n\"The Tories trebled tuition fees and scrapped maintenance grants, leaving the most disadvantaged students with over \u00a357,000 worth of debt when they graduate,\" she said.\n\n\"It is no wonder there are concerns that students do not get value for money.\n\n\"The number of part-time and mature students plummeted after the Tories trebled fees, yet they are doing nothing to support the many learners who have been shut out by the current system.\n\n\"They should start by matching Labour's commitment to bring back maintenance grants, to ensure that everyone, whatever their background, can succeed at university.\"\n\nAlistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: \"Our universities have a well deserved international reputation for high quality teaching, learning and research, delivered by talented and dedicated staff.\n\n\"Universities have increased investment in teaching and learning and students continue to report record levels of satisfaction with their courses.\n\n\"Graduates leaving our universities are also increasingly in demand from employers.\n\n\"They are more likely to be in employment and earn on average \u00a310,000 each year more than non-graduates.\"", "It's Monday, it's a new week, and while we won't pretend to know everything that's going to happen over the

The BBC's Sangita Myska has been meeting people who say they've suffered from sex addiction, in order to understand whether it really exists, and if so, what it is.\n\nNeila's first job in the UK, after she arrived from Central Asia 15 years ago, was on the trading floor of a finance company dominated by what she describes as \"alpha-males, earning million-pound bonuses\".\n\nShe was one of only two women on the team, and her male colleagues would sometimes try to provoke them by playing pornography on the big screens that should have been showing market data.\n\n\"I didn't like it but I was at the start of my career, making my way in the city. It was good money and a glamorous job and I didn't want to lose that,\" she says.\n\n\"I knew the men in the office were looking for a reaction - they wanted to shock me. So I started going home and watching porn videos and DVDs on my own, so I could brush it off in the office.\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nBut quickly Neila got hooked. Her upbringing in a socially conservative family where sex was never discussed left her \"defenceless\" she says.\n\nEvery day she was thinking about how quickly she could get home to choose a film and a sex toy and start to masturbate.\n\nShe describes the process for me.\n\n\"It starts slowly. You get aroused. And then you just watch and simultaneously you switch on your equipment. All your senses are stimulated, watching something so exciting. Your mind goes elsewhere. You know it's not going to stop until you press the button. You know you're in control of it, of every aspect of your pleasure, and it gives you orgasms you just can't have with another human being - and certainly not a man.\n\n\"The whole process of masturbating and coming will take you a maximum of five to 10 minutes but you pull back because you don't want to exit this state you are in, which is basically like being intoxicated.\"\n\nUsing this technique, called \"edging\", she was watching porn for two to three hours, seven days a week.\n\nFind out more\n\nListen to Addicted to Sex by Sangita Myska on Radio 4 on 5 November at 20:00, repeated on 7 November at 11:00\n\nDownload the Addicted to Sex podcast - six full and very frank conversations Sangita recorded for the programme\n\nHer behaviour was compulsive, she says. If she couldn't watch porn, she craved it. She would also spend hours justifying it to herself, however detrimental it had become: \"Everything is safe, you're not going to catch an STD from watching porn, you don't have to wear make-up. Everything on your terms and with guaranteed results.\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nBut to continue getting those guaranteed results, the type of pornography she was watching took a darker turn.\n\n\"Usually you start watching vanilla porn - that means male-on-female or female-on-female, normal stuff - and after a while it doesn't work any more. Your body gets used to this release. It's similar to drug addiction, you need to increase the dose, so in order to increase it you watch more hardcore stuff.\n\n\"So you start watching anal, and then after a while that becomes a new normal for you so you need to watch something more hardcore and then you start searching for extreme stuff like gang bangs.\"\n\nThis was very uncomfortable for Neila, who began to worry that she was \"a perv\", as she puts it.\n\nThis issue of shame is a big one for every person who believes they are a sex addict. Shame simultaneously makes them want to hide away and drives them further into their compulsion. \"It's a cocktail of arousal and shame,\" Neila says.\n\nPorn also changed her attitude towards men. It meant that when she looked for a potential partner, their personalities and character became almost irrelevant.\n\n\"I would look through their shirts to see if they had a six-pack,\" she says. \"The average UK penis size wasn't enough for me... but it's not a good way to choose a life partner.\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nShe had a series of failed relationships, but it was the fact she felt compelled to watch films featuring violence against women to get a \"high\" that really began to terrify her.\n\n\"I had to ask myself, what's next? Will I end up watching a snuff movie just to satisfy my addiction?\" she says.\n\nNeila left the City and re-trained as a counsellor. Now in her 40s, she specialises in treating other patients who believe they are sex addicts. She trained at the Laurel Centre in central London, one of only a handful of clinics in the UK providing specialist support of this kind.\n\nTo get it you have to pay, sometimes hundreds of pounds per hour, because the NHS doesn't recognise sex addiction as a genuine condition. But it's estimated that hundreds, if not thousands, of people seek treatment in the UK each year, the vast majority of them men.\n\nDoes sex addiction exist?\n\nThe World Health Organization recently added Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder to its list of recognised disorders\n\nThe UK's National Health Service doesn't recognise sex addiction as an illness - and doesn't keep official statistics\n\nThe NHS web page on addiction notes that addiction is most commonly associated with gambling, drugs, alcohol and nicotine - and adds: \"being addicted to something means not having it causes withdrawal symptoms\"\n\nPrivate clinics in the UK claim that hundreds of people, if not thousands, approach them every year for help\n\nWhere to get help\n\nPart of the reason for this may be that women are more ashamed and find it harder to confess to the problem. But whatever the explanation, Paul is more typical of those seeking help for this condition - both because he's a man, and also because he got his thrills from having sex rather than watching porn.\n\nIn his 50s, tall and well-dressed in a crisp white shirt and jacket, Paul tells me his addiction began 30 years ago at university. He had a loving relationship with his girlfriend but one day, it seems, that wasn't enough for him.\n\n\"I loved her, I really did but for whatever reason I went to see a prostitute,\" he says. \"I was desperate for a thrilling sexual encounter and I knew that this was something I shouldn't be doing. I'd never be unfaithful to her with another girl but this felt like something different.\"\n\nWithin weeks, his behaviour had changed completely.\n\n\"I had about six girlfriends on the go at the same time and I was seeing two or three sex workers a week. It's almost like ordering a pizza in because I was hungry. I want something, I order it in, I forget about it.\"\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nHe says he knew something was very wrong. But just as he began considering whether or not to confide in someone, or even get help, he landed his first job in London - and found himself in an environment where this kind of behaviour was actually encouraged.\n\n\"Life was unbelievable. Flying around the world on Concorde, earning a lot of money, frequenting the lap-dancing bars of London - you find yourself going out for a sexual thrill with the people you work with,\" Paul remembers. \"So at this point [I'm thinking] 'Maybe I haven't got a problem, maybe I'm just a normal sort of guy?'\"\n\nEven then, a nagging doubt remained at the back of Paul's mind.\n\nHe would go with colleagues on a \"grand night out\" to the lap-dancing bars - so-called because each spent \u00a31,000 per night - on a Tuesday, perhaps, and maybe again on a Thursday. But Paul would be the only one going back on a Saturday.\n\nLike Neila, Paul says he began to \"chase the high\". So much so, that despite being heterosexual, for 10 years he also had sex with men.\n\n\"I switched completely from women to men. So all my physical acting out was with men. I can honestly say that I haven't got one ounce of homosexuality in me. It's really just seeking a higher thrill, that's what it came down to. And throughout this whole period I had some very very nice girlfriends.\"\n\nAgain, as with Neila, Paul says his behaviour was compulsive. If he wasn't having sex, he craved it. And again it wasn't reaching orgasm that was the goal - it was the set of behaviours around it that he was hooked on. Like Neila, he would stretch out the experience for hours at a time.\n\n\"The thrill is the build-up, the anticipation of what you're going to be doing\u2026 the very last thing that you want to do is to ejaculate because at that point the whole process is over.\"\n\nIt took Paul a long time to get hooked on porn, after first discovering it at the age of 12. \"I did come across some magazines in my parents' house. I found them hidden when my parents were out. So it was a reasonably early exposure to porn. But, if I'm honest I can't remember feeling sexual excitement.\" That changed when high-speed internet arrived. At that point his focus shifted from sex workers to online porn, which he would watch for hours on end.\n\nImage copyright Karen Charmaine Chanakira\n\nPaul has received long-term support from the Laurel Centre, and now believes he is well on the way to recovery. He has not used sex workers for several years or watched porn for months, he says.\n\nHis goal is to settle down with one woman.\n\n\"It's a lonely disease\u2026 You get to the point where you realise that you've got a limited amount time on the planet. I've never had an enjoyable sexual relationship with someone I care for and love. That's the one thing that's been missing for 30 years.\"\n\nIn June, the World Health Organization officially recognised what it calls Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder in its international classification of diseases. Therapists I've spoken to say that even though this falls short of classifying the condition as an addiction, it may encourage the UK government to provide counselling services on the NHS.\n\nIn the last few weeks I have spoken to many other people who believe they are sex addicts, and I no longer believe it's important whether the condition is called an addiction or not - because all of them clearly need help to solve a problem that is wrecking their lives.\n\nWhen it comes to Weinstein, and the suspicion that checking into a sex addiction clinic could signal an attempt to dodge responsibility for his behaviour, the people I've spoken to understood the difference between consensual sex and rape even at the height of their compulsive behaviour. None, as far as I know, has committed a crime. In my view, sex addicts primarily hurt themselves and their partners - sex predators abuse victims and attempt to disguise it.\n\nYou can hear Sangita Myska's documentary, Addicted to Sex on BBC Radio 4 on 5 November at 20:00, repeated on 7 November at 11:00.

The shoulder can ride up or the player can dip into contact and either way you are bringing the possibility of a high tackle.\n\nOf more concern for Farrell was whether his arms were involved in the tackle or if it was a straight and illegal use of the shoulder.\n\nYou could see that there was an attempt with his left arm, but at high pace and from the awkward position that Farrell found himself in, it was difficult to claim that he was wrapping his man.\n\nIt appeared there wasn't enough there to keep the destiny of the match in England's hands.\n\nFarrell's left arm was the focus of much of the post-match debate over the legality of his tackle on Andre Esterhuizen\n\nGardner could easily have given a penalty on the video review and Handre Pollard may have kicked it to the win the match.\n\nBut there is no way that Eddie Jones will be telling Owen Farrell to change that part of his game.\n\nYou can't help the way you are and nor should you - that is why you were picked in the first place. That physicality is the something extra that Farrell brings to that position. Neither Ford nor Danny Cipriani, the two rivals for his position, can match it.\n\nHow England's last four fly-halves have fared Ford v SA (9 Jun) Ford v SA (16 Jun) Cipraini v SA (23 Jun) Farrell v SA (3 Nov) Passes 18 23 10 29 Runs 4 6 2 4 Metres made 3 30 16 6 Tackles made/missed 9/3 3/1 5/3 8/2 Points 0 0 0 9\n\nA decisive 10\n\nThat controversial tackle was the final act of a really influential final 10 minutes from Farrell.\n\nOn 72 minutes, he showed rock-steady nerves and technique to land what proved the match-winning penalty from out near the touchline.\n\nThen, in the 79th minute with the Boks pressing on the England line, he stripped the ball from second row Lood De Jager's grasp to earn a crucial turnover.\n\nJust like the hit on Esterhuizen, he was aggressive and furiously competitive. He went in chest high, looking to change the course of the match.\n\nAnyone running into Owen Farrell has to be aware that he will try something more than just a tackle. De Jager had not done his due diligence and came in too upright, without protecting the ball properly, and paid the price.\n\nOwen Farrell goes in on the chest of the slow-moving Lood de Jager...\n\n...uses his opposite hand to rip at the ball...\n\n... and causes the Springbok to spill possession\n\nWe should not be surprised any more. We should almost expect these match-turning contributions from him.\n\nHe has proven himself in the crucible of Lions Tests, Six Nations contests and Champions Cup and Premiership finals, and clearly relishes leading from the front in the crucial moments.\n\nWhat he has developed in his game since his Test debut six years ago is the composure and vision that helped him make the break that he did in the 55th minute.\n\nThere appeared little on as he received the ball in midfield, facing a well set up South Africa defence.\n\nHowever, Farrell's opposite number Handre Pollard second-guessed him, rushing up to intercept a possible pass to Henry Slade.\n\nFarrell feinted to deliver a flat pass to Henry Slade, but spotting the dogleg in the South African defence out of his peripheral vision, held onto the ball instead.\n\nHis dummy and dart took him inside Damian de Allende and through the gap between the centre and second row RG Snyman.\n\nFarrell could actually have held onto the ball longer to make more of the overlap. He was into fresh air and open space, but opted to offload to Slade, perhaps because of a tap from Snyman that made him think a cover tackle was coming in.\n\nThis was only Farrell's third start as England fly-half since the 2015 World Cup, although his 26th overall in his 62 England caps.\n\nThat running threat was not something he had during his previous stints in the role.\n\nBut - as Cipriani and, to a lesser extent, Ford show - it helps hold an opposition defence from drifting up fast on his outside runners.\n\nI suspect Farrell will have plenty more starts at 10 for England before, and during, Japan 2019.\n\nJeremy Guscott was speaking to BBC Sport's Mike Henson.", "Image copyright Reuters\n\nThe UK government has been told by Ireland to \"stand by its commitments\" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be \"worth the paper it's written on\".\n\nThe border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides.\n\nWith time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side.\n\nThe European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a \"hard\" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland.\n\nIt is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states.\n\nThere have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland.\n\nBut unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place.\n\nThere is disagreement on whether the \"backstop\" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nTory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point.\n\nWriting in The Sun, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an \"absolute stinker\" of a deal and warned of a \"surrender to Brussels\" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come.\n\nMrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be \"strictly time limited\".\n\nThis, however, is not the view of the EU.\n\nOn Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing.\n\n\"Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,\" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand.\n\nAnd Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding \"backstop\" to apply \"unless and until\" it is superseded by a new agreement.\n\n\"I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,\" he said.\n\nMr Varadkar described the UK as a \"divided kingdom\" over Brexit, saying this made it \"very difficult to come to an agreement\".\n\nWhile the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe prime minister says she does not think a \"backstop\" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed.\n\nMrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning \"to take stock of the progress being made\", Downing Street said, adding that: \"In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end.\"\n\nThe Irish government said Mrs May had \"raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop\", and that Mr Varadkar had \"indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop\".\n\nLawyers call for referendum\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum\n\nMeanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held.\n\nAmong the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice.\n\nThey say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community.\n\nIn the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said.\n\nBy contrast, during the 2016 vote, \"the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown\", said the letter.\n\n\"Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality.\"\n\nThe UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a \"mutually advantageous\" deal with the EU.\n\n\"The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,\" she said."]
