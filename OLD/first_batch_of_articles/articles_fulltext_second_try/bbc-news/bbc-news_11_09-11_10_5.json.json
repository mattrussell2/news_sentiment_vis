He then turned off the engine.\n\n\"Once the weight was taken, he then did not wait for the officials to push the car off the scales, and while the stewards accept that he may have misunderstood the indication from the official, he then re-fired the car and drove off the scales, which is not the procedure because it can damage the scales, which in this case he did.\n\n\"While no-one was hurt by the scales being thrown out from behind the car, and while the stewards accept that the driver did not drive off the scales in a reckless manner, the procedure is established exactly to prevent damage to the scales or a potentially dangerous situation, which is exactly what was caused.\"\n\nIn the end, the stewards decided to issue only a reprimand and a \u20ac25,000 fine - not a major problem for a man earning something in the region of \u20ac30m.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device 'F1 Breakdown: Has Lewis Hamilton had it easy?'\n\nContrary to the FIA's initial communication, Vettel did stop the engine when on the scales, and they were able to properly weigh the car.\n\nThis is probably what stopped Vettel receiving a further punishment. If a driver ignores a request for his car to be weighed, the normal penalty is to be sent to the back of the grid - ensuring a racing car is the correct weight is one of the fundamentals of motorsport, as weight has a significant effect on lap time.\n\nIt was not hard to see why Vettel was annoyed, but at the same time, rules are rules. It's not up to the competitors to decide whether they comply with them. As Fernando Alonso put it: \"It's not ideal because the weather can affect things. Maybe the rule is not the best. But it is the way it is.\"\n\nIt was the latest example of situations in which Vettel has let his emotions get the better of him, or made misjudgements in the heat of battle.\n\nHe has shouted and sworn at the team over the radio at least twice this year in high-pressure moments. There was the notorious incident in Baku in 2017, when he deliberately drove into Lewis Hamilton because he erroneously believed the Mercedes driver had 'brake-tested' him.\n\nAnd then there is the series of mistakes he has made in the heat of battle this season that have had a potentially decisive effect on the championship.\n\nVettel has seemed a little frayed and worn down by the intensity of the battle this season and by what looks like a feeling that he needs to guide the team more than should be necessary at times. He has already admitted he needs to have a think over the winter about how to have a cleaner season in 2019.\n\nWhile he's at it, he could do worse than work out a way to stop his emotional responses being triggered into over-reaction so easily when in the car.\n\nHamilton is on pole, but Ferrari have seemingly established a better strategy\n\nFerrari 'favourites' for the race\n\nThe weighbridge incident happened because Ferrari decided to call Vettel and team-mate Kimi Raikkonen in after doing just one exploratory lap to fit the 'soft' tyres rather than the 'super-softs' everyone else was using.\n\nWhy were they so keen to do this? The super-softs are faster over a lap, but more fragile in the race, and Ferrari wanted to start the race on the softs, and decided to take the risk that the rain would hold off long enough to let them get a lap in later than everyone else.\n\nMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: \"Ferrari took a big gamble in qualifying, switching tyres when the rain was imminent, and it paid off.\n\n\"They are on the more robust tyre for the race and they have a disadvantage at the start but a big advantage over the first 10 or 15 laps, which in our models show them as the favourite [for the win].\n\n\"We did not take that risk because we thought it was disproportionate. But we understand that Ferrari where they are now and their only way of staying in the fight for the constructors' championship is to do things differently and take risks and today it paid off.\"\n\nHaving lost the drivers' title to Hamilton, at least partly because of their own and their driver's errors, Ferrari still have a chance of the constructors' championship. But they are 55 points behind and need to score at least 12 more points than Mercedes in Sunday's race to keep the fight alive to the final race in Abu Dhabi in two weeks' time.\n\nThis, they felt, was their best chance of doing so. \"Maybe it can make a difference,\" Vettel said.\n\nAnother exercise in tyre management\n\nFerrari made their tyre decision because they believe the 'soft' will be much more effective in the expected hotter conditions in the race.\n\nVettel already experienced blistering in Friday practice and Wolff said avoiding this phenomenon - where the surface overheats and bubbles up - will be key in the race.\n\n\"The biggest struggle is going to be keeping those tyres alive, not making them blister,\" he said. \"With the disadvantage of the super-soft versus the soft, we are on the back foot a little bit. It is about carefully managing this tyre to the end of the race. That is the story of the motor race tomorrow.\"\n\nThis has become a recurring theme this year, and it has meant drivers lapping as much as six or seven seconds off the pace in races just to make their tyres last the required distance.\n\nShould this be the case, Wolff was asked? \"No, it shouldn't,\" he replied.\n\nThe drivers have tired of this, and have started to up the pressure on tyre supplier Pirelli to do something about it - as they did over the winter of 2015/16. It succeeded with new tyres for 2017, when drivers were able to push more, but this year has seen a step backwards after Pirelli was asked to produce softer tyres in an unsuccessful attempt to provoke more pit stops.\n\nWolff said: \"Pirelli had a good meeting with the drivers yesterday. We have expressed our support for Pirelli because we know it is a difficult task to manage.\n\n\"But in the past years we have simply asked the wrong things from them, by making the compounds softer and softer and softer, trying to trigger degradation and therefore more pit stops, the strategists have come up that the fastest race time is about managing those tyres and trying to achieve a one-stop or a two-stop.\n\n\"Completely the wrong direction. We need robust tyres, which Pirelli is perfectly able to produce. They just need to be given the right objectives and then the drivers can push the tyre harder, they can stay in the wake of the car in front, and we will not see blistering or deg that causes these seven seconds you've mentioned.\"\n\nThat is music to the ears of anyone who thinks F1 should be about drivers pushing to the limit at all times, and that Pirelli's thermally sensitive tyres have harmed the spectacle of the sport.\n\nAlonso has set his sights on winning motorsport's informal 'triple crown'\n\nAnother Indy tilt for Alonso\n\nFernando Alonso's Formula 1 career is fizzling out in a most unsatisfactory way, because of the abject performance of his McLaren car.\n\nOn Saturday, the McLaren was the slowest car in Interlagos, and he was 18th, his only satisfaction that he had beaten his team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne - for the 20th time in 20 races this year - and the Williams of Lance Stroll.\n\nHe expects a similar struggle at his final race in Abu Dhabi. \"We will put in a lot of emotions and a lot of effort and we will be out in Q1 because there are no miracles from one race to another,\" he said.\n\nBut on Saturday came confirmation of a reason for Alonso to look forward to the future with optimism when it was confirmed by McLaren that he will be racing again at the Indy 500 next year.\n\nMcLaren say they will run the car and that it will not be a satellite operation of another team, as it was when Alonso made his first attempt on Indy in 2017 with a McLaren-branded car from Andretti Autosport.\n\nBeyond that, McLaren refused to reveal any further details, although it can be taken as read that Alonso's car will have a Chevrolet engine, as Honda, the other supplier, are refusing to supply him, following the fractious nature of their relationship in F1 from 2015-17.\n\nThere was a twinkle in Alonso's eye at the news conference after the announcement.\n\n\"Indy is very special,\" he said. \"It's completely unpredictable until the last 20 laps and the whole game is the first 180 laps to be in position in the last 20 laps to compete for the win. It does not compare with any other race in motorsport.\"\n\nThat makes just four races Alonso is officially down for next year so far - Indy and the final three world endurance championship races in the 2018-19 'super-season'.\n\nThat's not a lot for a man who has admitted he would be happy to race every weekend. Isn't there a danger he will be bored?\n\n\"I will do many more but you will know step-by-step,\" he said. \"Today is the first one. Apart from the races, three races of WEC, there are four tests for those so if you add the three race weekends of racing and four weeks of testing it is already seven until June plus the test of IndyCar and two weeks of the Indy 500.\n\n\"If you see the calendar until June there are maybe two weeks off so even if it seems not too many races there are a lot of preparations for those races. I am looking forward and it is good to be back at Indy.\"", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Leicester City boss Claude Puel is \"proud\" of his players after they marked an emotional return to the King Power Stadium for the first time since the death of owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha with a draw against Burnley.\n\nMATCH REPORT: Leicester City 0-0 Burnley\n\nWatch highlights of Saturday's Premier League games on Match of the Day at 22:30 GMT on BBC One and on the BBC Sport website.", "Further work at the site in Saqqara is planned.

They were hard at the back, hard off the ruck and hard off the line and really squeezed us.\n\n\"They put some great pressure on our line-out and we struggled, but we got into the game on the back of our scrum, which was very good.\n\n\"There's lots to work on. It's not as surprising as, I suppose, it would have been had we had a full preparation or we hadn't had late changes.\n\nBut that's a good way for us to try to cope and test ourselves against a really good side, which we know Argentina are.\"\n\nIreland captain Rory Best: \"We were probably a little bit slow out of the blocks and they were winning the 50-50s and we had to really dig deep and grind parts of that first half out.\n\n\"There's a lot to work on and we know next week against New Zealand is a big step up and we know we are going to have to be a lot better.\n\nIreland have won four matches in a row but next face world champions New Zealand\n\n\"We want to go out and win and keep this home record we have.

He was still a young boy when his father died.\n\nHistorian Dr D\u00f3nal McAnallen, who has extensively researched the subject of GAA members enlisting to fight in World War One (an area which has long been the source of controversy given the GAA's ban on members of the crown forces), explains the Manning name had already begun to gain prominence in Belfast Gaelic circles before William came to the fore.\n\n\"William's cousin, also named William Manning and living in the Falls area, but five years his senior, had won Ulster hurling and football medals in the 1900s. Young William would go on to win an Antrim Senior Football Championship medal with the John Mitchels club in Belfast in 1912, playing alongside his brother John,\" said Dr McAnallen.\n\n\"William of course played a key part in Antrim's greatest-ever football victory - their All Ireland semi-final defeat of Kerry. He was described in the press as a 'remarkably clever exponent of half and three-quarter-back play'.\"\n\nManning's sporting prowess wasn't confined to football, as he was also a member of the Seaghan-an-D\u00edomais club, who won the 1915 Antrim Hurling Championship.\n\nHis sporting career was cut short, when in 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers regiment of the British Army. It is not clear what caused him to sign up to fight on the Western Front, but Dr McAnallen suspects money may have been a factor:\n\n\"One likely explanation is that the family income was low, with his widowed mother having two young stepsons to look after as well. What we do know is that west Belfast had one of the highest rates of enlistment in Ireland, and unemployment was high in the area.\"\n\nSuch was his popularity locally, his leaving for war was reported in the press, with Ireland's Saturday Night newspaper commenting:\n\n\"There passed through the city en route for the front, on Wednesday, 'Bill' Manning, who will be remembered as the former Shauns, Ollamh Fodhla and Dalcassian player. The day previous this the one-time All-Ireland hurler and footballer was entertained at a farewell party by several of his friends.\"\n\nIrish soldiers fighting in World War One\n\nManning proved to be a formidable soldier, rising to the rank of Lance Sergeant. His progress was followed by the local press in Belfast, and he allegedly even wrote a letter informing readers he was still alive and well.\n\nBut when the Germans launched a major offensive in the Spring of 1918, Manning was on front-line duty near St Quentin on 27 March when he was hit by a machine-gun bullet and was killed instantly.\n\nThe affection in which he was held by his comrades, and their grief at his death, was reflected in the words his commanding officer, Captain G. Craddock, wrote to William's mother:\n\n\"He died without any pain, hit by a machine-gun bullet. He was my platoon sergeant for some time and I always placed the greatest confidence and trust in him. I don't think I've ever felt so knocked out about anyone's death.\"\n\n\"I feel I am expressing the opinion of officers, NCOs and men in saying that he was one of the finest men it's been our lot to meet.\"\n\nA local newspaper reports the news of William Manning's death\n\nA number of GAA stars from across Ireland lost their lives in the war, including Wexford's star full-forward Jimmy Rossiter, who enlisted in the Royal Irish Guards and was killed at the Battle of Loos in September 1915. But those GAA members who returned home after the war were reluctant to discuss their military service for fear of being shunned in their communities.\n\nDr Richard McElligott, a lecturer in Modern Irish History at UCD and author of Forging a Kingdom: The GAA in Kerry 1884-1934, believes to fully understand their reticence it is important to remember how much Ireland had changed politically during the course of the war.\n\n\"Given the utter sea-change in political sentiment following 1916, these men, like thousands of their fellow Irish veterans, returned to an Ireland utterly different from the one they had left\", he says.\n\n\"They were an uncomfortable legacy of a complex period. So in that prevailing atmosphere it was natural that many kept their military service a secret. The GAA itself spent the next century writing its own role into the story of Easter 1916 and the subsequent War of Independence. The story of some of its players fighting in a British uniform, under a British flag was a difficult truth, easier erased than confronted.\"\n\n1916 had been a tumultuous year in Ireland's history, with the country in a process of change that permanently altered its political and social landscape. Resentment towards British rule was growing in Ireland, with rebels plotting an independent Irish Republic.\n\nOn 24 April 1916 the Easter Rising began, when roughly 1,000 rebels seeking independence surprised the British Army by taking over high profile buildings in Dublin.\n\nThe Rising ended with the execution of 15 of its leaders, which led to a change in public opinion in Ireland, with a surge of sympathy for the rebels. The GAA epitomised the rise in Irish nationalism.\n\nEngraved memorial remembering Armistice Day 1918. Words by Terence Poulter of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the regiment William Manning served in\n\nBut in recent years, and now with the Armistice Day centenary, the GAA has made moves to acknowledge the significant role William Manning and many other of their former members played both on the sports field and in World War One.\n\nDr McElligott says these initiatives have been welcomed.\n\n\"It is good to see the GAA now moving, in some small way, to acknowledge these men's places in its complex history. They have been releasing a short online biography of 11 members who fought in the war during each of the 11 days approaching the Armistice Day centenary.\"\n\nHe believes the story of men like William Manning needs to simply be acknowledged.\n\n\"That's all any historical commemoration can really do. It is not about trying to desperately pretend something did not happen. It is about accepting the reality of our history, trying to learn from it and moving on. \"", "After their worst top-flight start for 120 years, Newcastle have now won their last two matches\n\nNewcastle beat Bournemouth 2-1 to record back-to-back wins for the first time since April and move out of the Premier League relegation zone.\n\nNeil Warnock marked his 100th game in charge of Cardiff with a late win over Brighton, West Ham came from behind to draw at Huddersfield, while Watford also left it late to earn a point at Southampton.

all without scoring a goal - has coincided with the loss of several key players, with the absence of Scotland international Steven Naismith and fellow striker Uche Ikpeazu being particularly felt during four games without a goal.\n\nSo it was to be again against a well-organised visiting side they had not scored more than once against in their last six meetings.\n\nLevein made four changes from the side that were thumped 5-0 last weekend by Celtic, but it was counterpart Steve Clarke who sprung the bigger surprises.\n\nJamie MacDonald was replaced with Daniel Bachmann despite it being a week when he was recalled to the Scotland squad, the goalkeeper perhaps paying for last weekend's loss to Aberdeen.\n\nNorthern Ireland winger Jordan Jones was also dropped to the bench and Scotland right-back Stephen O'Donnell was an absentee through injury.\n\nJones' replacement, Mikael Ndoli, was immediately involved as Hearts had the first of a series of appeals for a penalty turned down after his challenge on Callumn Morrison.\n\nKilmarnock raced up the other end and Burke's shot was blocked superbly by Zlamal after the winger was found in the clear by Aaron Tshibola's defence-splitting pass.\n\nThat set the tone for the game - flowing moves, quick counter-attacks, some clever play but few clear-cut chances.\n\nDespite their recent hiccups, Clarke's side had only lost one of their six away games this season and they put on another resolute display on the road.\n\nWhen Arnaud Djoum did split the visiting defence with a fine pass just before the break, Bachmann did well to save from Ben Garuccio, while Steven MacLean was thwarted by an offside flag when Hearts finally did find the net.\n\nThe stage was set for Millen to make the most of his chance to start thanks to O'Donnell's injury as he beat Zlamal to score his first goal for Kilmarnock since his surprise move from amateurs Queen's Park this summer.\n\nKillie steadfast, Hearts must regroup - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's Brian McLaughlin at Tynecastle Stadium\n\nWith neither side recording a win on their previous three matches this was always going to be a tight affair and, over the piece, it was Kilmarnock who were able to make the best of the few clear-cut opportunities.\n\nDespite his advancing years, Kilmarnock striker Kris Boyd showed throughout that he is more than a handful for Premiership defences, but it was the Kilmarnock defence who were the real heroes on the day.\n\nKirk Broadfoot and Stuart Findlay had an outstanding 90 minutes, with Greg Taylor and Millen, who raced from one end of the pitch to the other to score the only goal of the game, making up the back four for Killie.\n\nHearts will play better and lose games, but without the services of Christophe Berra, John Souttar and talisman Steven Naismith, they lose a critical part of their team.\n\nThe international break is coming at the right time for Levein to give his beleaguered squad some time off and come back refreshed for what will be a busy spell of fixtures up to the end of December.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Fans and players pay emotional tribute at Leicester\n\nLeicester City's emotional return to the King Power Stadium for the first time since the death of owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in a helicopter crash outside the stadium ended in a 0-0 draw with Burnley.\n\nIt was a poignant occasion -

former director of football Steve Walsh and defender Robert Huth. Former Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, a hugely popular figure, was another paying his own tribute.\n\nIt was a gesture of thanks for the comfort the supporters have given him and his family - and also a real show of unity for players, staff, fans and all who played their part in this remarkable story.\n\nJamie Vardy went closest for Leicester in the first half when his shot was cleared off the line\n\nBurnley play their part\n\nBurnley's supporters played their own part in the pre-game tributes - and when the action started, in a football context, they will be pleased with the outcome.\n\nAfter conceding 13 goals in their last three Premier League games, manager Sean Dyche knew he had to stop the rot - although it did not look likely as Burnley were fortunate to come through a wretched first 30 minutes when Leicester dominated but could not make their supremacy count.\n\nAs Leicester tired, the emotion not just of this day but the last fortnight making its impact, Burnley started to look more composed and came through the second half with relatively few scares, even creating the odd opening for themselves with Chris Wood squandering the best chance.\n\nThis was a tough day for Leicester, the city and the football club.

It did disrupt the flow of the game - the long delay - and obviously the players were concerned so that didn't help,\" said Howe.\n\n\"I was pleased with aspects of the second half, we were on the front foot more and we had the ball in some dangerous areas.

As the backs massed left off a ruck, Ben Youngs threw a long blindside pass out to Ashton on the right wing for the maverick to sprint and slide into the corner - a dream return on his first start since 2012.\n\nThe old stadium was alive and although Farrell's attempted conversion from the touchline came back off the post, he dropped back into the pocket off another bulldozing foray from his forwards to slot the drop-goal for 8-0.\n\nThe dominant nation in world rugby were beset with uncharacteristic errors, over-throwing line-outs, putting kicks long, spilling high balls, and England hit them again as they sat on the ropes.\n\nElliot Daly stuck a penalty into touch by the corner, and off the line-out the forwards mauled like a runaway tractor, with Jonny May, Henry Slade and Farrell all piling in as the white wedge splintered the black-shirted defence and careered over the line.\n\nFarrell's conversion made it 15-0, just as it had been in England's famous victory in 2012. But even with the talismanic Sonny Bill Williams off injured once again, New Zealand came tearing back.\n\nThe forwards punched to within a metre of the try-line before centre Jack Goodhue put Damian McKenzie away with a cute inside ball, and Barrett's conversion was a formality.\n\nIt quietened the crowd, and when Farrell put the re-start straight into touch, it left the door ajar again.\n\nAnother series of carries forced England to infringe in front of the posts, Barrett knocked over the penalty and it was suddenly a five-point game at the break.\n\nBalance shifts in All Blacks' favour\n\nDamian McKenzie dived over just before half-time\n\nThe comeback should have been complete within moments of the second half. McKenzie stepped Farrell and found Aaron Smith on his inside, but with the try-line open, the scum-half put the killer pass just behind Ardie Savea and the ball went loose.\n\nYet England were reeling, and when Barrett slapped over a drop-goal from a penalty advantage there was relief that it was three points rather than seven and the lead had narrowed yet held.\n\nBack they came. Two penalties were kicked to the corner but this time the visiting defence held the rolling maul at bay, and then Kyle Sinckler knocked on as his team threatened a third try.\n\nIt was flawed but breathless. With McKenzie sticking a clearing kick straight into touch to gift England an attacking line-out on the Kiwi 22, replacement hooker Jamie George wasted it with a dummy throw.\n\nOn the hour, Barrett's second penalty after the English defence went offside finally put the All Blacks ahead 16-15. The home crowd were now quiet, the fear of what might follow from the world champions latent in the late afternoon air.\n\nJones sensed the balance of power had shifted and threw on fresh props plus scrum-half Danny Care and Lawes into the back row.\n\nStill the rain came down and still neither could land the killer blow. Farrell's cross-kick won another attacking line-out, Brodie Retallick nicked the throw and New Zealand went 50m downfield at pace before knocking on.\n\nWith Ben Te'o going off, Farrell switched to centre and George Ford to 10, but England were pinned in their own half.\n\nThen, with five minutes to go, they thought they had it won it. Underhill seized the loose ball off Lawes' charge-down and bolted for the corner, wrong-footing Barrett before diving over the line.\n\nBut television match official Marius Jonker correctly ruled that Lawes had been an inch offside, and when May sliced through down the left, that final opening was lost to a knock-on.\n\nSam Underhill's late try was chalked off after Courtney Lawes was ruled to be offside\n\n'A brilliant step-up for England' - analysis\n\nMatt Dawson, former England scrum-half on BBC Radio 5 live:\n\nI think everyone expected New Zealand to be far too drilled, far too fit, far too motivated and to demolish England.\n\nIt was nothing of the sort. Yes, New Zealand were poor today and weren't at their best, and we all know if you're going to beat them you need that luck on your side.\n\nThis is still a brilliant step-up for England, especially seeing how poor they'd been in previous games this year. They went toe-to-toe with the best and I said it at the time - three points is everything. When you're under the posts, you take the points and it's those fine margins that we need to get right.\n\nBrian Moore, former England hooker on BBC TV:\n\n\"England's downfall lay in the second half and particularly the line-out.\n\n\"You have to give them credit for limiting the All Blacks to a single point, though. They deserve a lot of credit for their efforts in the second half, but their line-out let them down.\"\n\nMan of the match - Sam Underhill (England)\n\nBrought in to stop the fearsome All Blacks' attack in its wake, Sam Underhill was everywhere in the first half-hour, and so close to snatching a famous win at the death.\n\nLine-ups\n\nEngland: Daly; Ashton (Nowell 68), Slade, Te'o (Ford 72), May; Farrell, Youngs (Care 62); Moon (Hepburn 57), Hartley (George 40), Sinckler (Williams 57), Itoje, Kruis (Ewels 66), Shields (Lawes 65), Underhill, Wilson.\n\nNew Zealand: McKenzie (Mo'unga 62); Smith, Goodhue, Williams (Crotty 31), Ioane; B Barrett, A Smith (Perenara 62); K Tu'inukuafe (Tuungafasi 56), Taylor (Coles 44), Franks (Laulala 44), Whitelock, Retallick, Squire (S Barrett 52), Savea (Todd 67), Read.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Dundee 1-1 St Mirren\n\nSt Mirren were wrongly awarded a penalty in their draw at Dens Park, insists Dundee boss Jim McIntyre.\n\nSimeon Jackson put the Buddies ahead from the spot against the run of play but Kenny Miller levelled with his first Dundee goal as the Premiership's bottom two ended all square.\n\n\"It's definitely not a penalty,\" lamented McIntyre.\n\n\"It's very soft but the reaction was great and the most important thing was my players' response.\"\n\nDundee remain bottom of the table, a point behind St Mirren, with the hosts ending a run of five defeats, while the Buddies' losing streak had stood at seven.\n\n\"We deserved to win,\" added McIntyre. \"We had the stronger chances.\n\n\"We had a far better tempo, the way I want to play, and got ourselves into some really dangerous positions.\"\n\nSt Mirren manager Oran Kearney was disappointed to see his side fall out of the game but thought there should have been a second penalty for a challenge on Danny Mullen late on.\n\n\"Danny is between the full-back and the goal, he's on the six yard line about to drill the ball and as he swings contact is made,\" he said.\n\n\"For 25 minutes after we scored we got the wrong reaction. Rabbit in the headlights possibly, 'what's happened here?', that type of thing.\"\n\nHonours even at Dens Park\n\nThis game could have gone either way as a spectacle - a tense nervous affair, or would both sides go for it? Thankfully, it was the latter and it made for a good watch.\n\nDundee knew they needed to do something about their toothlessness - zero shots on target in their past two matches - and they created the better chances initially. But that must have made going behind all the more galling.\n\nThe nature of the St Mirren penalty will also rankle. Jackson went down far too easily under virtually no challenge at all from Cammy Kerr. Unperturbed, Jackson dusted himself down to slam the spot-kick into the net via the crossbar.\n\nIt would be an eventful afternoon for the striker who was later booked for simulation.\n\nJackson scored his second goal for St Mirren\n\nDundee responded in the best possible way. Benjamin Kallman's ball across the box arrived at the feet of captain Miller, who slammed the ball home high into the net. With the roar that went up around this old stadium it sounded almost as if Dundee had won the Premiership.\n\nOverall, the Dark Blues had the better of things in the second half but they just could not find another goal. Both sides deserve credit for putting so much into the match.\n\n'Stats remain grim for both sides' - analysis\n\nWinning this match would have meant so much for both sides. Equally, losing would have been enormously significant.\n\nThe nature of how both sides played must have pleased both managers. There was little sign of the pressure that you might expect from two sides struggling for form and results, most of the play was open and enjoyable to watch.\n\nBut the stats remain grim for both sides. Dundee now with just one win in 14 games, St Mirren with zero wins in 13 matches.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: St Johnstone 4-0 Hamilton Academical\n\nRampant St Johnstone made it five wins in a row as they brushed past Hamilton Academical at McDiarmid Park.\n\nTommy Wright's men have not conceded during their winning run, and were rarely troubled by the visitors.\n\nMurray Davidson gave the hosts the lead after good play from Drey Wright on the wing, before Wright's cross deflected off Ziggy Gordon to double the lead.\n\nMatty Kennedy slipped in a third before being denied a fourth by the crossbar, but David Wotherspoon soon tapped in.\n\nThe win moves St Johnstone just three points behind leaders Hearts and into fourth place in the Premiership.\n\nFor Hamilton, though, they failed to make it back-to-back wins, something they have not managed since March.\n\nIn-form Saints\n\nWith the Perth side in sizzling form, the international break could not be coming at a worse time for them. Their next two games are against sides above them in the table - Kilmarnock and Hearts - and Saints will be chomping at the bit to get a hold of them.\n\nTheir eagerness showed in the opening minutes in Perth as Tony Watt, Wright and Davidson all peppered the Accies goal. Liam Craig and David Wotherspoon also headed wide as Saints continued to press Hamilton back.\n\nMartin Canning's side had soaked up Livingston's pressure the week before and hit them on the break to take the three points. But this time they simply could not fend St Johnstone off.\n\nThe impressive Wright nutmegged Ziggy Gordon on the right hand side, drove to the by-line, and cut back to Davidson, who side-footed home the opener.\n\nThe second goal had a large degree of luck about it. Wright attempted a cross, but it deflected off Accies defender Gordon and gave his own goalkeeper Gary Woods no chance.\n\nHamilton cannot stem the tide\n\nIt may have been fortunate, but it was no more than Saints deserved. Hamilton were being outclassed, yet had Steven Boyd put away an early chance when he elected to shoot first time rather than take a touch, the game could have taken a different turn.\n\nInstead, their confidence waned. Saints' Wright, a summer signing from Colchester, grew in stature as the game went on. At one point he drove through the middle, picked a spot, and was inches away from rippling the net with a long-range strike.\n\nKennedy added a third when Watt's through ball hit the leg of a defender and landed nicely for him, and he rolled the ball under Woods.\n\nKennedy also rattled the crossbar, but the fourth goal soon arrived as Dougie Imrie was left to defend against three Saints players, and Wotherspoon duly lapped up the space to tap home.\n\nSam Kelly could at least have grabbed a consolation for Hamilton and ended Saints goalkeeper Zander Clark's run of clean sheets, but his shot from the edge of the six-yard box was deflected wide, before Rakish Bingham headed the corner off the top of the bar.\n\nZander Clark sets a new record - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's John Barnes at McDiarmid Park\n\nThis was another impressive performance from St Johnstone as they continued their recent good run of form.\n\nDrey Wright caught the eye on the Saints right wing as he gave Ziggy Gordon an afternoon to forget. His touch, control and deliveries into the box caused Accies numerous problems and two of them in the first half led to Saints goals.\n\nThe former Colchester player was positive in everything he did. With him on one wing and the industrious David Wotherspoon on the other, they complimented the front two of Tony Watt and Matty Kennedy who never gave the Accies central defenders a minute's peace as they were dragged out of position.\n\nThis was possibly Zander Clark's quietest afternoon in recent matches as he recorded his fifth successive clean sheet to set a record for a St Johnstone goalkeeper in the top flight. He has now gone seven hours and 36 minutes without conceding a goal.\n\nHamilton contributed to their own downfall with a woeful performance in contrast to the display against Livingston the previous week.\n\nThe tannoy announcer also got into the spirit of the occasion with \"Hawaii five-o\" belting out at the end.\n\nSt Johnstone's David Wotherspoon added a fourth goal in the second half\n\nPost-match reaction\n\nSt Johnstone assistant manager Alex Clelland: \"We asked them to be better than last week and to have a good start to the game, and we certainly did that.\n\n\"I don't think he [Drey Wright] actually started that great today, but when he started going past players and getting balls into Matty Kennedy we really looked a threat.\"\n\nHamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: \"Second best all over the park.

Well Mourinho managed that in his early days at United.\n\nFirst, he was in trouble over comments about referee Anthony Taylor before the game with Liverpool, and he was sent to the Old Trafford stands by Mark Clattenburg five days later.\n\nOn that occasion, during a 0-0 draw with Burnley, he was accused of using abusive or insulting words to the officials in or around the tunnel area at half-time.\n\nJose Mourinho speaks directly into a TV camera following United's win over Newcastle in October\n\nHe's funny again\n\nMost would keep their mouths shut but Mourinho wasn't afraid to make a dig at the FA in a post-match interview after Wednesday's win over Juventus.\n\nWhen questioned by a reporter about his celebration, he replied: 'Do you speak Italian?' When the interviewer answered 'no' he told her to ask the FA as \"they would translate\".\n\nBut that wasn't all. He then burst into a laugh the kind of which you can't help but respond to in exactly the same way.\n\nMourinho is once again looking sharp. He's got a smile on his face (sometimes) and things are starting to look up for United.\n\nAll it needs now is for him to re-establish a bitter feud with a rival manager, like the Wenger years.\n\nPep Guardiola and the Manchester derby anyone?", "Video\n\nWhen you go to the toilet have you ever thought about all the things that you can do with the waste?\n\nWell, a team of scientists from the University of Cape Town have and they have come up with an innovative new way to use urine and make the building industry more sustainable.\n\nThe BBC went to their lab to find out more.\n\nVideo Journalist: Christian Parkinson", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image caption The Armistice message ordered that all hostilities would cease at 11:00 on November 11 1918\n\nIt was one of the most important messages to be sent in the past 100 years.\n\nIt was carried by a Dublin man serving as a despatch rider with the 36th Ulster Division during World War One.\n\nIt was the signal from Army headquarters to the commanding officer of the Ulster Division to cease hostilities on 11 November 1918.\n\nThe message effectively brought to an end four long years of carnage and slaughter in northern Europe.\n\nAt Methodist Centenary Church in a leafy suburb of south Dublin, the name Ormsby Pasley is etched, along with many others, on the brass plate of the war memorial plaque in the porch.\n\nImage caption Ormsby Pasley is commemorated on a plaque in Methodist Centenary Church\n\nOrmsby was a despatch rider with the Royal Irish Rifles and, on that fateful morning nearly 100 years ago, he was handed a signal and told to deliver it to Major General Coffin who commanded the 36th Ulster Division.\n\nIt was the news they had all been waiting for.\n\n'Didn't speak about the war'\n\nThe orders were that at \"11:00 all hostilities should cease\" and the soldiers should \"stand fast\" at whatever point on the front line they had reached.\n\nIt also instructed that \"defensive precautions will be maintained\" and warned the troops that \"there will be no intercourse of any description with the enemy\".\n\nThe message ended: \"Further instructions will follow.\"\n\nOrmsby Pasley, recognising the significance of the order, kept a copy, which he stuffed in his pocket and brought back to Ireland with him more than a year after the Great War ended.\n\nIt hung in a frame on a wall in his home for many years and, although faded by sunlight, is still legible today.\n\nImage caption Ruth Warren said her grandfather \"didn't talk much\" about his experiences in World War One\n\n\"He was delivering the telegram to say the war was over and he kept a framed copy,\" his granddaughter Ruth Warren explained.\n\n\"He didn't talk much about the war, according to my parents.

An interview with producer Giles Martin, who oversaw the anniversary project, reveals some of the box set's secrets and surprises.\n\nThe Beatles' ninth album has confounded, delighted and divided fans ever since its release in 1968. To some, it's their masterpiece: a vibrant explosion of ideas from a band no longer bound by format, genre or style. To others, it's a mess: a quixotic, fractured collection of songs that fails as often as it soars.\n\n\"You are either hip to it, or you ain't,\" opined Rolling Stone in its original review.\n\nSimply called The Beatles, the 30-track double LP became known as The White Album thanks to its plain white, subtly embossed sleeve - and the contrast to the colourful explosion of their previous album, Sgt Pepper, was deliberate.\n\nThe White Album is turbulent, raw, and challenging - partly in reaction to the political upheaval at the end of the 1960s, as the Vietnam War and the assassination of Martin Luther King crushed the idealism of the Summer Of Love.\n\n\"Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what the Beatles are on about,\" wrote Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times.\n\nDark forces were present in the studio too, as the band's friendship started to fracture.\n\n\"The White Album was the tension album,\" Paul McCartney said in 1987. \"Never before had we recorded with beds in the studio and people visiting for hours on end, business meetings and all that. There was a lot of friction.\"\n\nBy John Lennon's own account, the band found themselves creatively and personally at loggerheads.\n\n\"Every track is an individual track,\" he told Rolling Stone in 1970. \"There isn't any Beatle music on it... It was John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\"\n\nAnd yet, the outtakes on a new, six-disc deluxe edition of the White Album explode that myth.\n\nHere are The Beatles in George Harrison's house in Esher, Surrey, joking around as they lay down demos for the album; and there are the band jamming a rich, psychedelic version of Helter Skelter that's 14 minutes long.\n\n\"They're enjoying playing together,\" says Giles Martin, son of Beatles' producer George Martin, who has overseen the reissue.\n\n\"It's a very collaborative record - and that's the biggest shock for me, because I never thought it was.\"\n\nSpeaking at Abbey Road Studios, Giles shared his insights into the Beatles' longest, most scintillating record.\n\nThe Beatles spent an extraordinary amount of time in the studio for this album. What was going on?\n\nI think it's because they enjoyed playing. They'd stopped touring before Sgt Pepper the year before - and so the studios became the only place they played live.\n\nIt was like, \"We're at Abbey Road. This is our place. What are we going to come up with today?\" That's why we get so many takes of the songs.\n\nWhat did you learn from investigating the tapes?\n\nThe biggest thing was I always believed the White Album was an unhappy and fragmented record made by four solo Beatles, all working in different rooms. And it wasn't that. If you listen to the outtakes, it's a hugely collaborative process.\n\nAnd yet George Harrison, Ringo Starr and your dad all walked out of the sessions at some point. What was the source of tension?\n\nSgt Pepper was such a concise and great achievement, and my dad felt it was being derailed. He thought there'd be a progression - more collages of sound, more soundscapes, more conceptual work - but The White Album is very much, \"here's a song, here's another song, here's another song\".\n\nYour dad had just become a father for the first time, too...\n\nYes, my sister was born in 1967 so he had a young daughter at home - but the band were working incredibly long hours. Famously, they had to break into the fridge to get milk for tea because Abbey Road was closed overnight.\n\nSo for my dad and the engineering team, they were like, \"It's 4:30 in the morning, we're listening to 70 takes of Sexy Sadie\u2026 Should we just go home?\"\n\nIt must be emotional when you hear his voice on these tapes.\n\nIt is emotional and strange - but I'm used to it. We live down in the countryside and his grave is in the village next door to ours. We visit the grave and that's him. So that's more emotional for me than hearing him on the tapes.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption George and Giles Martin shared a Grammy for their work on the Beatles' Love album in 2008\n\nWhat were the challenges in remixing this album?\n\nWe actually started mixing it last December, and I got to January and said, \"This sounds terrible. It's too clean.\"\n\nThe White Album is slightly trashy. It's visceral, it slaps you in the face. We'd made it sound like Steely Dan or Dire Straits... so we went back and worked out a way to preserve that sound.\n\nWe live in a world of streaming, where Blackbird could be played next to Ed Sheeran and they [should both] sound as young and fresh as each other.\n\nIt's crazy to think that, when Paul wrote Blackbird, he was the same age as Ed Sheeran is now.\n\nThat's the key for me. Paul will always be that age on Blackbird because a recording is a timestamp. So, in 15 years' time, when someone finds Blackbird or finds Castle On The Hill, hopefully they're going to think, \"This is two 27-year-olds\".\n\nImage copyright Calderstone Productions Limited Image caption The original tapes have been digitally remastered for the 50th anniversary\n\nOn one of the outtakes of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, you hear George Harrison asking for a cheese and marmite sandwich. Did you order one from the Abbey Road canteen for the sake of historical accuracy?\n\nNo, I didn't! It's funny: George mentions Marmite three times on the White Album, like there's some sort of endorsement going on.\n\nThose little snatches of studio conversation really bring the album to life.\n\nThat's the nice thing. You think of While My Guitar Gently Weeps as this other-worldly, super-human thing and George is ordering a cheese and marmite sandwich literally seconds before he starts to sing.\n\nWe're led to believe in the world of X Factor that anyone can be a singer, and it just isn't true. You have to have a God-given talent and I find that hugely reassuring, spiritually.\n\nWhat's the secret? The secret is human ability.\n\nAnd The Beatles had it in spades....\n\nAbsolutely. There's 30 songs on the White Album but during this time they also did Across The Universe, Hey Bulldog, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude... They wouldn't stop. And that was the most taxing thing in the studio. To deal with The Beatles and to deal with their demand, their output, was just too hard.\n\nDo you think that's why George Harrison felt sidelined? It seems crazy that Not Guilty got vetoed in favour of something like Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\n\nI've heard my dad talk about this and he always said openly that, yes, he didn't give George enough time. And John and Paul probably didn't give George enough time either. They had each other but George was isolated, in a bubble.\n\nI think he brought in Eric Clapton for While My Guitar Gently Weeps because it was a really great song; and he knew that if he brought the best guitarist in the world to the session, they would have to listen.\n\nImage copyright Apple Corps Lts Image caption Some of Harrison's rejected White Album songs ended up on his solo albums\n\nIf there was one song you could remove from The White Album and replace with an alternate take, or another song entirely, what would it be?\n\nIt's an impossible question to answer because you can't change history.\n\nWild Honey Pie was definitely one of my least favourite songs on The White Album, but it's a bit like Stockholm Syndrome: When we mixed it, we had to press our fingers into the tape machine to wobble the tape, because the song has that 'wow-ow-wow' fluttering effect; and I kind of become fond of it in a strange way.\n\nSo you have to replicate effects that don't exist on the original recordings?\n\nAlways. Absolutely. We can't recreate everything from the tapes. There's certain vocal sounds or the slight distortion you get in Glass Onion and, without them, it sounds a bit boring.\n\nIs it true that you got a completely new recording of the flamenco guitar that opens The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill?\n\nWell, that's actually played on a Mellotron which, for those who don't know, was the original sampler. I remembered Paul still had the Mellotron, so it was just a question of me phoning him up and getting his engineer to record it in better quality.\n\nNow, someone said, \"It's sacrosanct! How could you do that?\" But it's the same machine, playing the same tape. If I can get a better version of it, then we should use it.\n\nI always think about my dad and The Beatles being in the room with me when I'm doing this work. If I can make the guitar from Dear Prudence shimmer and sound good using the techniques they used, I think John would be happy.\n\nI work with ghosts all the time. If I had a Ouija board, I'd probably use one.\n\nThe deluxe edition of The Beatles is out now.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Everybody's family is different. But they are all valuable, they are all equal, they all have the same amount of love'.\"\n\nWhy is it needed?\n\nThe Scottish government's decision to embed LGBTI issues in the curriculum comes 18 years after the controversial Section 28 was repealed.\n\nThe law prohibited local authorities and schools from promoting homosexuality and campaigners claim it has had a \"destructive legacy\".\n\nJames Morton said young people who were at school while the law was in force felt they simply could not talk about their sexuality.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nHe said it has had a lasting effect on the mental health of people in the LGBTI community - including himself.\n\n\"I grew up and went to school during Section 28. The lack of ability to talk to people about LGBTI nearly cost me my life.\n\n\"It's incredibly positive that more schools are providing that support that no matter who they are, how they live their life, there's a future for them.\"\n\nAnd although Section 28 was repealed in 2000, a recent survey by the Tie campaign revealed that life can still be difficult for LGBTI students.\n\nIt found that 90% of LGBTI people have experienced homophobia, biphobia or transphobia at school, and 64% have been bullied because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe campaign group believe this change to the curriculum could promote understanding and inclusion across the wider community.\n\nTeacher Dawn Wilson said: \"It's about promoting awareness and celebrating diversity.\n\n\"We all know that if people lack awareness about something, it breeds fear. Fear breeds hate and hate leads to violence.\n\n\"If you remove that mystique then kids will say, 'oh that's no big deal'.\"\n\nTie's Liam Stevenson added: \"When young people can see themselves reflected in their education, it gives young people the opportunity to reach their full potential.\"\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nImage copyright Blair Wilson Image caption Blair Wilson took a defiant selfie after being targeted in a homophobic attack as he walked home in June\n\nHate crime victim Blair Wilson told the BBC Scotland website that schools have been lacking this kind of education for a long time.\n\nThe 21-year-old said: \"If we had some LGBTI-inclusive education, I may have found it easier to talk to my friends about my sexuality. More than that, they may have found it easier to talk to me.\n\n\"If we were taught about sexuality and gender expression in school, I probably wouldn't have had to go on such a journey of self-discovery making a lot of mistakes on the way while I figured out who I was - I would have understood it was okay to be exactly who I am.\"\n\nImage caption Blair Wilson was publicly praised by Nicola Sturgeon at Glasgow Pride after he posted the selfie online\n\nHowever the response to John Swinney's announcement on Thursday has not been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nDavid Robertson, the minister of St Peter's Free Church in Dundee and director of the Solas Centre for Public Christianity, raised fears that children were going to be \"indoctrinated into one particular philosophy\".\n\n\"At best this is, I think, virtue-signalling but in reality I think it's discriminatory and indoctrination, and it's an unnecessary expense when the money could be used for much better things,\" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Steven Jardine Programme.\n\n\"It's the very opposite of equality. It's about teaching one particular philosophy and one particular view and excluding everyone else.\"\n\nHe said he wanted schools to tackle all forms of bullying - not just those that target LGBTI youngsters.\n\n\"But the reality is the bullying thing is being used as an excuse to impose a doctrine and a philosophy upon all our children.

But a century ago how did the early newsreels cover life and death in the trenches? And were they showing the real thing?\n\nOnly the keenest silent film buffs know much about cameramen Geoffrey Malins and J B McDowell. But hundreds of millions of us know their work on screen - and many more are seeing it now thanks to They Shall Not Grow Old.\n\nVirtually all British footage from World War I trenches and battlefields was filmed for the government-controlled organisation British Topical. Malins and McDowell shot the great majority of it and their work has featured in countless documentaries in the decades since.\n\nDr Lawrence Napper has studied the way newsreel coverage changed during the war.\n\nImage copyright Sam Dodge Image caption The kind of ancient Moy and Bastie camera which the newsreel cameramen used in World War 1\n\n\"War broke out in July 1914 but it wasn't until almost the end of 1915 that British news cameramen were allowed to France,\" he says. \"Partly it was that film had been seen as entertainment for the working class - no-one in Whitehall knew what to make of endless requests from companies like Pathe for access to the trenches. Newsreels were a pretty new medium and pre-war they'd dealt only with soft stories - the Boat Race or a royal visit somewhere.\"\n\nThe big turning point came with a documentary called The Battle of the Somme, which lasts around 70 minutes. It used Malins' and McDowell's material and it was a massive hit. \"It's been claimed a greater proportion of the British population saw it than any other film ever,\" Napper says. \"There was a real hunger to see how the war was going.\"\n\nStephen Badsey of the University of Wolverhampton has been studying World War I footage for much of his career.\n\n\"One of the reasons newsreel cameraman were finally allowed out to France was because it became clear Britain could no longer rely on a volunteer army. Conscription was coming and the government needed Britons to see what was being done in their name.\"\n\nBadsey says there are around 1,000 different items of film, ranging from very short clips to complete stories. \"Inevitably there are some sequences which get used again and again - quite a lot of Peter Jackson's film comes from The Battle of the Somme.\n\n'The real thing'\n\n\"There's some extraordinary material in the original documentary which impresses even now. You could say it's the first combat documentary ever shot.\n\n\"But public taste changed quickly. By the summer of 1917 Britain was getting a bit bored with documentaries and the War Office in effect bought out the Topical Budget company and issued short twice-weekly newsreels. The Whitehall propaganda machine was in control.\"\n\nIgnoring political machinations at home, Malins and McDowell had continued to operate as best they could on the Western Front. They were using big hand-cranked Moy and Bastie cine-cameras which were normally secured to a heavy tripod and couldn't be moved easily.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption \"In Peter Jackson's film there's a poignant scene of men waiting to go into battle,\" says Dr Lawrence Napper\n\nAll of which raises the question - how much of what we see of British Topical's work (which means most of what we ever see from the trenches) is genuine? And how much of the action was staged and a century later needs to be treated with care?\n\nNapper thinks the answer is complex.\n\n\"In Peter Jackson's film there's a poignant scene of men waiting to go into battle, which is taken from The Battle of the Somme. We know it's the real thing, partly because we know exactly where Geoffrey Malins filmed and when.\n\n\"And we're very familiar with scenes of artillery shooting towards the German lines - but that would be a long way from any real Germans because that's how artillery works. So usually you'd assume those sequences are real. But people sometimes think they've seen big battle sequences close up, which in reality barely exist.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption British troops on night raid in World War I\n\n\"Non-staged material of things exploding was almost always shot low-down with Malins poking his camera briefly above the top of the trench. Any explosions would in reality have been in the distance.\n\n\"Reviews have mentioned Peter Jackson's achievement in colourising the material. What has been spotted less is that he's scanned and digitally zoomed in so certain explosions seem far closer than they really were: they look as though they were shot on modern Steadicam. They're real explosions but originally they were smaller in frame and across no man's land.\"\n\nNapper says the work of Malins and McDowell remained influential even after the war. \"In the 1920s you get reconstructions of battles but filmed in peacetime. People were trying to recreate what the two men might have filmed if they could have done so without getting shot.\"\n\nOne thing about their work which is genuine often surprises people - the inclusion of dead bodies. Napper says it was controversial even at the time.\n\n\"When the Somme film was shown in 1916 the Dean of Durham was among those who protested at the depiction of death. But there were others who wanted to see the reality of war.\" It's a debate that goes on a century later.\n\nThey Shall Not Grow Old is on BBC Two on Sunday 11 November at 21.30 GMT.", "Image copyright Stefan Thissen\n\nEighty years ago the Nazis' persecution of the Jews suddenly turned violent in a night of mayhem. This and the next day are known as Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass - and there are still some who remember it vividly.\n\n\"Our father took me and my little sister in his arms that night, and said, 'this is the beginning of a very difficult time, and we'll try to live through it'.\"\n\nRuth Winkelmann is now 90, but looks far younger than her years. Her eyes are a bright hazel as she looks up at the sky above the roof terrace of her old Jewish primary school in the heart of eastern Berlin.\n\n\"When I stand here and look up at the clouds, I think that my father is watching over me, and it's a good feeling,\" she says.\n\nThen, Ruth points across the rooftops, towards the domes of Berlin's New Synagogue, now restored and gleaming in the sunlight, remembering the smoke she saw billowing out when the Nazis set fire to it exactly 80 years ago.\n\nShe was just 10 years old on 10 November 1938. The day began normally, but as her father drove her to school, they witnessed troubling scenes.\n\n\"On our way in, we saw broken shop windows and shards of glass lying in the streets. And then we saw a shop where someone had painted the word 'Jew', and smeared on a star of David.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThey drove on, and saw a Jewish man in a black coat.\n\nSome Nazi stormtroopers had grabbed him, and were daubing a star of David on to the back of his coat. And then they beat him, too.\n\n\"I thought, 'My dad is with me and nothing bad can happen to me', but it was a very disturbing sight, and I was shaking.\"\n\nRuth had every reason to be afraid.\n\nWhen she got to school, the head teacher took the girls straight into assembly.\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth (right) with her younger sister, Eddi\n\n\"That's where we heard what had been going on in Berlin during the night - that Jewish shops had been smashed up and people brutally killed. Shop windows had been broken everywhere, and the words 'Jew' or 'Jewish pig' written in many places.\n\n\"We were all very frightened. And on that day, for the first time since I'd started attending that school in 1934, there were prayers. It was a Jewish school, but not an Orthodox, religious one.\"\n\nThe little girls tried to peer out of the school windows at what was happening on the street below.\n\n\"You couldn't actually see the stormtroopers from where we watched, just their flags - and they were shouting and making a terrible racket. They'd barricaded the entrance, and daubed stuff all over the school too - stars of David and 'Jew' and 'Jews out' and things like that.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A burning synagogue on Fasanenstrasse, Berlin\n\nThe Nazi government had steadily been passing legislation discriminating against Jews, including children like Ruth, who was born to a Jewish father, Hermann Jacks, and a mother, Elly, a Protestant who'd converted to Judaism in order to marry him.\n\nIn 1935 the Nuremberg laws had become the legal basis for the expulsion of Jews from public life in Germany. The Nazis codified exactly who was Jewish and to what degree: definitions that for many came to mean the difference between life and death.\n\nOn Kristallnacht, the creeping persecution burst into overt and bloody violence.\n\nFind out more\n\nWatch Caroline Wyatt's report for the News at Ten on Friday 9 November\n\nThat day, Ruth and the other girls had to escape via the school loft, walking two by two through the attics until they found their way down some stairs and into a back courtyard behind the main street.\n\n\"Our teachers told us to go straight home because the stormtroopers were still able to see us from where they were standing. We were terribly scared.\"\n\nWhen she finally got home, Ruth realised that it was not just the children who were afraid, but her parents and grandparents too.\n\nThey had also seen the smoke coming from the New Synagogue after Nazi stormtroopers broke in, desecrating the Torah scrolls and setting fire to whatever they could find.\n\nIt was one of several hundred Jewish places of worship attacked in Germany that night, as well as Jewish homes, schools, hospitals and more than 7,500 businesses. Close to 100 Jews were killed, and some 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.\n\nRuth only realised this was happening when she returned to school and discovered that several of the fathers had gone missing - arrested or deported: first the Polish Jews, and then the German Jews.\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth and her mother, Elly\n\nAs I sit with Ruth over a cup of tea at her cosy house near the woods in northern Berlin, she shows me black and white photos of her family and the home she grew up in, on a similarly tree-lined street a little further north.\n\nThanks to the Nuremberg laws, her father's parents were forced to sell their scrap-metal business, which left her father without a job. Then they were forced to sell their home. And later, her grandparents and Ruth's other Jewish relatives were deported. Fifteen of them died; only one survived. Her paternal grandparents starved to death in the concentration camp at Terezin, also known as Theresienstadt, in what is now the Czech Republic.\n\nThe sudden violence of Kristallnacht is seared into Ruth's memory.\n\n\"In retrospect, I became a grown-up on that day,\" she tells me. \"The pogrom night took away my childhood.\"\n\nShe shows me a water-stained copy of her Nazi-era ID card, stamped with J for Jew.\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth's family - her mother and younger sister (left), her father, Ruth and an aunt\n\nThe complex Nazi race laws had declared children such as Ruth and her younger sister Eddi \"first degree mixed-race\", because while their father Hermann was Jewish, their mother had been born Protestant. For the Nazis she still counted as \"Aryan\", despite her conversion, because of her German blood.\n\nBut because the two girls were registered as members of the Jewish community, they were deemed to be Jewish, Geltungsjuden. Later they were made to wear a yellow star on their coats and had to add the name \"Sara\" to their real names.\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption The name \"Sara\" was added to Ruth's name\n\nIn an attempt to save the children, Ruth's parents agreed to divorce. However, this left Ruth's beloved father even more vulnerable. He was deported to Auschwitz in 1943.\n\nRuth received four postcards from her father, sent from the death camp. She still has them. Now barely legible, they make clear that her father's final act of love to his children was to protect them from the horrors of the camp.\n\nShe reads me one of them: \"My dear ones, I am well. How are you? Your parcel with bread and cake and tobacco has arrived. Thank you so much, that was very nice. Otherwise, nothing new. Best wishes to your Mum on her birthday too. Love and kisses from your Dad.\"\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption One of the postcards Ruth's father sent from Auschwitz\n\nRuth's father was a captive at Monowitz, a sub-camp of Auschwitz where prisoners were forced to work for the chemical industry. He was working on some scaffolding, when someone pushed him off.\n\nRuth found out that her father was taken away unconscious, in a van equipped with deadly gas, camouflaged as an ambulance.\n\n\"Everyone thought he would never have woken up again, but he must have done,\" she says. \"Because I learnt from the Auschwitz archives much later that he wasn't killed until January 1944.\"\n\nIn Berlin, food for Ruth, her mother and her sister became increasingly scarce. At 14, Ruth was called up to do forced labour. All three received a summons from the Gestapo, and only narrowly escaped deportation.\n\nRuth's mother, Elly, decided it was time to go into hiding. She selected a wooden shed on an allotment in southern Berlin, which belonged to a member of the Nazi party called Leo Lindenberg, who had taken a shine to her.\n\n\"We didn't feel safe there in the shed, but it was better than any alternative, because we could live there as non-Jews,\" remembers Ruth.\n\n\"I never wore the yellow star on my coat there, otherwise Leo Lindenberg would have been in huge trouble. We told the neighbours that our flat in Berlin had been destroyed by the bombing. That was common enough, so nobody asked too many questions.\"\n\nImage copyright Ruth Winkelmann Image caption Ruth on holiday as a young child\n\nLife in the shed was harsh - there was no water, electricity or heating.\n\n\"When the temperature outside fell to minus 10, it was minus 10 inside too. And in the last four months we lived on nothing but red turnips and oatmeal,\" Ruth remembers.\n\nThey had to grind the oatmeal from whole grains, putting them through a coffee grinder three times and then sifting it. It took half an hour to produce three spoonfuls.\n\nJust before the end of the war, Ruth's sister Eddi died of diphtheria. But Ruth and her mother survived.\n\nLater, Elly married Leo Lindenberg, who asked his step-daughter to convert to Christianity, and Ruth complied. But she still wears the star of David around her neck.\n\n\"I converted out of gratitude because Leo risked his life for us,\" Ruth explains.\n\n\"But my faith always remained mixed. I cannot say that I'm Jewish, and nor can I say that I'm Protestant. If you think about it, Judaism is the faith that Christianity sprang from, the root of it. I think that if I follow the 10 commandments, I'm not such a bad person. My father definitely wouldn't have condemned it, and his opinion was always the most important to me. My mother would have nothing against it either. More than anything else, she wanted me to live well and be happy.\"\n\nRuth says that even in the darkest times, she always kept her faith in God.\n\nImage caption Ruth at home, wearing the star of David\n\n\"That doesn't mean I go to church a lot,\" she says, \"but when I'm out in nature, I have everything I wish for and I thank him for the beautiful time I'm still having today. Not many people live to 90, and in reasonably good health too. I'm very grateful to my God.\"\n\nHowever, she no longer wears her star of David in public, having seen a passenger on the underground rip a crescent moon necklace from the neck of a Turkish girl. She puts it on for family occasions, though, and when she is giving a talk - as she frequently does, despite her age.\n\nFor Ruth, connecting with the young and telling her story to new generations remains vital.\n\n\"The most important thing for me is that they take on board how difficult it is to live in a democracy. Everyone has a different opinion, and picking out the best requires care and attention,\" she says. \"But democracy is the only way to live. Living under a dictatorship is impossible.\"\n\nRuth takes me to the house where she grew up. Set into the pavement outside is a small polished brass square, the size of a cobblestone. It's called a Stolperstein - a stumbling stone - and it bears the name of her father and the date he was killed in Auschwitz. She bends down to show me.\n\n\"To me this is a way of honouring my father. Because of course we don't have a headstone for him, there's no grave. And whenever I come past here, I pause for a moment - it's like a short visit to him. Whenever I come here, I feel as though my father is still standing there in the courtyard and polishing our bicycles, or all the family's shoes. That's what he liked to do on a Sunday morning.\"\n\nRuth has lived her life so remarkably free from bitterness. But is she alarmed by the rise of the far right in Europe, I ask?\n\n\"Of course I worry about that,\" she admits.\n\n\"But I'm hopeful that mankind learnt something from the Nazi era. I do worry about the rise of those parties, but I don't think we will ever see a systematic mass extermination like the Holocaust again. \"\n\nI meet Ruth again by the New Synagogue, just behind the school where she witnessed the events of Kristallnacht.\n\nBy the entrance, beside the armed guards who are now permanently present, is a black plaque with golden lettering.\n\nIt reminds passers-by that the synagogue was set alight by the Nazis during the night of 9 November 1938, and largely destroyed in a bomb attack by the Allies in 1943 before being restored.\n\nIn capital letters beneath, it urges: \"Never forget.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nWhen Alexander Bodin Saphir's Jewish grandfather was measuring a high-ranking Nazi for a suit in Copenhagen 75 years ago he got an important tip-off - the Jews were about to be rounded up and deported.

Ramsay Image caption Janet Hardy, who lost three sons in the conflict, unveiling the War Memorial in Lerwick in 1924\n\nIn comparative terms, Shetland had one of the highest losses of life in World War One. The conflict had a huge impact on the population that made up the towns and villages of the islands, which can at times seem apart from the rest of the UK.\n\nAccording to the 1911 census, Shetland had a total population of 27,911. Of this population, more than 600 servicemen died in the war.\n\n\"Has the foul curse of Cain Descended on us all? Then wash away the stain Ere one more brave shall fall\" 'War Weary' - David Mackie\n\nBut according to local historian and history teacher Jon Sandison \"the total of the war memorial and the Roll of Honour is closer to 700\".\n\nThis loss of life, in proportion, is considered one of the largest for any area of the UK.\n\nJohn Taylor, a former serviceman living in Shetland, said: \"Throughout the country, 1 in 45 people were lost, but in Shetland it was about 1 in 38. Percentage-wise, the loss here was greater than the rest of the UK.\"\n\n'Decimated by war'\n\nBobby Hunter, Lord Lieutenant of Shetland, said: \"It still leaves an effect. Folk still talk about folk who were lost in the First World War.\n\n\"I had my own grandfather and grand-uncle, two brothers, who were lost. It still affects folk to this day.\"\n\nThe War Memorial in Lerwick was unveiled in January 1924 by Janet Hardy.\n\nImage copyright Thomas Manson Image caption The Hardy brothers (top row and bottom left) who all died in the war\n\nHer family experienced the pain that war inflicts perhaps more keenly than any other family in Shetland. Three of her sons, Thomas, Charles, and William, went to war. None returned.\n\nThomas died when the ship he was serving on in Penzance sank in 1916. Charles died in November 1914 from wounds sustained in Ypres. William died in Calcutta in 1917 from drowning. As Mr Taylor said: \"A lot of families were decimated by the war.\"\n\nThere were, however, positive stories; stories of brothers surviving the war gave people hope.\n\nThe Cluness family ended up sending five sons to the war. Remarkably, all five came back.\n\nWhat did Shetland contribute?\n\nDespite its distance from mainland UK, Shetland was active in sustaining and supporting the war effort, in inventive and innovative ways.\n\nKnitting in the Shetland Islands has for centuries been a practical pursuit. Due to the often harsh weather, making use of wool has been necessary for survival.\n\nHalf-way up the ward two boys are lying together - one a German and the other a Britisher. The former is badly wounded in the head. He is somebody's boy Shetland-born, Nurse Martha Aitken\n\nThose knitting skills were underlined and put to the test in World War One.\n\nThousands of women from across the Shetland Islands produced various types of knitted goods for troops.\n\nThey were part of the Queen Mary's Needlework Guild. Its aim was to provide clothes and knitted goods to servicemen. And Shetland women did just that, producing more than 15,000 knitted items.\n\nTheir efforts did not go unnoticed. After the war, thousands of soldiers sent letters of thanks to those women who had provided them with clothes to help them see out cold winters.\n\nThis was just one way Shetlanders used wildlife and nature to pitch in with the war effort.\n\nThe 'Egg Collection for the Wounded' campaign aimed to distribute eggs from towns and parishes across the UK to the war wounded, often in hospitals.\n\nAbout 32 million eggs were sent to feed wounded soldiers in areas of France and Belgium. Shetland contributed a total of 300,000 eggs for the effort.\n\nImage copyright Shetland Museum and Archives Image caption Children collecting eggs for 'Egg Collection for the Wounded'\n\nOne more contribution from the Shetland Islands is perhaps more surprising - moss.\n\nThe contribution of sphagnum moss was classed as \"significant\", with the plant material being used for \"surgical dressings\" due to its antiseptic qualities, making it a first aid essential.\n\nDays were especially organised so that locals could go out to gather moss.\n\nMr Sandison said: \"There was a moss day in August 1917. People went to the hillsides and collected 2,500 bags of moss. The following year they sent 3,000 bags.\"\n\nThose 5,500 bags of moss were sent to help wounded soldiers.\n\nWhat happened then?\n\nThe 1911 census also revealed that Shetland had a majority female population - a majority of about 2,500.\n\nMr Hunter explained: \"The women were left at home with the families. They had to work on the crofts so they were left with the heavy end of the stick when the men were away.\"\n\nThey were affected by men being away and from the toll of those who did not return - and the whole of Shetland was impacted through that generation and beyond.\n\nMr Sandison added: \"Overall, most men did come home. But, when they did come home, they had to fit back into society.\n\n\"A lot were affected for the rest of their lives and their family had to deal with that\n\n\"The loss was very large for women. We often speak about the 'Lost Generation'.\n\n\"Perhaps there was another lost generation; the families who went through that and those who were left at home.\"", "Image caption One clickbait merchant chose to remain anonymous\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was sitting in a dark bar in a small town an hour's drive from Kosovo's capital, Pristina. In front of me, a man was nervously hunched over, his face turned away from the camera.\n\nHe was a fake news merchant and he agreed - eventually - to talk about how he earned his living.\n\nI first came to Kosovo over a year ago when researching a book about how power was changing in the digital age.\n\nI'd heard about shadowy Russian influence campaigns and militaries fighting warfare with information.\n\nBut the people I met there showed me there was another, very simple reason why people sent false and sensationalist news to Western audiences. It was for the money - they share it because we click on it.\n\nClickbait and \"fake news\" are terms sometimes used interchangeably to describe false or sensationalist material circulating on the web.\n\nA year ago, \"Burim\" showed me that misinformation was a flourishing industry. Some of what he described was political, far more of it was gore.\n\n\"Dog Groomer Who Kicked Dog till its Ribs Broke Remains Jail-Free\" was one story. \"Boy Comes out of Coma after 12 Years, Whispers Dark Secret to Parents [video]\" was another.\n\nMuch of it was false. And while some of it looked like news, this was content for one reason alone: clicks.\n\nMaking money from the internet means capturing audiences and the merchant I spoke to owned about a dozen Facebook pages, dedicated to anything from evangelical Christianity to holiday destinations.\n\nWhatever their theme, the audiences were huge: 90,000 likes; 240,000 likes; 26,000 likes.\n\nBurim could get his content to nearly a million pairs of eyeballs and he turned those clicks into ad revenue - both within the social media platform and on external sites. He earned about 600 euros (\u00a3520) a day.\n\nIt's far more money than any of the legitimate jobs he could take would offer him.\n\nImage caption Carl Miller has documented the clickbait industry in Kosovo for BBC Click\n\nSince I met Burim, the tech giants have vowed to shut this industry down. Fake news is what Mark Zuckerberg calls his \"personal challenge\".\n\nIn 2018, Facebook doubled its security team to 20,000 and closed down many groups and pages that shared clickbait, squeezing their content towards near invisibility.\n\nSo, last month, I went back, this time with the BBC. I wanted to see if anything had changed and what Facebook's anti-fake news drive really looked like in the eyes of the people who peddled the stuff.\n\n\"The audience on that page is mainly UK,\" the man said, grinning, hunched over his phone so that the camera couldn't catch his face.\n\nIt is difficult to tell exactly how large this illicit economy had become in the past. But Facebook's reforms, I heard again and again, have had some effect. Page after page had been shut down. Income had fallen from 600 euros a day to about 100.\n\nSpreading false news, then, has become less profitable - and possibly also less political. It has apparently morphed into celebrity hype, false stories of footballers breaking legs or lurid sexual gore. The content creators were sharing trivia, not Trump.\n\nYoung ones\n\nHowever, although less profitable, the practice was still widespread.\n\n\"Forty per cent of Kosovan youth are doing this,\" one merchant told me. \"Thousands upon thousands,\" said another.\n\nAnd it's little wonder. 100 euros a day is still life-changing for someone, like him, who'd earned seven euros a day as a waiter before he started. The \"why\" was clear. In the face of Facebook's reforms, the bigger surprise was \"how\".\n\nThere is another side to this fake news and clickbait industry that isn't visible to us. I learned that a network of closed groups exist, with memberships that can number from a few hundred to several thousand. To be part of such a closed group, you have to be invited.\n\nImage caption Gaz, a former clickbait merchant, explained how the industry worked\n\nBut inside, it was clear that Facebook wasn't just the place where they harvested audiences. It was also where the fake news merchants themselves traded with each other.\n\nI saw Facebook pages with hundreds of thousands of likes traded for thousands of dollars. Others sold fake likes, or fake accounts, or offered advice on how to get around Facebook's enforcement.\n\nWe even found a \"fake news starter pack\" for a beginner, complete with a collection of Facebook pages to gather an audience, along with websites to monetise your activity. This was a service sector economy for misinformation.\n\nIt wasn't just Facebook that was innovating, the misinformation merchants were too. Some were specialised in growing pages and selling them on. Others would sell content, and more still concentrated on getting around Facebook's enforcement.\n\nEven within small groups, this was happening routinely and dozens of times a day. It was industrial-scale gaming of Facebook's policies and systems.\n\nImage caption Pristina is the capital of Kosovo - and apparently a hub for clickbait\n\nAround the world, there are thousands of people like those I spoke to. Usually young, male and digitally savvy, they are willing to share any content for the clicks. And in the chase for clicks online, the horrifying, shocking, exaggerated, or divisive wins out again and again.\n\nI've begun to reflect on this kind of fake news, of content exported to Western markets for profit, as something akin to poppy growing. It's a cash crop.\n\nIt's no use to the people that make it. It doesn't do any good to the foreign markets that consume it.\n\nBut it is - by far - the easiest and most accessible way of making money for some. If you want to stop it, you can't just burn the fields. You also need to give people something else to grow.\n\nBBC Click will have more on the fake news merchants of Kosovo on this weekend's television show.

I feel very proud.\"\n\nAfter unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1906, Gerald Arbuthnot was elected as the Conservative MP for Burnley in January 1910. However he lost the seat in December of the same year during a second election.\n\nHe chose not to stand again, but remained in politics in other ways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Navy.\n\nBut Dr Rix explained: \"He's unusual amongst the MPs who died in that he served in the Navy, He'd served in the Navy as a young man, and at the start of the war he joined the Royal Naval Reserve.\n\n\"He was initially with their press bureau, but that wasn't involved enough in the fighting for him. So he joined a minesweeping division and commanded minesweepers in the North Sea for 15 months.\n\n\"But he was very keen to go and have active engagement with the enemy. So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916.\"\n\nBy May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards.\n\nOn 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs.\n\nLt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment.\n\nDr Rix explained: \"This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed.\"\n\nThe soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt.\n\nDespite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial.\n\nWith the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added.\n\nHis distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years.\n\nBut in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name.\n\nThe Armistice 100 years on\n\nImage copyright AFP\n\nLong read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline\n\nVideo: War footage brought alive in colour\n\nInteractive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?\n\nLiving history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended\n\nLord Arbuthnot said: \"I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist.\n\n\"It's an extraordinary story. He was part of a generation who truly believed in duty and serving their country.\n\n\"It feels very good - an extra bit of knowledge about what members of Parliament, what my family, did in that war has come to light and we can remember him properly now.\n\n\"We're very proud.

But when wrestling on TV was axed, the popularity of the sport in Britain took a nosedive. Decades later and a generation that grew up glued to World of Sport is spearheading a revival - but will it stick?\n\nIn an era when there were just three TV channels - unless you fancied watching the Open University - the choice was between BBC One's Grandstand or World of Sport on ITV.\n\nAt four years old, Jim Smallman opted for the commercial channel because it screened bouts of British wrestling.\n\n\"I genuinely hated Big Daddy,\" he remembers. \"But there was a wrestler called Johnny Saint, and the way he wrestled was brilliant.\n\n\"He was all about escapology and did these technical, complex holds, turning people [practically] inside out.\n\n\"When I first saw him it blew my mind.\"\n\nImage copyright James Musselwhite Image caption Wrestling promoter Jim Smallman says his shows have \"compelling characters and compelling storylines\"\n\nBritish wrestling was already popular in the mid-1950s, but when the sport hit the nation's TV screens the following decade it found a new audience.\n\nMillions of viewers would tune in to see the likes of Adrian Street, Kendo Nagasaki and Klondyke Kate, then head to draughty town halls to see them in person.\n\nFans were known for their passion and while the \"faces\" (the heroes) were lauded, the \"heels\" (the villains) took the brunt of handbags swung at them by angry ringside grannies.\n\nBut in 1985 World of Sport was taken off air and the wrestling portion of the programme moved to a less popular time slot, before disappearing altogether by 1988.\n\nWhen wrestling made its TV return the following year, it was the oiled and muscular stars of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) - Hulk Hogan, the Ultimate Warrior and Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart - who were centre screen.\n\n\"Terrestrial TV was the shop window [for British wrestling] and the money was in getting customers to the shows,\" says Dr Ben Litherland, author of Wrestling in Britain: Sporting Entertainments, Celebrity and Audiences.\n\n\"The second that was removed, the whole business model fell through.

tournament record.\n\nAustralia v Pakistan\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Australia thrash Pakistan by 52 runs\n\nAustralia were given early momentum by wicketkeeper and player of the match Alyssa Healy after they chose to bat against Pakistan as she helped them to fifty without loss after only 34 balls.\n\nAfter Healy was caught at long-on for 48 in the eighth over to leave the Australians on 72-1, Pakistan began to restrict the scoring and nearly five overs elapsed without a boundary.\n\nOpening partner Beth Mooney also made 48 and skipper Meg Lanning hit a six in her 41 before she was one of two wickets to fall in the final over.\n\nPakistan had lost three wickets by the end of the powerplay and teenage leg-spinner Georgia Wareham then struck twice in the

fifth Red Roses player to reach the landmark, scored a long-range try before departing to cheers on the hour.\n\nThe game was won by then, with Megan Rom shown red after 15 minutes for leading with her forearm in a tackle.\n\nDebutants Sarah Beckett and Tatyana Heard impressed for new-look England.\n\nAnd Gloucester-Hartpury's Kelly Smith, the Premier 15s top try-scorer, transferred her domestic

red.\n\nThe United States were reduced to 13 either side of half-time when captain Kate Zackary was shown yellow for dragging down a rolling maul.\n\nTheir reduced numbers told as Daley-McLean seized

Royal Canadian Legion names one mother of a soldier to represent all mothers who have lost children in Canadian military service. This year, Anita Cenerini, the woman who has been given the honoured post, holds a unique significance.\n\nAnita Cenerini did not immediately agree to take on the role of National Silver Cross Mother when she was first approached by the Royal Canadian Legion.\n\n\"It took me a while to ask the question: 'Did you pick me specifically because my son took his own life?'\" she says.\n\n\"And their reply was yes.\"\n\nIt was the answer she had hoped for - an opportunity to champion continued change within the Canadian military as it seeks to confront and address mental health issues within its ranks and among former soldiers.\n\nIt was only recently that her son, Thomas Welch, was finally honoured with the Memorial Cross, a memento of loss given to the loved ones of Canadian soldiers who died on active duty, or whose death was attributed to such duty.\n\nImage copyright Courtesy Royal Canadian Legion Image caption Anita Cenerini\n\nThe young soldier was deployed to Afghanistan in August 2003. It was his first mission overseas, and he was just 21 years old, a C9 Gunner with the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nMrs Cenerini says he \"was a great encourager\".\n\n\"He was actually highly regarded in the military for being someone to lift the morale of his comrades.\n\n\"And he was sensitive, he was really sensitive to the needs of others. He was a quiet person without many words but he had an incredible sense of humour and he loved to see people laugh, he loved for there to be laughter in the world. It made him sad to see brokenness.\"\n\nShe said her son spoke to her early in his tour of the conditions faced by women and children in Afghanistan at the time - they \"weighed heavy on his heart\".\n\nHe asked her to send extra sweets in his care packages so he could hand out the treats to local children.\n\nBut his family noticed a change when the young soldier returned from his tour.\n\n\"When he came home, he was unable to cope with even just the smallest things that you and I can cope with easily on a day-to-day basis,\" she said.\n\n\"His mental health had deteriorated to the point where everything was so arduous, so painful, and brought up so much anger in a young man who never expressed anger before.\"\n\nHe killed himself on 8 May 2004, less than three months after his return.\n\nImage copyright Courtesy Anita Cenerini Image caption Anita Cenerini and Thomas Welch\n\nHis death is marked as the first suicide of a Canadian soldier after returning home from the Afghanistan mission.

Day after day, bodies were recovered and by Friday an eighth victim was found.\n\nFewer people may have lost their lives than the 72 who died at Grenfell, but the disaster exposed a long-standing housing problem that affects some 100,000 people in private accommodation in Marseille, according to a 2015 government report.\n\nAnd there is heartbreak over lives cut short, and fear, and fury.\n\n\"Clearly there is anger,\" says Jean-Marie Leforestier, a reporter for local news site Marsactu. \"Residents and associations have been condemning substandard housing for years.

I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nIt has been a transformative year for Adams, who started it in prolific form for his club side Worcester but still passed under the radar for many followers of Welsh rugby.\n\nThere was a sense of being out of sight, out of mind for the 23-year-old from Hendy, near Llanelli, who had started his career with the Scarlets but left Wales after failing to secure a contract with the region.\n\nAdams joined Worcester in 2015 and, after a hardy apprenticeship including a loan with lower-league club Cinderford, he eventually forced himself into the first team.\n\nHe seized his opportunity by finishing 2017 as the Premiership's top try scorer, and his reward was a place in Wales' squad for this year's Six Nations, starting in the opening win over Scotland.\n\n\"Obviously with your first cap there's a lot of feelings flying around nerves, excitement and whatnot,\" he says.\n\n\"Even when you're driving to the game as a spectator you can feel a bit of a buzz about it because it is a special place when it's full.\n\n\"So it's something I'm looking forward to doing again, and hopefully we can get the right result this weekend.\"\n\nSaturday's match against Australia will only be Adams' second appearance for Wales at home and fifth in total.\n\nTwo of those caps came on the summer tour of Argentina, in which Wales won both matches with Adams scoring an excellent first try for his country in the second Test.\n\nThat form has convinced Wales head coach Warren Gatland to pick Adams ahead of British and Irish Lion Liam Williams for the encounter with Australia.\n\n\"It's great to hear he thought I went well in the summer,\" Adams says.\n\n\"I thought as a squad we did really well in Argentina to get two tough wins out there, and the boys who played in Washington did really well to beat South Africa as well.\n\n\"As a tour, it was positive. I think we created some depth with inexperienced boys playing and, off the back of that now, a few have had another opportunity this autumn as well.\"\n\nFacing Folau\n\nGeorge North hoisting Israel Folau was an abiding image of the Lions' tour win in Australia in 2013\n\nAfter their opening win over Scotland last weekend, the intensity will increase for Wales on Saturday when they take on Australia.\n\nThe Wallabies have won the past 13 meetings between the two sides, a sequence of results stretching back to 2008.\n\nOne of Wales' chief tormentors in recent years has been Folau, a prodigiously skilful back who has played the majority of his Test career at full-back, spent some time at centre in the summer but finds himself on the right wing this weekend.\n\nThat pits him directly against Adams.\n\nGeorge North, on Wales' other wing, found a novel way of combating Folau's threat during the Lions' victorious tour of Australia in 2013.\n\nThe Welshman was actually in possession when Folau tried to tackle him, only for the Wallaby to find himself lifted in the air by North, who marched onwards carrying his opponent like a rucksack.\n\n\"I'm nowhere near the size of George so I don't think I'll be carrying Israel Folau on my back this weekend,\" Adams says with a laugh.\n\n\"He's a top quality player. I know his threats, we know his threats. He's proven time and time again at international level how good he is.\n\n\"It will be a test for me but it's something I'm looking forward to. It's a good opportunity for me to see where I'm at, playing against probably one of the world's best wingers.\"\n\nIt will be a formidable test for Wales as a collective too.\n\nLess than a year before the World Cup begins, this would be a good time to end their losing run against an Australian side who will be in their pool in Japan next year.\n\n\"It's been very close so often and I just think it's small margins, maybe not concentrating for the full 80 minutes, maybe a slip in concentration in the last five minutes,\" says Adams.\n\n\"So it's a big emphasis on a big 80-minute performance this weekend. I think the feeling around the place is good at the minute.\n\n\"We've had six wins on the bounce and a hit-out in the autumn already. Obviously we've got to respect Australia - it's going to be a tough match without a doubt, and I'm sure they're expecting the same.\"", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Broward County Sheriff's Office Image caption Cesar Sayoc was arrested last month in Florida after a massive manhunt\n\nUS prosecutors have brought new charges against a Florida man accused of mounting a mail-bombing campaign against critics of President Trump.\n\nCesar Sayoc, 56, now faces 30 criminal counts including using weapons of mass destruction.

Moreover, half of us wouldn't be happy to reveal our salary details either.\n\nBut sharing more information about what we earn may be the best way to ensure that women are in a position to argue for fairer treatment over pay, say campaigners.\n\nThey point to the example of Kay Collins, a chef, who discovered that a male chef in her kitchen was being paid more than her.\n\nShe says the initial conversation wasn't awkward at all: \"We were working together. It was a quiet day. My colleague Chris was leafing through a college prospectus and said, there's an article here about motor mechanics earning \u00a325,000 a year.

She has since lost her job and is still out of work. But she says she would definitely choose to be open about pay in future if she got another job.\n\nSam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive, says not discussing pay with colleagues lets employers off the hook.\n\n\"In workplaces all over the country, pay discrimination is able to thrive and is more common than people realise because of a culture of pay secrecy which persists.\"\n\nDon't ask, don't tell?\n\nA lot of people are reluctant to ask for colleagues' salary details and even more reluctant to share their own.\n\n\"I'd probably say, mind-your-own-business, because it's not a question I would ask,\" says Tony Clapson who works as a junior manager for a High Street retail chain.

She says in her native France no-one would ever ask colleagues about their pay. \"I'm quite happy with it remaining a private matter.\"\n\n\"It's nobody's business,\" says Danielle Khan. \"If you want to fight with your boss about what you get paid, fight with your boss, not with your colleagues.\" She is semi-retired, but when she ran a software company she had a policy that people shouldn't ask each other about pay, and says the result was to keep a lid on office politics.\n\nHenry, 43, a commercial lawyer based in Singapore, says he wouldn't tell colleagues what he earns: \"I sympathise over the gender equality pay gap, but I don't think that's the right way of tackling it.\" He thinks it's the company's responsibility to ensure there aren't discrepancies in pay. \"If you want to tackle the problem, tackle it at source.\"\n\nThe other way the Fawcett Society aims to raise awareness of pay discrimination is by identifying a day each year as Equal Pay Day \"the day in the year when women effectively start to work for free\".\n\nThey suggest there is currently a 13.7% gap between what women are paid and what men are paid. Their premise is that if men and women were rewarded equally, women's pay would all have been handed out by this point in the year.\n\nBut their calculations have been questioned by the free market think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. The IEA says the Fawcett Society is inflating the pay gap by using the mean average to calculate their figure (taking a sum of hourly pay across the working population and dividing by the number of individuals).\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) calculates the pay gap using median earnings (comparing the rate paid to men and women who are in the middle of the pay spectrum). The ONS calculated pay gap is 8.6%.\n\nIEA's associate director Kate Andrews said the gender pay gap as calculated by the ONS has got smaller and it was time Equal Pay Day was moved to a later date: \"It was the 10th November last year, and is the 10th November this year, because it is calculated in a way that skews and inflates the data.\"\n\nThe IEA says using the mean average means the pay gap is distorted by the outlier salaries of a small number of high earners and doesn't reflect the experience of typical workers.\n\nThe Fawcett Society says that is the reason it uses the mean average - to reflect \"that more men than women are earning higher wages at the top, and that more women earn the least\".\n\n\"Each method sheds a different light on gender wage inequality,\" the organisation said.", "Image copyright Justyna Kowalczyk Image caption Justyna Kowalczyk says the \"Brexit box\" was her partner's idea\n\n\"It might sound a bit crazy,\" admits Justyna Kowalczyk.\n\nShe's talking about her \"Brexit box\" tucked under the kitchen table.\n\nIn the plastic container, which is around the same size as a small box of photocopier paper, she has bottles of tonic water, coffee and French marmalade.

This will continue to be the case whether we leave the EU with or without a deal.\"\n\nIndustry body the British Retail Consortium says there is no evidence of any widespread stockpiling of food. I asked the four major supermarkets as well as Aldi and Lidl whether they had seen any evidence, but none of them responded.\n\nBut according to food research charity IGD, 2% of shoppers in a survey of 1,700 people last month said they had started to stock up on food supplies.\n\nLast month, the New York Times ran a front-page story on \"the British hoarders\" preparing for Brexit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The government says it has no plans to stockpile food and people should not do so either\n\nA Facebook group called the 48% Preppers, named after the proportion of people who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, suggests stockpiling more everyday items.

Suggestions include potatoes, eggs, carrots, crackers, cheese, milk powder, grains and instant mash. Tinned fish and soup also feature as well as tea and coffee.\n\nIf the name didn't give it away, the group makes no secret of the fact that it thinks Brexit will be bad, \"possibly even disastrous\" for the UK and acknowledges its advice is based on this assumption.\n\nBut are people right to be worried about the availability of certain foods when the UK leaves the EU?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption KPMG says 290 trucks come through Dover each day just supplying citrus fruits\n\nAs a country we're currently heavily reliant on imports. In fact, just half of the food we eat in the UK originates here, with most of the rest imported from Europe, including almost all our fresh fruit and many of our vegetables.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab said this week: \"I don't think it's a question so much of the risk of major shortages but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes.\"\n\nMr Raab also admitted that even he \"hadn't quite understood\" how reliant UK trade in goods is on the Dover-Calais crossing, which is vital for trade with Europe.\n\nFresh food - which cannot be stockpiled - is the biggest concern. A vegetable shortage last year, driven by bad weather in southern Europe, highlighted this dependence, and led to a flurry of pictures on social media of empty supermarket shelves.\n\nDave Lewis, the chief executive of the UK's largest supermarket Tesco, warned on this last month.\n\n\"The biggest single challenge will be in a no-deal scenario, will be what happens with fresh food,\" he said.\n\n\"It's all about product flow [over borders]. The possibility of stockpiling fresh food is very, very limited.\"\n\nJust in time\n\nThe UK's supply chains work on a \"just in time\" basis, meaning stock is delivered daily, not stored for long periods in warehouses.\n\nMr Lewis said in the lead-up to Brexit that Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up.\n\nHe added that the retailer was looking at stockpiling grocery products, with contingency planning stepping up after Christmas if a deal is still not struck.\n\nTo illustrate the complexity, Paul Martin, UK head of retail at consultancy KPMG, says 290 trucks come through Dover each day just supplying citrus fruits. He says any level of disruption, such as trucks needing to pass extra inspections, is likely to have an impact.\n\n\"If we have a no-deal scenario, if there is disruption, then certain products will not be available for a certain period of time,\" he says.\n\nHe is, however, certain that any supply shortage would be only temporary \"because it's in the interests of all parties to get the supply chain as close to normal as quickly as possible\".\n\nTrying to fly in produce from elsewhere is a possibility, but this would cost more, and it's unlikely other countries would have the stock in sufficient volume to make up the shortfall, he says.\n\nImage caption It's not possible to stock up on fresh goods such as tomatoes and spinach\n\nMeanwhile, limited free warehousing space, particularly refrigerated space, in the country means supermarkets stockpiling goods themselves isn't practical on a large scale.\n\nOne cold storage firm, Wild Water, has already warned it has run out of room due to the food industry stockpiling in the run-up to Brexit.\n\nAnd stocking up on fresh food simply isn't possible, says Catherine Shuttleworth, shopping and retail expert at agency Savvy.\n\n\"Supermarkets might be able to stockpile tins, but not milk, cheese and fresh fruit. These are the things we buy every day as a nation,\" she says.\n\nShe warns if food supplies are affected by Brexit, supermarkets are likely to raise prices to try and slow demand.\n\nProf Tim Benton, an expert in food systems from the University of Leeds, also thinks if the EU and the UK fail to reach agreement on the terms of departure then there could be \"significant interruptions to food supplies\".\n\n\"If disruption were to continue for more than a week almost any food might start becoming difficult to get,\" he says.\n\nAs a result, he believes that it makes \"some degree of sense\" not to assume food supplies will be available as normal if significant structural changes to customs regimes at borders are likely.\n\nNevertheless, all official bodies advise against stockpiling, with the British Retail Consortium saying it's \"not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit\".\n\nJustyna is not deterred though. \"I just want to make sure I have my favourite things,\" she says.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most plug-in hybrids in the UK are bought for company fleets\n\nTens of thousands of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) bought with generous government grants may be burning as much fuel as combustion-engine cars.\n\n\u200bData compiled for the BBC suggests that such vehicles in corporate fleets averaged just 40 miles per gallon (mpg), when they could have done 130.\n\nMany drivers may never have unwrapped their charging cables, The Miles Consultancy said.\n\nSubsidies for new PHEVs were recently scrapped, after seven years.\n\nThe plug-in grant was introduced in 2011, gifting buyers up to \u00a34,500 off new cars.\n\nThe incentive helped the UK become the biggest market for PHEVs in Europe.\n\nThe majority of the tens of thousands of eligible vehicles sold were bought by company fleets, including more than 70% of the 37,000 plug-in hybrids sold so far in 2018.\n\nBut data from The Miles Consultancy, a Cheshire firm which advises 300 blue-chip companies on fuel management, reveals that many businesses simply used the grant to save on buying regular cars.\n\nImage caption When regularly charged, PHEVs can achieve more than 130 miles per gallon\n\nMileage records from 1,500 models, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Volvo vehicles, showed an average real-world mpg of 39.27, against an average manufacturer advertised mpg of 129.68.\n\nFigures for 2,432 hybrids -

At the other end, May failed to make Bogdan pay for his equally unwise rush from his goalline.\n\nAberdeen had not lost from a winning position at Pittodrie since 2014 and that record was prolonged after Kamberi twice failed to find the target from close range.\n\nFlorian Kamberi missed chances for Hibs in the second half\n\nPlenty to ponder for Lennon - analysis\n\nBBC Scotland's Tyrone Smith at Pittodrie\n\nThe wind was the winner, the dreadful conditions stifling what should have been a high-quality affair, but Aberdeen won't give a jot about that, as their bandwagon continues to gather pace. That is now four wins on the spin for the Pittodrie side, the international break perhaps coming at the wrong time for them.\n\nAs for Hibernian, they are now four without a victory, leaving plenty for Lennon to ponder over the next fortnight.

While they remain threatened they have done well in places such as Cantabria in northern Spain where their numbers have almost doubled in ten years.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wolf sightings have increased in Germany and France in recent years\n\nBut conservation success is also increasing the chances of human-wildlife conflict.\n\nWolf numbers have increased in Germany to such an extent that the animals now roam into the Netherlands where they have been linked to an increase in attacks on sheep.\n\nDespite these wild carnivores being protected by law in most countries, that hasn't stopped farmers reaching for their guns when their domestic animals have been attacked.\n\nThis has become a significant issue in some countries. In France, around 10,000 sheep were killed in wolf attacks in 2016, with the government paying out some \u20ac3.2m in compensation.\n\nNow the EU hopes that by relaxing the rules on reimbursing farmers for the damage done by carnivores, it will lessen the need for farmers to kill these threatened species.\n\nUnder the new arrangement, member states will be able to fully compensate farmers for damages caused by wolves and bears. The farmers will also be entitled to compensation for building electric fences and buying guard dogs.\n\nIndirect expenses, including veterinary bills for the treatment of wounded sheep or cattle, and the costs of searching for missing animals, will also be fully met.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners welcomed the move.\n\n\"It's taking away an excuse for killing the animals by saying there are preventative measures you can take which can reduce, if not completely eliminate the threat,\" said Dr Jo Swabe from Humane Society International.\n\n\"We hope it will make a difference on the ground.\"\n\nImage copyright NurPhoto Image caption French farmers have held protests against plans to allow wolf numbers to increase\n\nThere has been a lot of pressure from governments in Germany and France to allow culls of wolves as a way of protecting domestic livestock.

They have more to fear from us than we have from them.\"\n\nWhile the EU has sanctioned increased payments for farmers in the hope that this might reduce the need for culling, the money has not always been forthcoming from governments.

More than half of all missions that have tried have failed.\n\nThe most recent European effort in 2016, for example, crashed into the ground at over 300km/h.\n\nThe LSSWG had been discussing landing options for more than four years, pulling in comments from the wider community.\n\nBut this week's meeting came down to a straight fight between Oxia and a place just to the north called Mawrth Vallis.\n\nBoth \"finalists\" hold promise for finding the traces of long-ago microbial activity. However, after hearing all the submissions - the working group has decided Oxia represents the best combination of compelling science and engineering caution.\n\nImage copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: The ExoMars rover will search for signs of life\n\nOxia lies about 18 degrees north of the equator, ensuring ExoMars' solar panels will get good exposure to sunlight all year round.\n\nBut it is the potential of what could lie under the rover's six wheels that most excites researchers.\n\nObservations from orbit suggest the surface materials at this location contain abundant clays - the type of sediments that will result from rock-weathering processes involving water.\n\nInvestigations by the American robot Curiosity at another site halfway around the planet have already found fine-grained, clay-bearing mudstones that were laid down in a lake setting.\n\nResearchers see evidence for lakes at Oxia, too - and rivers and deltas. And with ExoMars' specific life-detecting technologies, it might just be possible to find the traces of biological activity in the sediments.\n\nImage copyright NASA/JPL/University of Arizona Image caption Oxia Planum viewed from orbit: The absolute imperative is getting down safely\n\nProf John Bridges from Leicester University is a member of the working group. He commented: \"With an enormous catchment area the sediments will have captured organics from a wide variety of environments over a long period of time, including areas where life may have existed. The fine sediments should also be ideal for the ExoMars drill - it aims to get to 2m depth.\"\n\nThe rover is set to blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan between 25 July and 13 August 2020. Arrival would occur on 19 March, 2021.\n\nThe entry, descent and landing strategy will incorporate a capsule, a parachute system and a landing platform fitted with retro-rockets.\n\nOne key advantage Oxia Planum had over Mawrth Vallis in the selection process was elevation. This is considerably lower at the former - by about 1,000m.

claimed.\n\nScientists identified about 86,000 acres of countryside - with similar traits to the French plonk powerhouse - deemed \"prime\" land for vineyards.\n\nThe areas, including some in Suffolk, had ideal soil, terrain and climate for grape growing, experts from the University of East Anglia (UEA) said.\n\nBut they also warned budding winemakers to expect expensive set-up costs.\n\nClimate change had led to \"warmer growing seasons\" in England and Wales, researchers said.\n\nAs a result, areas \"where relatively few vineyards currently exist\" could have unexplored winemaking potential.\n\n'Fickle weather'\n\nThey said Essex, more commonly associated with reality star haunt the Sugar Hut, was drier, warmer and more stable than some more established vineyard locations.\n\nProf Steve Dorling, from the UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said the summer's heatwave had led to a \"record grape harvest\" and \"a vintage year for English and Welsh wine\".\n\nBut, he said, the season had been \"quite unusual in terms of weather\" and more work was needed to find the best places to plant vineyards able to withstand the UK's \"often fickle weather\".\n\nLead author Dr Alistair Nesbitt echoed Prof Dorling, and said there was \"definitely room for improvement\" but it was hoped the research could \"help boost future productivity\".\n\nSouthend Sparkles\n\nCould we one day see these brands on our supermarket shelves?\n\nBrutlingsea\n\nMoet & Clacton\n\nBolly-riccay\n\nCava

sparkling wine more like Champagne, but even better,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr Macaudy said the spring frost could make or break the harvest, after 80% of their crop was wiped out in April 2017.\n\nYou may

straight from the start of the second half - he was unlucky to not add to that tally when Morata squeezed between Everton's central defenders to connect with Hazard's cross, only for Pickford to save.\n\nOn balance, the hosts can probably feel these are two points dropped, but perhaps they can take some comfort in maintaining their unbeaten record.\n\nThe last time they avoided defeat in their first 12 Premier League games was in 2014-15 -

I was simply bringing back the glory of the ancient world,\" Davie told the 30 for 30 Podcast.\n\nDuring his research Davie, a former high school roommate of US President Donald Trump, was made aware of the Playboy article and sought out the man in question - Rorion Gracie.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Watch: UFC's first ever fight, 25 years ago\n\nA real life 'Mortal Kombat'\n\nBorn in Rio de Janiero, Gracie had moved to California in the late 1970s to demonstrate the Brazilian jiu-jitsu taught by his father, and inspired by a travelling Japanese master, was superior to all others, labelling his fight offer the \"Gracie Challenge\".\n\nDavie made his pitch, and Gracie was sold.\n\nGracie had already enjoyed a taste of on-screen fighting after preparing Mel Gibson for 1987 film Lethal Weapon, but for he and Davie to make the tournament a success they needed to attract a pay-per-view provider.\n\nDespite HBO and Showtime turning down their pitch for a 'War of the Worlds', the concept hooked Semaphore Entertainment Group (SEG) executive producer Campbell McLaren, who likened it to a real-life version of popular video game Mortal Kombat.\n\n\"There's a story in this event, there's a hook, there's a drama, there's a danger,\" said McLaren, in the documentary Fighting for a Generation.\n\nIt was game on.\n\nSharks? Alligators? Schwarzenegger?\n\nConan The Barbarian and Mortal Kombat were some of the influences on UFC 1, which was co-founded by Art Davie and Rorion Gracie (top right)\n\nWhile the organisers set about creating the tournament - deciding to call it Ultimate Fighting Championship, because War of the Worlds was \"too science-fictiony\" - Davie stumbled across a loophole in Colorado law that meant bare-knuckle fighting was permitted in the state.\n\nVenue sorted, the eight-man roster also began to take shape - martial artists in savate, kickboxing, taekwondo, shootfighting, boxing, sumo, American Kenpo and, of course, Brazilian jiu-jitsu were booked in.\n\nBut as promotion for UFC 1 gathered pace with the marketing slogan \"there are no rules\", so did the opposition to it. Senator John McCain wanted it banned and branded the concept a \"human cockfight\".\n\nDavie, Royce and McLaren knew they needed a \"shock\" factor to generate interest, and were busy throwing ideas around for how the stage would be set for the fighters - an arena with sharks? A moat with alligators? An electrical fence?\n\nThey opted for an octagon-shaped cage, suggested by Conan the Barbarian director John Milius - because Conan, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, battles in a stone octagon. Schwarzenegger liked the idea, as did fellow Hollywood tough-guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.\n\n\"Van Damme was very cool,\" McLaren told Maxim, admitting martial artist-turned-actor-turned-producer Chuck Norris was \"not so cool\", questioning whether it was even legal.\n\n\"He was badmouthing it. He didn't want to be involved, he thought it was bad for the martial arts.\"\n\nThe rules\n\nThis won't take long. There were no rules.\n\nWell, actually, there were a couple - albeit the tournament was sold on the idea there were none - no biting and no eye-gouging. Oh, and no fish-hooking, as the only response to this was biting, and fighters had to be bare-fist, and they couldn't wear shoes if they planned to kick people.\n\nThis didn't sit well with the assembled mix of fighters. No rules meant no rules, right? It almost sparked a brawl in the pre-tournament meeting, until Teila Tuli smoothed things over.\n\nTuli, a Hawaiian sumo wrestler who had been banned from competing in Japan for pushing a journalist, told the others: \"I came here to party. If any of you came here to party, I'll see you in the arena tomorrow.\"\n\nTuli leaves teeth in Gordeau's foot\n\nDutch savate Gerard Gordeau beat sumo Teila Tuli in 26 seconds in the opening bout\n\nAbout 7,000 spectators turned up at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver to witness the action live, with a further 86,000 tuning in on pay-per-view - three times what the promoters anticipated - and many more heading to their local video store to rent the tournament on VHS in the aftermath.\n\nTwenty-six seconds into their viewing experience, they saw a tooth whistle past the judges after being knocked from the mouth of Tuli.\n\nThe sumo actually lost three teeth during a kick to the face from Gerard Gordeau, but two of them remained lodged in the Dutchman's foot.\n\nGordeau also left the octagon with a broken hand after following up his roundhouse kick with an uppercut to head of Tuli, whose optimistic early charge across the canvas towards the savate world champion ended with him being dragged to the ground.\n\nThe suddenness and violence of that opening bout left even the organisers stunned, and thirsty for more.\n\nAll bar McLaren and CEG, that is, who had three hours of live pay-per-view television to fill and feared if the fights carried on at that rate the tournament would be over in little more than 10 minutes.\n\nMcLaren needn't have worried. It might have been less clinical, but the second bout was as gruelling as the first had been explosive as kickboxer Kevin Rosier and American Kenpo Zane Frazier fought it out for four minutes and 20 seconds.\n\nIt was violent and chaotic, with knees and elbow strikes complemented by hair pulling and groin attacks, before Frazier's wife threw in the towel after he was knocked down with blows to the back of the head and stamped on.\n\nFrazier, a former bodyguard for Stevie Wonder, had asthma and was rushed to hospital following the bout after suffering respiratory failure.\n\n\"The paramedics saved my life,\" said Frazier in 2011, adding that he was diagnosed with asthma after the bout and told he would never compete again - he eventually retired 15 years later.\n\nEnter Royce Gracie\n\nRorion's younger brother Royce was put forward to compete\n\nNow, remember there was a Brazilian jiu-jitsu among the competitors? And that Rorion Gracie introduced the sport to the United States and challenged anyone to a winner-takes-it all $100,000 fight? Well, he put forward his brother, Royce.\n\nRorion said entering Royce would \"prove a point jiu-jitsu was for anyone... that it can do wonders for the little guy\", while Royce was keen to establish himself in the fighting arena.\n\nRoyce was drawn against boxer Art Jimmerson in the quarter-finals and swiftly floored the cruiserweight, who wore one glove for the fight, with a double-leg takedown.

I never imagined I would be wrestling a guy on the floor,\" said Jimmerson.\n\nMcLaren added: \"I was sure Royce was going to get his head knocked off his body by that boxer - and I thought Teila was going to slam everybody into the chain link fence and smoosh them - so that's how much I knew!\"\n\nRoyce said the bout was \"almost unfair\", adding: \"The stand-up fighters had almost no idea what to do on the ground.\"\n\nThe other fight of the round took place between the Captain America-esque Ken Shamrock, listed as a shootfighter, and taekwondo representative Patrick Smith.\n\n\"This thing, the UFC, it was almost like who could beat me?\" quipped Shamrock, who quickly submitted Smith with a heel hook.\n\nAn Ultimate Fighting Champion is crowned\n\nRoyce Gracie said he would spend his winnings on going to Disneyland\n\nShamrock's armoury was made up of a mix of disciplines, but in the semi-final he came up against Royce and the Gracie family who claimed to have \"the\" best fighting style.\n\nThe fight lasted less than two minutes, Gracie managing to engineer a choke using his uniform and Shamrock bemoaning his lack of grip having been banned from wearing shoes.\n\n\"I'm sorry I didn't give him a good enough fight,\" said Shamrock after the fight, later admitting he would never head into a contest with such arrogance again.\n\nHe may have lost the bout, but Shamrock would go on to become a UFC champion, be labelled \"The World's Most Dangerous Man\" by ABC News and feature in the WWE.\n\nRoyce, meanwhile, headed into the final unscathed having yet to be really tested. Gordeau, with a broken bone in his hand and pieces of tooth still in his foot, awaited him.\n\nThe final lasted one minute and 40 seconds, with Gordeau at first managing to stand firm before being grounded by Royce. There was an alleged bite from the Dutchman, but Royce was able to land strikes and headbutts before submitting Gordeau with a rear naked choke hold.\n\nRoyce, and the Gracies, were victorious. \"I had to prove to my family I was a fighter,\" said the champion, who declared after the bout he would use the $50,000 prize to go to Disneyland.\n\nAs for Rorion, he was delighted. And satisfied Brazilian jiu-jitsu produced \"the ultimate fighters\".\n\n\"It was like a Cinderella story, it was beautiful,\" he said. \"I proved my point, that's for sure.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Scotland 54-17 Fiji\n\nAutumn Test: Scotland v Fiji Scotland (21) 54 Tries: Dell, Brown, Seymour (3), Maitland, Ritchie, Hastings Cons: Laidlaw 5, Russell 2 Fiji (17) 17 Tries: Mata, Radradra Cons: Volavola 2 Pens: Volavola\n\nTommy Seymour scored a hat-trick of tries as Scotland weathered an early storm to blow Fiji away at Murrayfield.\n\nAllan Dell, Fraser Brown and Seymour touched down as Scotland edged to a 17-14 lead at the interval.\n\nTries from Viliame Mata and Semi Radradra had Fiji in front briefly but they had no answer to the hosts' composure, fitness and control.\n\nSeymour plunged over twice in a second-half rout, with Sean Maitland, Jamie Ritchie and Adam Hastings also scoring.\n\nGiven what happened to them the last time they played Fiji - a bruising loss in Suva in the summer of 2017 - Scotland will have been glad to get this one out of the way. And with an amount of style in the end.\n\nThe longer it went on, the more Scotland powered away and the more Fiji suffered. The visitors' ill-discipline cost them two yellow cards and a whole world of trouble. When their energy tanks started to empty, their pain only intensified.\n\nFinn Russell, piling on the unpredictability and the class on his return, and Seymour exploding back into try-scoring form were some of the headlines, but there were others.\n\nRitchie was terrific in the back-row against Fiji's man mountains. Sam Skinner, on his debut, was deeply impressive. Stuart Hogg's first game back after injury was a reminder of what Scotland miss when he's away.\n\nIt was a frenetic Test, a comfortable start for the home team, then a wobble, then a level of dominance that squeezed all the hope out of the Fijians.\n\nThe visitors took the lead with a Ben Volavola penalty, but Scotland quickly replied with a Dell try courtesy of patience and accuracy close to the line - features that were singularly absent in last weekend's loss in Cardiff - and then a close-range shunt from Brown.\n\nEven from the back of the stand you could hear Pete Horne's sigh of relief when the hooker piled over. In the preamble, Horne had Seymour running free outside him close to Fiji's 5m line and chose, in a rush of blood, to ignore him.\n\nCaptain Greig Laidlaw was good with both conversions and the Scots were ahead 14-3.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Scotland's Seymour completes hat-trick\n\nJust when things looked tidy for Scotland, it got messy. A miscommunication at a line-out gifted front foot ball to the visitors and when these lads are on the front foot and running into open country then it normally ends in a score.\n\nPeceli Yato, the giant of Clermont, took it on and linked with Mata who drove on under the posts. Six minutes later, they were at it again. Leone Nakarawa burst through a ruck and when he got a touch lucky with his offload his team made the most of it.\n\nFrank Lomani took Fiji into Scotland territory, Tevita Cavubati took Dell to the cleaners in support and found Radradra for the try. All of a sudden, Fiji had hit the front.\n\nThe rest? A constant blue wave. Cavubati saw yellow amid a Scottish siege, then Nakarawa went the same way. Seymour punished them before the end of the half after a beautiful skip pass from Russell, who then pored it on for the rest of the day.\n\nMaitland struck just after the restart to put Fiji well and truly on the ropes and Seymour virtually knocked them out just before the hour after being slipped in by Laidlaw.\n\nThe scores kept coming. Seymour's hat-trick score was a beauty, a counter-attack off a loose Fiji kick involving Horne, Russell and Chris Harris.\n\nScotland were rampant. Ritchie went over from close-range with two minutes left and Hastings, following more Russell excellence, took it beyond 50 points a few moments later. From a Test that looked tricky, it had long since become a stroll.\n\nScotland: 15-Hogg, 14-Seymour, 13-Dunbar, 12-P Horne, 11-Maitland, 10-Russell, 9-Laidlaw; 1-Dell, 2-Brown, 3-Nel, 4-Skinner, 5-Gilchrist, 6-Wilson, 7-Ritchie, 8-Fagerson\n\nReplacements: 16-McInally (for Brown, 52 mins), 17-Allan (for Dell, 55 mins), 18-Berghan (for Nel, 55 mins), 19-J Gray (for Wilson, 61 mins), 20-Strauss (for Fagerson, 30 mins), 21-G Horne (for Laidlaw, 61 mins), 22-Hastings (for P Horne, 71 mins), 23-Harris (for Dunbar, 49 mins).\n\nFiji: 15-Tuicuvu, 14-Talebula, 13-Radradra, 12-Vatabua, 11-Goneva, 10-Volavola, 9-Lomani; 1-Maafu, 2-Matavesi, 3-Saulo, 4-Cavubati, 5-Nakarawa, 6-Waqaniburotu, 7-Yato, 8-Mata\n\nReplacements: 16-Dolokoto (for Matavesi, 60 mins), 17-Mawi (for Maafu, 60 mins), 18-Tawake (for Saulo, 50 mins), 19-Tuisue (for Cavubati, 68 mins), 20-Kunatani (for Yato, 63 mins), 21-Seniloli (For Lomani, 61 mins), 22-Veitokani (for Talebula, 63 mins), 23-Vasiteri (for Tuicuvu, 24 mins).\n\nReferee: Andrew Brace (Ireland)\n\nTouch judges: Luke Pearce and Karl Dickson (both England)\n\nTMO: Ben Skeen (New Zealand)", "Image copyright PA Image caption The baby boy was born on a Southeastern service to Stratford International in London\n\nA baby has been born on a train after his mother went into labour while on board.\n\nParamedics were called to the service to London's Stratford International to help the woman give birth shortly after 20:55 GMT on Thursday.\n\nServices were suspended to allow the ambulance crew access to the train, causing delays on Southeastern rail.\n\nSoutheastern said: \"Mum and baby were taken to hospital and we send them both our warmest congratulations.\n\n\"We were pleased to welcome a new arrival at Stratford International station on Thursday evening, with a baby boy born on board one of our Highspeed trains.\"\n\nOn social media, passengers seemed to forgive the rail operator for the delays.\n\nOne person wrote: \"I'm on one of the delayed trains and for once I don't care.

Just ask League Two leaders Lincoln City, whose dramatic 2016-17 run has helped fund their new \u00a31.3m elite performance centre.\n\nSpeaking as the 12.3 acre training-ground site opened, vice-chairman Roger Bates told BBC Sport: \"The television money and the prize money have gone a long way towards underpinning what we've done here.\n\n\"It's fair to say that, without that cup run, this would have been a challenge. The progress we've been able to make gives us a real sense of pride.\"\n\nChief executive Liam Scully added: \"The support we've had from the city and the spirit of football is ultimately why we all work in this game, for stories such as this that we're living right now.\n\n\"This has all been achieved by six crazy months in a sense, by what was a relatively small non-league club at the time. To see us where we are now, averaging 8,500 gates, is phenomenal.\"\n\nLincoln overcame Guiseley, Altrincham, Oldham, Ipswich, Brighton and Premier League Burnley before losing to Arsenal in the last eight, playing nine games in that run including replays.\n\nThe Imps knocked out the Clarets with a late 1-0 win at Turf Moor in February 2017 to become the first non-league side to reach the quarter-finals for 103 years.\n\nOne of the stars of that run, forward Matt Rhead, added: \"The FA Cup can change your life. We didn't have a training ground at the time - we were training at parks, fields, wherever we could find. Now it's somewhere that we can all call home.\"\n\nLincoln host Northampton Town on Saturday, with \u00a336,000 up for grabs for first-round winners this term after total prize money was doubled for this season to \u00a330.2m.\n\nWhat about those wanting to avoid a shock?\n\nFormer Northern Ireland international Michael Duff took charge of Cheltenham in September\n\nThose scanning the first-round fixtures for possible shocks will likely look for three things; a lower-league side playing at home, a higher-ranked side enduring a poor run and minnows who are extra motivated.\n\nAt Saturday's tie between Ebbsfleet United and Cheltenham Town, all three arguably apply. The National League hosts have a new boss in Garry Hill, after Daryl McMahon's exit by mutual consent on Wednesday.\n\nHill's new side face a Robins outfit which is yet to win under manager Michael Duff in his nine League Two matches so far.\n\n\"It won't be easy. In the pyramid, they're not that many players below us,\" Duff told BBC Radio Gloucestershire. \"The players are fully aware of where we are and what we need to do.\n\n\"It's a tough game but we're not focused on them.

Anthony Martial sent the Brazilian keeper the wrong way from the spot.\n\nIt briefly revived memories of last season's dramatic derby here when United came from two goals down to win, but City never looked like losing control and wrapped up the win two minutes from time when substitute Gundogan took advantage of static United defending to beat De Gea from close range following a 44-pass move.\n\n\"We deserved the victory,\" City manager Pep Guardiola told BBC Sport. \"The first half we played a little bit with fear and we didn't want to lose the ball.

It's a completely absurd situation to defend.\n\n\"In this country normally you cannot show disrespect to the referee and this is a problem because it's shown disrespect to my team, myself and Fulham supporters.\"\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Jokanovic bemoans referee's decisions\n\nSalah's goal came after goalkeeper Alisson initiated a lightening counter attack, with the Egyptian running unopposed from the halfway line to open the scoring.\n\n\"We were a bit lucky and maybe because of Robbo it is not 100% offside because of his heel,\" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri's cushioned finish in the second half confirmed victory for the Reds who equalled their best start to a Premier League season, which came in 2002-03.\n\nLiverpool and Salah approaching their best?\n\nKlopp has maintained his Liverpool team are not yet at their free-flowing best - and that in itself should swell confidence around Anfield.\n\nThis victory ensured the Reds remain unbeaten after 12 league outings, eight points better off than at the same time last term and well placed to challenge for the league title.\n\nLast season Liverpool toiled against the bottom three, drawing twice against West Brom, once against Stoke and losing at Swansea.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Liverpool's 'exceptional' points haul delights Klopp\n\nBut Salah, who has now scored five goals and provided five assists in 633 minutes against newly promoted teams, helped to ensure the outcome of this fixture was not in question.\n\nThe Egyptian had scored nine times at the same stage last term but his performance against Fulham, where he registered his sixth goal of the campaign, suggested he is not far from replicating his best form.\n\nThe 26-year-old instigated a glorious early exchange with Roberto Firmino to carve the visitors' defence apart, only to see Rico react well to save at his feet.\n\nAnd that was a precursor to what was to follow, with Rico again saving from the Egyptian before he broke clear to open the scoring.\n\n\"The most important thing is reacting quick in that situation and it was brilliant: Alisson, Trent (Alexander-Arnold), Mo and done,\" Klopp added.\n\nRevised style sees Fulham improve\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic thought he had given Fulham the lead at Anfield, but Mohamed Salah scored 14 seconds later for Liverpool after the Serbia forward's header was ruled out\n\nFulham, whose expansive style of play proved so successful in the Championship last season, have yet to deliver results against clubs in the Premier League.\n\nThe Cottagers, who spent more than \u00a3100m on players in the summer, arrived at Anfield with the worst defensive record in the league, having conceded 29 goals from their opening 11 fixtures.\n\nThat prompted Jokanovic into a rethink as he deployed four central defenders in a revised system and fended off pre-match questions about his team selection.\n\nAnd after early teething problems - with Sadio Mane firing wide from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross - Fulham grew into the game.\n\nHappy to concede possession and sit deep, the visitors could have delivered the perfect riposte of a goal when Ryan Sessegnon was sent clear by Mitrovic's flick-on.\n\nThe England under-21 winger, who covered more ground (12.22km) than any other player during the course of the afternoon, guided his shot wide of the right-hand post.\n\nGerman forward Andre Schurrle then tested Alisson and Mitrovic failed to connect properly with a shot from 10 yards out.\n\nWhen the Serbia forward powered a header past Alisson from Tom Cairney's cross it appeared as though Jokanovic's strategy might yield an unlikely dividend.\n\nInstead the visitors, who managed the same number of shots on target as Liverpool in the first half, were undone by a moment of naivety with Denis Odoi's attempt to catch Salah offside.\n\nMan of the match - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)\n\nMohamed Salah has now scored against 19 of the 21 Premier League opponents he's faced with Liverpool, failing only against Man Utd and Swansea\n\nFulham close unwanted Barnsley record - the stats\n\nLiverpool have picked up 30 points from their opening 12 Premier League games (W9 D3 L0) - their joint-best total at this stage in the competition (level with 2002-03).\n\nFulham have conceded 31 goals from their first 12 league games this season; only Barnsley in 1997-98 conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League campaign (35).\n\nFulham have taken one point from their past 19 Premier League games against the 'big six' sides (W0 D1 L18), losing all four games this season by an aggregate score of 2-13.\n\nLiverpool have won all nine home Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp against newly promoted teams, scoring 27 goals and conceding just three.\n\nLiverpool have kept 10 clean sheets in 14 Premier League games at Anfield in 2018;

Manchester City had 80% of possession, with 20 shots to five from the Potters. \"It was horrible,\" he recalled.\n\nFletcher on Man City 7-2 Stoke: \"We got it wrong that day. We actually tried to press City high up the pitch and the problem was the game became too stretched.\n\n\"Not everyone in the team bought into it, and not everyone followed the instructions - and that is when it is dangerous.\n\n\"Some of our players pressed, but some didn't and the gaps became huge. It ended up becoming a disaster. There were too many spaces, and also too many players.\n\n\"City had all of their players in the midfield area, dropping in between the lines, and we had too many people in areas that could not affect that.\n\n\"Stoke had got a point at City the previous season playing the same way but that day we got it wrong and we got punished for it. As a player, to be out there and be part of that, was not a nice place to be.\n\n\"It was horrible, actually. Looking back now, it was one of the most difficult games of my career.\"\n\nWhat will United do? 'Inbetweeners in a circle press'\n\nPaul Pogba scored twice as United fought back from 2-0 down to beat City 3-2 at the Etihad in April\n\nFletcher: \"I am not expecting United boss Jose Mourinho to use a high press like Mark Hughes did with Stoke last season and again with Southampton when City beat them 6-1 on Sunday.\n\n\"I think Mourinho will set them up to be very solid, but not to sit as deep as they usually do.\n\n\"Instead I think they will use what I call a circle press, or a half-way line press, where you are not too deep but not too far forward either.\n\n\"So a lot of your players are maybe 10 yards either side of the centre-circle, which means you are trying to be a little bit brave with your defensive line and you have also got your strikers within a good distance.\n\n\"That way, there are no big spaces in the middle of the pitch for City to exploit.\n\nFor United to be dangerous on the counter-attack against City, Fletcher thinks they need their most mobile attackers - \"any three from Sanchez, Martial, Lingard and Rashford\" - on the pitch rather than Romelu Lukaku, who was injured and missed Wednesday's win over Juventus. Ander Herrera was also in the United side that beat Juve\n\n\"If United's defence is higher than normal, City can just play balls over the top - so the position of goalkeeper David de Gea is important too.\n\n\"His defenders will have to trust him to be in the right places to deal with certain balls so they are not worried about City's forwards getting in behind.\n\n\"If it works, United's outfield players will be in a sort of in-between position, where they can be a threat on the counter-attack but also put a bit of pressure on City when they are on the ball.\n\n\"That is what they did so well in the second half at the Etihad at the end of last season and fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.\"\n\nLong ball City? 'They like to ping a pass forward'\n\nEderson practices one of his long 'ping' passes forward\n\nFletcher: \"Whatever your strategy is against City, you have to be careful because they are a very clever team.\n\n\"People think they play total football out from the back but their gameplan is actually to get the ball into their front players as quickly as possible.\n\n\"And, whatever space there is to exploit out there, they exploit it.\n\n\"If you put too many players forward to press, they will play that hard, long and low 'ping' pass forward, which is different to a normal high long ball because it is harder for a defender to get there first. Ederson is a master of it.\n\n\"They want their three front players to go one-on-one if they can and, whoever is playing in their attack, they will back themselves to beat their man because they are so fast and skilful.\n\n\"Everywhere on the pitch, the balance of when to go hunting for the ball or when to drop deep is so hard to find. If you get it wrong, they will punish you.\"\n\nCity's key man? 'Silva is their Scholesy'\n\nDavid Silva has created 30 chances from open play in the Premier League this season, nine more than any other Premier League player. His City team-mate Raheem Sterling, Liverpool's Mo Salah and Chelsea's Eden Hazard are next on the list with 21. The highest-ranked United player is Alexis Sanchez, who is joint 18th with 14\n\nFletcher: \"City have so many fantastic players, but there is one who is more influential than all the others in terms of making them tick - David Silva.\n\n\"When you play against them, you can see Silva has got the respect of all the City team.\n\n\"I would relate it to how my United team was with Paul Scholes. You would sometimes be in a good position yourself but if 'Scholesy' was there, you would just give him the ball.\n\n\"You might think that is crazy for a professional footballer to admit but, when it happens, that is the ultimate respect.\n\n\"Everyone did it with Scholesy, not just me. I have seen players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney do the same if Scholesy was free, and just give it to him.\n\n\"It happens naturally when you are out on the pitch, and I see it happen with Silva now.\n\n\"Yes, Raheem Sterling is arguably their form player and is so dangerous with his runs, and how he penetrates defences and gets behind them.\n\n\"And they have got Sergio Aguero too, who is always such a threat, but Silva is the one for me who is the heartbeat of that team.\"\n\nHow to stop Silva? 'Herrera can be United's hero'\n\nCould Ander Herrera snuff out David Silva's threat on Sunday? \"He could make it a difficult game for him,\" thinks Fletcher\n\nFletcher: \"I quite like man-for-man marking as a way of stopping a key man for the opposition, and it is something I have done myself in my career.\n\n\"But I did it against what I would call classic midfielders - players more like Cesc Fabregas, Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard.\n\n\"The problem with doing that against City is that, if you man mark David Silva, he is quite comfortable dragging you all over the pitch, knowing what you are trying to do.\n\n\"He will go and stand on the left wing, so you will be playing right back. And then, say, Leroy Sane will come inside and your right-back will be playing in the centre of midfield.\n\n\"United have to try to stop Silva somehow, though, and for them to do that, I think Ander Herrera has to play.\n\n\"Having been in the United dressing room with him, he is one of those players who remembers everything the manager says, and is constantly reiterating those points to the rest of the team.\n\n\"Not every player does that, because some of them are so tied up in the game themselves, but Herrera does not just remember his role, he remembers other people's too.\n\n\"He is that influential to the whole team, plus he is aggressive and he can set a tempo for United when they get the ball back.\n\n\"I like him and I would have him in the team. He could go up against Silva and make it a difficult game for him, which does not happen very often.\"", "Video\n\nA community-based newspaper in the Indian capital Delhi is providing a voice for Africans living there.\n\nAfricans make up to 25% of the population in the city's Khirkee village area, but often face discrimination and struggle to integrate.\n\nKhirkee Voice co-publisher Malini Kochupillai told the BBC that they are \"providing a voice for the unheard to be heard\".\n\nVideo Journalist: Angelica Jopson", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Milford Haven was one of the areas to suffer flooding\n\nMore than 1,000 properties were left without power during heavy rain and wind which brought flooding and travel disruption.\n\nPembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire saw the worst of the weather with some homes in Milford Haven under 10ft (3m) of water.\n\nA Met Office warning to expect flooding was in force across the two counties until 23:00 GMT.\n\nOther parts of south and mid Wales were also \"at risk\" of flooding.\n\nWestern Power Distribution has restored most of the outages but the rain has been the biggest problem.\n\nPembrokeshire council said home owners and businesses in Haverfordwest town centre should prepare for possible flooding on Friday night, while Carmarthenshire council warned those in the St Clears area to be \"particularly prepared\".\n\nA number of roads were flooded including parts of the A40, which runs through both counties.

In a move opponents are calling unconstitutional, the island's parliament has been dissolved and fresh elections scheduled for January. Many now fear the return of a man accused of presiding over serious human rights abuses, as Charles Haviland reports.\n\nRajapaksa has charm and charisma in abundance.\n\nI met him for the first time in 2010, in the early stages of a five-year stint as the BBC's Sri Lanka correspondent. I and my colleagues had turned up at his rural home totally unannounced. We were greeted by his son - and heir-apparent - Namal and were ushered in to meet the powerful leader, who was relaxing in his front room.\n\nWe chatted at length. We were served tea. At no point did Mahinda Rajapaksa check the time, or imply we should leave. At later meetings, usually in a crowd of journalists, it was the same story. He would pat the seat next to his one. \"Come and talk,\" he would say.\n\nThat charm, combined with his oratorical skills and his folksy appeal to the Sinhalese masses, gave him, and still give him, huge popularity among the Sinhala people who make up about three-quarters of the island's population.\n\nSome composed songs and poems calling him a king. And his winning of the war against the Tamil Tigers (LTTE), the ethnic minority separatists who had waged a violent campaign for decades, sealed that popularity.\n\nHe had done a good thing, wrote an admirer on a news website, for liquidating the LTTE who had killed civilians \"through indiscriminate shooting, hacking and blowing up buses, trains, shopping malls etc\".\n\nThe problem is that winning that war was a supreme case of the end being used to justify the means.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Jubilant crowds took to the streets of Colombo in May 2009 after Mahinda Rajapaksa declared victory over the tigers\n\nSo for all the cheering crowds in Colombo streets at the war's end in May 2009, there was an equal number of people, mostly Tamils, silently mourning. They had lost infants, elderly parents, spouses and siblings as the army battered the last small pocket of land held by the LTTE - which, it is important to stress, would not let them leave.\n\nThey had seen their homes razed to the ground. They had seen their loved ones, conscripted by the LTTE, then forcibly \"disappeared\" after surrendering to Mr Rajapaksa's government forces. Or they had themselves been maimed. I will never forget a young woman working in a small shop in the former LTTE stronghold Kilinochchi three years after the war's end. When I cautiously raised the subject of the war she quietly emerged from behind the counter and delicately moved parts of her sari to show us a shrapnel wound.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Hundreds of thousands of people ended up in refugee camps\n\nThere were the accounts, too, of surrendering LTTE forces being killed even while waving white flags, or after being taken into custody. The video evidence of this that emerged at and after the war's closing stages was compelling, despite the government's strenuous denials.\n\nIn September 2018 came an admission from the horse's mouth. SB Dissanayake, who had served as Mr Rajapaksa's higher education minister, publicly said that many LTTE rebels were killed in army custody. He singled out one example, Thambiraja Thurairajasingham, an LTTE military commander widely known as Colonel Ramesh. Mr Dissanayake said Ramesh had phoned him to give notice of his impending surrender. \"Ramesh surrendered, and Ramesh was killed,\" the ex-minister told a Sinhala-language news conference, smiling.\n\nI remember similar creepy smiles from the defence spokesman at the time, Keheliya Rambukwella, commenting on the undisclosed fate of a (Sinhalese) satirical journalist who had disappeared in 2010. It was a cause for banter between him and his ministry colleague - who smiled and indeed laughed in front of the press, many of whom also laughed in seeming agreement.\n\nFor me, covering the war's aftermath, disappearances were perhaps the most haunting of the rights violations - the very large number of disappearances among ex-rebels and Tamil civilians in the north, but people also vanishing in Colombo, the city I called home. I met Shiromani and her infant at their Colombo home just weeks after the disappearance of her businessman husband, whose court case against the police for alleged torture in jail was about to be heard.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tamils held large, daily protests in the final days of the war outside the UK Parliament in London\n\nThat was six years ago. She is still awaiting news. Many others similarly vanished. At that time, a newspaper reported a senior police officer as saying they had \"plenty of white vans\" to bring to anti-government street protests. Such vans are still notorious as the instrument of alleged state-sponsored abductors.\n\nSince the people of Sri Lanka voted out Mahinda Rajapaksa and his allies in presidential and parliamentary elections in 2015, progress on human rights has been frustratingly slow. Some Tamil and other campaigners say little or nothing has changed.\n\nRanil Wickremesinghe, the prime minister recently sacked by his erstwhile ally, President Maithripala Sirisena, but who says he remains the rightful PM, has in the past crudely brushed aside concerns over disappearances. Last year Mr Sirisena dashed hopes that alleged war crimes would be investigated by saying he would \"not allow anyone in the world to touch\" any military chief or \"war hero\" - shorthand for the overwhelmingly Sinhalese army.\n\nTheir coalition has reneged on its earlier promise to set up a court to scrutinise the conduct of the war. And although it has released quite a lot of mainly Tamil-owned land in the north that the military had occupied for years, that process has been piecemeal, often grudging, and frequently involved properties being wilfully destroyed and villagers remaining destitute.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government has set up an Office for Missing Persons, created by parliament to establish the truth of the fate of thousands of people, including both civilians and combatants, from the war period and beyond.\n\nOther new mechanisms include an office for war reparations and another on reconciliation. The national human rights commission was made fully independent, and the climate for speech and media freedom and the right to demonstrate notably relaxed.\n\nImage caption About 20,000 people, mostly Tamils, are still thought to be missing\n\nWith Mr Sirisena now trying to reinstate Mr Rajapaksa, some of these things are slipping away. The same Mr Rambukwella who laughed at the disappearance of a journalist is now back as minister for the media, while there are reports of escalating threats against civil society activists.\n\nIn September 2015, unveiling a hard-hitting report on Sri Lanka, the UN's human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said it laid bare grave crimes committed by both sides, including indiscriminate shelling, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, harrowing accounts of torture and sexual violence, and the forced recruitment of children.\n\nHe called for a special court, including foreign judges, to investigate. With Mahinda Rajapaksa now the president's preferred choice for prime minister - through means that experts say are unconstitutional - the prospect of any such court being set up within Sri Lanka now looks more distant than ever.", "Image caption Rehana Popal said more solicitors and barristers need to share their experiences\n\nThe only female Afghan barrister in England and Wales says she has become numb to discrimination after a client sacked her to appoint a white man.\n\nRehana Popal said other clients have told her they wanted someone white \"because the judge will believe them\".\n\nShe said it suggested there was a \"serious concern\" with how the justice system was being perceived.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said it was committed to increasing the diversity of the judiciary.\n\nMs Popal, an immigration and civil law specialist barrister at 10 KBW chambers in the Temple, tweeted: \"Just had a solicitor call to tell me... the client has said he doesn't want an Asian female but a white male barrister.\"\n\nThe barrister, who came to the UK as a child refugee, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it had happened several times before and was \"just sadly the reality\" of what ethnic minorities faced at the Bar.\n\n\"They will have had to hold some prejudicial views, for them to have come to say that,\" she explained, \"but equally there is a serious problem here in relation to perception, because clients have thought their cases will be more likely to be believed by a judge if it is presented by a white male barrister.\n\n\"That is a serious concern, because if they're having that perception, then there's something wrong with how the justice system is being perceived by outsiders and that needs to be remedied urgently.\"\n\n'Eye-roll'\n\nMs Popal said the sad thing was she had become \"numb\" to it as it had happened so often.\n\n\"When it happened it's almost 'eye-roll, here it happens again'.

He was caught by the police several times but has usually been allowed to carry on once he has explained to the police that he is \"not a vandal\".\n\nHe said: \"I take care to do it at night and it doesn't take long as I've already made the stickers but yes I have been caught in Italy, London and Japan.\n\n\"My girlfriend is Japanese and when I was arrested I was banned from entering the country and she was banned from leaving the country for five months. It was the worst day of my life.\n\n\"I'm very respectful to the police and explain what I'm doing and usually they are cool.\"\n\nHe makes extra signs he then sells to private clients and buys the signs from councils who take them down. His signs sell for between \u00a31,000 and \u00a310,000.\n\nHe added: \"I'm so pleased they haven't been removed in Edinburgh and I would feel it was a pity if they were taken down.

But in the last five minutes we were the team that wanted to push for the win.\n\n\"The good thing is four points in a week. I really can see the positives. We'll take this result even if I think we deserved more.\"\n\nWest Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini said: \"We didn't play well in the first half after their goal. You have to fight for every ball when you come here, they play with a great intensity and aggression. We also kept the ball too much in our own half, this is a team that aggressively presses you.\n\n\"In second half we improved a little bit more, we created chances and we got the goal.

It shows the plans are right, the preparation is right.\"\n\nSpinners lead all-round attack\n\nMoeen Ali (left) finished with match figures of 8-137\n\nEngland's bowling attack has struggled for potency overseas in recent years, but here Root was able to call on a variety of bowlers who all contributed.\n\nRoot started day four with seamers James Anderson and Sam Curran before turning quickly to spin when there continued to be no swing.\n\nHe first introduced left-arm spinner Leach, followed by off-spinner Moeen, and the pair removed the Sri Lanka openers, with Leach trapping Kaushal Silva lbw for 30 and Moeen catching Dimuth Karunaratne off his own bowling for 26.\n\nAll-rounder Stokes had a light workload with the ball in this Test but he dismissed Dhananjaya de Silva on the stroke of lunch and bowled a hostile spell after the interval.\n\nHe peppered Mathews and Kusal Mendis with excellent short bowling and should have had been rewarded with another wicket but Anderson dropped a simple catch from Mathews.\n\nLeach bowled a long, accurate spell in the afternoon session and claimed the two wickets to fall, having Mendis caught at mid-off and bowling Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal with a brilliant spinning delivery.\n\nMoeen then returned after tea and for the second time in the match took a wicket with the first ball of the final session, this time having Dhananjaya de Silva caught by Stokes at slip.\n\nShortly afterwards Moeen saw off Mathews and leg-spinner Rashid claimed his first wicket of the innings by dismissing Dilruwan Perera for an aggressive 30, before the victory was sealed by the run out of Herath.\n\nOther than Root, who bowled one over on day four, every England bowler took a wicket in the match but it will be the spinners who pleased the England captain most.\n\nTheir combined 16 wickets is the second-best spinners' haul for England for 60 years, beaten only by the 19 Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar shared in Mumbai in 2012.\n\n\"The spinners performed beautifully,\" Root added.\n\n\"They controlled when required, attacked when they could and I always felt we would take wickets throughout the game.\"\n\nEngland wicketkeeper Ben Foakes, who scored a first-innings century, was man of the match on his debut\n\nLosing run ends in Galle\n\nEngland's losing run overseas stretched back all the way to 30 October 2016 when they lost to Bangladesh in Dhaka.\n\nSince then England have lost series 4-0 in both India and Australia, plus 1-0 in New Zealand earlier this year, with three draws accompanying the nine defeats.\n\nPreviously at Galle England had drawn twice and lost twice but on this occasion, after being reduced to 103-5 before lunch on day one, they then dominated the match.\n\nAs well as the bowlers the batsmen also contributed, with man-of-the-match Ben Foakes and Keaton Jennings hitting centuries in the first and second innings respectively.\n\n\"To be able to contribute to the team is just amazing,\" Foakes said. \"It has been one of the best weeks of my career so far, if not the best.\n\n\"It's a dream come true.\"\n\nA win in the second Test in Pallekele, starting on Wednesday, would seal England's first away series win since beating South Africa in 2016.\n\nProblems for Sri Lanka\n\nRangana Herath made his Test debut in 1999\n\nFor Sri Lanka, the final wicket summed up their disappointing performance in this Test.\n\nTheir bowlers were not as effective as England's, their fielding disappointed and some of their batsmen again fell to reckless shots on the fourth day.\n\nMaking an albeit unlikely attempt to save the Test, Karunaratne was out attacking Moeen, hitting the ball straight back for a catch in the morning session, and Mendis foolishly charged down the wicket and skewed a shot to mid-off.\n\nThe ball before Dhananjaya edged to Stokes at first slip in the final over before lunch, he had played a wild drive to the Durham all-rounder which had been given out caught behind, only to be overturned on review.\n\nHerath's dismissal - sprawled in the dirt after failing to beat Stokes' powerful throw - was an ignominious finish for a player who ended with 433 Test wickets - putting him joint eighth on the all-time list - but also a strange one as he had called for the risky second run.\n\nThe 40-year-old's team-mates celebrated his retirement at the end of play by carrying the spinner around his home ground on their shoulders but Sri Lanka will now have to do without him for the remaining two Tests.\n\n\"It's a hard day for us, because we know how much Rangana has done for the team and Sri Lanka cricket,\" reflected Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, who struggled in this match with a groin injury sustained while fielding.\n\n\"We'll have to say 'sorry' to him, we couldn't give him a really good farewell.\n\n\"Our batting was below par during the game, you can't stay in the game [with this kind of batting].\n\n\"Credit goes to England, they played some outstanding cricket.

Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter.\n\nHousehold spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.\n\nBusiness investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSimon Jack, business editor\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all.\n\nWorryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over.\n\nPlenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.\n\n'Signs of weakness'\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond said: \"Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.\"\n\nONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: \"The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.\n\n\"However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.\"\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.\n\n\"The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.\"\n\nSuren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters.\"", "Image copyright Alison Thewliss\n\nA Clyde-built ship is to return home after years spent as a visitor attraction in Hawaii.\n\nBuilt in 1878 in Port Glasgow, the Falls of Clyde is currently moored in Honolulu harbour.\n\nA group campaigning to bring the ship back to Scotland said it had agreed a deal with a Dutch company to collect it in February next year.\n\nThe plan is to restore the Falls of Clyde and use it as an education and training vessel.\n\nThe Save Falls of Clyde campaign hopes a mooring can be secured in Greenock near to where it was built.\n\nThe Falls of Clyde transported sugar from Hawaii to America's west coast during the early part of its life before being converted into a bulk oil tanker.\n\nWelcome flotilla\n\nThe plan is for the Falls of Clyde to be transported by a heavy lift ship, leaving Honolulu in February and arriving back in the Clyde in April where it will be greeted by a flotilla of small boats.\n\nThe ship, the first of eight iron-hulled, four-masted vessels built by Russell and Company for the Falls Line, was named after a series of waterfalls in Lanarkshire.\n\nImage copyright SaveFallsofClyde Image caption The ship, currently in Honolulu harbour, has fallen into a poor state of repair\n\nIt the late 1960s the ship returned to Hawaii where it had spent much of its working life, and where it was hoped it would be fully restored.\n\nHowever, it is now in a poor state of repair, and in 2008 it was suggested the ship might have to be scuttled.\n\nLater that year, the ship's long-time owner, the Bishop Museum, agreed to sell it to a non-profit group which wanted to restore it.\n\nThe Save Falls of Clyde campaign to return the ship to Scotland was formally launched in 2016.", "Image caption Jean Winder is standing in the middle of the 1947 Commons Hansard reporting team (copyright holder: Parliamentary Art Collection)\n\nThis Saturday, 10 November, is 2018's Equal Pay Day in the UK.\n\nAfter this date, women will effectively work for free until the end of the year because of the gender pay gap.\n\nIt is 100 years since some British women first got the vote under the Representation of the People Act, so seems an ideal opportunity to celebrate a woman who played a vital, yet unsung, role in Parliamentary history.\n\nJean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.\n\nWartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said \"the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man\".\n\nDuring his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was \"a shorthand writer's dream\", and Mr Cole described her as \"as good as the men\", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff.\n\nRecords suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.\n\nMrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay.\n\nShe sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was \u00a3250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.\n\nIt is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.\n\nThe amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.\n\nMr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating \"practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men\".\n\nHe added \"this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary\".\n\nHer call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.\n\nImage copyright House of Commons Library Image caption Hansard has been producing an official report of proceedings in the Commons and Lords since 1909\n\nHer pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.\n\nMs Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament \"cannot be run on the basis of equal pay\" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.\n\nIn 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: \"I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.\"\n\nIn January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.\n\nImage copyright UK Parliament Website Image caption Hansard was first published on the internet in 1997\n\nMrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland.\n\nFrom Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.\n\nHansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said \"she was a woman who would not take no for an answer\".\n\n\"As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,\" she said.", "Video\n\nTwo fishermen were winched to safety after a storm capsized their boat in the English Channel.\n\nA passing merchant vessel picked up two other members of the crew.\n\nAll four are \"cold and wet, but otherwise safe and well\" according the HM Coastguard.", "Seven suspected migrants in a boat in the English Channel off Dover put out a rescue call in the early hours.\n\nThe men aged between 19 and 54 said they were Iranian.

If he is allowed to get into a rhythm, he does so very quickly within two or three rounds and becomes just about untouchable.\"\n\nThe bout - which will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live - is described by Eddie Hearn as \"the best fight I have ever promoted\". Four world titles will be on the line for just the sixth time in men's boxing history.\n\nRoom for one final flourish?\n\nDereck Chisora expects Bellew to be losing on the judges' cards but land a knockout on Saturday\n\nIn his own words Bellew, 35, is ready to \"shock the world and then do the greatest disappearing act.\"\n\nRetirement beckons for a fighter who won three British amateur titles before earning professional belts at British, European, commonwealth and - famously at Goodison Park in 2016 - world level.\n\nEarly days spent earning supplementary income stuffing pillows in a factory or working nightclub doors created a gateway to an 11-year pro career which even took in a Hollywood film appearance as 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan in 'Creed'.\n\nAfter two wins at heavyweight over David Haye, his rollercoaster career faces one final challenge against an opponent he describes as \"a monster\", despite insisting he will \"break\" Usyk's \"heart\".\n\n\"I just hope he comes back from it well as he will get a shock he does not see coming,\" Bellew told BBC Radio 5 live.\n\nWhy is 'regal' Usyk so good?\n\nUsyk became undisputed world cruiserweight champion and won the Muhammad Ali Trophy in July\n\nSocial media footage of 31-year-old Usyk dancing demonstrates a sleight of foot not typically associated with men in the cruiserweight division.\n\nHis obscure movement and high-pace assaults helped him claim gold at the London 2012 Olympics, catapulting him into a professional career which saw him win the inaugural World Boxing Super Series - and all four titles - in his 15th and most recent bout.\n\nHis display in the Super Series final - beating Russia's Murat Gassiev in Moscow - was described as \"regal\" by 5 live's Steve Bunce. It also ensured the father of three became the first Ukraine fighter to become an undisputed champion in a division.\n\nBellew's trainer Dave Coldwell said: \"If you just looked at the Gassiev win you'd think 'how on earth do you beat this guy?' But there are fights and moments where he doesn't have it all his own way. Do I think my fighter can take advantage? Yes I do.\"\n\nIn addition to movement, speed, Olympic pedigree and general work rate, Usyk brings another notable challenge...\n\n'Havoc' from the 'maverick' southpaw\n\nBellew admits he has in the past faced a \"massive problem\" in dealing with fighters - like Usyk - who sport a southpaw stance.\n\nHe says he has overcome the issue since working with trainer Coldwell but the clash of orthodox versus southpaw can historically present problems.\n\n\"I often used to refuse to go near southpaws,\" Bellew said. \"I've sparred them for 12 weeks now so I can hit them and know what they do. This guy is unlike any other fighter in the world.\n\n\"He's a one-off, a maverick, he's formidable at what he does. I just know I am going to find a way. I even know how I am going to do it, I just can't say.\"\n\nBBC 5 live commentator Mike Costello:\n\nWhy is there that issue? It is very difficult to get a jab going and get into a good rhythm against a southpaw. The reason the southpaws don't have the same problem is the numbers mean they are so used to meeting plenty of orthodox fighters compared to the other way around. It took 100 years until we saw a southpaw heavyweight world champion - Michael Moorer.\n\nWe know the old adage of a kid turning up at a gym and being asked what hand he writes with. Whatever the strong hand is tends to be a fighter's back hand as it's then more powerful, so a right handed kid would typically be orthodox in his stance.\n\nI've read about the great Soviet coach Andrei Chervonenko who went to Cuba and revolutionised their boxing in the 60s. He was committed to turning fighters to southpaw regardless of their strongest hand as he felt southpaws would wreak havoc on the international scene.\n\nBBC 5 live analyst Steve Bunce:\n\nFrom when I first started covering international events in the late 1990s, you're stunned by just how many Eastern Block fighters and the entire Cuban team are southpaws. They 100% switch guys around and make southpaws out of guys that should have been orthodox.\n\n'Tony wins, it's in the stars' - what they said...\n\nUsyk (left) is a strong favourite to beat Bellew with bookmakers\n\nFormer world heavyweight champion David Haye: I consider Bellew a friend. Someone who fairly beat me. It'll be better for my ego to say I got beat by a guy who beat Usyk. He can do it. If he doesn't it's a points loss. Usyk on points, or Bellew by stoppage.\n\nBritish heavyweight Dereck Chisora: It is just written in the stars. Tony wants this badly. He will be losing this fight but when he hits this guy he will stay hit. He will knock him out, 100%. Then Tony becomes the number one fighter in the United Kingdom.\n\nFormer British middleweight champion Matt Macklin: If Bellew wins this it is without doubt the best win of his career.\n\nFormer two-weight world champion Paulie Malignaggi: People have counted Tony out before, made him the underdog. Appreciate Usyk but appreciate the desire and determination Bellew has shown us over the years. He always gives people their money's worth and comes to fight.\n\nSend us your predictions to #bbcboxing.\n\nFinal thoughts - 'What if?'\n\nUsyk (left) has aspirations of moving up to heavyweight to face Anthony Joshua after facing Bellew\n\nBBC 5 live commentator Costello:\n\nBellew is a bookmakers' underdog just as he was against David Haye twice, Nathan Cleverly twice and Adonis Stevenson.\n\nIn Usyk, we are talking here about one of the best. He claimed the World Boxing Super Series but in the semi-final, he did see a few problems against Mairis Briedis, who varied the line of attack, going to the body and head in the same attack.\n\nIt did get through. And one judge gave it a draw while the others two went 7-5 Usyk, so there is a way to get to him.\n\nBBC 5 live analyst Bunce:\n\nIn the Super Series, Usyk was owning every second of every single fight.

You can also buy them at your neighbourhood chemists.\n\nSome are simple cloth masks while others come with high-grade filters to keep toxins out. They're available in black or can be multi-coloured.\n\nAnd thousands of people in the capital, which is among the worst affected by pollution, are wearing them.\n\nBut can a face mask protect you from the deadly tiny particulate matter that enter deep into the lungs and play havoc with your health?\n\nA mask with a capacity to filter out these tiny microns can help but, Dr Madan says, they will have to be worn all the time and be completely sealed around the nose and the mouth.\n\n\"But these high filtration capacity masks can make breathing difficult, especially during exercise. And how are you going to make children wear it when they go out to play?\n\n\"These are solutions that are very difficult to use,\" he adds.\n\nGooseberries and turmeric\n\nLast week, as Delhi's air quality began worsening, schools in Delhi started taking precautionary measures - morning assemblies were suspended, outdoor games were restricted, and one school began distributing gooseberries to students.\n\nThat's because traditional Indian wisdom says the sour green fruits are loaded with anti-oxidants and can help boost immunity and reduce the impact of pollution.\n\nNutritionists have also suggested drinking a concoction made with turmeric, ginger and Indian basil, or eating jaggery or clarified butter.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Doctors say the number of patients with respiratory problems has risen in the past week\n\nDr Madan says he's not sure to what extent these claims are backed by scientific data and that there is no evidence to suggest they work.\n\nHe says any food that contains vitamins and anti-oxidants is good for overall health, but it doesn't prevent exposure to pollution.\n\nIn the past week, Dr Madan says, the number of patients he's seen with \"asthma-like symptoms\" has risen, with many complaining about a \"burning-itching sensation in the nose and throat\".\n\nDescribing it as a \"serious health emergency\", he says children, the elderly and the asthmatic are more vulnerable to bad air and he's advising them to \"avoid outdoor activities and heavy exertion\".\n\nThe adverse impact of pollution is already established on the lung and heart, but newer research points to its impact on our cognitive abilities too - a recent study found pollution also causes a reduction in intelligence.\n\nAloe vera, Mother-in-Law's Tongue...\n\nIt's well known that trees help absorb pollution, but newspapers and websites in India are increasingly talking about indoor plants that can suck out toxins from inside homes.\n\nThe list of top air purifying plants includes, among others, aloe vera, the spider plant, a type of lily and the snake plant (also known as Mother-in-Law's Tongue).\n\nDr Madan says the claim that they have an impact on the air quality needs to be backed by evidence.\n\n\"Someone please do a study on pollution within homes with and without these plants. We need very good quality data to see if this intervention can be effective.\"\n\nBut Dr Madan is clear the situation is so bad there's really only one course of action - and that is to tackle the pollution itself.\n\n\"There are no shortcuts.

They want the UK to sign up to what's known in trade-speak as a level playing field. This affects common restrictions on state aid, for example, as well as certain labour regulations and environmental laws. There is also talk of the EU trying to get agreement on maintaining fishing rights in UK waters as part of the accord. UK critics of the customs partnership - such as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab - say the UK would need a unilateral get-out mechanism to ensure it wouldn't forever stay tied to the EU customs regime, which, you will remember, renders the UK unable to make any independent trade deals at all.\n\nThe EU argues, however, that it wouldn't be a proper guarantee to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland if the UK could abandon said guarantee - i.e. the UK customs fallback plan - whenever it felt like it.\n\nBut the UK then argues that if the EU co-polices the Irish backstop then Brussels would have the power to potentially keep the UK tied to its customs regime for the foreseeable future. Which doesn't much look like the return to national sovereignty which those who voted Leave in the EU referendum were promised.\n\n2.5 There are disagreements in UK government circles as to whether the Irish border guarantee should constitute two different customs plans with the EU - one for Northern Ireland, which already has devolved powers, and one for the rest of the UK that would be easier to uncouple.\n\nTo sum up: the deal is not yet done.\n\nBut if and when it is - with chat about a UK parliamentary vote as late as 21 December -

as it seemed to a generation in unprecedented rebellion against its fathers - by guilty old men\".\n\nHowever, Gervase Phillips, Manchester Metropolitan University's principal lecturer in history, said the reaction at the time was quite different.\n\n\"Authors often point to the peculiar poignancy that when the Owens received the telegram informing them of Wilfred's death, all the church bells were sounding to mark the Armistice.\n\n\"Yet to those who had lived through the conflict, and experienced so much loss, I am not sure these deaths were felt any more keenly.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Wilfred Owen was killed after returning to the front following treatment for shell shock\n\nHindsight also attributes huge significance to Owen's death, but it must be remembered that, at the time, he was not well-known and so the tragedy was felt only by his family and friends - and they were far from alone in experiencing such grief.\n\nCapt Robert Bartholomew, who was the editor of the wartime Canadian Hospital News, read about the death of his only son in a newspaper three months before the end of the war.\n\nAn account of what happened next stated that the news caused him to have a nervous breakdown and drop into a \"severe depression\" due to the \"mental shock\".\n\nHe had previously written that the parents of those killed would feel \"sorrow and pain\", but would also \"be able to look back with a feeling of pride and say: 'They died for God, for King and Country'\".\n\nAnd despite his severe reaction to the loss of his son, that sentiment did not seem to change, as a few weeks after hearing the news, an editorial in the publication declared with pride that \"sons have died by thousands and will continue to die by thousands if necessary, until victory is assured\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Armistice came into effect at 11:00 on 11 November 1918\n\nMr Phillips said while a modern reader might judge such a stance as bravado, and more widely see those deaths in the final months of the war as futile, it was important to remember there was no \"unconditional surrender\" at the end of the war and an Allied victory was far from assured until its very last moments.\n\nHe said the Armistice \"was not certain until about 05:00 on the morning of the 11th\", though talk of it had been \"widespread throughout the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) since at least 9 November\".\n\n\"Think of the ending of the war as a process, rather than a distinct moment,\" the academic said.\n\n\"Bulgaria agreed an armistice with the Allies on 30 September, the Ottoman Empire agreed one on 30 October and the Habsburgs (the rulers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on 3 November.\n\n\"The 'direction of travel' was clear, [but] the Germans still hoped to negotiate the best possible terms for a ceasefire right up until the end.\n\n\"So the BEF's victory at the [second] Battle of the Sambre on 4 November, where Owen was killed, the American advance to the heights overlooking Sedan and the French capture of the strategic railhead at Hirson by 9 November, were all instrumental in persuading the German delegation to agree to the Armistice.\"\n\nConfirming the actual number of Allied deaths in the run-up to the Armistice is problematic.\n\nStatistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire, a book published in 1922, listed 6,064 deaths between 1 and 11 November 1918, with a further 2,008 men listed as missing, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's (CWGC) database now records 15,002 graves with death dates in those 11 days.\n\nMr Phillips said \"recordkeeping at the front was, inevitably, suspect [as] it wasn't a great environment for bureaucracy, and trying to establish the record retrospectively, on the basis of documentation that may be incomplete or inaccurate, is no easy task\".\n\nHe said thousands of soldiers \"effectively disappeared\" towards the end of the war and \"very often no-one knew exactly what had befallen them or precisely when\".\n\n\"Some subsequently turned up - in a hospital or perhaps in a POW camp - but many were simply recorded as 'missing, presumed killed' - and they still are.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pte David McKie, 19, died on the last day of World War One\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Funerals for the fallen were held along the Western Front during the war\n\nAmong those who died in those last days were three soldiers who were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nSgt Hugh Cairns was killed after capturing a machine-gun at Valenciennes on 2 November, while two days later, 2nd Lt James Kirk and Acting Lt Col James Marshall died in the same action as Owen.\n\nLt Kirk was killed while supporting troops crossing the Oise canal, and Col Marshall died leading his men across a bridge on the waterway.\n\nBut far from being seen as needless, their deaths were recorded in the press with the same pride as any of the hundreds that had come before and were welcomed in the same way as the others by the general public, Mr Phillips said.\n\nSuch a reaction was understandable, given that the end of the war came as something of a surprise to most of both those who were fighting and their families.\n\nMr Philips said the most surprising thing was \"how suddenly the war stopped on the dot\".\n\nAn account by Gen Sir Archibald Montgomery recorded that \"the firing, which had been heavy all the morning, continued until three minutes to 11:00 when it ceased for a short period and then broke out in a final crash\".\n\nHe also recorded the \"final act\" of a German machine-gunner, who, at two minutes to 11:00, had \"fired off a complete belt without pause\", before standing, taking off his his helmet, bowing and walking \"slowly to the rear\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The news of the Armistice was greeted with relief and delight by troops\n\nHowever, Mr Phillips said the war had been a \"brutalising business\" and there were also \"some instances\" where there was \"a desire not to stop fighting\".\n\nAn account of the BEF's 8th Division's actions includes details of a company coming across an occupied German post at precisely 11:00.\n\n\"The men were persuaded with difficulty to refrain from attacking it,\" the account records, adding that it was \"their earnest contention being that no-one needs know anything about it and that it seemed a pity not to kill a few more Germans while they had the chance\".\n\nIt also must be remembered that the war continued to claim lives after the Armistice.\n\nNews of the ceasefire took time to filter to all the areas involved, and fighting continued for some time after 11:00 in places such as Russia and Mesopotamia (an area that covers parts of modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey).\n\nA large number of soldiers also succumbed to wounds or illness in the days and weeks following the end of the war.\n\nThe CWGC database lists 10,991 graves with death dates between 12 and 30 November 1918 and a further 47,510 listed between 1 December 1918 and 10 January 1920, the day the Treaty of Versailles, the formal document that officially ended the war, came into effect.\n\nAnd so the Armistice might have silenced the guns, but it did not entirely stop the fatalities.", "Video\n\nThey're a favourite cuddly toy of children the world over, but how did the teddy bear come into being?

The fertility rate all but halved to 2.4 children per woman by last year.\n\nBut that masks huge variation between nations.\n\nThe fertility rate in Niger, west Africa, is 7.1, but in the Mediterranean island of Cyprus women are having one child, on average.\n\nIn the UK, the rate is 1.7, similar to most Western European countries.\n\nHow high does the fertility rate have to be?\n\nThe total fertility rate is the average number of children a woman gives birth to in their lifetime (it's different to the birth rate which is the number of children born per thousand people each year).\n\nWhenever a country's rate drops below approximately 2.1 then populations will eventually start to shrink (this \"baby bust\" figure is significantly higher in countries which have high rates of death in childhood).\n\nAt the start of the study, in 1950, there were zero nations in this position.\n\nProf Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told the BBC: \"We've reached this watershed where half of countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, so if nothing happens the populations will decline in those countries.\n\n\"It's a remarkable transition.\n\n\"It's a surprise even to people like myself, the idea that it's half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.\"\n\nWhich countries are affected?\n\nMore economically developed countries including most of Europe, the US, South Korea and Australia have lower fertility rates.\n\nIt does not mean the number of people living in these countries is falling, at least not yet as the size of a population is a mix of the fertility rate, death rate and migration.\n\nIt can also take a generation for changes in fertility rate to take hold.\n\nBut Prof Murray said: \"We will soon be transitioning to a point where societies are grappling with a declining population.\"\n\nHalf the world's nations are still producing enough children to grow, but as more countries advance economically, more will have lower fertility rates.\n\n'We'd rather give our daughter the best of everything'\n\nRachael Jacobs, 38, of Kent, had her first and only child seven years ago\n\nI'd always focused on my career. When I was pregnant I was still focusing on my career.\n\nI know now that we can survive on what we earn as a family and still go on holiday every year. If we had more than one child we couldn't go on holiday.\n\nWe'd rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe.\n\nMy partner and I are also thinking about the future. We want to be in a position where we can help her financially with university or housing. I don't want to ever have to say that she can't go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.\n\nWhy is the fertility rate falling?\n\nThe fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility.\n\nInstead it is being put down to three key factors:\n\nFewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies\n\nGreater access to contraception\n\nMore women in education and work\n\nIn many ways, falling fertility rates are a success story.\n\nWhat will the impact be?\n\nWithout migration, countries will face ageing and shrinking populations.\n\nDr George Leeson, director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing, says that does not have to be a bad thing, as long as the whole of society adjusts to the massive demographic change.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"Demography impacts on every single aspect of our lives, just look out of your window at the people on the streets, the houses, the traffic, the consumption, it is all driven by demography.\n\n\"Everything we plan for is not just driven by the numbers in the population, but also the age structure and that is changing, so fundamentally we haven't got our heads around it.\"\n\nHe thinks workplaces are going to have to change and even the idea of retiring at 68, the current maximum in the UK, will be unsustainable.\n\nThe report, part of the Global Burden of Diseases analysis, says affected countries will need to consider increasing immigration, which can create its own problems, or introducing policies to encourage women to have more children, which often fail.\n\nReport author Prof Murray argues: \"On current trends there will be very few children and lots of people over the age of 65 and that's very difficult to sustain global society.\n\n\"Think of all the profound social and economic consequences of a society structured like that with more grandparents than grandchildren.\n\n\"I think Japan is very aware of this, they're facing declining populations, but I don't think it's hit many countries in the West, because low fertility has been compensated with migration.\n\n\"At a global level there is no migration solution,\" Prof Murray says.\n\nBut while the change may challenge societies, it may also have environmental benefits given the impact of our species.\n\nWhat about China?\n\nChina has seen huge population growth since 1950, going from around half a billion inhabitants to 1.4 billion.\n\nBut it too is facing the challenge of fertility rates, which stood at only 1.5 in 2017, and has recently moved away from its famous one child policy.\n\nThe reason developed countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 is because not all children survive to adulthood and babies are ever so slightly more likely to be male than female.\n\nBut in China, the report shows for every 100 girls born there were 117 boys which \"imply very substantial sex-selective abortion and even the possibility of female infanticide\".\n\nThat means even more children need to be born to have a stable population.\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "Image copyright Luke McSweeney Image caption Rachael Miller believes the Cora Ball could hugely reduce microfibre pollution\n\nConcern is mounting over the volume of plastics in our oceans and, in particular, how tiny particles of plastic and other synthetic materials are infiltrating every part of our ecosystem. Can technology help address the problem?\n\nIn October 2009, windsurfing teacher Rachael Miller went to help clean up an island off the coast of Maine in the north-east of the US.\n\nThere had been a heavy storm and \"we found the beach covered in debris\", she says, mostly washed up plastic fishing gear.\n\nHer husband was incensed. \"Marine debris is one of the few things that really make me angry,\" he said.\n\nSo Ms Miller, who had studied marine archaeology, decided to devote herself to keeping plastics from ever reaching the ocean.\n\nIn April, she began selling a special gadget for capturing those tiny bits of synthetic material - called microfibres - that come off our clothes in the wash.\n\nFour inches (10cm) in diameter and made from recycled and recyclable plastic, the Cora Ball imitates the structure of coral in the ocean. While it doesn't catch everything, the company says it captures between a quarter and a third of microfibres in every wash.\n\nImage copyright David A. Seaver Image caption Cora Ball founder Rachael Miller works to prevent microplastics entering the oceans\n\nCustomers on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter pre-ordered 15,500 of these in 2017.\n\nCora Ball is one of several small start-ups working to keep microplastics and other microfibres out of the water system.\n\nThe shocking truth is that we could be ingesting 11,000 pieces of plastic a year just through eating shellfish, says Ghent University's Lisbeth Van Cauwenberghe.\n\nIt's a pollution we all contribute to when we wash our clothes.\n\nUp to 700,000 microfibres can shed from a typical 6kg (13lb) household load, says Imogen Napper, a postdoctoral marine science researcher at the University of Plymouth in the UK.\n\nAnd a sizable minority can make it into the ocean. So laundry is turning oceans into \"a big plastic soup\", says Ms Napper.\n\nHow can I stop my washing putting plastic into the sea?\n\nImage copyright IMOGEN NAPPER Image caption Marine scientist Imogen Napper says laundry is a big contributor to microfibres in the oceans\n\nMany of these fibres, which can be as small as three microns, a thirteenth the width of a human hair - are too small for water treatment plants to remove.\n\nDespite being so small, organic pollutants in the oceans, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), can stick to them, creating a nasty amalgam.\n\nThere can be as many as 100,000 microplastics in a cubic metre of ocean, researchers say, which are then eaten by marine creatures.\n\nMore than two thirds of fish species in California markets have microfibres in them, says Chelsea Rochman, an aquatic ecology professor at the University of Toronto.\n\nTwo other people working to keep microfibres out of the water are Alexander Nolte and his friend Oliver Spies, both enthusiastic surfers from Berlin.\n\nThey invented a laundry bag called Guppyfriend after coming up with the idea while brainstorming at a beer garden, says Mr Nolte.\n\nImage copyright Guppyfriend Image caption The Guppyfriend bag collects microfibres shed from synthetic clothes in the wash\n\nThe bag cushions clothes to release fewer plastic fibres, and catches those that form, he says.\n\n\"If you wash synthetic textiles, there are 86% fewer fibres that break, and those that do break are in the bag,\" Mr Nolte explains.\n\nLike Cora Ball, they started with a Kickstarter campaign, which closed in December.\n\nAt first they thought the bag was a \"quite amusing idea, and we can bring it to market very quickly,\" says Mr Nolte, \"and we were fundamentally wrong.\"\n\nThe biggest challenge, he says, was to get openings in the bag the right size to let in enough water, without letting microfibres escape.\n\n\"It is pretty easy to make a bag, but to do it in a way that gets the filament right to reduce fibre shedding is pretty high tech,\" Mr Nolte observes.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nIn Denmark, 60% of all sewage sludge is \"getting used in agriculture,\" says Lars Monster from the KD Group, a wastewater tech company in the southern Danish town of Vejle.\n\nThese solid remnants from waste water treatment are distributed on farmland as fertiliser. But plastics in the sludge then enter the food chain.\n\nOne problem is that most wastewater treatment plants don't aim to remove microfibres, largely because regulations don't require them to.\n\nSo Mr Monster's company has developed a new filtration technology that can remove 90% of microplastics, he says. He's hoping to get the figure up to 96%.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to recycle all the removed plastics, says Mr Monster, and \"get to the point where microplastics are a resource\".\n\nFour science and bioengineering students at London's Imperial College won a prize in October for coming up with an inexpensive way to remove microplastics from wastewater.\n\nImage copyright Imperial College London Image caption Students Jedidiah Cheung and Dario Mongiardi are working on filtering out microplastics\n\nIntroducing an additional compound to the filtration stage of treatment could remove upwards of 99% of microplastics cheaply without retrofitting a treatment centre, says Dario Mongiardi, one of the students.\n\nCora Ball's Ms Miller - who also runs a clean-water non-profit, the Rozalia Project - says these laundry and wastewater treatment technologies are complementary.\n\nIf just 10% of US households used Cora Ball it would keep the equivalent of 30 million water bottles from washing into public waterways a year, claims Rachael Miller.\n\n\"If you eat or drink or wear clothes or use objects,\" she says, \"this affects you.\"", "Video\n\nCan people in today's Germany mourn their dead without whitewashing their country's past?\n\nWe ask three Germans, ahead of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War One.", "Image caption The loss of bank branches is one issue affecting vulnerable customers\n\nA committee of MPs is to examine whether vulnerable consumers are being treated fairly by banks and service providers.\n\nAmong other things the Treasury Committee will look at what banks are doing to stop financial exclusion.\n\nIt will also examine whether some vulnerable people are being overcharged for travel insurance.\n\nCitizens Advice has claimed that people are losing as much as \u00a3877 a year each, because they are loyal customers.\n\nAs a result, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) are already looking at whether some people are being over-charged for financial products.\n\n\"With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing, and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it's becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services,\" said Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee.\n\nThe enquiry will also consider:\n\nhow financial firms define \"vulnerability\"\n\nwhether firms should have to have a legal duty of care to their customers\n\nwhich customers suffer most when a bank branch closes\n\nhow Post Offices are filling the gap after a bank branch closure\n\nTom Selby, a senior analyst with the investment platform AJ Bell, said there was no easy answer to improve the situation.\n\n\"Although there are some customers who may more obviously be vulnerable, such as those diagnosed with Alzheimer's, anyone can potentially become vulnerable at any time.\n\n\"Furthermore, it is not always obvious when someone is vulnerable.
