He was one of four ministers to quit.\n\nMrs May later defended the deal in the House of Commons, telling MPs it delivered on the Brexit referendum and provided for an orderly withdrawal.\n\nWhat has the EU said and what happens next?\n\nMr Barnier was speaking on Thursday morning alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk as the chief negotiator formally handed over the 585-page draft withdrawal agreement.\n\nMr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an \"ambitious new partnership\".\n\nMr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had \"secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole\".\n\nHe laid out the timetable for the days ahead.\n\nEU member states will analyse the document and at the end of the week national envoys will share their assessments\n\nA political declaration on future ties between the EU and the UK will be agreed by Tuesday and members will have 48 hours to evaluate it\n\nThe EU Council will then meet on 25 November to finalise the agreement \"if nothing extraordinary happens\", Mr Tusk said. The leaders of the 27 EU nations must approve the deal\n\nMr Tusk said: \"Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.\"\n\nAddressing the UK, he added: \"As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us.\"\n\nMr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019.\n\nIf the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.\n\nA smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict.\n\nThe document from the EU side\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called \"divorce\" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a \"financial settlement\" from the UK, thought to be about \u00a339bn (\u20ac45bn; $50bn).\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish \"hard border\" issue.\n\nHe said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called \"backstop\" measure would be used.\n\nBoth sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\n\"If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy.\"\n\nThe draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent.\n\nMr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, \"by a limited period and by joint agreement\".\n\nDuring the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules.\n\nThere are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there \"to continue to live as they do today\", Mr Barnier added.\n\nSpain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights.\n\nThe UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there.\n\nSkilled swerve\n\nAnalysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler\n\nThe EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time.\n\nI put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.\n\nBrussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a \"better\" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.\n\nHow have other European leaders reacted?\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday welcomed the draft agreement, saying: \"I am very happy that, after lengthy and not always easy negotiations, a proposal could be reached.\"\n\nThe European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of \"intense negotiations\" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that \"there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'\".\n\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was \"good news for the French economy\" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules.\n\nFinland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, \"decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement\".\n\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was \"very pleased\", adding: \"The result is a good one.\"", "Marin Cilic hit six aces in his victory, compared to 17 for John Isner\n\nMarin Cilic fought back to keep alive his hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the ATP Finals for the first time with victory over John Isner.\n\nThe Croat, who has won just two of 11 matches in four appearances at the event, triumphed 6-7 (2-7) 6-3 6-4.\n\nThe result puts Novak Djokovic into the semi-finals, leaving Cilic, Isner and Alexander Zverev to fight it out for the group's other spot on Friday.\n\nIt was the first singles match of this year's event to go to a deciding set.\n\nCilic holds his nerve\n\nCilic has something of a reputation as a bottler - the most recent example coming last week in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters where he lost to Djokovic despite having won the first set.\n\nAnd there was a moment here when it looked like he might not hold his nerve.\n\nHaving secured rare back-to-back breaks against the tour's leading server to win the second set and take an early advantage in the third, he then inexplicably dropped serve to give Isner hope.\n\nBut he then showed his determination - via some first-class returning and a wonderful drop volley - to secure a third successive break.\n\nWith Isner holding on to force him to serve for the match, Cilic showed no sign of wobbling as he brought up three match points and took victory when the American returned a looping second serve wide.\n\n\"It was very difficult.

I felt that I had that momentum towards the end of the second set.

But because the depression is covered by up to 980m of ice, the scientists have so far had to rely on indirect studies.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark Image caption A map of the bedrock topography beneath the ice sheet\n\nWhat is the supporting evidence?\n\nMeltwaters running out from under Hiawatha Glacier into the Nares Strait carry sediments from the depression. In these sediments are quartz grains which have been subjected to enormous shock pressures, of the type that would be experienced in an impact.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption Quartz grains show evidence of having experienced shock pressures\n\nOther river sediments have revealed unusual ratios in the concentrations of different metals.\n\n\"The profile we saw was an enrichment of rhodium, a depletion of platinum, and an enrichment of palladium,\" explained team-member Dr Iain McDonald, from Cardiff University, UK.\n\n\"We got very excited about this because we realised we weren't looking at a stony meteorite, but an iron meteorite - and not just any old iron meteorite; it had to be quite an unusual composition.\"\n\nSuch metal objects that fall to Earth are thought to be the smashed up innards of bodies that almost became planets at the start of the Solar System.\n\nThe signatures identified by Dr McDonald are relatively close to those in iron meteorite fragments collected at Cape York not far from the Hiawatha site. It's not inconceivable, the team argues, that the Cape York material represents pieces that came away from the main asteroid object as it moved towards its collision with Earth.\n\nImage copyright NASA/John Sonntag Image caption The Hiawatha Glacier cuts across the rim of the crater\n\nWhat are the doubts?\n\nOne concerns the absence of any trace of the impact in several cores that have been drilled through the ice sheet to the south. At the very least, these might have been expected to incorporate the dust that fell out of the sky after the event.\n\nThe other head-scratcher is the absence in the vicinity of the Hiawatha site of any rocky material that would have been ejected outwards from the crater on impact.\n\nProf Kj\u00e6r says these missing signatures might be explained by a very shallow angle of impact that took most of the ejecta to the north. And if the fall-out area was covered in ice, it's possible any debris was later transported away.\n\n\"We know that at one time the Greenland Ice Sheet was joined to the Canadian Ice Sheet, and flowed out into the Nares Strait.

But the only way to get a definitive age for the crater would be to drill down and collect rocks for laboratory dating.\n\nImage copyright Natural History Museum of Denmark/NASA Image caption An artist's depiction of an iron asteroid hurtling through space\n\nHow does this connect with other ideas?\n\nIf the impact was right at near-end of the age window then it will surely re-ignite interest in the so-called Younger Dryas impact hypothesis.\n\nThe Younger Dryas was a period of strong cooling in the middle of the climatic warming that occurred as the Earth emerged from the height of last ice age.\n\nSome have argued that an asteroid impact could have been responsible for this cooling blip - and the accompanying extinction of many animal groups that occurred at the same time across North America.\n\nOthers, though, have been critical of the hypothesis, not least because no crater could be associated with such an event. The Hiawatha depression is likely now to fan the dying embers of this old debate.\n\nDr Mathieu Morlighem, a team-member from the University of California, Irvine, US, commented: \"When you think about it, the bed below the ice sheets has to have impact craters that have not been explored yet, and there may even be some in Antarctica as well, but more radar measurements are necessary to locate them, and dating them is extremely challenging.\"\n\nImage copyright BEDMACHINE Image caption A map of the bedrock of Greenland.

In one year, you only see one part of the cycle, and you have to cover it over many years to be sure that it's repeating,\" Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9 told me.\n\nThe team re-examined archived data obtained from two astronomical surveys over a 20-year period. They also added new observations with the Carmenes spectrometer in Almeria, Spain, the Eso/Harps instrument in Chile and the Harps-N instrument in the Canary Islands.\n\nIt's the first time the radial velocity technique has been used to detect a planet this small so far away from its host star.\n\nImage copyright NAture Image caption The planet lies at about the same distance as Mercury orbits the Sun\n\n\"We couldn't get a single experiment that would detect it unambiguously, so we had to combine all the data very carefully,\" said the Queen Mary University of London astronomer.\n\n\"We found a lot of systematic errors from several of the instruments that were producing \"ghost signals\". It was not only about getting new data but also about understanding the systematic effects. Only when we had done that did the signal become very clear and obvious.\"\n\nWhen the next generation of telescopes come online, scientists will be able to characterise the planet's properties. This will likely include a search for gases like oxygen and methane in the planet's atmosphere, which might be markers for biology.\n\n\"The James Webb Space Telescope might not help in this case, because it was not designed for what's called high contrast imaging. But in the US, they are also developing WFirst - a small telescope that's also used for cosmology,\" said Dr Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\n\"If you take the specs of how it should perform, it should easily image this planet. When we have the image we can then start to do spectroscopy - looking at different wavelengths, in the optical, in the infrared, looking at whether light is absorbed at different colours, meaning there are different things in the atmosphere.\"\n\nImage copyright NASA Image caption Artwork: The next generation telescope WFirst, should have the capability to produce a direct image of the new planet\n\nThis is not the first time there have been claims of a planet around Barnard's Star. In the 1960s, the Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp, working in the US, published his evidence for a planetary companion, based on perturbations in the motion of the star.\n\nHowever, van de Kamp's claims proved controversial, as other scientists were not able to reproduce his finding.\n\n\"The new planet is impossible for Peter van de Kamp to have detected. The signal would have been too small for the technique he was using,\" said Guillem Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the new data contain tentative hints of a second planet orbiting Barnard's Star even further out than the Super-Earth.\n\n\"The new data does show evidence for a long period object. That object... has a very low probability of being the van de Kamp planet. But it's a long shot,\" said Anglada Escud\u00e9.\n\nIn a separate article published in Nature, Rodrigo Diaz, from the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who was not involved with the study, said the discovery \"gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail\".\n\nHe added: \"Difficult detections such as this one warrant confirmation by independent methods and research groups... a signal for the planet might be detectable in astrometric data - precision measurements of stellar positions - from the Gaia space observatory that are expected to be released in the 2020s.\"\n\nThe star is named after the American astronomer E E Barnard, who measured properties of its motion in 1916.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jim Acosta lost his White House access after a fiery exchange with President Trump\n\nThe White House has filed a memo opposing CNN's suit against the Trump administration, saying no journalist has a constitutional right to access.\n\nIt states the president and his staff have \"absolute discretion\" over journalist access and interviews.\n\nTheir memo comes on the same day numerous other media organisations - including Fox News - announced their support for the broadcaster.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta lost his access after a fiery exchange with President Trump.\n\nA White House intern tried to take the microphone from Mr Acosta as he tried to ask the president another question.\n\nHis pass was revoked shortly afterwards, with press secretary Sarah Sanders claiming it was because the correspondent \"put his hands on\" the intern.\n\nCNN filed suit against the president and several of his aides.

Media outlets jealously guard their prerogatives - and White House access is the lifeblood of their business.\n\nCNN and others came to Fox News's defence in 2009, when the Obama administration froze the cable network out of interviews with key officials.\n\nThey also supported Fox when one of its reporters, James Rosen, was named as a criminal co-conspirator in a 2013 Obama justice department leak investigation.\n\nIt appears that CNN may also have legal precedent on its side. In a case dating back to the Lyndon Johnson administration in the 1960s, a federal court ruled that a reporter for the left-wing Nation magazine could not be denied a press credential for \"arbitrary or content-based criteria\".\n\nForty years later, a court will be considering constitutionally protected press freedoms.

copyright EPA Image caption Mr Mundell arrived in Downing Street for a cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon\n\nScottish Secretary David Mundell has backed the draft Brexit deal despite concerns about its impact on the fishing industry.\n\nEmerging from a five-hour cabinet meeting, he said the alternative of a no-deal would be \"appalling\" for Scotland.\n\nHe said he was clear the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in 2020.\n\nEarlier he was among 13 Scottish Tory MPs who wrote to the prime minister seeking assurances on fishing.\n\nAfter a much longer than expected meeting, Theresa May's cabinet collectively backed the withdrawal agreement, and the 585-page document has now been published along with a shorter document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU.\n\nBut Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara have since resigned in protest.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon described it as \"bad deal\" for Scotland and predicted the prime minister would struggle to get it passed in the House of Commons.\n\nMr Mundell told the BBC on Wednesday evening there had been a \"full and frank\" discussion at cabinet and they had agreed to move to the \"next stage\".\n\nHe said there would be a special EU council meeting, hopefully later this month, and the cabinet would then decide if to recommend the deal to parliament.\n\nAsked about rumours of a leadership challenge to Mrs May, he urged fellow Conservatives to back the prime minister.\n\nHe said: \"We need to support her going forward with the agreement, that's potentially been reached because the alternative to reaching this agreement is no deal, and no deal is an absolutely appalling outcome, not just for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scotland's fishermen largely backed Brexit ahead of the referendum\n\nThe earlier letter to Theresa May from Scottish Conservative MPs came amid speculation that the UK's departure from the Common Fisheries Polices (CFP) could be delayed or watered down.\n\nThe CFP is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.\n\nThe letter reminded the prime minister she had promised this would happen and that anything less than this would be a \"betrayal of Scotland\".\n\nIt went on to say: \"This has raised expectations in the fishing industry that Brexit will lead to complete control and full sovereignty over domestic waters that we must deliver on.\n\n\"In order to deliver on these expectations, we could not support an agreement with the EU that would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares.\n\n\"That would mean that we would not be leaving the CFP in practice, and would become an independent coastal state in name only\".\n\nEU fishing vessels\n\nFollowing publication of the draft agreement the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) said it was seeking assurances that EU vessels will not be guaranteed continued access to UK waters in return for favourable trade terms.\n\nOn Wednesday evening the EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: \"An essential condition for the single customs territory to cover fisheries... will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities.\"\n\nThe declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU makes clear that a new fisheries agreement will need to be negotiated.\n\nSFF president Bertie Armstrong said: \"Any linkage between access and trade contravenes all international norms and practice and is simply unacceptable in principle.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland 'concerns'\n\nMr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is on maternity leave, have previously written to Mrs May warning they would not support any deal that gave Northern Ireland a different arrangement to the rest of the UK on the single market and customs union.\n\nThey fear that making a special case for Northern Ireland while rejecting calls to do the same for Scotland would be a political gift to the SNP, and could fuel the case for independence.\n\nAsked about Northern Ireland, Mr Mundell said they continued to have concerns.\n\nHe said: \"We want to ensure that Northern Ireland remains fully part of our United Kingdom.\n\n\"We've always been very clear about that and we want to be satisfied that those arrangements in place for Northern Ireland that also respect the Good Friday Agreement and existing all-Ireland arrangements don't do anything to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.\"", "Image copyright Spindrift Image caption William Robertson claimed the baby sustained her

Doctors diagnosed cyanide poisoning.\n\nHis poisoning has led investigators to re-examine the forensic tests carried out on his father's body.\n\nThe possibility that Jorge Enrique Pizano's death may not have been due to natural causes has caused a stir in Colombia with many speculating about who could have wanted to silence the engineer.\n\nWhistleblower\n\nMr Pizano worked as an auditor for the Ruta del Sol (Sun Route), one of Colombia's biggest infrastructure projects aimed at constructing roads to link up the centre of the country with the Caribbean coast.\n\nThe contract to build much of the 1,000km (620 miles) stretch of motorway was awarded to Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht and its local partners.\n\nBut Odebrecht's concession was cancelled in February 2017 after evidence emerged suggesting the company had paid bribes to be awarded the contract.\n\nOdebrecht is at the centre of a massive corruption scandal spanning Latin America and, as part of a plea deal with the US justice department, it has admitted paying bribes in 12 countries, including Colombia.\n\nProsecutors in Colombia estimate the firm paid $27m (\u00a320.9m) to land the contract for the Ruta del Sol project.\n\nMr Pizano was hired as an auditor in 2010 and in 2013 began denouncing what he said were suspicious payments made by Odebrecht and Grupo Aval, Colombia's largest banking group which was also involved in the Ruta del Sol project.\n\nPosthumous interview\n\nIn August, Mr Pizano handed Colombian news programme Noticias Uno a secret audio recording he said he had made in 2015 of himself flagging up the payments to N\u00e9stor Humberto Mart\u00ednez. Mr Mart\u00ednez was Grupo Aval's legal adviser at the time and is now Colombia's attorney-general.\n\nNoticias Uno says Mr Pizano feared there were people plotting against him and handed their reporter the recording and other documents for safekeeping either until he was safe in another country or for publication in the case of his death.\n\nNoticias Uno broadcast the audio on Sunday night and it has triggered calls for Mr Mart\u00ednez to resign.\n\nMr Mart\u00ednez said in a statement that Mr Pizano had told him about irregular payments at the time but that it was not clear that those payments were bribes. Mr Mart\u00ednez also said that he had passed on Mr Pizano's concerns to company officials at the time.\n\nGrupo Aval has released a statement saying it had \"immediately ordered an internal audit into Dr Pizano's suspicions\" at the time and that it had not been aware of any bribes being paid before 21 December 2016, when Odebrecht admitted to the payments as part of the plea agreement.", "Media playback is not supported on this device Watch: Djokovic beats Zverev in straight sets\n\nATP Finals Venue: O2 Arena, London Dates: 11-18 November Coverage: Follow live coverage across BBC TV, radio, the BBC Sport website & mobile app. Live text commentary available on selected matches.\n\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic became the first man to reach the semi-finals of the ATP Finals after a clinical win over Alexander Zverev and a favourable result in the group's other match.\n\nAfter a very physical and close first set, the 31-year-old Serb ran away with the second to beat the German 6-4 6-1.\n\nDjokovic, chasing a first ATP Finals title since 2015, reached the last four when Marin Cilic beat John Isner later.\n\n\"I don't think it was breathtaking tennis but a win is a win,\" he said.\n\n\"I played well midway through the second set and started to swing through the ball.\n\n\"I had not served that well but he made a lot of unforced errors which helped me to win.\"\n\nIndeed, it was a double-fault from Zverev that handed Djokovic the first set and a total of 33 unforced errors that contributed to the 21-year-old's downfall.\n\nZverev himself later later seemed to imply that fatigue had perhaps also played a part, saying the length of the tennis season was \"ridiculous\".\n\nDjokovic plays Cilic in his final round-robin match on Friday, while Zverev takes on Isner.\n\nAre you Mr Bendy, Novak?\n\nIt took until the ninth game of the first set for either player to fashion a break point, Zverev missing two in that game.\n\nHaving survived that pressure, Djokovic left it until the perfect time to break in the following game - taking the set when the German double-faulted.\n\nIt was an unfortunate way for Zverev to fall behind, having been impressive with his serves until that point, delivering seven aces and in one game firing down three successive serves at more than 140mph.\n\nTipped by many as a future Grand Slam-winner, Zverev showed some of his talent with some beautiful passing shots but he was up against a player who can contort his body to reach almost anything.\n\nDjokovic met one of Zverev's body serves with an unconventional placement of his racquet that looked more about shielding his face - but of course the return went in - and later Zverev needed two attempts at a smash to put the ball away, when against any other player the first one would have done.\n\n\"That's a first - 'Mr Bendy',\" the Serb laughed in his on-court interview. \"I am relying on my flexibility a lot. I was fortunate to be surrounded with people who emphasised the importance of stretching and it has paid off.\"\n\nDjokovic is favourite to win a sixth title at the end-of-season tournament after a remarkable year in which he came back from elbow surgery to win Wimbledon and the US Open and return to the top of the rankings for the first time in two years.\n\nThe top two from the two four-player groups qualify for Saturday's semi-finals, with the winners of those matches meeting in Sunday's final.\n\nGroup Gustavo Kuerten P W-L Sets Games Novak Djokovic 2 2-0 4-0 24-12 Alexander Zverev 2 1-1 2-2 19-24 Marin Cilic 2 1-1 2-3 30-28 John Isner 2 0-2 1-4 21-30\n\nWhere did it go wrong for Zverev?\n\nThe turning point of the match was at 4-4 on Djokovic's serve, when Zverev went 0-30 up. But a forehand and then backhand error wiped out the advantage and the German bounced his racquet off the ground in frustration.\n\nDjokovic netted a forehand to give Zverev a break point, which he wasted by returning long, and the Serb then gave him a second chance with a double-fault but the youngster missed that break point when an attempted lob drifted long.\n\nIn the end, Djokovic held his serve with a lovely drop-shot and never looked back.\n\nThree errors in a row in the next game gave Djokovic his first break points of the match and while Zverev saved one of them with a smash, he gave the set away with his only double fault of the first set.\n\nThe opening two games of the second set were close, Djokovic whacking his shoes with his racquet when he failed to break in Zverev's first service game having taken him to deuce.\n\nBut after that Djokovic turned the screw, with the German taking only three points in the final five games as the 14-time Grand Slam champion wrapped up victory against an apparently tiring Zverev in one hour and 16 minutes.\n\n\"The issue is that our season is way too long. But I've said it before,\" Zverev, whose 55 match wins this year is more than any other player, told reporters.\n\n\"We play for 11 months a year. That's ridiculous. No other professional sport does that.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nFormer player and BBC commentator Andrew Castle:\n\nThis was from a guy [Djokovic] who was nowhere. He was a lost soul in the last two years after winning the French Open in 2016. He had won everything. But he is re-ignited now. I think it is fantastic to see him back at his best. It is brilliant for the game. Everyone will be watching this and thinking 'that is a high standard'.\n\nThis tournament is finally starting to light up. We have had a lot of ordinary matches but that wasn't one of them.

I just got a bunch of envelopes and addressed them to 'the manager'.\"\n\nRobert Rowan was an 18-year-old college student from Fife when he sent out the dossiers on the Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona in Rome.\n\nIt was a punt that would earn him scouting roles with Celtic, then the Scotland national team, and a stint during which he combined working in a bank with being the sporting director of Scottish League One side Stenhousemuir, before joining Brentford in 2014.\n\nAt the time of his death on Tuesday at the age of 28, Rowan was the Championship club's technical director.\n\nThe club's co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen described him as \"not only an ambitious colleague who kept pushing the club forward but also a warm, funny and trusted man\".\n\nBut how did a teenager with no football experience end up such a pivotal figure in one of the world's biggest leagues at such a young age?\n\nTurning up at Celtic clueless & soaking wet\n\nWhen football-daft teenager Rowan spotted the internet leak of a scouting report Andre Villas-Boas had compiled for Jose Mourinho's Chelsea a few weeks earlier, he thought he'd have a go at writing one himself.\n\nRemarkably, Nottingham Forest, West Ham and Celtic replied to his mail shot, with the latter inviting him for a meeting in Glasgow.\n\nRowan had never been to Scotland's largest city on his own before. In fact, he hadn't been to many places outside the small town of Kirkcaldy in which he grew up.\n\n\"My mate was at university in Glasgow so he met me and we decided, for some reason, to walk to Celtic Park,\" he told BBC Sport in 2016. \"By the time we got there we were soaking.\n\n\"When I was inside speaking to them, I could see my mate outside in the car park huddled under a \u00a31 umbrella that we bought from a guy on the road side. Thinking back, I wouldn't do it that way again.\"\n\nDespite the shambolic scene, Rowan impressed enough to be invited to work with Celtic's youth and under-21 sides, scouting opposition teams.\n\n\"I was young and naive and there was nothing too complicated about the reports,\" he said. \"I wasn't cocky but I had nothing to lose and wanted to give it a shot.\"\n\nAsking if he could become sporting director\n\nRowan had been at Celtic for a year when Mick Oliver - chief scout for then-Scotland manager Craig Levein - asked him to meet at a non-descript hotel in a non-descript part of central Scotland.\n\nThe two had never spoken before but Oliver handed over footage of Slovenia and asked the wide-eyed 20-year-old to write a report on how the national team's next opponents played.\n\n\"It must have been okay because he gave me a job,\" he said.\n\nThat job, which entailed tracking players from other countries, looking at potential Scotland internationals and recruiting pupils for the Scottish FA's performance schools, ended when Levein was sacked.\n\nThinking his hopes of a career in football were over, Rowan started a traineeship with a bank. Then came another opportunity.\n\nStenhousemuir had never had a sporting director until Rowan arrived\n\nFormer Scotland striker Scott Booth, with whom he had worked at the Scottish FA, was appointed Stenhousemuir manager and asked him to get involved with the part-time club.\n\n\"I jokingly told him I'd only do it if I could be the sporting director, but Stenhousemuir had never had one before,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't think for a minute it would work and, actually, I don't think the club were ever convinced they needed me, but they let me have a go at it.\"\n\nFilming games, showing clips to players and holding analysis sessions may not seem revolutionary, but it was entirely alien to a squad of joiners, plumbers and policemen to be asked to turn up for an additional third training session every week.\n\nHiding in a bank toilet talking to Brentford\n\nThroughout that time, Rowan continued his traineeship and was beginning to consider it his career until two interviews in the space of two days in August 2014 rekindled his hopes of a job in football.\n\n\"I'd told the bank I needed a day off because I had an interview with the English FA,\" he recalled. \"But the Brentford thing was on my day off\u2026\n\nThe \"Brentford thing\" involved a trip to Blackpool on a Tuesday night. The west London club were playing Blackpool and - thanks to his friendship with then-assistant manager Davie Weir - they asked Rowan to meet them pre-match to discuss a position as scouting co-ordinator and join them to watch the game.\n\n\"The problem was, I was working the next morning so I had to drive down then leave pretty much straight away after the chat,\" he recalled. \"I remember heading up the road to Kirkcaldy really hoping I'd get the job but at the back of my mind I was thinking 'aww man, I've got work in the bank tomorrow morning'.\n\n\"But a few weeks later, after hearing nothing, I got a call at work one day and ended up hiding in a toilet cubicle listening to Brentford's director of football talking about salaries, contracts and start dates.\"\n\nGambling with personalities at Brentford\n\nManager Mark Warburton, left, and assistant Davie Weir departed not long after Rowan arrived. The latter two were flat-mates for a spell\n\nA few months after arriving at Brentford - and being promoted to head of football operations - Rowan found himself stuck in the middle of a schism between owner Matthew Benham and the management.\n\nDirector of football Frank McParland, manager Mark Warburton, and assistant Weir were not convinced by professional gambler Benham's statistical modelling strategy.\n\nBut Rowan was an enthusiastic disciple, insisting on spending one day a week studying at Benham's Smartodds statistics company throughout his first year at the west London club.\n\n\"That was a tricky time for me personally but I learned a lot and I've done a lot,\" he said two years ago.\n\n\"In a way, it was good for me to be thrown into that situation because I just had to get on with it and it's given me the kind of experience that very few people my age have, in whatever industry they work in.\"\n\nThat experience attracted an offer from Celtic a couple of years ago to work with their first team and an interview with Rangers last year when they were searching for a director of football.\n\nHowever, Rowan opted to stay in England, where his remit had evolved into the role of technical director.

I know gambling addiction can devastate lives.\"\n\nHow important are FOBTs to bookmakers?\n\nBy Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check\n\nFOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999. Since then, the number has grown to 33,468 in Great Britain.\n\nData from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from \u00a31.05bn in 2009 to \u00a31.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%.\n\nLast year, betting shops made \u00a33.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional \"over-the-counter\" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09.\n\nThat suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit.\n\nWhy has the government been looking at this issue?\n\nFOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm.\n\nThe machines have been called the \"crack cocaine\" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems.\n\nThe government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a \"call for evidence\" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players.\n\nHow has the market reacted?\n\nInvestors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%.\n\nAfter the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said.\n\nWhat has been the political reaction?\n\nTom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken \"the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals\".\n\nHe added it was \"a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction\".", "Five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton says

What happened to the 40 trade deals Liam Fox had said would be ready to go \"a second after midnight\" on Brexit day next March, he asked.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cCan the PM tell us exactly how many of these 40 deals have been negotiated?\u201d\n\nMrs May said the UK had \"started discussions\" with other countries, before launching an attack on Labour's policy of being in a customs union, which she claimed would prevent trade deals.\n\nMr Corbyn had some fun at the expense of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said last week he had not been aware of how much the UK relied on the Dover/Calais route for trade in goods.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cWhen did the PM become aware of this absolutely shocking revelation about Britain\u2019s trade routes?\u201d\n\nThe PM insisted \"we do know about trade policy\" - before turning PMQs on its head by asking Mr Corbyn - in the light of apparent differences between him and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer - if it was Labour policy to \"stop Brexit\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May asks Jeremy Corbyn \"is it Labour Party policy to stop Brexit?\"\n\nMr Corbyn said Labour respected the result of the referendum - and took another swipe at Mr Raab's \"woeful ignorance\". He ended with his first question - would MPs be presented with a choice between her \"half-baked deal\" or \"no deal\"?\n\nMrs May ignored this in favour of her customary swipe at Labour's economic policies and a defence of her Brexit agreement.\n\nWhat else came up?\n\nThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford also went on Brexit, calling for Scotland to stay in the customs union.\n\nTory Brexiteer Peter Bone accused the PM of failing to deliver the Brexit people had voted for.\n\nThe prime minister hinted that a planned crackdown on betting machines in bookmakers shops could be brought forward - after protests from MPs on all sides and the resignation of Sports Minister Tracey Crouch.\n\nLabour's Rosena Allin-Khan called for another EU referendum.\n\nLabour's Wes Streeting called for stricter controls on the sale of crossbows.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nHere is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:\n\nJeremy Corbyn was on fire today. A series of pointed, well-delivered questions, including one on whether the UK could unilaterally leave the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement, which the PM danced around but didn't answer.\n\nThe prime minister was in the awkward position of discussing an as yet unpublished and unagreed document, and she looked uncomfortable and, at times, cornered.\n\nShe endured a very tough three quarters of an hour against opponents whose position was far more fluid than her's could be. I think we saw Jeremy Corbyn's position evolving a bit, before our very eyes.\n\nHis warning that Labour would not accept a choice between the PM's Brexit deal or a no-deal Brexit opens up the prospect of an attempt to present some further option. But what? A new round of negotiation?\n\nPerhaps accompanied by an extension to the Article 50 deadline for Brexit?\n\nHis aside that Labour respected the referendum verdict would seem to rule out a call for a second referendum. A number of his senior colleagues are attempting to waft him towards a very soft Brexit position, and maybe more; today they got some Remain body language.\n\nEven more ominous was the intervention that followed from Conservative Brexiteer backbencher Peter Bone.\n\nHe normally wraps his political messages in a joke - this time he delivered a blunt, to-her-face warning that the PM's deal was unacceptable. It's the kind of attack from the benches behind that has failed to materialise at previous PMQs that may be a feature of future ones.\n\nThe prime minister fielded questions about other issues - the horrible crossbow murder in Ilford, rolling stock in Elmet and Rothwell, viaducts in Eddisbury, disabled veterans and many more, but the Brexit questions kept coming.\n\nSeveral MPs quoted departed transport minister Jo Johnson at her, and the questions he raised will not go away.\n\nThe PM could swat away outright calls for another referendum, but the SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, zeroed in on the idea that Scotland should have a similar customs union deal to that offered for Northern Ireland, an idea which alarms Scottish Tories, while Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts used a Brexit question to take a swipe at the Labour-led Welsh government in Cardiff.\n\nAnd at the end of it all a series of points of order established that the PM will probably be back tomorrow (Thursday) for a full-dress Commons statement on the deal - if it gets through Cabinet.\n\nThis was a mere appetiser for what promises to be a gruelling \"til they drop\" ordeal.", "Video\n\nThe film continues the story of Newt Scamander, writer of a famous book in the wizarding world called Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\n\nIt stars a host of A-list actors including Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law and Johnny Depp.", "The Confederation of African Football has ruled in favour of Equatorial Guinea\n\nKenya's Football Federation (FKF) says it has filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Wednesday, in a late bid to reverse their exclusion from the Women's Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on Saturday.\n\nOn 18 October, Equatorial Guinea were banned for using an ineligible player in qualifying, with Kenya replacing them at Ghana 2018.\n\nBut a Confederation of African Football (Caf) tribunal overturned that punishment on 7 November, reinstating Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\"They included us in the draw and in the fixtures, so we prepared our team,\" FKF president Nick Mwendwa told BBC Sport.\n\n\"For them to make a decision nine or 10 days to the event, is why we are in the problem we are in.\n\n\"If they came back to us one month ago, then we would have had enough time - but they did not,\" said Mwendwa.\n\nKenya had announced an appeal last Thursday but, on Tuesday this week, CAS confirmed to the BBC that they had not received it.\n\nWith just three days to go before the tournament kicks off in Ghana, Mwendwa is hoping that any appeals decisions are made swiftly - even if they are in Kenya's favour.\n\n\"We can get to Ghana on Saturday.

Neither does 13 goals conceded in that time.\n\nBut perhaps the most damaging statistic is that Alex McLeish's side have scored only four goals so far this calendar year. One of those was an own goal, another a penalty, and of the two that Steven Naismith scored, one was a consolation in a 3-1 defeat by Portugal.\n\nThe absence of Naismith and fellow striker Leigh Griffiths because of injury for the Uefa Nations League games against Albania and Israel has left a vacancy in McLeish's attack.\n\nBut who can fill the void? BBC Scotland assesses the options...\n\nFour players, 10 goals... six of them against Gibraltar\n\nRecalled 13 months after his last cap, Steven Fletcher was one of the most notable inclusions in the squad. The Sheffield Wednesday forward had not featured at all since McLeish took control for a second time in early 2018.\n\nFletcher continues to be something of a conundrum for Scotland. He had a much publicised absence from international duty during Craig Levein's tenure, meaning he did not feature between August 2010 and October 2012. During that period, he scored 29 goals, mostly in the Premier League in England.\n\nSince returning to the international fold, he has scored 27 club goals in six years but most of those have been in England's Championship. He has three in 18 games this term.\n\nWith nine goals for Scotland, Fletcher is by some distance the top scorer in the squad but six of those - two hat-tricks - came against Gibraltar.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Inverness CT manager John Hughes on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nHe's only 31 - still a young boy, really - and he's playing regularly for Sheffield Wednesday. He's been there and done it and I think he'll start through the middle.\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nSteven's been there. He's experienced enough. If you're looking for an option that holds the ball up well, technically good, always a goal threat then Steven's more than capable of filling that void.\n\nScotland Women midfielder Leanne Crichton:\n\nI think he will be a shoo-in to start. I don't think a guy that's been out for 13 months, you would just bring him in to almost supplement the squad. He's brought him in knowing that he'll probably play.\n\nUnlike Fletcher, Matt Phillips has been involved in McLeish's squads this year and netted his debut international goal in the March win over Hungary.\n\nHe started as a lone striker in the friendlies against Costa Rica and Peru, as well as against the Hungarians, but his versatility means he could play with a more recognised number nine like Fletcher.\n\nPhillips, 27, has scored five times in 14 club appearances this season for West Brom and offers pace as well as power at the apex of the attack.\n\nThe 27-year-old's recent record at club level of four goals in 13 appearances is superior to that of Fletcher (three in 18).\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nMatty Phillips has done the job up front for Scotland and Alex McLeish seems to like him in that role.\n\nThough lauded for some of his performances at international level, Johnny Russell is yet to score for his country.\n\nThe former Dundee United and Derby County forward proved a good foil for Naismith in the opening 2-0 Nations League win against Albania at Hampden and has scored 10 goals for Major League Soccer side Sporting Kansas City this term.\n\nShould McLeish persist with his 3-5-2 formation, Russell seems a good bet to keep his place playing off one of the other strikers.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland forward Kris Commons on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nJohnny Russell is playing at a real good level - man of the match displays in America, involved in the play-offs. His contribution to Scotland over the previous games has been superb. He adds pace, he's clever, he can get hold of the ball.\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nJohnny Russell's played in the last few games as well and I think he's done excellent up there with Naismith. I think he's done okay, despite performances maybe not being quite up to scratch.\n\nSwansea City striker Oli McBurnie may be the underdog to lead Scotland's attack but he has scored more club goals this season than either Fletcher or Phillips - seven in 18 games.\n\nHe started in the friendly defeat by Portugal and came on in Israel last month, and has had a substantial amount of game time under McLeish in the past few months.\n\nMcBurnie has also proven he can score goals at under-21 level under Scot Gemmill's command.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland striker Kenny Miller on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nMcBurnie's started a game or two, and has been around the squad. Again, he's having a decent goalscoring start to the season with Swansea.\n\nFormer Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nFrom what I've seen of McBurnie, he's not set the heather on fire playing for Scotland.\n\nIs Paterson a left-field solution?\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing option is former Hearts defender Callum Paterson.\n\nThe 24-year-old has won each of his nine caps at either right-back or right wing-back, and is notionally in the squad to cover those positions.\n\nHowever, he has been deployed as a lone striker by Cardiff City in recent Premier League matches, scoring three goals in four games, and broke through at Hearts as a centre forward.\n\nWhat do the pundits say?\n\nFormer Scotland midfielder Michael Stewart on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nCallum Paterson plays in a team that's so suited to their style of play and the athlete that he is. But I don't see his attributes being a link man holding it up and that is vital.\n\nFormer Australia striker Scott McDonald on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\nIf you're playing away from home, I think you would be a little more inclined to play on the counter and I think Cardiff have been trying to do that. So why would you not throw him in there? He's got pace, he's got power, he's good in the air. If you're playing that out-and-out lone striker who wants to run the channels and be a nuisance all night, Paterson might be your man.\n\nSo what does McLeish do?\n\nBoth Celtic's James Forrest and Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser could also be considered, with the pace of the wingers a potential counter-attacking weapon in Albania. Between them, they have scored 11 times this term for the clubs.\n\nBut neither have scored for the national team. Celtic's Callum McGregor hasn't either. Nor midfielder counterpart from Aston Villa John McGinn.\n\nIn fact, among the rest of the squad, only captain Andrew Robertson and midfielder Stuart Armstrong have international goals to their name. And by goals, we mean one each.\n\nSo who would you select to play in attack in Shkoder?", "Image caption Sana Muhammad died in hospital on Monday\n\nThe death of a pregnant woman who was killed in a crossbow attack in her own home has \"shocked people to the core\", an MP has said.\n\nSana Muhammad, 35, died on Monday after the attack in Ilford, east London, but her unborn son was delivered safely.\n\nIlford North MP Wes Streeting said in Parliament her death had left people in shock \"up and down the country\".\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said laws around crossbows would be reviewed after Mrs Muhammad's death.\n\nRamanodge Unmathallegadoo, 50, of no fixed address, has been charged with Mrs Muhammad's murder and is due to appear at the Old Bailey on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Streeting said: \"I know I will speak for every member of this House in expressing our deepest condolences to the family and our best wishes to the baby for a speedy recovery.\n\n\"Given these weapons, like the crossbow, used to kill my constituent are readily for sale online, can I urge the Prime Minister to urgently and seriously look at expanding the Offensive Weapons Bill so that we can toughen the scope of the laws governing the sale, the possession and the use of these deadly weapons.\"\n\nMrs May responded by saying crossbows were \"subject to strict controls\", but the government would \"consider the risk to public safety and whether further measures are needed\".\n\nImage caption The Met Police said the newborn baby remains in hospital in a \"stable condition\"\n\nOffers of help for Mrs Muhammad's family, including a pledge to cover funeral costs, have flooded in from the community.\n\nRedbridge Council leader Jas Athwal said the authority would support the family for \"as long as it is needed\".\n\nNearly \u00a33,000 has also been raised through a Go Fund Me page, which described the death of Mrs Muhammad as \"unimaginable\".\n\nMohamed Omer from the Gardens of Peace cemetery and funeral company said: \"The entire Muslim community and the entire Redbridge community is in absolute shock as to what has happened.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family.\n\n\"In order to help them cope, we are making the family of Sana Muhammad know that they need to not worry about funeral costs as we will be covering them.\"\n\nImage caption Police said the victim and the suspect were known to each other\n\nMrs Muhammad was attacked in front of her five other children in the family home on Applegarth Road, her husband Imtiaz Muhammad told the Evening Standard.\n\nShe was taken to hospital with an abdominal wound and pronounced dead at 11:00 GMT, less than four hours after the attack.\n\nHowever her son was delivered by Caesarean section and \"remains in a stable condition in a critical care unit\", police said.\n\nCouncillor Athwal said he had asked for an \"urgent meeting\" with the borough commander \"to discuss safety\" in the Redbridge area.", "Image copyright April Catherine Rose Image caption April says her friends didn't know what to do when she had a hypo\n\nOn World Diabetes Day, three people talk about what it's like to live with the condition and what they wish people knew about it.\n\n'People think I can't eat sweets'\n\nApril Catherine Rose has type 1 diabetes, meaning her body doesn't produce the hormone insulin and can't properly control the amount of sugar in her blood. She says there are plenty of misconceptions.\n\n\"People think I can't eat sweets, chocolate or cake,\" she says. \"I can eat it, I just have to take insulin.\"\n\nPeople with type 1 tailor their dose of insulin to the amount of carbohydrate in the food they're eating, but April says people don't always understand how dangerous the condition can be.\n\nWhen she was at university, a housemate drunkenly moved her insulin from the fridge to the freezer - and insulin doesn't work if it gets too cold.\n\n\"As it was frozen I had to throw it away,\" says April, saying she had only got the prescription two days previously. \"People don't realise how serious it is - it's someone's life on the line.\"\n\n'If I'm having a hypo, don't give me insulin'\n\nThe 21-year-old actress adds that in \"life or death situations\" most non-diabetics may not know what to do. Once, April says, her lunch plans with friends almost became fatal.\n\nApril had a \"hypo\", short for hypoglycaemia, meaning her blood sugar levels were too low. Hypos happen if the balance of medication - usually insulin - isn't right. Symptoms can include shaking, sweating, going pale, being anxious or irritable and blurred sight.\n\nThey can be caused by things like delaying meals, not having enough carbohydrate, doing lots of exercise or drinking alcohol on an empty stomach.\n\n\"My body was shutting down on me,\" she says. \"I was disorientated and I didn't have the energy to speak.\"\n\nBut when they were trying to help, her friends injected her with insulin - which made her levels even lower. When her condition did not improve, another friend was called who explained that she needed sugar, not insulin.\n\nIf someone has a hypo, they need a fast-acting carbohydrate - something sugary that will enter the bloodstream quickly. If someone is unable to treat their own hypo and they are unconscious, an ambulance should be called.\n\nImage copyright Paula Chinchilla Image caption Gavin Griffiths runs marathons despite his diabetes\n\nGavin Griffiths views his Type 1 diabetes in a positive light. But that's not always been the case.\n\n\"I was diagnosed at eight years old and I went into school and I suddenly felt very shy and very different compared to everyone else,\" he says. \"That wasn't me beforehand.\"\n\n'Don't think I'm different'\n\nGavin says his school stuck a big photograph of him outside the medical room - \"like a wanted poster\" - which made him feel singled out.\n\n\"I didn't want to draw more unwanted attention from the other kids so I would avoid testing my blood sugars. My confidence was completely shattered.\n\n\"Through sport I was able to find myself again and feel more confident and comfortable in myself.\"\n\nNow, aged 27, Gavin feels the opposite from how he did as a child. He used his confidence to develop his own diabetes educational company, DiAthlete.\n\nHe also takes part in endurance challenges and earlier this year ran 25 marathons in May.\n\nGavin wishes the media better portrayed the specific details of the types of diabetes and their symptoms. He also wants more to be done in schools to educate children about the condition.\n\nDiabetes - the basics\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes - type 1 and type 2. There are also other kinds like gestational diabetes, which develops during pregnancy.\n\nIn type 1, which is typically diagnosed earlier in life but can develop at any age, insulin has to be injected, either manually or through a pump. It can't be prevented or cured and it's not caused by lifestyle.\n\nPeople get type 2 when the insulin they produce isn't working properly, or not enough is being made. It can be linked to being overweight or inactive and also to family history. It's much more common than type 1, accounting for about 90% of all people with diabetes. Some people with type 2 take insulin, while others control their blood sugar levels with medication, exercise and a healthy diet.\n\nHaving uncontrolled blood glucose in the long run can lead to complications, including problems with nerves, kidneys, eyes and feet, but the risk of developing them can be reduced with the right treatment and care.\n\nSources: NHS, Diabetes UK\n\n'Understand if I get tired'\n\nMuch to her amusement, Hildia Campbell says she's fallen asleep in public places because of her diabetes.\n\n\"If I go out and it's past a certain time, I fall asleep after taking my tablets,\" she says. \"I've had pictures taken of me sleeping at parties.\"\n\nIt is not, Hildia stresses, because she wants to sleep, but because her body gets tired because of her type 2 diabetes.\n\n\"I wish everybody understood diabetes a bit more,\" she says.\n\nImage copyright Hildia Campbell Image caption Hildia says she's now more aware of what she puts in her body\n\nWhen diagnosed 14 years ago, Hildia was not aware that healthier food options and exercise could have helped prevent her from developing the condition.\n\nShe was also unaware of the side effects that could happen from taking tablets to manage her diabetes and wishes more emphasis was placed on nutrition education.\n\nStudies show that type 2 diabetes can be reversible through a healthy diet and active lifestyle.\n\n\"It was a turning point for me as it has made me become aware of what I put in my body and the doctors have told me that diabetes is on its way out of my body.\n\n\"The last blood test I had, the doctors were pleased that my diabetes was more under control.

The final winners of each category are chosen by a blended vote between a jury of games industry professionals (90%), and the public (10%).\n\nWhile there are some predictable nominees in this year's line-up, YouTube producer and games critic Louise Blain believes some unexpected patterns emerged.\n\n\"What's really refreshing to see is that the majority of the game of the year awards are huge single player experiences,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\n\"With all the discussion over the last few years of the future of games being depressingly described as an ongoing 'service', the success of games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and God of War shows that there's still an absolute love for brilliant single player games.\"\n\nGames as a service (GaaS) is industry jargon referring to how players are encouraged to spend more money through a steady drip feed of new in-game content.\n\n\"There's no denying the power of Fortnite, which is nominated elsewhere, but single player games aren't going

off for some of the world's most charismatic animals, according to new assessments for the extinction Red List.\n\nProspects look better for the mountain gorilla, after years of conservation measures, including anti-poaching and veterinary patrols.\n\nAnd numbers of two large whales are recovering, following hunting bans.\n\nHowever, other flora and fauna is declining.\n\nSpecies getting closer to extinction include several types of fish, a globally important timber tree, and one of the world's largest and smelliest flowers.\n\nThe fin whale, western gray whale, mountain gorilla and Rothschild's giraffe are among the animals where numbers are rising.\n\nThe latest assessments by the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN come as governments convene in Egypt for the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\nIUCN Director General, Inger Andersen, said the recoveries we are seeing illustrate the power of conservation action.\n\n\"These conservation successes are proof that the ambitious, collaborative efforts of governments, business and civil society could turn back the tide of species loss,\" she said.\n\nAlmost 100,000 plants and animals have now been evaluated for extinction threats by the IUCN. Of these, around a quarter are on the edge of extinction.\n\nThe \"winners\" in the new Red List include:\n\nThe mountain gorilla\n\nThere were around 600 mountain gorillas left in the wild in 2008; but numbers have now risen to over 1,000 after intensive conservation efforts. These include anti-poaching patrols and vets trained to give care to gorillas in the wild.\n\nThe gorilla is restricted to protected areas in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. Threats remain, including poaching, civil unrest and diseases passed on by humans.\n\nBut while mountain gorillas are increasing in number, the great ape remains endangered.\n\nDr Liz Williamson of the IUCN primate specialist group said conservation action must continue.\n\n\"Coordinated efforts through a regional action plan and fully implementing IUCN Best Practice guidelines for great ape tourism and disease prevention, which recommend limiting numbers of tourists and preventing any close contact with humans, are critical to ensuring a future for the mountain gorilla,\" she said.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fin whale: From endangered to vulnerable\n\nThe fin whale\n\nPopulations of this large whale - one of the biggest in the ocean - are on the rise, and have roughly doubled since the 1970s. There are now estimated to be 100,000 adults.\n\nThe western gray whale\n\nThis whale too is reaping the benefits of bans on commercial whaling. Numbers are starting to rise, albeit more slowly. However, this success could be derailed by threats from oil and gas development and commercial fisheries.\n\nImage copyright Oregon State University Image caption Western Gray Whale: From critically endangered to endangered\n\nRandall Reeves of the IUCN cetacean specialist group said it is a relief to see populations of both whales on the rise, but conservation efforts must continue.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"Large whales are, for the most part, doing pretty well - they show that if you stop killing them, they can recover.

He will enjoy his new manager's popularity but he will also want his pragmatism and expertise to get results.\n\nRanieri's warm personality will lift some of the clouds over Fulham in an instant and they will also garner support among neutrals purely because of the Italian's presence.\n\nYes, it did go wrong in the final months at Leicester City but his methods were still enough to take an unheralded squad to unimaginable heights in the previous season.\n\nAnd they were not always conventional.\n\nWho can forget Ranieri's imaginary \"dilly-ding dilly-dong\" bell he claimed to use when players were not paying attention - even giving his players a small bell as a light-hearted Christmas present?\n\nEarlier in that glorious campaign Ranieri complained about a lack of clean sheets, promising his players a pizza as a reward.

A last-minute loss at Arsenal meant they only got six - but Ranieri gave them their holiday anyway.\n\nAnd to show his human side, he spent the day Leicester City clinched the title - when Spurs only drew with Chelsea - in Rome celebrating his mother's 96th birthday.\n\nWhen his arrival at Leicester was questioned he said: \"I like to travel. I like to discover new places. I am like Christopher Columbus.\"\n\nBut will charm and affability be enough for what he will he discover at Craven Cottage?\n\nCan popular Ranieri get tough?\n\nThere is no doubt that Ranieri's charisma will be crucial in lifting spirits at a club that started the season high on optimism before plummeting to the foot of the table, despite spending \u00a3100m in the summer following promotion from the Championship.\n\nAnd Khan will be hoping he gets the Ranieri who inspired Leicester City to the Premier League on a tidal wave of momentum that saw his 'Tinkerman' reputation ditched in favour of continuity - although this Fulham side will certainly need some tweaking to achieve its potential.\n\nKhan will not want the second-season scenario at Leicester, where Ranieri's glory boys quickly went off the rails and the manager lost his sure touch to such an extent that he was sacked only nine months after his greatest moment, with the Foxes one point off the relegation zone.\n\nRanieri also left amid suggestions of discontent among the players and his own backroom staff. It was certainly not a happy ending to that mercurial management tenure.\n\nKhan, then, will want a manager with fire in his belly and a determination to end his Premier League story on a high after the disappointing end to his short time at Leicester, although the love he still inspires at the King Power was illustrated when he was back recently to pay tribute to owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha following his death in a helicopter crash.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Ranieri pays respects to Leicester owner\n\nWhat are Ranieri's biggest priorities?\n\nRanieri will walk into Fulham's secluded Surrey training ground and Craven Cottage to find plenty of sympathy for Jokanovic, who was actually his first signing as Chelsea manager.\n\nJokanovic took Fulham into the Premier League playing attractive attacking football and Tom Greatrex, chairman of the club's Supporters' Trust, said in a glowing testimonial: \"He will always go down as one of the great Fulham managers.\"\n\nIndeed, it was only two weeks ago that owner Khan delivered combative support for Jokanovic in his programme notes for the home game with Bournemouth in response to stories he was facing the sack, writing: \"I'm in equal parts amused, astonished and disappointed. I ask you not to believe everything you read. Or, in this case, don't believe anything you read.\"\n\nThe subsequent 3-0 loss to the Cherries, a damaging 1-0 reverse at fellow strugglers Huddersfield Town and Sunday's defeat at Liverpool meant things changed quickly - as Ranieri knows they can after his own sacking at Leicester.\n\nNow he must use his well-honed brand of charm and personal magnetism to not only lift a team short on confidence and low on morale, but also apply a fix to serious flaws in a Fulham side that was expected to live comfortably in the Premier League.\n\nFulham spent big in the summer to confirm the loan signing of Aleksdandar Mitrovic from Newcastle United for \u00a320m and bring in the likes of Jean Michael Seri from Nice for \u00a325m, Marseille midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa for \u00a322.3m and Germany World Cup winner Andre Schurrle on loan from Borussia Dortmund, as well as Swansea City defender Alfie Mawson for a deal that could eventually be worth \u00a320m.\n\nThere have been questions about how many of these deals were at Jokanovic's request but only Mitrovic has been a real success and the result has been an imbalanced, uninspired side that has lost its best attacking qualities and has also conceded more goals than anyone else in the Premier League - 31 - and has the worst goal difference at minus 20.\n\nCuring that defensive flaw will be his biggest challenge but he has proved he can do it before - while also getting those big-money buys to justify those lavish price tags.\n\nRanieri will arrive at Fulham on a tide of goodwill, despite replacing the much-admired Jokanovic, but Fulham's situation is so serious he may not be able to use the light touch immediately as one of management's most enduring and popular characters gets back to business.", "Cameron Steel is the youngest batsman to hit a double century for Durham at the age of 21\n\nDurham batsman Cameron Steel has signed a contract extension to keep him with the county until the end of the 2021 campaign.\n\nThe 23-year-old joined from Middlesex in 2017 and previously extended his stay until the end of next season.\n\n\"I'm delighted to have extended my contract and to continue my development here at the Riverside,\" Steel said.\n\n\"It's a special ground to play cricket at and my aim is to push for 1,000 Championship runs next season.\"\n\nSteel scored 638 first-class runs for the county last season, which included four half-centuries and a top score of 160 in their win against Sussex in September.\n\nHead coach Jon Lewis, said: \"We're delighted with the progress that Cameron has shown during his first two years here and I'm convinced he will continue to develop even further.\n\n\"He's just 23 but has shown excellent maturity with his red ball batting and how he handles himself in the dressing room.\"", "Image copyright PA Image caption A protester was detained after flying over the Turnberry hotel in July\n\nA second man has been reported by police after a paraglider pilot flew over the Turnberry resort in protest at Donald Trump's visit to the UK.\n\nThe aircraft, trailing a banner, was flown over the South Ayrshire property on 13 July despite a high police presence.\n\nA man aged 55 was later held by police before being released pending further inquiries.\n\nA 35-year-old man has now also been reported to the procurator fiscal.\n\nPresident Trump was at Turnberry during the private leg of his UK visit.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump played golf at his South Ayrshire resort during his visit\n\nHe was on the front steps of the hotel as the light aircraft approached and was ushered inside by armed police officers.\n\nThe aircraft held a banner reading: \"Trump: well below par #resist\".\n\nProtest organiser Greenpeace has said it gave police 10 to 15 minutes' warning.\n\nBut Police Scotland said the man flying the glider had put himself \"in grave danger\" by breaching the air exclusion zone around the golf course.", "Image copyright TOM JORDAN Image caption The British Antarctic Survey flew one of its planes back and forth across the pole\n\nA \"hotspot\" is melting the base of the Antarctic Ice Sheet at the South Pole.\n\nThe area affected is three times that of Greater London.\n\nScientists suspect a combination of unusually radioactive rocks and geothermal springs may be responsible.\n\nThe warm bedrock is removing some 6mm a year from the underside of the 3km-thick ice sheet, producing a mass of meltwater that then flows away through sub-glacial rivers and lakes towards the continent's coastline.\n\nThe roughly 100km-by-50km hotspot came to light when researchers examined radar images of the ice sheet at 88 degrees South.\n\nThis revealed a startling sagging in the ice layers directly above the hotspot.\n\nDr Tom Jordan, from the British Antarctic Survey, and colleagues have detailed the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nDr Jordan told BBC News: \"We can't be 100% sure because we don't have access to the rocks, but our interpretation is that this heat is coming from granites that contain lots of radioactive elements, such as uranium and potassium.

Having scored 63 and 78 to shift the first and fourth Tests against India in England's favour this summer, the 20-year-old made another vital half-century in trying circumstances.\n\nHis change of pace was ferocious - having largely defended in a stand of 45 with Adil Rashid, Curran was 16 off 65 balls when James Anderson arrived at the crease at 225-9, before the Surrey all-rounder scored 48 off his next 54 deliveries as they put on 60 for the last wicket.\n\nHe blasted six sixes before hitting his sole four and now has 14 sixes in his seven Tests - more than any other batsman in 2018 and more than Alastair Cook made in his entire career.\n\nHe had some luck - he was dropped on seven and 53, while Anderson successfully overturned a decision on review after being given out lbw first ball - but by the time he picked out long-off for the final wicket, Curran's innings had ensured the beleaguered hosts were visibly deflated as they left the field.\n\nFamiliar flaws on a tricky pitch\n\nJust as in Galle, England won the toss, batted with a positive approach and were in trouble early on, albeit more down to testing bowling than particularly reckless shots this time.\n\nThe flaws were all too familiar though - opener Keaton Jennings showing why doubts over his long-term place remain just one innings on from his unbeaten 146 as he again struggled against pace, prodding uncertainly at Suranga Lakmal to be caught behind for one.\n\nIt is too early to judge Ben Stokes' long-term candidacy as England's number three - he applied himself well before before he was squared up by Dilruwan Perera to fall lbw for 19, the ball straightening sharply and hitting the back leg, with Sri Lanka successfully overturning the initial not out decision on review.\n\nRoot was busy from the off but tried to defend an innocuous delivery from Pushpakumara with a large gap between bat and pad, the ball flicking both on its way to hit the stumps.\n\nThere were positives - Rory Burns hit 43, his highest score in his three Test innings to date, before nicking a fine, biting delivery by Akila Dananjaya to first slip.\n\nBen Foakes also looked assured following his century on his debut, although should have reviewed when given out for an apparent bottom edge that flicked off his and counterpart Niroshan Dickwella's pads before ending up at first slip, with replays suggesting the wicketkeeper had not hit it.\n\nBut, despite moving down from three to six, Moeen Ali's form with the bat remains a concern - the all-rounder playing across the line and out lbw on review for 10.\n\nButtler and Curran - together with Rashid's enterprising 31 - took England to a decent total but better sides will not let them recover from such perilous positions.\n\nPoor tactics let down Sri Lanka\n\nThat Sri Lanka let England off the hook was a result of some poor tactics in the field.\n\nTheir plans were too easily scrambled by Buttler's approach, with stand-in captain Lakmal leaving huge gaps square of the wicket for the England batsman to target and seemingly waiting for the miscue that took 63 runs to arrive.\n\nCurran and Anderson batted together for 66 balls but the tail-ender faced only 12 of those deliveries, with Curran routinely able to tap an easy single off the last ball of the over and keep the strike.\n\nThose mistakes let down an otherwise admirable bowling display by Sri Lanka's spinners.\n\nOff-spinner Dilruwan constantly threatened England's left-handers from round the wicket and returned to trap Rashid plumb lbw before dismissing Curran, while slow left-armer Pushpakumara picked up three middle-order wickets.\n\nAkila, who will be tested after being reported for a suspect bowling in the first Test, shrugged off that added scrutiny to bowl well, including a ripping delivery to dismiss Leach.\n\n'It's going to be a three-day Test' - analysis and reaction\n\nFormer England captain Michael Vaughan on the TMS podcast: \"It's been a riveting day. It looks like we're in for a three-day Test.\n\n\"I can't see how the pitch will get any better.

Lee left the Marvel company in 1972 but remained a chairman emeritus.\n\nIt's not often with a company as large as Marvel that one of the creators becomes such a well-known household name - Lee is almost as recognisable as the name Spider-Man.\n\nHe is known for creating compelling characters that people could relate to, as his comic book and storytelling ability inspired others to create.\n\nX-Men characters Professor Xavier and Magneto were allegories for Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, while many fans have compared the gay rights parallel to the discrimination the X-Men often faced. Ian McKellan, who went on to play Magento in multiple movies once said that parallel was his reason for taking on the role.\n\nImage copyright Barcroft Image caption The X-Men were first created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963.\n\nLee had a fondness for portraying characters with flaws that the audience could relate to, such as the Hulk, possibly the strongest character in the Marvel universe, but that power, ultimately can not be controlled. Peter Parker, although gifted with his spidey-senses and superhuman agility and strength, was still a teenager dealing with normal teenager problems of negotiating homework deadlines and avoiding school bullies.\n\nAlthough most fans know the Hulk and Spiderman, some of Marvel's less high profile characters have roots in Scotland, and while Scottish characters are still rare in US comics, Lee has helped craft and inspire other Scottish creators as well.\n\nOne of the first Scottish characters in Marvel given a prominent role was Dr Moira MacTaggert, a geneticist who made her first appearance in Uncanny X-Men in 1975. Although the character was not a mutant, she founded a mutant research facility called Muir Island, an island chain off the coast of Scotland and had a on-and-off relationship with X-Men leader, Prof X.\n\nMoira has featured in multiple comics, and made two live action movie appearance, one with her native Scottish accent during X-Men 3, and again when she was portrayed by actress Rose Byrne in First Class, this time without the Scottish accent.\n\nAnother popular character, and eventual X-Man is the mutant Rahne Sinclair, a powerful Scottish born woman who goes by the mantle Wolfsbane. Again, created by Chris Claremont, Rahne has the ability to turn her body into both a wolf and a werewolf and has been a featured member of the X-Men team for years. She has teamed with Wolverine many times during their run in X-Men spinoff series, X-Force.\n\nShe will be making her big screen debut in 2019 when she is brought to life by Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams.\n\nMore recently Leo Fitz, one of the main characters on Marvel's television series S.H.I.E.L.D. is a Scottish born agent and scientist and there is even a Scottish Spider-Man called Peter Parquagh set in an alternative comic book Earth.\n\nNot only did Stan Lee inspire other comic book writers to create Scottish characters within the Marvel universe, he worked with two of the biggest names in comics today.\n\nGrant Morrison and Mark Millar, two Scottish born comic book writers have written Lee's characters in the past with great success.\n\nImage copyright Dave J Hogan Image caption The Game of Thrones actress with portray the Scottish hero in upcoming movie, The New Mutants\n\nMorrison MBE is a comic book writer and playwright and had a successful run on New X-Men, which was also illustrated by fellow Scot, Frank Quitely. Millar MBE is best known for his work on Kingsman: The Secret Service, Wanted and Civil War.\n\nRichmond Clements, a graphic novel writer from Northern Ireland, who has been living in Scotland for the past few years says \"Scotland easily punches above its weight\" in the comic world, but when it comes to US comics, Scottish characters are thin on the ground.\n\nClements said: \"Alan Grant always enjoyed bringing Marvel and DC characters to Scotland, and jokes about how little American editors would know about Scotland.\n\n\"A great example of Alan's mischief can be found in one of his Nick Fury tales, where the Marvel superspy had a top-secret base on top of the Old Man of Hoy. I'm sure it was no coincidence that the artist on this story - Cam Kennedy - lives on Orkney.\"\n\nComics in Scotland have become more popular over recent years, there is even a Comics and Graphic Novels degree course at Dundee University and in Saltire, a graphic novel set in a mythological Scotland, the genre has truly come home.\n\nImage copyright Diamondsteel Comics Image caption Set in a mythological Scotland, Saltire is inspired by real life places and events.\n\nMeanwhile Clements is currently writing his graphic novel which he described as \"the most Scottish comic possible\" - set to be released next summer. And Scots duo Gordon Rennie and Emma Beeby recently created the award winning Robert Burns Witch Hunter, which recasts the Nation's favourite poet as a crusader against the supernatural.\n\nClements thinks it is impossible to call yourself a comic creator, or fan, and not be in some way influenced by Stan Lee.\n\n\"It is not an exaggeration to say he is the most important figure in American comics ever - and there's a good argument to be made he's the most important figure in comics ever,\" he added.\n\n\"His characters have went from cheap, disposable comic books to now being the cornerstone of the biggest and most successful film franchise around.

The cost of oils and fats dropped by 6.3% compared with the previous month, while milk, cheese and eggs prices were down 1.4%.\n\nOverall food and non-alcoholic drink prices dropped by 0.2% in October.

It'll be OK.\"\n\nSpeaking to Lauren Mahon and Deborah James, the co-presenters of the award-winning podcast about living with cancer, Mr Bland said neither he nor his wife realised \"just how tough\" her final days would be.\n\nHe said the days leading up to, and following her death, had been \"nothing like you imagine\", as he had not realised what would happen physically as she \"was getting more and more sick\".\n\nImage caption It is the first You, Me and the Big C podcast since Rachael died\n\n\"I didn't feel like anyone really actually explained how hard and how demanding that last four or five days were going to be,\" he said.\n\n\"I might be wrong but I just feel that if Rachael had known how hard it was going to be she might have wanted to go into a hospice or something else. I just don't know that either of us understood just how tough those last days were going to be - how demanding on her it was, only having me looking after her, and how demanding it was on me.\"\n\nThe podcast, released on Wednesday, is the first recorded since her death.\n\n'Good and bad days'\n\nHe said it was difficult reconciling the Rachael being shown in the \"media storm\" after her death with the person he knew - although it had been comforting too.\n\n\"It was very hard because my Rachael wasn't the Rachael who did the podcast, wasn't the Rachael on the TV, wasn't the Rachael on the radio,\" he said.\n\n\"My Rachael was the one who sat next to me on the sofa watching crappy TV.

But, back in the UK, senior Brexit and Remain supporters have expressed reservations about the draft agreement, which very few people have yet seen.

For the most part, play-offs are held among teams in the same tier - so giants will face giants, minnows will face minnows etc.\n\nThe teams who win the four divisions in League A go into a four-team knockout final tournament in June 2019 to decide the winners of the Nations League.\n\nCountries who win the groups in the lower three tiers all get promoted to the higher division for the 2020-21 event.

He turned down a new deal that City manager Pep Guardiola said he had agreed to sign as he went in search of regular first-team football.\n\n\"I just felt I was ready for the next step and I felt Borussia Dortmund was a great club to move to and develop my career,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"It's taking my game to a different level, only because I'm playing and getting the chance to show the world what I can do on the pitch.\"\n\nEngland Under-21 striker Nelson left Arsenal on a season-long loan.\n\n\"For me, I always want to be the best player I can be,\" he said. \"I'm 18 and I thought going to the Bundesliga will give me a challenge and doing that would make me become a better footballer and a better person as well throughout life.\n\n\"I wanted to challenge myself and see what I could do. It's going well so far.\n\n\"It's incredible. But I've just got to keep it up. It's not just for the six games, I've got to do it throughout the season.\n\n\"I don't know where it's going to take me, but I've just got to keep my feet on the ground and keep positive.\"\n\nWhat's life like in Germany?\n\nSancho is in the more metropolitan city of Dortmund compared with the quieter town of Heidelberg, where Nelson has chosen to live.\n\n\"I like it. I've settled down now - got my apartment and I'm loving it here,\" said Sancho.\n\n\"The city is nice. I go for little strolls, I'm getting to learn the language as well, so everything's going well so far.\n\n\"My dad's over here at the moment, so he's just looking after me. I've actually got a chef - Dortmund recommended him and he's helped me a lot, keeping me healthy and in shape.\n\n\"There's a lot of foreigners in the dressing room so I think it's just normal to them, but it's nice to be around everyone. There are different cultures and you get to learn different things.\"\n\nNelson has swapped the bustle of London for a town which, according to Wikipedia, has \"roughly a quarter of its population being students\".\n\n\"London is a very big place but I'm in a small town called Heidelberg and I'm here with my family,\" said Nelson. \"I'm happy at the moment and I'm playing, so it's all going well.\n\n\"It [Hoffenheim] is a small little village. I've got my mum and my brother here - they're exploring Heidelberg and they say to me they love it, so that's just all good for me.\"\n\nHe added: \"I can speak a bit of German.

The boys banter me sometimes, the way I speak, but that's just what comes with it.\"\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nNelson (left) and Sancho have 11 goals between them so far this season\n\nSancho's form has led to him breaking into the England squad and he made his debut in a goalless draw in Croatia on 12 October. He came on for Raheem Sterling after 78 minutes and produced an impressive cameo appearance.\n\n\"I feel like I'm just doing my job really, I don't really look at myself as the next big thing,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm just here to do my job and I just want to play - that's the love of the game really.\n\n\"I think if I keep this up I can go a long way, but I've just got to keep grounded and keep focused.\"\n\nSancho added: \"Right now I'm just focused on season-by-season, game-by-game. I couldn't really tell you the future.\n\n\"But, country-wise, I hope I get more senior caps, that would be fantastic for me and my family. I've just got to keep on working hard and you never know what's next.\"\n\nNelson moved to Hoffenheim on the back of signing a new long-term contract with Arsenal and Gunners fans can rest easy when he talks about his next destination.\n\n\"Arsenal are my boyhood club,\" he said. \"I've been with them since I was eight, so that's 10 years.\n\n\"I just want to go back there stronger because at the time I was at Arsenal I was 16, 17 and I didn't feel confident.\n\n\"I didn't think I was a man, but now I'm feeling stronger and I think a couple more months or even a year in Hoffenheim will make me strong and give me the belief and confidence to go back to Arsenal and do very good there.\n\n\"I want to be an Arsenal legend.

We were playing against Leicester; Jeffrey Schlupp was playing up and down the wing in front of me, had made a bad challenge, and I got into him.\n\nI got his attention and we exchanged a few choice words before I gave him the bird as he jogged off. About five minutes later he scored and celebrated in front of me while holding eye contact with me the whole time. Not really much I could say at that point...\n\nTom from Stafford\n\n'Your dad's rubbish at advertising'\n\nHi Peter - I work in advertising and know your dad Bruce slightly. When you were on loan at Norwich, you came up to Deepdale. You were in the Preston box and I was behind the goal.\n\nI shouted out something along the lines of, \"You're rubbish and your dad's rubbish at advertising.\" Because it was obvious that I must know your dad in some capacity you lost concentration and scanned the crowd for a moment.\n\nJust so we're clear: your dad was a great creative. I was saying it to put you off.\n\nMick\n\nHasselbaink handbags\n\nI was at Chelsea v Arsenal when the away fans were down the side of the main stand.\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink came over to get the ball and my mate shouted, \"Oi Hasselbaink, your backside is massive in those shorts!\" - just as there was a lull in the singing, and everyone heard it.\n\nThe stand seemed to laugh and I laughed out loud too but just as I laughed, Jimmy looked round and stared straight at me with those massive eyes.\n\nHe stayed there staring for what seemed like minutes. I kept pointing to my mate but he wasn't having any of it. Jimmy shook his head and I felt that my days were numbered.\n\nJonathan\n\nWiki woe\n\nA couple of mates and I went to Oxford v Cambridge at the Kassam Stadium. In the second half, we were standing near the Cambridge keeper of the time, Chris Dunne.\n\nOne of my mates had his Wikipedia page up on his phone and we were giving him abuse based on his playing stats over the years, saying stuff like: \"What happened at Yeovil in 2013-14, Chris? Why weren't you good enough to play?\"\n\nAfter 20 minutes of our heckling, he dropped the ball and got it taken around him by a striker.\n\nAlthough the striker hit the bar we still believe that we broke him down mentally and caused that mistake.\n\nJames\n\nSqueaky voice time\n\nI was 15 years old, and we were at a non-league game at Altrincham FC. The goalkeeper was getting abuse hurled at him from behind the goal all game from about 200 fans. I decided to get involved and picked out one of his weaknesses, and I plucked up the courage to hurl my witty abuse.\n\nI shouted at the top of my voice: \"Keeper, you've got small feet!\" As I did, the whole stand went quiet and everyone heard me say it. Even the keeper turned round as my voice, which hadn't yet broken, went as high-pitched as humanly possible, not helped by the realisation of how rubbish my insult was.\n\nSafe to say, I shrivelled into a cocoon and have never publicly insulted a player at a football match again.\n\nChris\n\nGiving Uriah heaps\n\nWhen at a Stockport County game some years ago, I stood up in the main stand as the players went into the tunnel at half-time and shouted towards the referee, Uriah Rennie: \"It's because of performances like that, you're reffing in League Two!\"\n\nHe stopped shy of the tunnel, looked at me with genuine sorrow, then looked down at his feet and trudged into the tunnel.\n\nI've never been able to forget his hurt expression. Sorry Uriah.\n\nPhil from Hazel Grove\n\nRebel Neville\n\nI need to apologise to the Neville brothers. During their time playing for Manchester United together, my football club, Blackburn Rovers were also playing in the Premier League. I sat in the Jack Walker Stand, lower tier, pitch side. Impeccable seats.\n\nFor whatever reason, Sir Alex Ferguson opted to play Phil on the right wing, with Gary behind him at right-back. The Neville right-side double.\n\nAnd so for the entirety of the second half, with both players in front of me as Gary overlapped Phil, I sang the Chuckle Brothers theme tune to the Neville brothers.\n\nI genuinely feel like I put them off their game. Without doubt they recognised the chant, as I was acknowledged while Gary took a throw-in. Phil, especially, played dreadfully.\n\nI'm not sure if Phil ever played on the right wing again. I do know that shortly after, he was shipped off to Everton. I would like to think that game alone didn't have anything to do with the decision to let him go.\n\nThank you for this opportunity.\n\nJosh\n\nBolton boo-boys\n\nAfter spending a season at Bolton Wanderers in their Championship relegation year, I'd like to apologise to David Wheater and Dorian Dervite for suggesting that the defence would have put up more of a fight had they stabbed a pair of upside-down broomsticks into the turf and hung shirts on them.\n\nHaving said that, they would have at least held a decent defensive line.\n\nCraig Thompson\n\nJeers for Jenko\n\nWanted to take the opportunity to apologise to one of my favourite Arsenal players, Carl Jenkinson. We love him because he's a fan and chose to have the same number as Kanu.\n\nI was at a League Cup match, Arsenal v Southampton, and I was sitting at the side where Jenko was having a poor game. Forgetting how close I was, I shouted, \"Jenko! Bloody play better!\"\n\nI did not realise quite how close I was and he looked up at me, visibly upset. Which made me feel terrible.\n\nWhat followed was Mathieu Debuchy getting rushed back from injury and getting hurt again, eventually leaving after very few Arsenal games, and Wenger saying to the press that Jenko has lost confidence (he then didn't play for Arsenal for two years).\n\nI feel so bad that I ruined potentially two players' Arsenal careers, and would like to apologise to Jenko and Debuchy. If nothing else it's nice to get it off my chest.\n\nHarry\n\nTwo faces\n\nMy apology is for Ben Garratt, who plays for Crewe Alexandra.\n\nOn 26 August 2017, I watched Port Vale lose to local rivals Crewe. I spent 90 minutes berating Ben, the Crewe 'keeper.\n\nAfter the game, I bumped into him in the car park. My reaction was to compliment him on his performance, have a photo with him and wish him well for the season.\n\nThis was a totally natural reaction after having spent the previous few hours screaming all sorts of expletives at him.\n\nEd (From Stoke but a Vale fan)\n\nTwo faces, part two\n\nIn the late 1990s (I'm now 41) I used to give the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Ben Roberts a really hard time from the stands.\n\nLater on that season I managed to go along for a few trial games for Middlesbrough. The goalkeeper in the two games I played was Ben Roberts. Being a central defender, I was in close proximity to Ben for all of the two games and I felt really guilty for having slagged him off from the terraces only a few weeks earlier as he was genuinely a nice lad and tried to help me out in the games.\n\nThe only opportunity I got to speak with him really after the game. So I found myself over compensating and being over friendly with Ben Roberts in the showers. Must have been a bit weird for him, as it was for me too.\n\nI didn't make it as a footballer. I'm now a civil engineer.\n\nAlan Robinson\n\nOuch for Crouch\n\nThis has been eating away at me for years. It was Old Trafford, England v Poland. We'd just qualified for Germany. Sven was in charge and Becks wasn't playing. The game was cracking. Lamps and Owen scored if I remember correctly.\n\nSomehow my friends and I were sitting pretty much next to Sven and the bench. So while everyone was watching the exciting game we noticed Sven getting ready to make his notorious, game killing substitutions. So we started shouting \"Noooo!\" and then \"Booo!\"\n\nUnfortunately the crowd around us caught on just as Peter was preparing to come on and suddenly everyone was booing Crouchy.\n\nI always felt guilty for starting the booing which was never intended to be aimed at Peter.

Sources said many Brexiteer MPs were likely to submit letters to the backbench 1922 Committee calling for her to go.\n\nIf 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) do this it would trigger a vote of no confidence.\n\nMeanwhile Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party -

Its code says admission authorities must make decisions on the basis of the circumstances of each case and in the best interests of the child.\n\nIn 2015 the UK government said it would amend the guidelines to ensure summer-born children could be admitted to reception at five if this is what their parents want, but the changes have yet to be made.\n\nThe school year is different in Scotland and runs from mid-August and the children in the school year are born between the beginning of March and the end of the following February. So children usually start school between 4.5 and 5.5 years old.\n\nBut parents of children born between mid-August and February can request to defer their child's entry to the following August.\n\nRequests for those born between mid-August and December are subject to approval by the local education authority; requests for children born in January and February are automatically approved. These children tend to be aged between 5.5 and 6 years old at the time they start school.\n\nChildren in Northern Ireland begin compulsory education earlier than children in the rest of the UK, at four years old. But if a child turns four between 2 July and 31 August of a given year, they will not begin compulsory education until the following September.\n\nA petition has been submitted to the Welsh assembly asking AMs to consider automatically to allow requests for children born between 1 April and 31 August to start reception a year later; or failing that, placing more emphasis on councils to fully consider requests.\n\nSome parents of summer-born and premature babies want their children to start formal schooling later as they fear there is an impact on the child's ability and confidence when they compare themselves with older classmates.\n\nThe Welsh Government said: \"Our school admissions code is clear that admission authorities should consider requests for admission outside the normal age group carefully.

They are also a natural laboratory, providing a unique setting in which to study cures for some of the world's deadliest diseases.\n\nA collection of 18 islands and 70 islets off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, the Bijagos are home to about 30,000 people with their own language and unique traditions.\n\nThey also teem with wildlife, including the rare saltwater hippopotamus and giant sea turtle, which thrive in this remote spot.\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nBut these tranquil islands are home to many serious illnesses and conditions. Life expectancy on Guinea-Bissau is about 60, and on the Bijagos Islands it is thought to be much lower.\n\nMalaria, a severe eye infection called trachoma, lymphatic filariasis - a chronic swelling sometimes known as elephantiasis - and intestinal worms are particular problems.\n\nHowever, the islands may also hold the secret to tackling the very diseases that blight them.\n\nA natural laboratory\n\nMedical researchers have been working on the Bijagos Islands for several years to see if they can get rid of certain diseases from certain islands.\n\nThe reason that the islands work so well as a natural laboratory is their remoteness.\n\nWhile this makes some everyday activities difficult, it is a helpful feature when trying to eradicate disease.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A boat in Bissau harbour preparing to make the journey to the Bijagos\n\nThe islands' separation by water creates a natural barrier. This allows us to compare different disease control methods, without the risk of cross-contamination between the test sites.\n\nOn the mainland, people can readily move in and out of trial areas, contaminating the sites and making it difficult to establish cause and effect.\n\nAn island set-up allows us to carefully and accurately measure the impact of any intervention made.\n\nWhile there are many archipelagos around the world, few have islands close enough together to allow us to work there, but far enough apart to minimise interference during experiments.\n\nThere are also few islands with this layout that are home to so many diseases.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nTrachoma\n\nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) initially focused on trachoma, an infectious disease that turns the eyelashes inwards. Affecting 1.9 million people globally, it is the world's leading cause of preventable blindness.\n\nTrachoma can be transmitted if contaminated hands, clothing or infected flies come into contact with the eyes. It is caused by a form of chlamydia bacterium and often spreads in crowded areas with inadequate sanitation.\n\nThe disease is found in 42 countries around the world, and at one point, there were some villages on the islands where every single child had the disease.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Dr Anna Last examining a patient for trachoma\n\nDr Anna Last from LSHTM identified high risk areas for trachoma, before treating entire communities with antibiotics to end the cycle of transmission.\n\nInner eyelid swabs, taken before and after the treatment, helped the researchers to detect the disease at an early stage. They are also being used to identify which genetic types of infection were present.\n\nThis might improve understanding of what happens after local elimination.\n\nIf the trachoma returns, we may be able to determine from its genetic strain whether it came from an outside source or re-emerged from within that community.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe results were striking. When she first began her work, 25% of people on the islands had the disease. Now, only 0.3% of people have it.\n\nNot only is this below the WHO threshold for elimination, meaning the disease is all but eradicated from the islands, but the techniques developed could now benefit the wider world.\n\nGetting to Bijagos\n\nOccasionally attracts intrepid explorers, but not a typical holiday destination\n\nGetting to the islands can be treacherous, particularly in the rainy season, when storms can come out of nowhere and cause large swells\n\nThe journey from the mainland takes at least five hours, on a small ferry packed with people and animals\n\nThere are few health centres, with the largest on the main island of Bubaque - medical supplies are limited\n\nWhile medical professionals provide the best care they can, remoteness and inaccessibility at times make this difficult\n\nMalaria\n\nTrachoma is not the only problem facing the people of the Bijagos and several other diseases on the islands are now being tackled.\n\nOur current focus is malaria. This disease is spread when female mosquitoes infected with a parasite bite a human, leading to initial symptoms such as fever and a headache before quickly becoming more severe. Malaria kills almost half a million people worldwide each year.\n\nGiven the prevalence of malaria on the islands - with up to one in four people infected - it is unsurprising we found mosquitoes that are very good at transmitting the disease.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Researchers from LSHTM leaving Rubane island following a mosquito survey\n\nWorryingly, we also found that some were resistant to insecticides.\n\nThis means the most common ways to control malaria - bed nets and spraying houses with insecticides - may not work, meaning an alternative strategy is needed.\n\nMore like this\n\nA new drug is about to be trialled, which is transferred to the mosquito via the victim's bloodstream when it bites.\n\nPast treatments have tended to target the malaria parasite within the human body. But this drug targets both the mosquito and the malaria parasite, shortening their lifespan.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Islander Ansulmani collecting mosquito larvae using the dipping method\n\nIn this trial, all the islands will be given the standard control tools, such as bed nets. Some, the \"intervention\" islands, will also be given the drug. Others, the \"control\" islands, will not.\n\nA team of local islanders have been trained in medical skills, such as taking blood samples and screening them for malaria.\n\nThey have also learned how to collect and identify mosquitoes, with the help of Ba, one of our field team hoping to become the first entomologist, or insect specialist, on the islands.\n\nImage copyright LSHTM Image caption Ba is studying to be an entomologist\n\nLooking to the future\n\nWhether this drug will get rid of malaria on the islands once and for all remains to be seen.\n\nEither way, the lessons learnt from our studies are likely to have an impact far beyond the remote Bijagos Islands.\n\nEvery study helps us to learn about the disease itself and how it is transmitted, which shapes future research.\n\nOn the islands, this can be done more quickly, with greater control and accuracy. We can see what the effects are in a defined area, reaching an entire population.\n\nThe LSHTM project will continue on the Bijagos for at least another five years, and in the meantime, its findings are likely to be used to tackle major diseases like malaria elsewhere.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

while his mum washed dishes in the campus canteen - that Prof Hedges realised the opportunities a degree could bring.\n\nFast-forward half a lifetime, and that young boy is now a leading academic, chairman of the department of statistics and professor of education at Northwestern University, Illinois.\n\nAt a ceremony in Hong Kong, Prof Hedges will receive this year's Yidan Prize for education research, worth $3.9m (\u00a33m), with half awarded as a cash prize and the rest to support his research into studying what really works in improving education.\n\nBeing the first in his family to go to university was \"life-changing\", says Prof Hedges.\n\nHe is \"passionate\" about others getting similar opportunities, but he says it's a \"hard question to answer\" whether today's youngsters have the same chance of social mobility.\n\nDoors still open?\n\n\"I think that there's still plenty of opportunity, but I'm not so sure that it's better than it was 30 years ago,\" he says.\n\nAs a child, when he spoke about going to university his mother would say: \"Well, that's a good ambition but I'm not sure people like us can do that.\"\n\nImage caption Prof Hedges has won a major prize for his work in education research\n\n\"When she talked about that, there was a consciousness of social class in her mind,\" he says.\n\nHe believes she was trying to spare him from \"getting slapped down for trying to step out of my place\".\n\nThe turning point was wandering around a college campus as his mother washed \"pots and pans\" in the cafeteria.\n\nHe walked through an open door into a chemistry lab and met a graduate student.\n\nThis was the first time in his life, Prof Hedges says, that he had \"a concrete idea of what it would be like to be a scientist, or to work in a university\".\n\nReaching out\n\nA good student, in 1970, at age 18, he won a prestigious Regents Scholarship to study mathematics and physics at the University of California at San Diego.\n\nA stint working on improving opportunities for disadvantaged students at the university followed, where he first discovered the field of education research.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIt is unlikely that disadvantaged students today would be exposed to the potential of a college education in the same way, he acknowledges.\n\nBut there are efforts to reach these youngsters.\n\n\"I think that things have changed a lot, and probably it would be harder to walk into that lab because there are probably now many more safety restrictions.\n\n\"On the other hand there are, at least in the US, more efforts to extend the reach of the university to places where university is unfamiliar.\"\n\n'Keys to opportunity'\n\nAt Northwestern there is an initiative which recruits 14 and 15 year olds from Chicago state schools with the aim of preparing and encouraging them to apply to US elite universities.\n\n\"One of the things that makes me happiest is that the universities themselves have been agents of change,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Northwestern University encourages applications from state schools in Chicago\n\n\"Rather than sitting in their own ivory towers and lamenting the fact that not many disadvantaged students seem to come to their university, most universities are trying to do things to reach out to those communities - and not just encourage people to come, but make it more likely that they'll be able to come.\"\n\nMany top US universities offer generous financial aid to students who would otherwise be unable to afford to attend, Prof Hedges says, although perception of cost is still a challenge.\n\nWould-be students also need the \"knowledge not only that going to college is a good thing, but that it makes a difference which college you go to\".\n\nProf Hedges says that while to some, \"going to the community college down the street may seem appealing\", attending a top university can give people \"a whole different range of opportunities\".\n\n\"For better or worse, the most elite universities are the keys to the most opportunity, at least in the US.\"\n\nProf Hedges says the long term \"holy grail\" is to figure out how to organise the education system and teach children so that they all excel at a high level.\n\n\"You can teach almost any child almost anything that the best students know, or are able to do.\n\n\"We know that it's possible to achieve excellence for all, we just don't know how to make it happen,\" he says.\n\nMore from Global education\n\nThe editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk).", "Image copyright EPA Image caption Most locals aren't exactly fans of the summitry\n\nPapua New Guinea (PNG) might be the least likely place to spot world leaders shaking hands. But that's exactly what's happening over the next few days.\n\nNotoriously dangerous Port Moresby is hosting the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit this week, and it's shaping up to be quite an unusual meeting.\n\nAmong the stranger features of the gathering: some of the thousands of delegates and media will be staying on cruise ships because of a lack of hotels, while a multinational security force has been assembled to keep the city safe.\n\nBut many locals have expressed frustration over millions of dollars spent on the gathering, including on luxury Maserati cars, at a time when the impoverished country faces many challenges.\n\nAll things considered there is intense anticipation about whether the Pacific country will be able to cope with such a huge international event.\n\nWhat should we expect?\n\nApec bundles 21 countries from both sides of the Pacific and there are big names on the PNG ticket: China's President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and US Vice President Mike Pence are all due to attend.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin will be missing, despite having attended last year's summit in Vietnam.\n\nOverall, the 21 countries' representatives - together with a host of business delegates - make up some 15,000 attendees in total.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Port Moresby is under tight security for the summit\n\nThat's a lot of people for a city of 300,000, roughly half of whom live in squatter settlements.\n\nPort Moresby is notoriously dangerous, known for rampant crime, corruption and street gangs.\n\nForeign journalists travelling to the summit are commonly warned by their local co-ordinators stick to a 1700 curfew. It's deemed to be too dangerous to be out after that time.\n\nInternational troops\n\nIt is no surprise then that in the run-up to the event, the summit's unlikely location has largely overshadowed news about the actual agenda.\n\nSo how does PNG plan to stage an event like this? With a little help from its friends. That's mostly Australia, the US and New Zealand.\n\nAll three countries have sent special forces to make sure that attendees will be safe.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Ships from Australia, New Zealand and the US are patrolling the waters\n\nThat means the place is swarming with foreign military and the harbour is packed with military vessels.\n\nAustralia has even sent a helicopter carrier, fighter jets and a surveillance aircraft.\n\nCruise ships turned hotels\n\nAccommodation is the next problem. How to house the thousands of delegates?\n\nIn addition to the city's hotels, there are three cruise liners moored in the harbour for delegates and the media to stay at, and they will also host some of the events.\n\nBut despite the security, that's still not safe enough for Vice President Pence. He will be staying in Cairns, Australia.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption How about this for a safe hotel option?\n\nIt's an 850km (520-mile) commute to the summit but apparently still deemed a better option than for Mr Pence to stay in the host city itself.\n\nWhy PNG?\n\nPort Moresby was ranked the fifth least liveable city in 2018 by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and the country is the poorest member of the Apec grouping.\n\nAbout 40% of the population are living on less than $1 a day, according to the UN, and in June the government declared a national public health emergency after an outbreak of polio.\n\nTake all this, add the security problem and you will probably wonder why PNG was chosen to host a summit of this level in the first place.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Local security will get massive international help\n\nThe decision was taken five years ago, at a time when the country was going through a boom period and things were looking up.\n\nBut in 2014, the price of oil collapsed by half, negatively affecting the energy sector and bringing economic momentum to a brutal halt. Yet the decision on the summit venue had already been made.\n\nOfficials in Port Moresby are quick to say the event will lift the country's international standing and bring in investment and trade deals, things that PNG dearly needs.\n\nBut that narrative has failed to convince many people in the country.\n\nImage copyright AirBridgeCargo Image caption Are 40 Maseratis simply standard for a global summit?\n\nAlready doubtful that the one-week summitry blitz was really a good idea, their scepticism wasn't exactly helped when the government bought some 40 luxury Maserati cars for the summit.\n\nFaced with a wave of criticism, authorities have defended the super cars, saying they will be sold again after the event and won't add to the bill.\n\nYet with each one coming with a price tag of more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000), many are wondering whether that money wouldn't have been better invested in one of the country's many more urgent problems.", "Image copyright SSA UK\n\nThe high cost of housing has helped to create a boom in self-storage with many people now renting self-storage units long term because their home is too small.\n\n\"It's a bit of a rip-off really,\" laughs Angela Andrew, talking about the \u00a3120 she pays a month for a self-storage unit in east London.\n\nIn the unit, which is packed to the roof with boxes and bags, she keeps her collection of records, costumes from her work as a performing artist and other stuff such as old gas heaters. The items may not have monetary value, but they have \"nostalgic value\", she says.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a hoarder, but I do see value in stuff.\"\n\nWhen she took out the space, Angela expected to keep it for a year, but she's now had it for two years and uses the unit to supplement her small living space.\n\n\"The amount of money I pay to sub-let plus this works out at a normal monthly rent,\" she says.\n\nImage caption Angela Andrew pays around \u00a3120 a month for this unit\n\nFor Angela, self-storage is about more than not being able to part with items, it has also given her some security. When she started using the unit she had no permanent living space and it was a way for her to keep all her things in one place.\n\n\"This little box is also my home,\" she says.\n\nAngela is not the only person willing to shell out for extra space to store her things.\n\nThere are now around 1,500 self-storage sites in the UK, with use of them up almost 9% last year on 2016, according to the most recent industry figures from the Self-Storage Association UK (SSA).\n\nImage copyright Everett Collection Inc / Alamy Stock Photo Image caption Cash stash: In Breaking Bad self-storage was used to hide the illicit gains from a crystal meth lab\n\nThe industry's reputation has been shaped by TV and films, where they're often used as a hiding place for a dead body or stolen goods.\n\nIn horror film Silence of the Lambs, serial killer Hannibal Lecter uses one to store a severed head, whilst in cult TV series Breaking Bad a unit was used to stash the illicit gains from a crystal meth lab. Even on the reality TV show Storage Hunters, snakes and a naked man have been stashed away in units.\n\nThe reality is much more prosaic. The contents of these giant warehouses, which loom over busy road junctions or are situated in industrial parks, are typically the mundane realities of day-to-day life - cooking equipment, spare mattresses, books or bikes.\n\nMost people turn to them at a significant junction in their lives - they've had a child, got married, separated or divorced, or they're moving house or redecorating and they need somewhere to store their stuff temporarily.\n\nBut for an increasing number of people, like Angela, self-storage has become a longer term option. Almost a third of customers have had their unit for over three years. And over a quarter of users (27%) say they use storage because there is no room for the items where they live.\n\nImage caption Self-storage is cheaper than renting or buying a larger home\n\nThe average household in the UK is 2.4 persons, larger than both Germany and France, yet we have the smallest average property size, making the UK population \"one of the most squeezed in Europe\", according to the SSA.\n\nSo it's not surprising that people are turning to self-storage, with it cheaper to rent extra space than it is to buy or rent a bigger home, says Rennie Schafer, chief executive of the SSA.\n\nA \"room away from home\" is how he describes it.\n\n\"People know their stuff is safe and with most self-storage units offering 24-hour access they can get to their goods whenever they want to.\"\n\nBut it's not cheap. Mr Schafer estimates \"as a very general guide\" that a 90-sq-ft unit, which would easily accommodate the contents of a three-bedroom house, would be around \u00a3150-\u00a3200 per month in London and \u00a3100-\u00a3150 per month in the North of England.\n\nImage copyright Attic Self Storage Image caption Frederic de Ryckman de Betz says he wishes he'd held on to more of his mother's things\n\nShouldn't people just get rid of things?\n\n\"It's human nature to hoard and keep things,\" says Frederic de Ryckman de Betz, the founder and owner of Attic Self Storage.\n\nHe says the number of \"lifestyle customers\" who are keeping storage long term are increasing.\n\n\"People might discover it when they move house, but once they move in and it's all nice and clean the last thing they want to do is clutter it all up, so they leave their stuff in storage.\"\n\n'I wish I'd kept more'\n\nMr De Ryckman de Betz discovered the industry when a relative died in Belgium and he had to deal with their belongings. He used it again when his mother died.\n\nHe only used self-storage temporarily, but now wishes he had kept the unit for longer.\n\nThis would have given him time to realise the emotional value of some of his mother's items, such as her collection of dresses from the 1960s, he says.\n\n\"When you experience a loss like that you're not in the right place to make those decisions. With the benefit of hindsight I wish I'd kept more.\"\n\nBut the fact that he struggled to find an available unit and that, when he did, the rent on it was put up twice in just 18 months made him realise it was an attractive industry.\n\n\"The more I looked into it, the more I realised it was a good sector, a growing business,\" he says.\n\nImage caption Julia Weiland rents a self-storage unit across the road from her office\n\nIt's not just individuals driving the self-storage boom.\n\nAround a quarter of self-storage users are small businesses, attracted by the fact they don't have to commit for a long period. Typically you can leave with just a month's notice and crucially you don't need to pay business rates on the premises.\n\nThey too often use self-storage to supplement more expensive office space.\n\nJulia Weiland runs a direct marketing agency specialising in events. She has an office across the road from the self-storage unit we meet at, but still rents a unit to store clients' props and samples.\n\n\"It's just much more convenient. We wouldn't be able to store the stuff for all our different clients in the office.\"\n\nShe is trying to grow the business and says eventually it will \"probably come to a point where it will make financial sense to have something a bit more permanent\".\n\nImage caption Gemma Martinez says she feels safe to visit late at night\n\nGemma Martinez uses two self-storage units to keep all her stock for her wholesale business Bonadea, which supplies high-end dining and tableware wholesale.\n\nShe initially considered a warehouse instead, but said self-storage offered more \"scalability\".\n\n\"I started with a small unit and then kept on growing. It would also work the other way around. If I needed to cut costs I could do so very quickly.\"\n\nEven if clients like Julia and Gemma move on, Mr de Ryckman de Betz is confident they will be easily replaced.\n\nHe points out that self-storage is hugely popular in the US despite the fact that people's homes tend to be larger.\n\n\"It's the great contradiction of self-storage to think that it's for people without enough space. The more space you have, the more you're going to keep,\" he says.", "Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The glucose monitoring device works via a sensor attached to the skin, allowing people to check their blood sugar levels\n\nWearable glucose monitors will be made available to tens of thousands more people with type 1 diabetes from April 2019, NHS England has announced.\n\nIts decision comes after an investigation found patients in some areas of the country were being denied access to the device.\n\nIt reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and helps people with diabetes to manage their condition.\n\nDiabetes charities called the change of policy a huge step forward.\n\nIn England, around 300,000 people have type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Freestyle Libre flash glucose monitoring system, used by Prime Minister Theresa May, who has the autoimmune condition, was made available on the NHS last November.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister's Freestyle Libre could be seen on her arm when she and her husband attended a dinner with President Trump in July\n\nBut recent research suggested only 3-5% of type 1 patients in England had access to the monitors on the NHS, when 20-25% were eligible.\n\nThis was because some local clinical commissioning groups decided not to prioritise funding of the devices.\n\nNHS England said the device would now be funded to allow access throughout the country in all 195 clinical commissioning groups, benefiting a target of about a quarter of people with type 1 diabetes.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe glucose monitoring device uses a tiny sensor inserted under the skin of the arm which is connected to a small transmitter patch on the surface of the skin.\n\nThe sensor reads blood sugar levels from fluid just beneath the skin and transmits them wirelessly to a display on a portable reader held near the sensor.\n\nThe technology reduces the need for finger-prick blood tests and can make it much easier for people with diabetes to manage their condition.\n\n'It's like swiping a contactless bank card'\n\nBBC journalist Lauren Turner has had type 1 diabetes for 14 years and has tried using a flash glucose monitor.\n\n\"I've used the Libre and compared to pricking my fingers (which I do about eight to 10 times a day), it's revolutionary,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm now waiting to find out when I can get it on prescription.\n\n\"It doesn't work for everyone -

She's fighting her ministers and Tory MPs on two fronts, it says.\n\nJames Forsyth, on the Spectator website, says the problem for Mrs May is that the pre-emptive attacks on the broad outline of the deal make it harder for her to emphasise the progress she has made.\n\nWriting in the FT, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson says the paradox intrinsic to Brexit is only now becoming clear: we can only secure continuity of frictionless trade by complying with the EU's rules but without a say in them once we have left.\n\n'How old, Grandpa?'\n\nImage copyright Chris Jackson/Clarence House\n\nMany of the papers carry photographs of the Prince of Wales among his extended family on his 70th birthday.\n\nThe Daily Mail captions the image of Prince Charles surrounded by his grandchildren: \"How old are you NOW, Grandpa?\"\n\nAs the Sun remarks in an editorial, while most men are thinking about kicking back a little at the age of 70, this is not an option for the Prince.

Why shouldn't they be accorded a proper burial?\"\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption In August, Herero women attended a service in Berlin which saw some Namibian skulls being returned\n\nA proper burial is what is on the mind of Mr Mboro.\n\nHe says that if he can return Mangi Meli's skull to Moshi in the north of Tanzania then he \"will feel at peace\" as the chief's dismembered body needs to be complete.\n\n\"They have to bring the remains back to the people who are still suffering from the loss,\" he adds.\n\nMr Mboro, who now lives in Berlin, comes from the same community as the executed chief and grew up on the stories of his bravery.\n\nHis grandmother told him how he remained defiant up to his death.\n\nMangi Meli was hanged with 18 other rebels but he took seven hours to die, which was seen as proof of how strong he was, Mr Mboro says.\n\n'Ignorance and resistance'\n\nIn 1977, when he was 27, Mr Mboro won a place to study civil engineering in Germany and he made a pledge to his grandmother.\n\n\"When I went to say goodbye to her she jumped up and went outside the hut to tell all the villagers to come,\" Mr Mboro remembers.\n\n\"She told them, 'You see my man is going to Germany and he will bring back the skull of Mangi Meli', and I had to promise.\"\n\nBut the village is still waiting.\n\nImage copyright Konradin Kunze Image caption The German East African newspaper announced the death of Mangi Meli in March 1900\n\nMr Mboro has spent the last four decades pushing the authorities to open up the archives and look into the collections of human remains.\n\nAt first it was ignorance rather than resistance that hampered the search, he says.\n\n\"Everyone I was asking said they didn't know anything about the history.\"\n\nBut eventually he discovered that Berlin's Charit\u00e9 institution held a collection of skulls, and in 2000 two experts were allowed to view them.\n\nThey found that there were at least 70 in the collection from Tanzania, but according to the records that were there none of them belonged to Mangi Meli.\n\nIt was this collection that was transferred to the SPK, which eventually opened up about the extent of the remains, but that was only after pressure from Mr Mboro and the campaign group he helped found, Berlin Postkolonial.\n\nInitially, the SPK only admitted that there were cultural objects and some human hair in its archive, Mr Mboro says.\n\n'Deliberate starvation'\n\nThe rebellion that Mangi Meli was involved in served as a precursor to the Maji Maji wars of resistance from 1905 to 1907. These were protests in southern Tanzania against German colonial exploitation, oppression, and forced cultivation of cotton.\n\nTens of thousands of people starved, died or fled their homes during the uprising.\n\nImage copyright SPK/Birgit Jobstl Image caption The collection of human remains are now kept in the archive of the SPK\n\nThis was part of a deliberate policy.\n\n\"As its last option, the Schutztruppe had to use the cooperation of hunger,\" the governor of German East Africa, Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen wrote.\n\n\"Burning down villages, fields and food supplies might seem barbaric to the distant observer. This method of warfare was not just the most promising one, but also the only practical one.\n\n\"According to me, military actions alone will be fruitless, only hunger and hardship will be able to force people into final submission.\"\n\nThe German action in Namibia - the forced expulsion of Herero and Nama people from their land - is more notorious and has been described as an attempted genocide. But its operations in East Africa also proved deadly.\n\nNamibian activists have been successful in getting the German authorities to return some of the skulls that were taken from their home. Those from Tanzania want the same for the remains from their country.\n\nDemands for the return of skulls taken during the colonial era are not exclusive to Germany. Human remains from Africa and other colonised continents were either sent home as trophies or sent to collectors and museums across Europe.\n\nMugabe's intervention\n\nIn the 19th Century the science of phrenology, that human characteristics can be determined by the shape of the skull, was very popular. Phrenological societies would collect skulls to help develop the theory, which for some extended to racial classification.\n\nListen to BBC World Service:\n\nSome researchers set out to show that skull shape indicated that people from different parts of the world were inherently inferior.\n\nIn the UK \"there was not quite the same call from British universities, medical offices and research centres as we see in the German case,\" says Jeremiah Garsha, who is researching the subject at Cambridge University.\n\nNevertheless, large numbers of skulls were sent to the UK but were more dispersed than in Germany, he adds.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The skulls taken from Namibia were shown at the church service before being sent home\n\nA study by South African historian Denver Webb into how the British behaved in South Africa showed that the colonists took skulls for both research purposes and as a way to dehumanise and suppress the vanquished.\n\nLondon's Natural History Museum has admitted that it holds an unknown number of remains from Africa, but it is yet to do an audit to figure out the extent of the collection or the origin of the bones.\n\nIt has established that there are 13 sets of remains from southern Africa, 11 of them from Zimbabwe, in its archive. The work on these remains began after former President Robert Mugabe said in 2015 that the museum held skulls of heroes of the country's first independence war from 1896-97, known as the First Chimurenga.\n\nBut the Natural History Museum says that none of the skulls in its collection date from that conflict. It does admit that there are three skulls taken in 1893 from a place associated with executions carried out by a Zimbabwean chief, Lobengula.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Skulls of victims were sent back to Germany for eugenics research\n\nAlthough some governments are taking an interest in having the remains returned from Europe, there has not been a public fuss made about getting them back. Mr Mugabe's intervention was perhaps the most notable, but that has not yet borne fruit.\n\nFor Mr Mboro and his hope that Mangi Meli's skull will turn up, the wait continues despite his government's interest in the return of human remains.\n\n\"The project concerning East African remains will be completed by the end of 2019,\" the SPK's lead researcher Bernhard Heeb says. After which discussions about repatriation can begin.\n\nBut for Mr Mboro this feels like yet another delay and he fears that he may never honour the pledge to his grandmother.", "Image copyright Lilly Singh Image caption Lilly Singh has gone from videos of tying turbans to global stardom on YouTube in a few years\n\nYouTuber Lilly Singh, also known as Superwoman, has announced she is taking a break from the video platform.\n\nThe Canadian-born content creator is stepping away from YouTube after eight years for her mental health.\n\nShe promised fans she will \"be back happier and healthier\" after her time off.\n\nA prolific and popular YouTuber, Ms Singh has over 14 million subscribers on her channels and is among the platform's highest earning stars.\n\n\"I am mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually exhausted,\" she said in a video posted on Monday night.\n\nThe comedian and actress said she was struggling with burnout after posting nonstop videos since 2010.\n\nMs Singh said she is not \"particularly proud\" with some of recent content and needs time to reflect the kinds of videos she wants to create.\n\n\"The thing about YouTube is, in all of its glory, it kind of is a machine and it makes creators believe that we have to pump out content consistently even at the cost of our health and our life and our mental happiness,\" she said.\n\nMs Singh said she is not permanently leaving the platform and is not sure of how long she will be away.\n\n\"I'm not making any rules.

The smoke from 2017's massive blazes had been swept across the country along the jet stream.\n\n\"These are levels that we would not smell. If you're actually smelling the fire, you're talking much higher levels,\" Mr Tesfaigzi adds.\n\nThe types of vegetation burning can affect exactly how harmful the plumes are. Smoke from pine trees, for example, may be carcinogenic and eucalyptus is particularly toxic to humans.\n\nOne study by researchers from several US universities, including Yale and Harvard, estimates that more than 82 million people in the western US will suffer \"significant\" health consequences from wildfire smoke in the next 20 years.\n\nMasks can help mitigate some of the dangers, but only certain kinds can keep out all the toxins, and some California communities are already experiencing a mask shortage, Kaiser Health reported.\n\nAccording to Mr Tesfaigzi, it is unclear what the lasting impacts of wildfire smoke are on healthy individuals, as those studies are still ongoing.\n\nImage copyright NOAA Image caption Satellite imagery showed plumes of smoke from the Camp Fire stretching across portions of Northern California\n\nWhat's the best way to escape a wildfire?\n\nOnce evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Kathleen Schori, information officer for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) told the BBC.\n\n\"But in those initial stages of a fire, you may have minutes,\" she added.\n\nFleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous.\n\n\"This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong,\" Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently.\n\n\"During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Environmental conditions in California in recent years have made wildfires deadlier\n\nHow do you fight a wildfire?\n\nSometimes, you do fight fire with fire.\n\nIn addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames.\n\nIntentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create \"firebreaks\" is another way to achieve the same.\n\n\"Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly,\" Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, told the BBC.\n\n\"The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains.\"\n\nMs Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve.\n\n\"There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving,\" she says.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paradise resident Sorrell Bobrink describes 'apocalyptic' scenes\n\nHow do wildfires start?\n\nOfficials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation.\n\nIn nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes or arson.\n\nAbout 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson.\n\nDetermining the cause of a wildfire can be a painstaking process.\n\nInvestigators search for a fire's point of origin by looking at how the fire spread - at the start, flames grow outward in a circle unless wind or terrain affects it otherwise, according to National Wildfire Coordinating Group's handbook.\n\nFrom there, officials comb through the area to determine if the blaze was of natural or human origin, looking for pieces of evidence like lightning scars on trees, campfire kindling, or cigarette butts.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cal Fire firefighters have been fighting the Camp Fire for days\n\nWhy are California fires so devastating?\n\nAccording to Prof Peterson, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has.\n\n\"The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so,\" he told the BBC. \"It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area.\"\n\nIn California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes.\n\nLast year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state.\n\nAnd straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says.\n\nKeeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate \"far beyond\" historical levels.\n\n\"When fires occur they can burn hotter,\" he says. \"These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Many Californians have had to abandon vehicles and escape the flames on foot\n\nHow do homeowners pay for the damage?\n\nSome of the hyper-wealthy may never see any damage in the first place.\n\nThis week, TMZ first reported that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West had a team of private firefighters protecting their cul-de-sac from the Woolsey Fire.\n\nThese firefighters for hire are usually affiliated with insurance companies like AIG and Chubb, which have special wildfire protection units.\n\nAccording to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California.\n\nDamage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found.\n\nIn California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan.\n\nFAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nMusic streaming powerhouse Spotify has launched its service across the Middle East, hoping to tap into millions of digitally-connected consumers.\n\nRumours about the service's launch had been circulating for months.\n\nSpotify will face stiff competition from rivals already in operation.\n\nExecutives from the company hope the service's launch could cut down on music piracy in the Middle East, but would not comment on how many new users they expect to enlist.\n\nThe service is already popular in the region with users who have accounts connected to other countries where it is already available.\n\nAbdallah Atlaee, 26, a project manager in the Abu Dhabi aviation industry said: \"I have already been using it for a long time with gift cards, so finally now I will be able to renew without gift cards.\"\n\nListeners in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and the Palestine territories will now be able to subscribe to Spotify's free, as well as paid premium services.

That content will be made available to users around the world.\n\nThe company will offer playlists currated for the Arab world, and listeners globally.\n\n\"So they will be even more accessible, and more easily accessible to also Arab diaspora or other customers who are interested in their music outside of the region, and maybe the next Despacito or other global hit might come from the Arab region - which would be quite exciting,\" Mr Krause said.\n\nIs this the first music-streaming service to launch in the Middle East?\n\nHardly, in some ways it's late to the party.\n\nAsked about this, Mr Boller said, that the company spends a lot of time researching both the infrastructure, but also local customs and culture ahead of any regional launch - allowing them to offer curated content for localised markets.\n\nBut, now that Spotify is launching across the Middle East, it will compete directly with regional and international power players who already have a foothold in the area.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Spotify launched on the New York stock market in April\n\nSpotify's chief rival Apple Music already operates in the region and is available to consumers in a number of countries across the region, according to their website. But with its launch this week, it will gain a leg up on YouTube Music Premium, a younger music streaming service that is not available in the Middle East.\n\nMeanwhile, it will face competition from France-based Deezer, which launched in the region in October. The service counts 14 million monthly active users globally in more than 180 countries.\n\nReuters reported in August that Deezer had signed an \"exclusive, long-term agreement\" with Rotana Records - a major Arab record company.\n\nAsked about whether this deal would make Spotify's existence in the Middle East difficult, Mr Boller said: \"We are trying to build out the catalogue. Right now, to be honest, we don't think it's a negative [disadvantage] for us because use there are so many young, fresh blood.\"\n\nAdditionally, local players, such as the Lebanon-based Anghami, which has been operating in the region since 2012, could prove to be stiff competition.\n\nAsked if he would sign up for the service, Sameh Darwish, 24, an architect from Damascus visiting Dubai, said, \"I don't think so... I'm not even sure what it is, but I have my own music apps that I'm used to.\"\n\nOther potential customers were more excited.\n\n\"I think I'll use it. It will probably gain popularity too, but it has competition,\" Youssef Rishmawy, 26, a doctor in the Sharja emirate of the UAE, said. \"Most people here use Anghami, which offers Arabic music too.\"\n\nIs launching in the Middle East a game changer for Spotify?\n\n\"The Middle East has nearly 400 million inhabitants, unlimited music streaming is an increasingly popular way of consuming music and I assume there is likely a pretty healthy amount of demand for Spotify in that area of the world,\" said Mr Wlodarczak.\n\nMr Wlodarczak added: \"While the Middle East is nice for Spotify the market that will really move the needle for them is India.\"\n\nSo why then is the Middle East important?\n\nThe Middle East represents tremendous growth potential for technology companies - especially those in the streaming content business.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report from GSMA, a mobile operator industry trade group, \"smartphone adoption continues to rise in the region (just under half of total connections were smartphones by mid-2017) and as more users come online, an increasing range of mobile services are being consumed, including video, social media, e-commerce and financial services.\"\n\nThe group predicts that connections of mobile broadband will increase from 50% to 69% between 2016 and 2020.\n\nThose mobile broadband connections, mean new users that streamers like Spotify can market to.\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nWill it be easy to get a foothold in the Middle East?\n\nThe region will present its challenges too - namely significant variation in who is connected to the mobile internet.\n\nAs GSMA points out, some 90% of the population of countries like Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE are mobile subscribers - making those countries \"among the most penetrated mobile countries in the world\". But poorer Arab states like Somalia, Comoros and Djibouti have mobile subscription rates below one-third of the population.\n\nTo combat some of the technical challenges that the region presents, Spotify is planning to stream it's content at a lower bitrate - allowing users on slower networks to access their service.\n\nWhat could it mean for music piracy?\n\nMusic and other entertainment piracy is rife across the Middle East.\n\nMr Krause, the Spotify executive, said he hoped that Spotify's free service could cut down on illegal content sharing.\n\nHe pointed to Latin America, where he claimed Spotify helped cut down on piracy and boosted the local music industry.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Morocco is one of 139 countries where the risk of contracting rabies is high, the government says\n\nA man who died after contracting rabies while on holiday has been named locally as Omar Zouhri.\n\nMr Zouhri, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, contracted the disease after being bitten by cat in Morocco.\n\nDr Tina Kenny, medical director of Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, confirmed that he passed away at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.\n\nShe said an internal review would be carried out \"given that deaths from rabies are so rare in this country\".\n\nIn a statement, Dr Kenny offered her \"sincere condolences\" to Mr Zouhri's family and urged them to \"get in touch\" if they had any \"concerns about the care they received at our hospital\".\n\nShe said Mr Zouhri attended Stoke Mandeville Hospital before being \"transferred to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford as the regional referral centre for infectious diseases\".\n\n\"Given that deaths from rabies are so rare in this country, we have already begun our own internal review of Mr Zouhri's care and understand that an inquest into his death will be opened in due course,\" she added.\n\nFive Britons became infected from rabies between 2000 and 2017 after \"animal exposures abroad\".\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the disease occurs in more than 150 countries and causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) reminded travellers to avoid touching animals in rabies-affected countries.\n\nWhat is rabies?\n\nImage copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Electron micrograph of the rabies virus\n\nInitial symptoms can include anxiety, headaches and fever\n\nAs the disease progresses, there may be hallucinations and respiratory failure\n\nSpasms of the muscles used for swallowing make it difficult for the patient to drink\n\nThe incubation period between being infected and showing symptoms is between three and 12 weeks\n\nIf you are bitten, scratched or licked by an animal you must wash the wound or site of exposure with plenty of soap and water and seek medical advice without delay\n\nOnce symptoms have developed, rabies is almost always fatal\n\nBefore symptoms develop, rabies can be treated with a course of vaccine -

At one stage there was even talk of an unlikely \"bromance\" between them.\n\nWhat about not going to the cemetery?\n\nMr Trump has been widely criticised on Twitter for failing to visit a US war cemetery at Belleau near Paris on Saturday because of rain.\n\nOne British MP, Sir Nicholas Soames, who is a grandson of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill, said he was unfit to be president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump tweeted his reasons and pointed out that he had attended Sunday's events despite the rain then too.", "Watch the five best shots from Kei Nishikori's \"embarrassing\" 6-0 6-1 defeat by Kevin Anderson in the ATP Finals at the O2 Arena in London.\n\nWATCH MORE: Watch: Five best shots as Zverev beats Cilic in straight sets", "Image copyright Philip Ramshaw Image caption The sculpture was targeted over the weekend\n\nA a newly-installed World War One memorial sculpture has been vandalised in Brechin.\n\nThe ceramic horse saddle was created to commemorate those who died in the war, as well as the eight million service animals which perished.\n\nOfficers said the incident took place some time over the weekend and had \"understandably angered the local community\".\n\nThe piece took artist Karen Elliot more than 100 hours to make.\n\nA crowdfunding campaign has been launched to have the sculpture cast in bronze to prevent damage in the future.", "Dinnage has worked for Discovery for the last 10 years\n\nSusanna Dinnage has been named as the new chief executive of the Premier League, replacing Richard Scudamore.\n\nDinnage joins from media organisation Discovery, where she was the global president of the Animal Planet channel.\n\nScudamore, 59, is stepping down next month after 19 years at the helm.\n\n\"I am excited at the prospect of taking on this fantastic role. The Premier League means so much to so many people,\" said Dinnage, who will begin her new job early in 2019.\n\n\"It represents the pinnacle of professional sport and the opportunity to lead such a dynamic and inspirational organisation is a great privilege.\n\n\"With the support of clubs and the team, I look forward to extending the success of the league for many years to come.\"\n\nDinnage will become just the third person to lead the Premier League, after Scudamore and his predecessor Rick Parry.\n\nPrior to joining Discovery in January 2009, Dinnage worked for 10 years at Channel Five and she started her career at MTV.\n\n\"We are very pleased to appoint such a capable leader to this important role,\" said Bruce Buck, Chelsea's chairman and chair of the Premier League's nominations committee.\n\n\"We had a very strong field, but Susanna was the outstanding choice given her track record in managing complex businesses through transformation and digital disruption.\n\n\"She is a leading figure in the broadcasting industry, a proven business executive and a great developer of people. She is ideally suited to the role and we are confident she will be able to take the Premier League on to new heights.\n\n\"Richard Scudamore, having provided exceptional stewardship for almost 20 years, will leave us at the end of the year in great shape and with an excellent executive team and board able to fully support Susanna.\"\n\nScudamore was the Premier League's executive chairman but the top-flight clubs had already agreed to split his role. The search for a non-executive chair will now begin, the league said.\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhen she takes up her role in the new year, Susanna Dinnage will become the most senior female leader in the world's major professional sports leagues. And because of the commercial wealth, global popularity and cultural influence of the Premier League, arguably the most powerful figure in British sport.\n\nAlthough she is a Fulham season-ticket holder, Dinnage does not have experience within the football industry, and some traditional match-going fans will worry that the appointment of a media executive reinforces the sense that professional football is in thrall to television.\n\nBut with sports audience habits shifting, a decrease in the value of the latest domestic TV rights deal, and new digital challengers emerging in the market, Dinnage's experience of tough negotiations at Discovery should also be useful.\n\nHowever, with the biggest clubs jostling for more of a share of overseas TV revenue, the task of emulating outgoing Richard Scudamore and keeping the cosmopolitan league's billionaire owners unified will be a challenging one.\n\nWith Brexit looming, relations with the FA and the government will be priorities, along with the regulation of agents, and reviewing the sport's close relationship with the gambling industry. And after the recent collapse of the sale of Wembley to Shahid Khan, many in the game will hope that Dinnage also persuades the clubs to invest more of their wealth towards grassroots facilities and player welfare at academies.", "England's all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney says he and the Football Association agreed it was \"right\" for him to make a farewell appearance at Wembley against the United States, adding that he hopes other players can have similar experiences in the future.\n\nWATCH MORE: Cole scores 'wonderful' volley at 2006 World Cup", "England's all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney says he and the Football Association agreed it was \"right\" for him to make a farewell appearance at Wembley against the United States, adding that he hopes other players can have similar experiences in the future.\n\nWATCH MORE: Cole scores 'wonderful' volley at 2006 World Cup", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Born Stanley Lieber in 1922, Lee was the former president of Marvel Comics\n\nThrough Spider-Man, the X-Men and many other characters, the late Stan Lee sought to make a positive and lasting difference.\n\nIt's difficult to envision what pop culture would be like without Stan Lee's prolific impact.\n\nAnd it's even more difficult to imagine there was a time Lee nearly quit the industry altogether.\n\nAfter spending more than 20 years working at Timely Comics, which would later evolve into the Marvel we know today, Lee had grown both frustrated and irritated with the public's perception of comic books.\n\n\"Nobody, outside of our own little circle, had a good word to say about comic books,\" Lee said in his 2002 memoir Excelsior.\n\n\"To the public at large, comics were at the very bottom of the cultural totem pole.\"\n\nOne day in the early 1960s, as Lee was planning to tell his boss he wanted to quit, he was tasked with creating a new superhero team in the vein of DC's Justice League of America.\n\nAfter being advised by his wife to experiment with stories he was more passionate about, he put the human in superhuman and started to give his heroes a flawed quality - something to make them more relatable to us mere mortals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The Fantastic Four revolutionised storytelling within comic books\n\nWhen jotting down ideas for the Fantastic Four, Lee conceived them as real, living people whose personal relationships would interest readers.\n\nTraditionally, comic books had very simple storylines. Fantastic Four, in contrast, honed in on the personalities of its heroes rather than solely focusing on their abilities.\n\n\"They were the kind of team I had been longing to write about,\" Lee said. \"Heroes who were less than perfect.\n\n\"Heroes who didn't always get along with each other, but heroes who could be counted on when the chips were down.\"\n\nThe Fantastic Four was published in November 1961 and the public loved the fresh approach, making the new series of books an overnight sensation.\n\nSoon after Lee created the Incredible Hulk and then Spider-Man, which went on to be one of the most successful characters in comic book history.\n\nMany critics attribute the latter's success to the in-depth characterisation of Peter Parker, as well as his personality quirks.\n\nPeter was the \"quintessential hard-luck kid\". Despite beating bad guys and protecting the city from danger, he still had trouble finding a date and keeping his acne at bay.\n\nLast summer, when images of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville circulated on social media, Lee responded with a powerful statement of his own.\n\n\"Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today,\" he wrote. \"As true today as it was in 1968.\"\n\nThe words he shared originally appeared in Stan's Soapbox, a column he wrote for Marvel that was published in the same year Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated.\n\nWhile celebrities engaging in politics through social media is seen as a new trend, Lee used his platform to fight prejudice.\n\nFrom The Fantastic Four to the X-Men, his heroes were outsiders who fight for a better society - no surprise given they were created during the height of the civil rights movement.\n\nX-Men has often been praised for its portrayal of mutant oppression and its reflection of the fight for civil rights. Fans have even compared Professor Xavier and Magneto's differing views to King and Malcolm X's respective ideologies.\n\n\"I always felt the X-Men, in a subtle way, often touched upon the subject of racism and inequality,\" Lee told the Washington Post in 2016.\n\nAlongside his long-time collaborator Jack Kirby, Lee also created Black Panther, the first black superhero to appear in comics.\n\nThis year's film version was praised for providing the representation many black audiences had been craving for, from children seeing what they could grow up to be, to women witnessing their hair and skin tones being celebrated on screen.\n\nOther fans praised the comic and film for its portrayal of fictional African nation Wakanda as the most technologically advanced country in the world.\n\nBlack Panther is now Marvel Studios' most successful release at the box office and has been tipped to win awards at next year's Oscars.\n\nImage copyright Marvel Studios 2018 Image caption Chadwick Boseman (second from left) with other stars from Black Panther\n\nThrough gaming tournaments she organises, Stephanie Nnesaga aims to eradicate the negative, \"nerdy\" stereotype that is often associated with comics.\n\nThe group she founded celebrates gaming, comics and anime and welcomes people from all walks of life to express their passions, without fear of being judged.\n\n\"Growing up as a black woman, I often read Marvel comics as an escape,\" she tells the BBC.\n\n\"Whenever I felt down, or wanted to be alone or wanted to get away from the worries of my world, I'd go straight into the comics.\n\n\"Stan created this unimaginable world and he inspired me to do what I want and not care what people said about reading comics. He made it cool and inspired me to create my own platform,\" she continues.\n\n\"Like me, Spider-Man was a nerd and wasn't popular. But he was given a chance to be greater at such an young age, and that was so amazing for me to read.\"\n\nStan Lee died on Monday at the age of 95. But his legacy will live on, not least due to the cameo appearances that were a much-loved feature of the films with which he was associated.\n\nIt is believed he may have left as many as six different cameos in the can before he died - a comforting thought for the many fans for whom he was as much a grandfather as a godfather.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It never got to a tribunal and, to be fair, the SRU resolved it and there are no hard feelings.\n\n\"It's the only year in the last seven that Glasgow haven't made the [Pro12/Pro14] play-offs, which may just be coincidence, but the feeling within the squad was quite aggravated towards the SRU at times.\n\n\"I think they felt the SRU were trying to do one over us. We disagreed that they had done it in the right manner. We believed we were right and it turns out we were.\"\n\nGlasgow failed to reach the Pro12 play-offs in 2017\n\nSwinson also cites the case of Scotland flanker Hardie as an example of where a players' association can be helpful.\n\nLast season, when Hardie was playing for Edinburgh, he was suspended by Scottish Rugby amid allegations of cocaine use. The Scotland flanker would return to play for the club but did not have his contract renewed in the summer and has since joined Newcastle.\n\n\"An independent and impartial spokesperson for the players as a whole and in individual cases surrounding discipline would be important,\" Swinson said.\n\n\"Particularly John Hardie's case. The outcome may not have been any different, but it would have been seen to have been done appropriately and fairly.\"\n\n'It would be useful to have an impartial service'\n\nAttempts have been made to form a Scottish players' union before, but the project has never got off the ground.\n\nPlayers' associations have long since been established in other leading rugby nations. England have had one since 1994 - the Rugby Players' Association - of which Swinson was a member during his time at Newcastle.\n\n\"If I ever needed help, I knew they had certain things in place and they were impartial,\" Swinson said.\n\n\"When I moved up to Scotland six years ago, I was told that really wasn't an issue and I really believed that for the first few years, that everything was going well.\n\n\"There have been a couple of incidents that have highlighted to the players that, although the SRU do generally care about us, it would be useful to have a service that we know is impartial and independent.\"\n\nSwinson, second right, says the case involving Hardie would have benefited from union involvement\n\n'This is not a confrontation'\n\nSwinson says Rugby Players Scotland has received \"great support\" from players such as Greig Laidlaw and Finn Russell, who play outside Scotland, as well as those based at home.\n\nRegistration papers for the new organisation have been lodged with Companies House and the next step is to work out a way to work alongside the governing body.\n\nScottish Rugby are thought to have been resistant to the idea of a players union in the past.\n\n\"We want to be taken seriously by the SRU, by our players and by the international rugby community and to achieve that, we have to be professional right from the start,\" Swinson said.\n\n\"It's not a confrontational situation, I want to work with the SRU. I want to make rugby better for Scotland, for the players that play it, and that in turn will be better for the rugby community in Scotland.\n\n\"If the SRU don't take it the way that I do, then I'll have to deal with that.\n\n\"There are a lot of things in the SRU that are going very well.

They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.\n\nSo they agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.\n\nThe backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\n\nThat will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.\n\nThe backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.\n\nBut this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.\n\nThe role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.\n\nMrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\nThey could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When will Brexit happen?\n\nWhat else is in the agreement?\n\nCommitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members\n\nA proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure\n\nA \"fair financial settlement\" from the UK - also known as the \u00a339bn \"divorce bill\"\n\nProtection for 3,000 \"geographical indications\" including Parma ham, feta cheese, champagne and Welsh lamb\n\nWho has resigned?\n\nDominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary on Thursday morning, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over \"fatal flaws\" in the draft agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU \"blackmail\".\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department.\n\nNorthern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it \"leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation\".\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.\n\nIs there going to be a leadership challenge?\n\nA number of Conservatives have said publicly that they have written letters to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee, made up of backbench MPs - saying they have no confidence in Mrs May's leadership.\n\nThese include the head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former minister John Whittingdale.\n\nParty rules say that if Sir Graham receives 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of MPs - it will trigger a vote of confidence.\n\nIf Mrs May wins that a secret ballot, she would be immune from another challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.\n\nSir Graham will not reveal the number of letters he receives until he gets to that magic number.\n\nAnd it is not yet clear how any of this will affect Brexit and the outcome of talks.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nAn emergency EU summit is due to be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.\n\nIt is difficult to see how the summit could go ahead if Theresa May loses a confidence vote in the next few days.\n\nIt is up to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 committee, to decide when such a vote will be held, once he has received the required 48 letters from Tory MPs demanding one, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.\n\nIf Mrs May loses she will continue to be prime minister until the leadership contest is over but she won't be allowed to take part in it.\n\nShe could opt to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.\n\nIn either circumstance, her version of Brexit, as set out in the withdrawal agreement and future relationship document, would be in doubt.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something \"extraordinary\" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.\n\nSebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor who currently holds the revolving EU presidency, told Die Presse: \"The next week will be intense, because of course it will be crucial if there is a majority for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister May. In any case, as the EU Presidency, we have made all the preparations to move forward swiftly.\"\n\nWhat about the Commons vote?\n\nIf Mrs May survives as PM she faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.\n\nAny vote is expected to take place around 7 December.\n\nMrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.\n\nIf Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.\n\nSome Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out.\n\nOn Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was \"no question\" of reopening talks.\n\nMrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, \"nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow\" and it would mean taking \"a path of deep and grave uncertainty\".\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

The service, sometimes referred to as \"the nation's law firm\", has also been hit by a series of cases that collapsed because of failures by the police and prosecutors to disclose critical evidence to the defence.\n\nAnd the number of people charged with rape in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in a decade.\n\nMr Hill, formerly the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, will need to boost the morale of his 6,000 staff as he gets his teeth into issues on which he and they will be judged.\n\nDisclosure\n\nDisclosure is the bedrock of our fair trial system. In every criminal trial, the prosecution must disclose any evidence gathered by the police investigation which either helps the defence case or weakens its own. If that fails, miscarriages of justice can occur, and for years there have been problems with disclosure.\n\nLast December, the rape case against Liam Allan collapsed when text messages were disclosed very late - three days into the trial - which proved his alleged victim had pestered him for \"casual sex\".\n\nIt was the first of a series of collapsed trials which led to reviews by the police and CPS, a National Disclosure Improvement Plan (NDIP), and, in July, a stinging report from the Justice Committee.\n\nThis found that, after six reports in six years from experts including judges and lawyers highlighting the problem, Max Hill's predecessor as DPP Alison Saunders had failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings.\n\nThe committee found that she was not hands-on enough and her approach permeated the CPS. This wasn't helped by CPS data which may have underestimated the number of cases stopped with disclosure errors - by around 90%.\n\nThe report made clear that disclosure failings are systemic and not limited to rape and sexual assault cases. CPS data showed 841 cases in 2017-18 were stopped due to disclosure, but the committee said it knew that was less than the true figure.\n\nIf disclosure goes wrong, innocent people can go to prison. Alison Saunders told the Justice Committee that that had happened.\n\nResponding to the Justice Committee report, she said: \"Getting disclosure right is a fundamental part of a fair criminal justice system. I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority.\"\n\nMax Hill is keen to be seen to be on top of the disclosure problems. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are committed at all levels in this organisation to making sure that these errors are driven down to an absolute minimum.\"\n\nImage copyright CPS Image caption Alison Saunders' tenure as DPP was a controversial one\n\nHowever, when asked if people were still in prison as a result of disclosure failures he said it was \"impossible to know\".\n\nIdentifying disclosure problems is the easy part, fixing them is hugely complex.\n\nThe NDIP has implemented a range of joint measures including:\n\nFurther training of police officers and prosecutors\n\nPublication of a national standard on disclosure\n\nA protocol on handling third-party material\n\nAn investigation of what technological tools might assist with the examination of the material\n\nStronger national and local leadership and oversight of the operation of the disclosure process\n\nHowever, the law has hit a real problem in terms of the sheer weight of digital evidence - described as a \"digital crater\" by the Justice Committee - which now plays a part in many criminal cases.\n\nA single mobile phone can generate upwards of 20,000 pages of evidence. The right skills and technology are needed to deal with the mass of evidence from electronic devices and that has huge resource implications.\n\nIt is likely that Max Hill will be making the case for greater resources here. He told the Today programme that in the lead-up to the next spending review \"we will be marshalling our arguments to say how stretched we are\".\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption Liam Allan's trial was halted after messages undermining the case were found\n\nCurrent efforts to address disclosure failures will address present and future cases.\n\nThere are also demands, most recently from outgoing chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission Richard Foster, for a targeted review of past cases where errors may have resulted in miscarriages of justice.\n\n\"In my view the only proper course now is for police and prosecutors to themselves initiate a targeted review of existing convictions, starting perhaps with those from police forces where we know from inspectorate work there are ongoing problems with the quality of their criminal investigative work,\" Mr Foster said in October.\n\nMax Hill says the CPS will look into any case \"where an issue arises\". However, a targeted review that looks at past cases would represent a challenge for the CPS.\n\nPublic confidence\n\nThe CPS must command public confidence. Max Hill believes that to build it people must understand the role of the CPS.\n\nHe is keen that the public realises that it doesn't investigate crime, or choose which cases it considers and is not there to secure a conviction in every case. Its job is to assess whether it is appropriate to present charges for the criminal courts to consider. They, and not the CPS, decide on guilt or innocence.\n\nPublic confidence will depend on CPS work being of the highest quality.\n\nMax Hill has identified a number of challenges, including the fact that the CPS is demand-led. It obeys Parliament by prosecuting the crimes passed into law, and it responds to changing trends in crime by dealing with every case.\n\nHe believes that has resource implications. In recent years, the CPS has had to respond to big shifts in the mix of cases presented to it by the police. There has been a significant increase in complex cases including child sex abuse, economic crime and terrorism.\n\nHowever, the new DPP accepts mistakes have been made, and says that the CPS is determined to learn from them.", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Video\n\nAn unnamed Member of Parliament has been accused of \"mocking\" the accent of a Welsh MP during a Commons debate.\n\nPlaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards said that during debate on the Budget on Monday, an MP from another party \"chose to make disparaging remarks about my accent\", saying such behaviour served to \"reinforce the privileged and exclusive perception of Westminster politics\".\n\nSpeaker John Bercow said \"personal mockery\" was wrong, and \"to many people it constitutes bullying\".\n\nHe also apologised for his own \"extraordinarily ineffective mimicry\" of Tory MP Ken Clarke.", "The final interview with the veteran American politician Senator Joe Tydings, with his vivid memories of working with the Kennedy dynasty - and his unhappy relationship with Donald Trump.

Put under the microscope, however, and they can appear a chaotic mess.\n\nPart of this is because \"national\" elections in the US are far from national. Every state has its own rules and systems, frequently with county-by-county variations. In many places the voting infrastructure is woefully underfunded, and the management of the process can be less than entirely competent.\n\nMost of the time, the system's warts go unnoticed. But in a close race, where the outcome isn't immediately clear, frustrations and concerns can bubble to the surface.\n\nSuch is the case in Florida, whose the recounting ordeal is turning into a full-employment plan for election lawyers.\n\nComplicating matters further, other states are expanding the use of mail-in balloting.

Thirty pupils were taken to hospital.\n\nSix alleged accomplices of those who were arrested are still being sought.\n\n'Heinous act'\n\nThe Ugandan Red Cross said its team had managed to break the padlocks using a hoe and rescue many of those trapped.\n\n\"We are happy to have managed to save many who escaped with burns but at least did not die,\" Irene Nakasiita, communications co-ordinator for the Uganda Red Cross Society told the BBC.\n\nShe urged schools to boost student safety by ensuring fire extinguishers were available, and that pupils knew how to use them.\n\nHenry Nsubuga, the headmaster, described the fire, which took hold in the early hours of Monday, as a \"heinous act\".\n\nGerald Karasira, a local councillor, said people living nearby desperately tried to put the fire out using sand, water and bricks but rescue efforts were complicated by the locked doors and heavy smoke inside the property.\n\n\"Had the firefighting truck been near within the district, maybe we would have saved lives and property,\" he is quoted as saying by New Vision newspaper.\n\nRakai district is located is about 192km (119 miles) south of Kampala, near the country's border with Tanzania.\n\nA number of senior government officials, including the education and security ministers, have been visiting the scene.\n\nDamage done by school dormitory fires is usually aggravated by overcrowding, which hampers rescue efforts, the BBC's Patience Atuhaire reports from the capital, Kampala.\n\nIn 2008, a dormitory fire at a primary school near Kampala killed 20 pupils.\n\nA wave of school fires followed shortly after that, but they have been fewer in recent years, our correspondent adds.", "Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault during the 2017 season, has joined the BBC team to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.\n\nMax Verstappen is showing exactly why he's tipped as a future champion at the moment.\n\nHis drive in Brazil was stunning yet again, and it comes off the back of his drives to second from 18th on the grid in the US Grand Prix, and of course his dominant win in Mexico.\n\nThe Dutchman has always been quick, but now he is cutting out his mistakes and racing with much better judgement than earlier in the year.\n\nHe would have had two wins on the bounce had it not been for one of the most brainless acts of driving I've seen in a long time in Formula 1, from Force India's Esteban Ocon.\n\nOcon is super-talented, and it's a real shame he's not going to be on the grid in 2019, but his collision with Verstappen put a real taint on his driving skill.\n\nHe's had his fair share of incidents, mainly with his team-mate, and that's been a focal point of his career - and one of the reported reasons Mercedes were reluctant to promote him to their team for next year was because they were worried about team harmony.\n\nHis move on Verstappen on Sunday was just plain wrong.\n\nThe moment Max Verstappen angrily confronts Esteban Ocon after the race\n\nOcon unlapping himself was pointless\n\nDrivers are allowed to unlap themselves in F1, but they have to do it cleanly.\n\nThe sporting regulations dictate total respect for the race leaders' battles - the rule that they can only see three blue flags before letting a leader by is a good example.\n\nIt should have been obvious to Ocon that he should not compromise the leaders' pace when at the back of the field by scrapping as he took advantage of a brief new-tyre performance peak.\n\nFor that reason, the FIA was right to give Ocon a 10-second stop-go penalty - he didn't just compromise the lead battle margin; he lost Verstappen a win by hitting him!\n\nHamilton was the man to profit from the clash to pick up yet another win, and, as you would expect, he was quick to defend Ocon after the race.\n\nOcon is a Mercedes young driver, has worked closely with Hamilton and probably will again next year.\n\nHamilton argued to Verstappen that \"you had more to lose than him\", and yes, of course, in hindsight Verstappen may have thought he should have let Ocon go through, or at least left the door open to him at Turn Two.\n\nBut Verstappen was also right when he said: \"You can't crash into the leader.\" And I'm sure Hamilton would have felt very differently if it was him having to defend and then getting turned around by a back marker.\n\nAny pass would have been short-lived\n\nIt's not like Verstappen was going slowly and significantly holding Ocon up. He was lapping pretty much as quickly as anybody else on track.\n\nOK, Ocon was briefly quicker. Midfielders can do that on fresh tyres. But after one or two quick laps, they have to get into their own race-management mode, saving a bit of tyres, fuel, energy on the battery, and their pace drops back to a more normal midfield level.\n\nHad Ocon passed Verstappen, he would have had to let him by again a lap or two later. That would have cost Verstappen time at a point in the race when Hamilton was just a couple of seconds back from him.\n\nWhen you have someone as successful as Hamilton fighting you for the win, you don't need to be messing around with a backmarker. It gives Hamilton a sniff of victory he shouldn't have.\n\nAs for Ocon, he was down in 14th place. His chances of even a single point were looking very slim. He was 10 seconds down on his team-mate Sergio Perez before they pitted, with two cars in between. Perez went on to claim that final point. It's hard to envisage Ocon would have beaten him.\n\nNot only that, but if Ocon was thinking of trying to catch Carlos Sainz's Renault in 13th a tiny bit quicker, tucking in behind the race leader was a more effective way to do it than battling with him before having to mess about letting him by again a couple of laps later.\n\nWorld champion Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win in Brazil\n\nMove showed no respect\n\nWould Ocon have pulled the same move on Hamilton? No chance.\n\nWould he have pulled the same move on Vettel? I doubt it.\n\nThis was a move of frustration from a man who was big rivals with Verstappen in the 2014 Formula 3 season. He beat Verstappen to the title, yet it is Verstappen who is having all the success in F1 right now, and Ocon who is almost certainly out of a seat at the end of the year.\n\nThe frustration must have built up and there was zero respect shown for his rival.\n\nHe wouldn't have pulled the move on Hamilton because of Mercedes politics. He absolutely knew it would compromise the race leader's race. If it was Hamilton, he would have just kept his head down behind him.\n\nWith Vettel, I think there would have been a level of respect for a four-time world champion, and one of the senior drivers.\n\nWith Verstappen, none of that applied. No respect. Just foolhardy driving.\n\nVerstappen deserved to win the grand prix. It was a thriller of a race and it is rare to see someone lead (or win) the race from fifth on the grid, having genuinely overtaken all of his rivals on the track.\n\nStrategy helped in his pass of Hamilton for the lead because he pitted later, but he passed the other Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas fair and square into Turn One, and he overtook both Ferraris without the help from DRS overtaking aid as well, which is great to see (Vettel also had DRS on Bottas when Verstappen passed him so the advantage was negated).\n\nPunishing Verstappen is silly\n\nVerstappen's reaction after the race was understandable. He was rightly livid. He saw Ocon before heading to the podium and pushed him three times.\n\nVerstappen picked up a two-day public service penalty from the FIA, which is silly.\n\nPeople want to see drivers' emotions. This is the stuff of legend. Nelson Piquet karate-kicked and punched Eliseo Salazar in Germany in 1982 for a similar incident. Ayrton Senna came swinging at Eddie Irvine in Japan in 1993, when Irvine had unlapped himself on the Brazilian and given a cocky response when Senna went to talk to him about it.\n\nVerstappen didn't physically harm Ocon. Sure, he pushed him a bit, but Ocon is a grown man. In a world where everyone claims the drivers' emotions and passions are being contained, Verstappen let it out and got punished for it.\n\nIf there was any legitimate threat to Ocon's wellbeing, then of course it would be unacceptable. But what Verstappen did was only the same as you usually get in football or rugby matches and is rarely punished. I can barely remember an incident when someone even got a yellow for a push.\n\nYet in F1, after one of the most controversial moments in recent times, it is deemed totally unacceptable.\n\nI've been in Verstappen's shoes. I was taken out by a back marker in my GP2 days in my home race at Silverstone.\n\nIt wasn't F1 and I wasn't leading the race, but the frustration is through the roof when something like that happens. I also confronted the aggressor after the race and let him know my thoughts in no uncertain terms.\n\nUnlike Max I didn't push him, but I did nonetheless pick up a hefty fine.\n\nSebastian Vettel was reprimanded after angrily driving off some weighing scales during Saturday's qualifying\n\nVettel's qualifying anger was understandable\n\nThere was another, unrelated, incident of passion in Brazil. Vettel picked up a reprimand and \u20ac25,000 (\u00a321,770) fine for driving off the weighing scales after being angered by being held back in second qualifying on Saturday with rain approaching.\n\nTo the outside world, this seems impetuous and, sure enough, everyone was quick to criticise Vettel for his outburst and actions. But the keyboard warriors sat in front of their TVs have no clue what it is like driving, under the helmet, in the heat of battle with millions at stake, and millions watching, quick to judge.\n\nI could completely see where Vettel was coming from and his former team-mate Daniel Ricciardo agreed. Time was critical with rain approaching, and he should never have been called to the weigh bridge, as he had not set a lap time.\n\nWhen everyone around was dawdling, paying no attention to the time pressures at play, that would be immensely frustrating. Vettel's qualifying nearly turned to disaster through no fault of his own. I've been there before and it's an agonising wait.\n\nThis is F1. This is sport. Passions run high. Let's not tame everything even further than it already is.

She added: \"This is the first time I'm showing the film, which was made in Inverness, to an Invernessian audience.\n\n\"I'm more nervous for this screening than any of the screenings I've done around the world.\n\n\"I hope that I've done the Invernessian people proud, and I hope that I've portrayed the place in a way that they approve of.\"\n\n'Authentically Scottish'\n\nShot on location in the Highlands and taking only three weeks to film, Gillan said it was one of the shortest but most intimate projects she had worked on.\n\nThe former Doctor Who companion said she hoped the film would start a conversation about the high suicide rates in the Highlands.\n\nShe added: \"Its really important that we start talking about this and raise awareness. Because this is something that needs to be talked about and I think the more freely it's talked about, the more people would feel comfortable to talk about the emotional states that they're in.\n\n\"Communication is key, you might not feel like you have anyone to talk to but you always do. You can reach out to anyone in your life or there are help lines you can call.\"\n\nImage copyright The Party's Just Beginning Image caption The Party's Just Beginning tackles the issue of suicide in the Highlands\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy actress said that although the movie tackles the serious topic of suicide, she chose to include humour as it was true to how people in the Highlands are.\n\nShe added: \"It's a very dark subject matter, so I definitely tried to make that story as authentic as possible. I wanted to portray Inverness in a way we haven't seen before.\n\n\"Something that is authentically Scottish is cracking jokes and laughing in the face of adversity, that's something we all do quite a lot and I wanted the genre of the film to feel Scottish.\"\n\nRon Williamson, the co-founder of Inverness charity Mikeysline, welcomed the focus Gillan's film has brought and spoke about suicide and depression in the Highlands.\n\nMr Williamson said: \"The Highlands have the highest rate per head of capita in the whole of the UK for suicide in young people under the age of 45.\n\n\"Raising awareness of suicide, depression and mental illness has become more and more important.\n\n\"We've got people in the film industry, television, we have entertainers we have sports people all coming out now and admitting and confessing to things that 12 years ago it would have been an admission, it would have been a confession... now it's just a simple fact.\"\n\nMikeysline is a charity that aims to help young people who are dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. It was founded three years ago after the sudden deaths of two friends, both of whom were from Inverness.\n\nImage caption Mikeysline is an Inverness charity set up to help people who are dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts\n\nThe charity released 20,000 beer mats on Friday, which have been given to licensed premises throughout the north and north east, with a message displayed on them which reads \"Is there a mate missing around this table... have you checked they're ok?\"\n\nMr Williamson added: \"We also know when our friend really isn't fine. We're not all doctors, we're not all psychiatrists, but we all do know our friends.\n\n\"Unusual behaviour of any kind, that can suddenly be someone who's down all the time and conversely that can be someone who's down for a few weeks who's suddenly elated. Spotting those signs is the way to help.\"\n\nMr Williamson said the problem is getting people to talk about their feelings and he hopes the new campaign will start a conversation about mental health and encourage others to reach out to their friends and family.\n\nAnd on the need to get people talking, Gillan said she found the showing of her film in different countries had underlined how universal this story is. \"Its not specific to Scotland... people are connecting with it and it's very moving to see that,\" she added.\n\n\"I think a lot of men don't think they can open up about their emotions and I really hope that maybe this film might help them do that. Again, communication really is key and this is a universal problem.\n\n\"It's not specific to the Highlands of Scotland, I think it happens in a lot more rural areas where people might have a sense of isolation and that's something we wanted to address through the movie.\"", "Image copyright Warner Bros Image caption Pikachu has thick fur in Pokemon Detective Pikachu\n\nPikachu has been the approachable face of the Pokemon franchise for more than 20 years, but a new film trailer has left some fans unsettled.\n\nThe preview for Pokemon Detective Pikachu shows the character covered in thick yellow fur, which some fans have called \"grotesque\" and \"disgusting\".\n\nWhile Pikachu has always been described as furry, it is the first time the character has been rendered in \"life-like\" 3D in an official capacity.\n\nMany fans liked the realistic fur.\n\nImage copyright The Pokemon Company/4Kids Entertainment Image caption Pikachu in the first video game, in early artwork and in the first appearance in the TV series\n\nImage copyright The Pokemon Company/Nintendo Image caption The forthcoming Let's Go Pikachu game shows Pikachu with a fringe\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Pikachu has been seen with a furry texture before\n\nPikachu appeared in the first Pokemon game, which was released in Japan in 1996.\n\nIt quickly became a global phenomenon and has become one of the best-selling entertainment franchises of all time.\n\nPikachu is an electric mouse and the animation series has previously showed the character with hair, albeit in a stylised and undefined way.\n\nThe new Warner Bros film is the first official movie to integrate Pokemon characters in real-world settings with actors.\n\nDeadpool actor Ryan Reynolds provides the voice for Pikachu, which has historically been voiced by Japanese actress Ikue Otani.\n\nWhile many fans questioned the hyper-realistic art style of the film, others pointed out that it reflected what Pokemon might look like in real life.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald and Melania Trump were in Paris to mark 100 years since the end of World War One\n\nThe French army appeared to poke fun at Donald Trump on Twitter, after the US president cancelled a visit to a World War One cemetery over poor weather.\n\n\"There's rain, but it's no problem,\" the army's account tweeted, with the hashtag #MondayMotivation.\n\nMr Trump was widely criticised for failing to visit the Aisne-Marne American cemetery before Armistice Day.\n\nThe French army later claimed the tweet was only meant to be about training.\n\n\"Thanks to our fans for sharing this,\" the follow-up post read, \"sorry to those who misinterpreted it, but there was no allusion to anything other than the usual activities of the soldiers of the army, which this morning took place in the rain!\"\n\nMr Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders has defended his decision to skip the memorial event last Saturday, saying visibility was too poor for his helicopter and he did not want to disrupt the Paris traffic with his motorcade.\n\nOn Monday, the White House also confirmed that the president would not be attending a remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery that day.\n\nThe president himself has since taken to twitter to launch a public defence of his actions.\n\n\"I suggested driving.

Yet.\n\nThat is a particularly surprising statistic since the bottom five teams have managed only seven wins between them all season, from a combined total of 60 games.\n\nSo, as we enter an international break often referred to as \"sacking season\", are we witnessing unusual restraint from Premier League clubs' owners?\n\nBucking the trend\n\nAfter 12 games of the 2017-18 campaign, Frank de Boer (Crystal Palace), Craig Shakespeare (Leicester), Ronald Koeman (Everton), Slaven Bilic (West Ham) and Tony Pulis (West Brom) had all paid the price for underwhelming starts to the season.\n\nWhile that might seem like a lot, it was not a record. In three other Premier League seasons there had been six sackings by the end of November.\n\nFactoring in pre-season managerial changes in the summer, four clubs did change their manager for the 2018-19 campaign: Chelsea, West Ham, Everton and Arsenal.\n\nIn each of the past three seasons there has been an overall total of 13 changes per campaign, while the lowest tally during the past decade came when just nine changes were made in 2009-10.\n\nWe could be on for a lower total this season.\n\nSome bookmakers are even offering odds of 50-1 on there being no Premier League managers sacked this campaign.\n\nBut a look at the results suggests that is highly unlikely...\n\nSides struggling - but managers surviving\n\nAt the bottom of the Premier League table, Southampton, Huddersfield and Fulham have each managed just one win.\n\nFulham, having spent over \u00a3100m on new players this summer, are bottom after conceding a league-high 31 goals.\n\nThey have managed five points from their 12 games, at an average of 0.42 points per match.\n\nOne place in the table above them, Huddersfield have seven points from 12 matches, at an average of 0.58 points per match.\n\nAnd above them, Cardiff, Southampton and Crystal Palace are averaging 0.66 points per match.\n\nOver the past five years, the lowest points-per-game average returned by a club who just stayed up, finishing fourth from bottom, is 0.94.\n\nIt suggests major improvements are required to survive - whether that is inspired by the existing managers or their replacements.\n\nAlthough, if results continue as they are, the magic 40-point mark for survival can be nearly halved. The struggling sides' current points returns mean 25 points could be enough to stay up.\n\n25!\n\nShould it be time to change?\n\nThe October and November international breaks are notoriously popular times for owners to make managerial changes. Enough time has passed for poor results to cause concern, but sufficient time remains to remedy the problems.\n\nAnd looking back at the past 10 Premier League seasons, in all but one instance where a club sacked a manager (or he resigned after poor performance) during October and November, their average points-per-game return increased over the remainder of the season.\n\nThat's 14 sackings/resignations during that two-month period, 13 with an ultimately positive impact.\n\nAnd interestingly, only one club that has sacked their manager in October or November during the past decade has gone on to finish lower than their position at the time of the dismissal - West Brom last season.\n\nManager sacked Replaced by Club Season Position at time of sacking Position at end of season Juande Ramos Harry Redknapp Tottenham 2008-09 20th 8th Paul Hart Avram Grant Portsmouth 2009-10 20th 20th Steve Bruce Martin O'Neill Sunderland 2011-12 16th 13th Roberto Di Matteo Rafael Benitez Chelsea 2012-13 3rd 3rd Mark Hughes Harry Redknapp QPR 2012-13 20th 20th Ian Holloway Tony Pulis Crystal Palace 2013-14 19th 11th Brendan Rodgers Jurgen Klopp Liverpool 2015-16 10th 8th Dick Advocaat Sam Allardyce Sunderland 2015-16 19th 17th Tim Sherwood Remi Garde Aston Villa 2015-16 20th 20th Francesco Guidolin Paul Clement Swansea 2016-17 17th 15th Craig Shakespeare Claude Puel Leicester 2017-18 18th 9th Ronald Koeman Sam Allardyce Everton 2017-18 18th 8th Slaven Bilic David Moyes West Ham 2017-18 18th 13th Tony Pulis Alan Pardew West Brom 2017-18 17th 20th\n\nThey are statistics that suggest making a change works.

I then found they were essentially the same in the eyes of the law.\"\n\nWhat is the argument against not proven?\n\nAlmost three years ago, Holyrood's justice committee concluded Scotland's not proven verdict was on \"borrowed time\" and may not serve any useful purpose.\n\nThe justice committee heard evidence that there was no legal difference between a not guilty and not proven verdict.\n\nBut it was told that not proven could carry a stigma for an accused person, as well as failing to provide the necessary closure for victims.\n\nIts report said the verdict could lead to the \"effective defamation\" of the accused where the public believes the not proven verdict implies they \"got away with it\".\n\nThe verdict was also said to be \"deeply unsatisfactory\" for alleged victims.\n\nThe new campaign to get rid of the not proven verdict is being launched by Rape Crisis and Miss M and is backed by organisations including Scottish Women's Aid.\n\nImage caption Sandy Brindley said the not proven verdict is used disproportionately in rape cases\n\nSandy Brindley of Rape Crisis Scotland, told the BBC that some see the not proven verdict as somehow \"less painful\" for those accusing rape than a not guilty verdict.\n\nShe said the reality was that it was \"devastating\".\n\nMs Brindley said: \"What we know is that the not proven verdict is used disproportionately in rape cases and it has the exact same impact as not guilty in terms of acquitting the accused but our concern is that it gives an easy out for juries in rape trials.\"\n\nThis is not the first time families and victims have campaigned against this distinctly Scottish and historical verdict but this time campaigners say they hope it will be different because it is being looked at in research commissioned by the Scottish government.\n\nThe research by Glasgow University is expected to report back in autumn 2019.\n\nWhat happened to previous campaigns?\n\nImage caption The body of Amanda Duffy was found on waste ground in Hamilton in 1992\n\nJoe Duffy has fought for decades to try to get rid of the verdict.\n\nHis daughter Amanda was murdered 26 years ago.\n\nHe told the BBC that at the time it had been a shock to find out not proven had the same effect as not guilty.\n\n\"I was like most of the public at large just now, I did not realise it did not mean anything,\" he said.\n\n\"I actually thought it meant if there was more evidence you could bring somebody back to trial.\n\n\"To discover it was a full acquittal was a shock to me to be honest.\"\n\nImage caption Joe Duffy said he was shocked to find not proven meant acquittal\n\nHe said: \"The not proven verdict is a total enigma.\"\n\n\"It's a verdict that doesn't mean anything.\n\n\"Why can the defence get a two-to-one chance of getting someone off? That is exactly what it is - a complete nonsense. It is outdated and outmoded and needs to go.\"\n\nWhat is the argument in favour of not proven?\n\nImage caption Brian McConnachie QC said juries understood what the verdicts meant\n\nBrian McConnachie QC, a former president of the Criminal Bar Association, said juries understood the fact there were two acquittal verdicts in Scotland.\n\n\"The choice between them is simply a way of them indicating to the court which they feel best represents their verdict in the case,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it is an easy out at all.\"\n\nMr McConnachie said that if not proven did not exist then juries would find people not guilty.\n\n\"If they choose not proven rather than not guilty it reflects the fact simply that they are not satisfied the prosecution have proved their case,\" he said.\n\nImage caption Advocate Derek Ogg said the verdicts should be proven and not proven\n\nQC and advocate Derek Ogg told BBC Scotland he did not believe the current system was \"demonstrably broken\" so he did not see the need to fix it.\n\nHe said he saw no reason to change it but \"given a blank sheet\" he would prefer verdicts of proven and not proven, dropping the not guilty verdict.\n\nMr Ogg said juries in criminal cases were asked whether a charge was \"proved beyond reasonable doubt\".\n\nHe said: \"That really focuses what the jury's job is.\n\n\"It asks 'has the evidence in the court made it sure and certain that this crime occurred?'.\n\n\"If we are not sure it is only right that the citizen who is on trial gets the benefit of the doubt and the verdict is not proven.\n\n\"Proven and not proven are the two logical verdicts.\"\n\nIn 2016, Douglas Thomson, of the Law Society's Criminal Law Committee, also said it was more logical to drop not guilty.\n\nBut, he said, the difficulty with dropping the not guilty verdict is that it is the \"appropriate verdict of acquittal\" recognised across the rest of the English-speaking world.\n\nHow often is not proven used?\n\nThe vast majority of criminal cases end in a guilty verdict.\n\nOf the 32,540 crimes that came to court in 2016-17 just 2,257 resulted in acquittal.\n\nAbout one in five (21.5%) of acquittal verdicts were not proven.\n\nThe rate varied for different crimes with not proven verdicts being returned most often in homicides and attempted murder cases, where about 30% of acquittals were not proven.\n\nIn rape and attempted rape cases the conviction rate is much lower than the average, with more than half of cases resulting in an acquittal.\n\nIn 2016-17 there were 107 not guilty verdicts in rape cases and 42 not proven (about 28.2% of acquittals).\n\nThe number of not proven verdicts has risen over the past five years, but not as much as not guilty verdicts.\n\nWhy does Scotland have not proven?\n\nImage caption Prof James Chalmers is leading the research into the use of the not proven verdict\n\nProf James Chalmers, who is leading the research into the use of the not proven verdict, published a blog post last year looking at its history.\n\nHe states that there is a common misconception the not guilty verdict was a later addition to the proven and not proven outcomes.\n\nProf Chalmers cites Ian Willock's The Origins and Development of the Jury in Scotland as an authoritative history.\n\nWillocks says that the not proven verdict was a \"pure historical accident\" rather than a \"manifestation of the genius of Scottish criminal jurisprudence\".\n\nProf Chalmers, regius professor of law at the University of Glasgow, says Scotland's early courts used a large variety of terms for guilt and innocence.\n\nAs the court system developed in the 17th Century the practice became that the jury merely found each of the charges proven or not proven and it was up to the judge to decide on guilt.\n\nWillocks says that it was not until the 1728 trial of Carnegie of Finhaven that the jury's right to return a verdict of not guilty \"was emphatically re-established\".\n\nHowever, \"not proven\" had become something of a legal fixture, and juries continued to use it alongside \"guilty\" and \"not guilty\".\n\nProf Chalmers says not only is the verdict of \"not proven\" not Scots law's original verdict of acquittal but today's \"not proven\" is used for a very different purpose from that for which it was introduced.\n\nWhat does the Scottish government say?\n\nA Scottish government spokesman said: \"Lord Bonomy's Post-Corroboration safeguards review recommended that research be undertaken to better understand the dynamics of jury decision-making in Scotland's jury system.\n\n\"Ministers agree with Lord Bonomy that key components of the jury system - including the three verdicts, the simple majority required for conviction and the size of the jury - are inextricably linked.\n\n\"Any changes to Scotland's jury system, including the 'not proven' verdict, would best be made on an informed basis, so ministers will await the findings of the independent jury research before considering further.\"", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many parents carry wipes for convenient cleaning\n\nAll wet wipes sold as \"flushable\" in the UK have so far failed the water industry's disintegration tests, the BBC has found.\n\nWater companies say wet wipes don't break down and are causing blockages which cost millions to put right.\n\nManufacturers insist their test is adequate and say sewer blockages are caused by people putting non-flushable wipes down the toilet.\n\nWet wipes are sold for everything from make-up removal to surface cleaning.\n\nMost importantly when it comes to flushability, they're available as moist toilet tissue.\n\nThe government has said it is working with manufacturers and water companies to develop a product that does not contain plastic and can be safely flushed.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How to break your wet-wipe addiction\n\nThe sticking point comes over what you count as \"flushable\".\n\nWet wipes will flush - in that they will disappear down the U-bend of your toilet. The problem is what happens to them next.\n\nWet wipes are behind up to 80% of blockages in UK sewers, a key element of the infamous giant obstacles known as fatbergs, according to water companies.\n\nThey say it costs \u00a3100m a year to deal with them.\n\nSkips full of wipes are caught by the filters at water treatment works and end up in landfill.\n\nFrom their treatment sites across the North West, United Utilities collect around 12,000 tonnes of wipes and other rubbish every year.\n\nImage caption Wet wipes causing a blockage at a house on the outskirts of Manchester\n\nTony Griffiths, from United Utilities, said: \"It's extremely frustrating.

They also test new products still in development, and have found some wipes which do break down - but none of these are yet available on the UK market.\n\nThe manufacturers use a different test. It is more vigorous, and means that wipes break up more quickly.\n\nSome water industry experts likened this to putting the wipes in a washing machine, and said it didn't realistically reflect what happened in the sewers.\n\nImage caption There are many brands of wet wipes available, but only some of them are marketed as 'flushable'\n\nBut the manufacturers insisted their test was adequate, and believed that wipes marked \"flushable\" weren't the problem.\n\nLast year, the government asked the manufacturers and water companies to agree a flushable standard.\n\nBut these efforts have failed, leaving the water companies to insist that only three 'Ps' should go down the toilet: pee, poo and paper.\n\nHear more on Costing The Earth on BBC Radio 4 on 13 November at 15:30 BST, repeated on 14 November at 21:00.", "Video\n\nThis video has been removed for right reasons.\n\nStan Lee, creator of some of comics books' most enduring characters and the former president of Marvel Comics, has died aged 95.\n\nLee created The Fantastic Four, Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk and X-Men among others.\n\nIn its heyday, Marvel sold 50 million copies a year.

Last week there were Senate contests in eight key presidential battleground states - Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida and Virginia. Democrats have won every one except Florida.\n\nAnd the significance of the Arizona victory is also notable. Of the five seats that have changed hands, Arizona is the only one that flipped away from the party that carried it in 2016.\n\nTime will tell whether the 2018 results indicate a new baseline for Democrats or a high-water mark. By limiting the damage in what could have been a devastating election for its Senate contingent, however, the party is much better positioned to challenge for control of the chamber in the coming years.", "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Irish foreign minister spoke to chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier ahead of an EU meeting\n\n\"Clearly this is a very important week for Brexit negotiations,\" Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Monday after a meeting of EU ministers.\n\n\"But the issues aren't new.\"\n\nIt was a sentence he could have uttered almost every week for the past few months.\n\nSo why is this any different?\n\nIt's because the EU and UK negotiating teams really do appear to be quite close now to a deal on a withdrawal agreement.\n\nBut the last few points are always the most difficult to resolve and the politics remain highly unpredictable.\n\nSpecial summit\n\nIf there is to be a special EU summit to finalise a Brexit withdrawal deal before the end of this month, then agreement at official level needs to happen in the next couple of days.\n\nNot only does an agreement have to pass muster within Theresa May's cabinet, it also needs to be sent to the capitals of the other 27 EU member states for line-by-line perusal.\n\nAt the moment, the negotiations are taking place in what's been called \"The Tunnel\" in Brussels - meaning that little information is being passed on, to ensure that little information leaks out.\n\nBut every country is going to want to take several days to make sure they can accept any final text.\n\nIn particular, there are legal issues to overcome relating to the terms on which any temporary UK customs union with the EU could be brought to an end.\n\nEU countries will also want to ensure that a temporary customs union doesn't give the UK an unfair trading advantage.\n\nIn other words, it is not just in London that searching questions will be asked.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nDecember deal\n\nIf it doesn't prove possible to get a tentative deal finalised in the next couple of days, that's not the end of the story. Attention will then shift to the next date in the diary - a regular EU summit scheduled to take place in mid-December.\n\nOn both sides, though, there are warnings that there will be a price to pay if negotiations last much longer. A lot more money will soon have to be spent - by both governments and businesses - to put contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit into practice.\n\nUntil any withdrawal agreement is turned into a legally binding treaty, everyone will have to get ready for no deal, just in case.\n\nAnd that will take time and money.\n\nThat's one of the reasons why the UK government is keen to get a withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament as soon as possible - ideally before Christmas.\n\nThe numbers in the House of Commons, though, are too close to call.\n\nAs for ratification on the EU side, the European Parliament says it will need six to eight weeks to complete the process. And it plans to vote on the issue in mid-March, just a couple of weeks before the UK is due to leave.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nJanuary deadline\n\nAnd what if the negotiations run into the sand and even by the time the December summit takes place there is no text for EU leaders to approve?\n\nIn those circumstances, Christmas might not be the season of goodwill for those directly involved in the negotiations.\n\nBut the next key date is 21 January. If there is no agreement by then, the UK government will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps it plans to take.\n\nWhether or how MPs would be able to have a meaningful say in the process at that stage, possibly even trying to delay or stop Brexit, is the subject of considerable political debate.\n\nBut after the end of January it would probably be too late to get a withdrawal agreement ratified before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The government would not only have to win a \"meaningful vote\" on its deal with the EU in Parliament, it would also have to pass legislation giving the withdrawal agreement effect in UK law.\n\nOne possibility is that the two-year Article 50 period (named after Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the terms on which a member state leaves the EU) could be extended.\n\nIn theory, that could happen if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agree.\n\nBut the government has already said it has no intention of asking for an extension of Article 50 and other countries would certainly not want to agree to anything open-ended - a few weeks at most, unless UK politics takes a sudden and unexpected turn.\n\nThat is a reminder that there is, of course, an alternative timeline.\n\nIf parliament did vote against a deal brought forward by the prime minister, the UK would be faced with several alternatives.\n\nEither it could accelerate contingency plans and leave with no deal at all.\n\nOr it could change course and request an extension of Article 50 to allow for one of several possible options:\n\nParliament could instruct the government to go back to Brussels to renegotiate.\n\nA general election could be called.\n\nAnother Brexit referendum could take place.\n\nIt's all uncharted territory and that is why the next few days feel so critical.\n\nWe've been talking about the cliche of the Article 50 clock ticking for more than 18 months.

Free entry came as another post-Strictly perk.\n\nAnd Joe's Twitter and Instagram pages give testament to a butterfly schedule of basically just having fun.\n\nYet the invitations offering fantastic acting work have been less forthcoming. The few approaches Joe's had over the last year just \"have not been right\", he says.\n\n\"Admittedly, Strictly didn't have the massive impact on my career that I thought it might,\" he adds. \"Maybe it's one of those slow-burners.

But it makes you realise we're capable of so much more than we think.\n\n\"And it was brilliant, not just the winning. Even finding the ability to do the dances to any kind of good standard gives a real sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nMaybe his success had something to do with his remedy for dealing with anxiety and exhaustion: power naps. He even has his own special triangular Thai fold-up bed in his dressing rooms.\n\n\"I love my naps.

The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to families with autistic children who are struggling to cope with their violent outbursts.\n\nJamie punches his mum and spits in her face while she cries, in footage captured on a tablet.\n\nThe seven-year-old has a rare form of autism called pathological demand avoidance (PDA), meaning a simple request to do something can lead to a violent meltdown lasting for hours.\n\nThe behaviour is not the fault of the children with PDA, as it is the condition that prompts them to behave this way. In some cases, they do not know what they are doing.\n\nIn the incident captured on video, Jamie is stressed as he does not want to go to school.\n\n\"I get very, very, mad and smash stuff,\" he says.\n\nHis mum, Kate, from Bury St Edmunds - whose surname we are not using - says during violent episodes, he smashes up the house and has tried to attack her with knives.\n\nImage copyright Family photo Image caption Jamie's parents say they are struggling to cope with his outbursts\n\nShe finds the video footage traumatic and hard to explain.\n\n\"Part of me can't believe that is my child, because we have really good times,\" she says. \"My main concern is he is a risk to himself when he gets like that.

According to Prof Godfray he was \"explicitly asked\" not to look at the effectiveness of the current culls.\n\nInstead Prof Godfray and his team drew on the results of the Randomised Badger Control Trials carried out between 1998 and 2007.\n\nNatural boundaries\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The science behind the badger cull was established in 1990s\n\nThese showed that culling tended to increase TB in badgers because of increased movement.\n\nIt did, however, find that a reduction of between 12% and 16% in the rate of new cases of cattle TB was theoretically possible, but with significant caveats: the culling had to be carried out over a large area with natural boundaries for between eight to twelve days each year for four years and that more than 70% of badgers had to be killed.\n\nSince culling began in 2013, scientists and campaigners have expressed concerns that the culls that have been rolled out by Defra have not been in accordance with the strict criteria set out by the expert group because they have proved too expensive or too difficult.\n\nThey say that improperly conducted trials could actually increase cattle TB rates.\n\nBut Prof Godfray notes that, in principle, culling is one of the tools ministers have at their disposal and it should be up to them whether its marginal benefit was worthwhile.\n\n\"We conclude that culling does have an effect on the disease. The phrase we use is 'a real but modest effect',\" he said.\n\n\"If nothing else is involved then one would obviously cull, because if one does not cull one is throwing away one of the tools. But of course there are many other factors involved.\"\n\nAnother argument Prof Godfray puts forward in favour of culling is that it makes affected farmers more amenable to carry out unpopular and costly disease control measures on their farms and in transporting their cattle.\n\n\"It is likely that the farming industry would be more willing to accept other interventions that could negatively affect dairy and beef profitability if they believed that the threat of transmission from badgers was being robustly addressed,\" he said.\n\nThe report warns however that continued culling \"would not be acceptable to some (possibly large) sections of the public, and the costs of policing could be substantial\" and says that a shift away from culling is \"highly desirable\".\n\nSpecifically, it emphasises the need for a proper evaluation of badger vaccination.\n\nTesting regime\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Cattle herds are checked for the presence of TB with a skin test\n\nProf Godfray's report also states that infections from cattle to cattle is higher than had been thought, possibly because the current so called skin test used to test for the disease is less reliable than experts once believed.

It makes no mention of more recent data, which have suggested incidence might be falling in two areas but rising in a third.\"\n\nProf Lord John Krebs from Oxford University, who led the Randomised Badger Control Trials, said that the report indicated that Defra and farmers need to do more if cattle TB is to be stamped out.\n\n\"Currently, much of the spread of TB in cattle arises from a combination of disappointingly low uptake of measures to prevent cattle coming into contact with badgers, trading of infected cattle, and the low sensitivity of the standard skin test for TB, which means that there is likely to be a hidden reservoir of infection in many cattle herds in high risk areas,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless the government and the farming industry tackle these problems now, TB will not be eradicated or controlled.\"\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "Sorry, this episode is not currently available", "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People in Manchester explain why \"freakshakes\" hold such appeal\n\nThe campaign group Action on Sugar is demanding a ban on freakshakes and all milkshakes with more than 300 calories.\n\nIt surveyed milkshakes sold in restaurants and fast food shops in the UK and found they contained \"grotesque levels of sugar and calories\".\n\nFreakshakes are milkshakes that also contain chocolates, sweets, cake, cream and sauce.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake came top of the survey with 39 teaspoons of sugar or 1,280 calories.\n\nThat is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds.\n\nIn terms of sugar, it is the equivalent of drinking more than five cans of cola.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation calculates an average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories.\n\nThe researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult.\n\nThey say that of the 46 products included in the survey with nutrition labelling available online, all would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugar per serving.\n\nAction on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, are calling for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus.\n\nThe government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) also has a sugar reduction programme as part of the government's childhood obesity plan. It is challenging businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020 and milkshakes are included in that.\n\nAction on Sugar chairman Graham MacGregor, professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at London's Queen Mary University, said that does not go far enough.\n\n\"These very high calorie drinks, if consumed on a daily basis, would result in children becoming obese and suffering from tooth decay - that is not acceptable,\" he said.\n\n\"These high calorie milkshakes need to be reduced immediately below 300kcal per serving.\"\n\nRegistered nutritionist Kawther Hashem, a researcher at Action on Sugar based at Queen Mary, said it was \"shocking this information is hidden from the consumer, who would struggle to find it\".\n\nShe said it was \"time the government introduced legislation to force companies to be more transparent about what is in their products\".\n\nDr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: \"The food and drink industry - including restaurants, manufacturers and retailers - has a key role in helping to tackle this, by reducing the amount of sugar we buy and consume, and we hope to see them step up to the challenge.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nFreakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media.\n\nThe Toby Carvery Unicorn Freakshake is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon.\n\nToby Carvery had two freakshakes in the top 10 of the survey, as did Harvester.\n\nBoth companies told the BBC that they shared their nutritional information online, took their nutritional responsibilities seriously, had committed to PHE's sugar reduction programme and also were not targeting children with their shakes.\n\nA Toby Carvery spokesperson added: \"We also regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes.\"\n\nAnd a Harvester spokesperson said: \"We have also been recognised by the Soil Association Out to Lunch campaign for continuing to develop our children's menu and offering healthier choices for young guests.\"\n\nSupermarkets\n\nAction on Sugar also looked at supermarket milkshakes and found that 90% of the 41 products surveyed would receive a red/high label for excessive levels of sugars.\n\nThe top three for sugars and calories were Muller Milk Frijj in chocolate, fudge brownie and cookie dough flavour.\n\nA spokesperson for Muller said: \"We know that for health conscious consumers, the choice of reduced sugar is important, without compromising on taste.

What's the bill all about, and what will actually change?\n\nWhat happens at the moment?\n\nThe age of criminal responsibility is the age at which a person is considered old enough to be responsible for their actions and held criminally accountable for them.\n\nCurrently, this age limit in Scotland is eight years old. This is two years younger than the rest of the UK, the lowest figure in Europe and one of the lowest in the world.\n\nThe cut-off point of eight years of age dates back to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which raised the age of criminal responsibility from seven to eight across the UK.\n\nA Scottish version of the bill was passed in 1937, the wording of which remains on the statute book to this day: \"It shall be conclusively presumed that no child under the age of eight years can be guilty of any offence.\"\n\nAn updated version of the law in 1963 raised the minimum age for the rest of the UK to 10, but this was not formally replicated in Scotland, where the youth justice system moved in a different direction with the establishment of the children's hearing system after the Kilbrandon Report in 1964.\n\nHowever, since 2011 the age of criminal prosecution in Scotland has been 12 years of age, meaning children can only stand trial in a criminal court from that age up.\n\nThis means younger children are sent to children's hearings instead of court - but crucially, the judgements handed out there can still appear on their criminal record.\n\nWhat is the proposal?\n\nImage copyright Police Scotland\n\nThe government's plan is to bring the age of criminal responsibility up to 12, into line with the age of criminal prosecution.\n\nA move like this has been in the pipeline for a few years now. Minister set up an advisory group in 2015, which came back recommending the change.\n\nTheir argument stems from the fact that the majority of children referred to children's hearings for offences which could appear on a criminal record had been referred on care and protection grounds.\n\nTo put it simply, there was a strong link between harmful behaviour and other disruption or trauma occurring in the child's life.\n\nThe goal in raising the age of criminal responsibility was therefore to recognise the link between childhood trauma and offending behaviour, and to make sure children are not \"criminalised or stigmatised\".\n\nA public consultation was subsequently held in 2016, which came back with responses 95% in favour of raising the age limit to 12.\n\nEarlier this year, ministers tabled the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Bill, which now faces its first parliamentary test.\n\nIs this a big issue?\n\nThere has actually been a sharp decline in the number of young people prosecuted in Scotland's courts in recent years.\n\nIn 2006-7, there were 9,813 people aged 12 to 17 prosecuted - but by 2015-16 this had fallen to 2,203, a decline of 78%.\n\nAnd the number of young people aged 8 to 11 referred to the children's reporter on offence grounds - so the kind of thing that can end up on a criminal record - has also been on the wane.\n\nAccording to the government, this figure was up at 798 in 2010-11, but dropped to 205 by 2016-17 - a decline of 74%.\n\nTaking 2014-15 as a snapshot, data collected by the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration shows 75 children being referred as a result of being charged with assault, 55 for threatening or abusive behaviour, 28 for causing \"distress/racial alarm\", 15 for shoplifting, 14 for theft and 13 for assault to injury.\n\nLooking at the most recent figures, the vast majority of children reported on offence grounds are over the age of 12 anyway, with 14 and 15 the most common ages. The 2017-18 report from the children's reporter administration shows that eight to 11-year-olds made up less than 8% of such referrals.\n\nImage copyright SCRA Image caption The bulk of children referred to the reporter on offence grounds are over 12 anyway\n\nWhat do other countries do?\n\nAt present, Scotland's age of criminal responsibility is one of the lowest in the world. Few countries use a lower age, although these include some very populous countries in India, Pakistan and Nigeria, all at 7 - the lowest national age globally.\n\nIn the rest of the UK, it is set at 10 - still lower than any other country in the EU, where 12 is the lowest but some countries like Portugal, Lithuania and Luxembourg have it as high as 16.\n\nThe UN Committee on the Rights of the Child says that 12 should be \"the absolute minimum\", and that anything lower is not considered \"internationally acceptable\".\n\nA number of Asian countries set the age at 14 - including China, Japan, North and South Korea and Vietnam - and some South American countries have opted for 18, including Ecuador, Colombia and Uruguay.\n\nThe United States of America has two layers to its justice system. While only children from the age of 11 up can be charged with a federal offence, there are 33 states where there is no minimum age of criminal responsibility at all.\n\nIs 12 high enough?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThere is broad support at Holyrood for raising the age of criminal responsibility. The equalities and human rights committee, which includes SNP, Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem members - unanimously signed up to the general principles of the bill.\n\nHowever, the committee also gave a hint at what the key debate around the legislation might be - just how high the age limit should be raised.\n\nTheir stage one report noted a \"shared commitment to improving outcomes for children and young people\", but said some members backed the bill \"in the knowledge it could be used to raise the age to 14, 16 or 18 years old\".\n\nThe Lib Dems - who pushed for the age of responsibility to be raised in 2015 - want it set at 14.\n\nMSP Alex Cole-Hamilton pointed to the UN recommendation, saying the government \"should not be contented to do the bare minimum\".\n\nThe government has argued that children over 12 were judged to have \"sufficient understanding\" to make a will, instruct a solicitor and consent to or veto their own adoption.\n\nThe policy memorandum for the bill concludes that \"it is considered that reform to raise the age to 12 is the most appropriate at this stage\".", "Image copyright Big Burns Supper Image caption The Troggs have been added

frustrating at the best of times, but for many disabled people it comes with even more unnecessary challenges - narrow aisles, no step-free access, rushed shop assistants.\n\nBut one businessman and wheelchair user has turned his frustrations into a national event - Purple Tuesday - in a bid to get hundreds of retailers to improve their customer experience and tap into the \u00a3249bn disabled customers spend each year.\n\nFor Holly Greader, from Cardiff, going shopping is like \"tackling an obstacle course\".\n\nLike many other 21-year-olds she's interested in fashion with a keen eye for a bargain, but as a wheelchair user she's often left frustrated by the barriers she faces on her local high street.\n\n\"I've got money that I want to spend, but, due to the fact I can't even get into some shops with steps, they miss out on my cash,\" she says.\n\nOnce she's in a shop, she often finds accessible changing rooms are filled with stock, tills are out of her reach, and many retailers are simply unaware of the needs of her and other disabled customers.\n\n\"If staff thought a bit more about my needs and saw me as a proper person rather than a problem to deal with then I think that would make shopping a lot better for me,\" she says.\n\nIt's a frustration felt by many and it translates into hard cash.\n\nAccording to the Department of Work and Pensions, of the estimated

says disabled people want to feel like people first, who just happen to have a disability\n\nThat's the trigger behind Purple Tuesday - a day to make customer-facing businesses in retail more aware of the challenges faced by disabled customers.\n\nIt's something entrepreneur and wheelchair user Mike Adams created out of his own experience.\n\n\"I used to get taken on my school 'Happy Bus' as we called it, from my special school in Sussex once a month to the nearby town.\n\n\"We were taken into a shop for a special treat where we were able to spend any pocket money our parents had

more.\n\n\"Shop staff are still unsure of engaging with me,\" he says. \"This isn't through prejudice, but more a fear of offending me through the use of the wrong language or etiquette.\"\n\nWhat is the Purple Pound?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The power of the \"purple pound\" explained\n\nThough communication needs some more work, he says physical access is also still an issue and, though many stores now have ramps or level floor access into the building, the crowded layouts inside make it very difficult to get around without causing damage.\n\nThis is something Holly knows only too well.\n\n\"Small aisles are virtually impossible to navigate,\" she says. \"If I'm in a clothes shop and there's a sale on, the sale items are usually clumped together
