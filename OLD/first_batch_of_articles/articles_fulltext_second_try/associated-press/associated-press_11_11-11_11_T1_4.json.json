["", "", "", "", "", "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady watches from the sideline after leaving the game in the second half of the Patriots' 34-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans in an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Zaleski)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The New England Patriots dipped into their bag of tricks, and wide receiver Julian Edelman threw to a wide-open Tom Brady.\n\nThe three-time NFL MVP stumbled toward the first-down marker only to be stopped a yard shy by Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard. Then right tackle Marcus Cannon false started before Logan Ryan, a former Patriots cornerback, knocked down Brady\u2019s fourth-down pass to Edelman.\n\nBrady spent the rest of the game on the sideline, watching Brian Hoyer mop up Sunday after a very ugly and uncharacteristic performance in a 34-10 loss to the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to win in the NFL,\u201d Brady said when asked about being pulled. \u201cYou can\u2019t take it for granted. And I think it\u2019s hard to win. If you don\u2019t play well, you don\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nBrady was 21 of 41 for 254 yards, and this was the second time in three games he finished without throwing a TD pass.\n\nThe Patriots (7-3) snapped a six-game winning streak with the offense sputtering and not performing up to their own standards against a team that hadn\u2019t beaten New England since Dec. 16, 2002.\n\nNew England came in ranked fourth in the NFL in averaging 30 points a game, and the Patriots hadn\u2019t scored less than 25 points in each of the past six games. Tight end Rob Gronkowski sat out for the third time in four games with ankle and back injuries, but they did get back rookie running back Sony Michel.\n\nYet New England was held to just 40 yards rushing, and Tennessee outgained the Patriots 385-284 in total offense. Worse, the Titans led 17-3 at the end of the first quarter, and New England managed only one touchdown drive the entire game. Coach Bill Belichick said the Titans did better than his Patriots in every facet of the game.\n\nThe Patriots also had allowed only 13 sacks this season coming in, yet allowed a season-high three sacks to the Titans who also hit Brady six other times. Woodyard, an inside linebacker, led the Titans with 1\u00bd sacks and three hits on Brady.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do really much of anything well today, so everything was a problem,\u201d Belichick said of the pass protection.\n\nLeft tackle Trent Brown left briefly in the first half and was questionable to return because of illness. He was back for the start of the third quarter before leaving for good with an injured back. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him. Patriots tight end Dwayne Allen also hurt a knee.\n\nBut Michel managed only 31 yards on 11 carries, and the Patriots didn\u2019t have a run longer than 9 yards.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get in a rhythm,\u201d Michel said. \u201cWe just have to execute better.\u201d\n\nFormer Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler has struggled, giving up touchdown passes through the first half of the season. Tennessee kept second-year cornerback Adoree Jackson on Josh Gordon, and Brady threw 12 passes to Gordon. The receiver finished with only four catches for 81 yards \u2014 44 on the Patriots\u2019 opening drive on one completion.\n\nGordon said Jackson has a lot of promise in the NFL, but that the offense seemed a little rushed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough for me to give good perspective,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI\u2019m not looking back and seeing the defensive line, but I think that\u2019s partially due to the fact I felt a little rushed.\u201d\n\nSeeing Brady on the sideline for the final two series surprised Ryan, who had never seen the Patriots quarterback not finish a game during his four seasons in New England.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side with him, and teams lose focus and he\u2019s able to come back from 28-3,\u201d Ryan said referring to 2017 when the Patriots rallied to beat Atlanta in the first overtime in the history of the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots went three-and-out four times and settled for a pair of 52-yard field goals, and kicker Stephen Gostkowski pushed the second just wide left. They converted only 3 of 15 on third down.\n\n\u201cWe just got outplayed,\u201d said Edelman, who finished with nine catches for 104 yards.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

The Bills won 41-10. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 The locker room was eerily quiet as New York Jets players got dressed, packed their bags and headed for the exits.\n\nTheir 41-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday was as ugly as it gets. And it further cast doubts on the future of coach Todd Bowles.\n\n\u201cEverything that could\u2019ve gone wrong,\u201d Bowles said, \u201cwent wrong.\u201d\n\nThe hot seat under Bowles reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a Bills team that was led by Matt Barkley , who hadn\u2019t started in nearly two years, and entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\nNew York has now lost four in a row heading into its bye-week break. Whether Bowles will still be in charge when the Jets play again on Nov. 25 against New England seems immediately uncertain. But the coach spoke like a man approaching things like business as usual.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a long, hard look at everything this week, coaches and players,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try like hell to win our last six games.\u201d\n\nThis loss, and the way it went down, could give owner Christopher Johnson pause when evaluating the future. It has seemed like a forgone conclusion to many that Bowles would not be back after the season. This latest loss, though, had many wondering if the coach will be back after Sunday.\n\nJohnson declined comment to reporters after the game when asked if he was considering a change.\n\nMany of the players insisted that the struggles can be attributed to lots of people, not just Bowles.\n\n\u201cT-Bowles is not the problem,\u201d safety Jamal Adams said. \u201cI\u2019m going to ride with T-Bowles until the end. I don\u2019t care what the fans say. It\u2019s T-Bowles. I\u2019m going to support my coach through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nWell, consider this the thinnest of thin.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn\u2019t prevent a brutal loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions, and the Jets finished with just 199 total yards.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\u201d cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \u201cand we didn\u2019t do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nBarkley sparked Buffalo\u2019s bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins, LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs, and the Bills (3-7) were in control before many fans had settled into their seats.\n\nOn Barkley\u2019s first play, he launched a 47-yard pass to Robert Foster. On the next play, Barkley handed off to LeSean McCoy, who scored his first touchdown of the season with a 28-yard run that gave Buffalo a 7-0 lead 49 seconds in.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we didn\u2019t expect to come out there like that,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this game to go like that. We didn\u2019t come out there and execute.\u201d\n\nBarkley and the Bills took a 14-0 lead midway through the opening quarter on a fluky play. On third-and-7 from the 11, Zay Jones caught a pass and took it 10 yards before fumbling as he reached for the goal line. Tight end Jason Croom recovered in the end zone for a touchdown that was upheld by video review.\n\nThe 14-play, 73-play drive was prolonged by a fake punt on fourth-and-6 from the Bills 47 when the ball was snapped directly to tight end Logan Thomas, a quarterback at Virginia Tech. Thomas then completed a 19-yard pass to Foster for the first down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like anybody quit,\u201d Claiborne said. \u201cI just feel like the way the game went, it was their day coaching and their day playing.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign of that came midway through the second quarter when Dawkins lined up as an eligible receiver on first-and-goal from the 7.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Glover Quin had a chance to stop Anthony Miller. He ended up on the ground on the sideline, watching as Miller sped toward the end zone.\n\nIt was that kind of day for Detroit\u2019s secondary.\n\nPlaying without injured cornerback Darius Slay, the Lions were picked apart by Mitchell Trubisky in a 34-22 loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Quin, DeShawn Shead and Nevin Lawson each had costly missed tackles, and coverage issues created large swatches of open green grass for Allen Robinson and the rest of Chicago\u2019s receivers.\n\n\u201cIt is on us,\u201d Quin said. \u201cWe have to turn it around. At the end of the day, we\u2019re the ones out there playing. We have to get it fixed.\u201d\n\nDetroit (3-6) had played well against the pass in its first year under coach Matt Patricia, who was New England\u2019s defensive coordinator for six seasons before taking over the Lions in February. But the secondary issues for the Lions in their third consecutive loss looked more like their old teams than anything from Patricia\u2019s time with the Patriots.\n\n\u201cRan into each other on one particular big play. We had a communication thing on another one,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cBut look, in the end, I just got to do a better job coaching it up and getting them in the right positions and we got to go out and execute.\u201d\n\nThe trouble began on the first drive of the game. Shead was unable to bring down Robinson on a slant, and he ran all the way down to the Detroit 3 for a 35-yard play. Tarik Cohen carried the ball in for the Bears (6-3) on the next play.\n\nShead got the start in place of Slay, who was sidelined for the first time this season because of a knee injury.\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re going to play with whoever\u2019s healthy and whoever\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cSo, for us, if you\u2019re out on the field you got to perform. You got to go out and execute. So obviously we didn\u2019t do a good job early on with our execution in the back end.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old Shead had more trouble in the final minute of the first quarter. Chicago was facing third-and-15 at the Detroit 36 when Shead was beaten by Robinson at the line. He caught up, but couldn\u2019t find the ball as Robinson adjusted to make the catch in the end zone.\n\nIt was more of the same in the second quarter. Miller was wide open on a reception on the right side of the field. Quin came over and tried to bring him down near the 20, but Miller ran through his tackle attempt for a 45-yard touchdown that made it 19-0 with 11:24 left in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe just have to execute better,\u201d Shead said. \u201cJust go in, look at the tape and just see, I mean the little things, the little mistakes. I know ... one play was miscommunication on my part on the back end. Just being on the same page and just jelling together and executing.\u201d\n\nChicago led 26-7 at halftime. Trubisky was 14 for 16 for 209 yards at the break with a perfect passer rating of 158.3.\n\nThe Lions\u2019 chances for a comeback took a hit when Robinson ran out of Lawson\u2019s tackle attempt for a 26-yard TD reception in the third quarter.\n\nDetroit began the weekend ranked fourth in the NFL with just 214.6 yards passing allowed per game. But Trubisky finished with a career-high 355 yards through the air, and Robinson and Miller each went over 100 yards receiving.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a combination of a lot of fundamentals right now that need to be better across the board,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cTackling is one of them, but there\u2019s certainly, obviously, a bunch of things we need to work on.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJay Cohen can be reached at https://twitter.com/jcohenap\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 9 Ohio State guard Duane Washington, top, dunks between teammate guard C.J.

It wasn\u2019t much of a contest from then on as Ohio State clamped down on defense and the Summit Conference team wilted.\n\nDuane Washington Jr. scored 20 and Jaedon Ledee had 16 points on 12-of-14 free-throw shooting as Ohio State won for the second time in five days. The Buckeyes beat Cincinnati on the road Wednesday.\n\nJohn Konchar and Kason Harrell each had 13 for the Mastodons (0-2), who shot just 34 percent from the field. They shot 30 percent in the second half as Ohio State smothered them on defense and the game got out of hand.\n\nOhio State led 41-34 at the end of the first half on the strength of a pair of late 3-pointers hit 23 seconds apart by Washington. Konchar hit a layup on a fast break as time ran out in the half to keep the deficit at seven points.\n\n\u201cWe just weren\u2019t making smart decisions defensively, and that kind of led to bad offense,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe got a couple of silly turnovers in the first half, and that kind of slowed us down a little bit. We weren\u2019t making as many shots. Later we started being a little smarter with the ball, knocking down those same shots we were taking earlier.\u201d\n\nThe Buckeyes cleaned it up in the second half, putting up the team\u2019s highest point total in nearly two years, then sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Holtmann in the locker room afterward.\n\nRAINING 3-POINTERS\n\nThe Buckeyes were 15 for 28 from beyond the arc, a 54-percent success rate. The parade was led by Washington, who hit 6 of 9, and Jackson, who was 4 for 7.\n\nIt was Ohio State\u2019s best day from the 3-point line since making 17 of 29 attempts against Maryland in January.\n\nWashington\u2019s six 3-pointers tied a school record for a freshman. D\u2019Angelo Russell did it in 2015.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPurdue Fort Wayne: The scrappy Mastodons managed to hang in there until Jackson started raining 3s and the Buckeyes pulled away.\n\nOhio State: Jackson, the only senior among the starters, is on fire, posting a career high despite leaving the game with about six minutes left. And Ohio State\u2019s young players, particularly Muhammad and Washington, are looking more confident and meshing with the more experienced players \u2014 which is exactly why games against overmatched mid-majors are scheduled early in the season.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cChris has got the Buckeyes playing really good defense right now,\u201d Purdue Fort Wayne coach Jon Coffman said. \u201cYou play that kind of defense \u2014 and I know it\u2019s only a couple games in \u2014 you\u2019re going to have a lot of success. And I\u2019ll attribute our lack of success in the second half to what Ohio State did today.\u201d\n\nTOO EARLY TO TELL\n\nHoltmann said even though his freshmen have been a major presence early, he doesn\u2019t know yet exactly what he\u2019s got.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early in the season to have any real idea where we\u2019re at or make any statement about where we\u2019re at or where another team we play is at,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get better with every day in practice that\u2019s in front of us.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nPurdue Fort Wayne: Hosts Manchester on Tuesday.\n\nOhio State: At Creighton Thursday night.\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy", "New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (9) reacts as he runs off the field following an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Cincinnati.

What little was left of the crowd of 52,492 booed loudly when it ended with New Orleans taking a knee three consecutive plays \u2014 technically, Cincinnati\u2019s only defensive stop of the day.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like it,\u201d linebacker Preston Brown said. \u201cEvery week we\u2019re giving up too many yards.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals knew they\u2019d be in for some growing pains when they decided to field the youngest team in coach Marvin Lewis\u2019 16 seasons, with most of the inexperience on defense. They also brought in coordinator Teryl Austin, who changed some of their schemes.\n\nIt\u2019s not working, and the Bengals seem to have run out of ideas for what to do next.\n\n\u201cObviously, your confidence gets shaken,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI just addressed that with them. They have to focus and get determined. It\u2019s their job to do it right.\u201d\n\nShaken, and deeply disturbed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in shock after a loss like that,\u201d linebacker Jordan Evans said.\n\nIn the last four games, the Bengals have given up 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards. They\u2019re allowing an average of 454 yards per game, worst in the league.\n\nThey\u2019re on pace to allow 7,272 yards, which would be an NFL record. The 2012 Saints are the only team to give up 7,000 in a season, 7,042 in 2012.\n\nThe Bengals opened the season 4-1 despite giving up a lot of yards. Four defensive touchdowns played major roles in the fast start, and the offense managed to keep up and pull out two wins at the end. With A.J. Green out indefinitely because of a toe injury, the offense is limited.\n\n\u201cWe always want to score, but at the end of the day, our defense has got to get some stops,\u201d receiver Tyler Boyd said. \u201cYou can\u2019t let the other team score on every drive.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the Saints did.\n\nBrees led the Saints to touchdowns on all five first-half possessions with a nearly perfect performance \u2014 only two incompletions. His 17-yard TD to Michael Thomas with 2 seconds left in the half gave him 509 career touchdown passes, one more than Brett Favre for second on the career list. Peyton Manning holds the record with 539.\n\nBrees had his way with the Bengals\u2019 historically bad defense , even diving over the pile to score a 1-yard touchdown.\n\nThe Bengals matched the most lopsided defeat in franchise history and gave up the second-most points in club history. In the first half alone, the Saints piled up 311 yards and had 21 first downs on 40 plays. The 28 points allowed in the second quarter matched the club record.\n\nEven more shocking: Cincinnati was coming out of a bye and had two weeks to prepare for the Saints. The Bengals thought they\u2019d get some of their issues resolved.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look like it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe gave up 500 yards.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 The catch that Larry Fitzgerald secured late in the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday did nothing to change the outcome: another loss for Arizona in a season full of them.\n\nIt was hardly meaningless to the veteran wide receiver.\n\nThe catch moved Fitzgerald past Terrell Owens into second place on the NFL\u2019s career reception yardage list. He finished the Cardinals\u2019 26-14 loss to the Chiefs with six catches for 50 yards, giving him 15,952 yards \u2014 behind only Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice.\n\n\u201cIt happens to be Terrell Owens and I\u2019m pretty close with T.O. His friendship and my relationship with him is invaluable to me,\u201d Fitzgerald said afterward. \u201cHe means a great deal to me, and to be mentioned in the same breath with him means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nThe biggest lament for Fitzgerald, though, was that the yardage he needed came when the outcome was decided. He was shut out on three targets in the first half as the Chiefs took a 20-7 lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important for us to try to get our good players involved, and we try to do it a little early. We didn\u2019t have an opportunity there,\u201d Cardinals coach Steve Wilks said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any catches, rather, so we came out in the second half really trying to find ways to get him the football.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Cardinals did, it was too late.\n\nPerhaps that was fitting considering Fitzgerald has pieced together one of the finest careers in NFL history relatively quietly, with some of his best seasons coming in the Cardinals\u2019 worst years. The 35-year-old Fitzgerald has had at least 100 receptions each of the past three seasons, and five times in his career, while piling up nine seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving.\n\nHe has 40 catches for 407 yards and two touchdowns this season.\n\nAnd while Fitzgerald is almost certain to fall short of the numbers he is accustomed to producing, he is nevertheless providing another year of invaluable service: He\u2019s the steady, capable and wise veteran in the ear of Josh Rosen, who is expected to lead the Cardinals for years to come.\n\nThe rookie quarterback had plenty of bright spots Sunday, even though he was sacked five times and threw a pair of costly interceptions.

She will serve until the special election is resolved.\n\nEspy in 1986 became the first African-American since Reconstruction to win a U.S. House seat in Mississippi, and if he defeats Hyde-Smith, he would be the first African-American since Reconstruction to represent the state in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHyde-Smith, who is endorsed by President Donald Trump, is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, and after being appointed is trying to become the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the state.\n\nLamar White Jr., publisher of a left-leaning Louisiana news site called The Bayou Brief, posted the video Sunday on social media. White told The Associated Press he received the video late Saturday from \u201ca very reliable, trusted source,\u201d but he would not reveal the person\u2019s name. He said that source received it from the person who shot the video.\n\nWhite said he believes he received the video because he has been writing about racism in the South for about a dozen years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse to say what she said,\u201d White said of Hyde-Smith.\n\nThe national NAACP president Derrick Johnson, who is from Mississippi, said Hyde-Smith\u2019s comment shows a lack of judgment.\n\n\u201cSenator Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s shameful remarks prove once again how Trump has created a social and political climate that normalizes hateful and racist rhetoric,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cHyde-Smith\u2019s decision to joke about \u2018hanging,\u2019 in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African Americans is sick. To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people, Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful.\u201d\n\nA Republican activist who initially supported another candidate in the special U.S. Senate election said he will vote for Hyde-Smith in the runoff, even though he considers her a weak candidate.\n\n\u201cThat comment about \u2018a public hanging\u2019 is much ado about nothing,\u201d said Scott Brewster of Brandon, who is white. \u201cShe\u2019s not very smart and made a tone deaf comment.

(AP Photo/Joel Auerbach, File)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 Dwyane Wade is putting family over basketball right now.\n\nWade will miss at least another week before resuming his final Heat season, telling The Associated Press in an interview Sunday that he needs time to continue bonding with and caring for his daughter. Wade and his wife, actress Gabrielle Union-Wade, had the baby via a surrogate last week.\n\nThe couple and their baby are now at their Los Angeles home, and Wade said all are doing well. The baby\u2019s name has not been publicly released.\n\n\u201cWith my daughter coming a couple weeks early, she\u2019s a little tiny right now, so we\u2019re making sure health-wise that she\u2019s OK,\u201d Wade said. \u201cAnd for me, once I leave and go back to the season, not really being able to be with me everywhere I go, this time right now, this bonding moment with my daughter is the most important thing in my life at this time.\u201d\n\nWade will miss, at minimum, upcoming Heat games against Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Indiana and the Los Angeles Lakers. He has also missed Miami\u2019s last three games.\n\n\u201cAnd then I\u2019ll go from there, see how she\u2019s doing and make a decision based on that,\u201d Wade said.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra said the team remains committed to giving Wade all the time he needs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re totally fine with it,\u201d Spoelstra said Sunday.\n\nWade released a video in September announcing he was coming back for one final season. At one point on that tape, Wade had tears in his eyes when he told fans they were not fully aware of everything that went into his decision to either come back or retire.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that you guys don\u2019t know that we deal with and I have dealt with this summer,\u201d Wade said on the tape.\n\nIt\u2019s clear now what he meant.\n\nUnion-Wade has spoken often about her struggles on the road to motherhood. In her memoir published last year, \u201cWe\u2019re Gonna Need More Wine,\u201d Union-Wade revealed that she\u2019s had \u201ceight or nine\u201d miscarriages. The Wades ultimately decided to conceive via a surrogate.\n\n\u201cWe had to go through a lot to get here,\u201d Wade said. \u201cEveryone knows that a little girl steals your heart.\u201d\n\nWade was strongly considering retirement, not because he no longer wanted to play but because he knew he and his wife were having a daughter and he was unsure if he wanted to be away from her for extended periods.\n\n\u201cOur situation is different,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThe world expects moms to take time off from work. They never expect dads to be the ones who take time away. Because of the route we took to this, it\u2019s important that not also my wife but also me take this time. I was going to take the whole year. I was going to retire this summer. But I decided to just take a little time in between instead.\u201d\n\nThere is no mention of paternity leave in the NBA\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement, so players and teams to work out such situations on their own. Major League Baseball is the only one of the four U.S. major pro leagues to have an official paternity policy, one that allows players to take up to three days.\n\nExtended absences by fathers are rare.

Daniel Murphy, then of the New York Mets, took sports-radio criticism in 2014 when he missed two days after his son\u2019s birth. Al Horford of the Boston Celtics was criticized by some after missing a 2016 game \u2014 with his team\u2019s permission \u2014 for a baby\u2019s arrival.\n\nAnd backlash now seems less common. Players from England, Switzerland and Denmark were allowed to leave the World Cup in Russia earlier this year to be home for births. U.S. tennis star John Isner opted out of the Davis Cup semifinals in September because his wife\u2019s due date was nearing, and did so with plenty of support.\n\n\u201cMy focus is my family and right now she is the most important person for me to focus on, and my boys understand that,\u201d Wade said. \u201cMy heart is full, man.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FARGO, N.D.

The Mountaineers (8-1, 6-1, No. 9 CFP) lost to all three teams a year ago. Oklahoma is the only Big 12 opponent the Mountaineers haven\u2019t beaten since joining the league in 2012.\n\nTheir final road game is Saturday against the Cowboys, who dominated West Virginia 50-39 a year ago in Morgantown.\n\n\u201cThey came here and embarrassed us last year, so we have redemption on our mind,\u201d said West Virginia defensive coordinator Tony Gibson.\n\nWest Virginia has played well on both sides of the ball ever since its only loss Oct. 13 at Iowa State and quarterback Will Grier has re-emerged as a Heisman Trophy hopeful.\n\n\u201cGetting your tail beat in kind of opens up everybody\u2019s eyes a little bit,\u201d said West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to let that define us. We\u2019ve been pretty good since.\u201d\n\nAfter struggling at times this season to shut down opponents and fill gaps at linebacker created by injuries, Gibson\u2019s unit has allowed 14 points or less in two of the last three games.\n\nAlthough Texas moved the ball well two weeks ago, West Virginia\u2019s defense held on just enough to force the Longhorns to kick two field goals in the second half and enable Grier to provide the decisive push in the 42-41 victory.\n\nWest Virginia handed TCU\u2019s Gary Patterson his most lopsided loss in 18 seasons as head coach. The Mountaineers limited the Horned Frogs to a season-low 222 yards of offense, including minus-7 yards rushing, and forced a safety in the 47-10 win.\n\n\u201cWe knew the schedule of the month of November,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared and built ourselves up to be able to stop these kind of offenses, and now we\u2019re going to get tested the next few weeks.\u201d\n\nNext stop: Stillwater, Oklahoma, where Holgorsen had a 10-month stint as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under Oklahoma State\u2019s Mike Gundy in 2010 before moving to West Virginia in December of that year.\n\n\u201cNext week\u2019s going to be a huge challenge,\u201d Holgorsen said Saturday before heading off to watch the Cowboys lose at Oklahoma 48-47.\n\nOklahoma State and Oklahoma will see some new offensive twists. The Mountaineers haven\u2019t thrown this often to their tight ends since Anthony Becht caught 35 passes in 1999. Grier also is turning to his running backs more as receiving targets if he can\u2019t throw downfield.\n\nTight end Trevon Wesco, who caught one pass all last season, and Miami transfer Jovani Haskins have combined for 31 catches for 367 yards and two scores.

And the Bears surpassed their win total from last year with their third straight victory .\n\n\u201cWe were just out there having fun today,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cEveryone was doing their job. We just went out there and played. And the plays made themselves because we were just going out there not thinking, just translating the work from practice on gameday.\u201d\n\nThough he threw for six touchdowns against Tampa Bay earlier this season, Trubisky had one of his best games since the Bears took him with the No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft.\n\nHe completed 23 of 30 passes and finished with a 148.6 rating.

Robinson set up Tarik Cohen\u2019s 3-yard touchdown on the game\u2019s opening drive when he turned a slant into a 35-yard gain, breaking a tackle by DeShawn Shead on a 35-yard slant.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Andrew Luck started Sunday by carving up Jacksonville\u2019s staunch defense.\n\nHe finished it by playing the eager spectator.\n\nAfter throwing three first-half touchdown passes and picking up only two first downs in the second half, he celebrated when the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 defense delivered the decisive turnover with 90 seconds left to preserve a 29-26 victory over the Jaguars.\n\n\u201cWe played well enough in the first half to put some points on the board,\u201d Luck said. \u201cThen we survived.\u201d\n\nBarely survived, that is.\n\nTrailing by three, Jacksonville quickly marched from its 42-yard line into field goal range, and when Rashad Greene Sr. went down at the Colts\u2019 23, it looked like the Jaguars were already set up for at least a tying field goal. Initially, Greene was ruled down before the ball squirted out.\n\nBut just before the Jags (3-6) ran the next play, the whistles blew for a booth review. A few minutes later, the call was overturned, giving the ball and the game to the Colts, who have won three straight for the first time in three years.\n\n\u201cI thought we got the play off, but obviously, we didn\u2019t,\u201d Jags coach Doug Marrone said before elaborating later. \u201cPersonally, I thought it wasn\u2019t a fumble. But I see what everybody sees from the sideline.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s AFC runner-ups were a popular preseason pick to dethrone New England. Instead, the Jags have lost five straight, six of seven and are last in the division.\n\nAnd they don\u2019t get more painful than this.\n\nJacksonville had an extra point blocked and nearly returned for a 2-point conversion in the first half.\n\nTwo 15-yard penalties helped Indy score its fourth touchdown, a 1-yard pass from Luck to Mo Alie-Cox late in the second quarter. An offside call on the ensuing extra point prompted coach Frank Reich to go for two, which Marlon Mack punched it in to make it 29-13.\n\nJacksonville kicker Josh Lambo missed his first field goal of the season, a 52-yarder, wide left in the third quarter but then made a 55-yarder to cut the deficit to three with 4:03 left.\n\nFinally, Kenny Moore III sealed the Jags\u2019 fate by ripping the ball away from Greene just before his leg went down and Malik Hooker scooped it up.\n\n\u201cOffensively we\u2019re looking to improve, put that thing away,\u201d Reich said. \u201cBut make no mistake about it: This was a huge win for us.\u201d\n\nLuck started fast, hooking up with Eric Ebron on a 53-yard TD pass seven plays into the game.\n\nAfter Donte Moncrief tied it on an 80-yard scoring play, Ebron answered with a 2-yard TD run to make it 14-7. Luck connected with Ebron again on a 12-yard TD pass, giving the tight end a career-high third score with 9:19 left in the first half.\n\nLuck finished 21 of 29 with 285 yards, one interception and was not sacked. He has three TD passes or more in six straight games, one of three QBs to do so in a single season. His company: Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.\n\nBlake Bortles was 26 of 38 with 320 yards and two TD passes while Leonard Fournette had 53 yards rushing, 56 yards receiving and his first two scores of the season \u2014 one on the ground, one through the air.\n\nIt just wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good defense, a lot of respect for that defense,\u201d Luck said. \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t sharp enough.\u201d\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nJaguars: Center Brandon Linder and offensive tackle Ereck Flowers both left in the third quarter with knee injuries.\n\nColts: Defensive end Carroll Phillips left in the first half with an injured groin.

Neither returned.\n\nAUTOMATIC ADAM\n\nThe Colts honored the NFL\u2019s new career scoring leader, Adam Vinatieri, before the game with a brief highlight film and the distinction of being the last starter introduced to the crowd, which roared.\n\nVinatieri responded by waving to the crowd and slapping hands with some fans on the field. Then he added three more points to his record-breaking total (2,553) before missing a 52-yard attempt wide right with 2:58 left in the game.\n\nHe also tied George Blanda for the most regular-season wins in league history (209).\n\nSTAT PACK\n\nJaguars: Fournette had 29 touches, 24 carries and five receptions, in his third game this season. ... Punter Logan Cooke completed a 4-yard pass on a fake field goal, which kept the Jags\u2019 17-play drive alive to open the second half. The drive ended with Fournette\u2019s 1-yard TD catch.\n\nColts: Ebron finished with three catches for 69 yards.

The good news for Presbyterian was the emergence of Stafford, who scored 12 of the Blue Hose\u2019s first 15 points while making her college debut at one of the most storied venues in women\u2019s basketball.

(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady added another big chunk of NFL history to his resume.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans made sure the Patriots quarterback didn\u2019t finish his 300th game by hitting him over and over again.\n\nThe Titans sacked Brady three times and hit him six more times as they beat New England 34-10 Sunday, snapping a seven-game skid against the Patriots in Mike Vrabel\u2019s first game as head coach against the team he helped win three Super Bowls.\n\nIt was the most sacks allowed in a game this season by the Patriots (7-3), and coach Bill Belichick pulled Brady for Brian Hoyer midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cYou got to make Tom blink, and if you make him blink and have to go to a second read you got a chance,\u201d Vrabel said of his former teammate. \u201cBut if you let him rip it to the first guy he looks at, it\u2019s going to be a long day.\u201d\n\nAsked if he thought Brady was effective, Belichick said to ask Brady.\n\n\u201cIt was just a bad day for all of us,\u201d Brady said.\n\nOnly Brett Favre (326) has played in more games, both regular season and postseason, as a quarterback than Brady. The three-time NFL MVP also needed only three touchdown passes to tie Peyton Manning (579) for the NFL record for most TD passes all time for both the regular season and postseason.\n\nBrady left having thrown for 254 yards and no TD passes. The Titans outgained the Patriots 385-284, holding New England to just 40 yards rushing. Linebacker Wesley Woodyard, who had 1\u00bd sacks, said that allowed them to get after Brady.\n\n\u201cCoach Vrabel said make them pay for everything,\u201d Woodyard said. \u201cTackle him, hit him and make him feel it.\u201d\n\nMarcus Mariota capped each of the first two drives with TD passes, and Derrick Henry ran for a pair of TDs. Ryan Succop also added two field goals as the Titans (5-4) scored a season high in points after jumping out to a 17-3 lead in the first quarter. They now have beaten both of last season\u2019s Super Bowl teams in Nashville.\n\nThe loss snaps a six-game winning streak going into New England\u2019s bye. The Patriots, who routed the Titans 35-14 in January, also lost to Tennessee for the first time since Dec. 16, 2002.\n\nDarius Jennings opened the game with a 58-yard kickoff return, and Mariota capped the drive with a 4-yard TD pass to Jonnu Smith. The Titans never trailed again.\n\nThe Titans came in with the NFL\u2019s stingiest scoring defense and also leading the league in fewest touchdowns allowed in the red zone. They held the Patriots to a pair of 52-yard field-goal attempts by Stephen Gostkowski, who missed his second wide left. James Develin scored on a 1-yard TD run early in the second, which pulled New England within 17-10.\n\nBrady looked ready to pull off another amazing comeback, driving the Pats to the Titans 37. The Titans stopped Brady a yard shy of the first down after catching a pass from Julian Edelman. A false start followed, then Logan Ryan, a former New England cornerback, broke up a Brady pass to Edelman to turn the ball over.\n\nOn the very next play, Vrabel called his own trick play with Jennings throwing to a wide-open Mariota for a 21-yard gain.\n\nHoyer replaced Brady on the next drive.\n\nAnything you can do, we can do better. #TitanUp pic.twitter.com/ahhCqy2urq \u2014 Tennessee Titans (@Titans) November 11, 2018\n\nEX-PATS CONNECTIONS\n\nTennessee fired coach Mike Mularkey after the January playoff loss and hired Vrabel to try to recreate the Patriots\u2019 winning ways with the Titans. Vrabel hired Dean Pees, a former Patriots linebackers coach and defensive coordinator, as his defensive coordinator. General manager Jon Robinson, who started in New England, signed cornerback Malcolm Butler and running back Dion Lewis in free agency.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you go cheap,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cYou get your (expletive) kicked.\u201d\n\nRARE BRADY CATCH\n\nBrady\u2019s catch was just the third of his career and first since Dec. 6, 2015, when he caught a 36-yarder from Danny Amendola against Philadelphia. At 41, Brady became the oldest player with a catch since Jerry Rice had 30 at the age of 42. Brady slipped at the end and said he didn\u2019t know what happened.\n\n\u201cIt was \u2018fish out of water,\u2019\u201d Brady said.\n\nMariota also has three receptions, including catching his own pass in the playoffs last January. Vrabel said Mariota got up faster than Brady did. Mariota said he had one thought on his reception: \u201cJust catch it.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nPatriots left tackle Trent Brown missed the final drive of the first half and was announced as questionable to return because of illness. LaAdrian Waddle replaced him for that series, but Brown returned for the first start of the third quarter. Brown left later in the third quarter with an injured back. Edelman hurt an ankle and didn\u2019t return.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Matt Barkley had just put the finishing touches on a stunning victory when he jogged over to the sideline, found his mother in the stands and handed her his well-deserved game ball.\n\nIt was quite a moment for the Buffalo Bills quarterback, who looked nothing like a guy who had no job and an uncertain future just a few weeks ago.\n\nBarkley sparked Buffalo\u2019s bumbling offense with two touchdown passes, including one to offensive tackle Dion Dawkins , LeSean McCoy broke out of a season-long slump with 113 yards rushing and a pair of TD runs, and the Bills embarrassed the New York Jets 41-10 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cFor me, I knew I could play in this league,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cTo get back out there after two years, it was, and I don\u2019t want to be clich\u00e9 by saying it was like riding a bike, but I\u2019ve done this for years. I feel like I was made to play football and (today) was an example of going out there and doing what I was made to do.\u201d\n\nBarkley made his first start in nearly two years, and looked the best of any of the four quarterbacks the Bills (3-7) have trotted out this season. The 28-year-old journeyman was 15 of 25 for 232 yards while helping Buffalo snap a four-game losing streak as the Bills put up 451 yards of total offense.\n\nBarkley got the nod from coach Sean McDermott ahead of the ineffective Nathan Peterman despite having just two weeks of practice with the Bills since signing on Oct. 30. Rookie Josh Allen has missed four straight games with a sprained right elbow, and Derek Anderson is sidelined with a concussion. Barkley\u2019s last start came in the 2016 season finale for Chicago.\n\nNow the question is: Should Barkley be the Bills\u2019 starter moving forward?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cThat\u2019s a question I don\u2019t have the answer to, nor the authority to answer. I\u2019ll be ready to play. This QB situation seems to be fluctuating. In whatever way I can help this team, that\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nAdded McDermott: \u201cGive me some time on that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the hot seat under coach Todd Bowles reached a boiling point as the Jets (3-7) got completely manhandled by a team that entered with a league-low 96 points and had two touchdowns in its previous four games.\n\n\u201cEverything that could\u2019ve gone wrong went wrong,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe stunk it up as coaches, we stunk it up as players.\u201d\n\nThe Jets have a bye-week break and the future of Bowles, in his fourth season, is in serious doubt. Owner Christopher Johnson declined comment to reporters after the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try like hell to win our last six games,\u201d Bowles said.\n\nNew York started 39-year-old Josh McCown in place of injured rookie Sam Darnold, but he couldn\u2019t prevent the Jets from their fourth straight loss in front of a frustrated fan base that booed lustily throughout.\n\nMcCown was 17 of 34 for 135 yards with two interceptions, and the Jets finished with just 199 total yards.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I felt like somebody really smacked us,\u201d cornerback Morris Claiborne said, \u201cand we didn\u2019t do nothing about it.\u201d\n\nBarkley certainly didn\u2019t look rusty, launching a 47-yard pass to Robert Foster on the Bills\u2019 first offensive play. Foster, just promoted from the practice squad, beat top Jets cornerback Trumaine Johnson, who had missed the previous five games with an injured quadriceps.\n\nOn the next play, Barkley handed off to McCoy, who scored his first touchdown of the season with a 28-yard run that gave Buffalo a 7-0 lead 49 seconds in.\n\nBarkley and the Bills took a 14-0 lead midway through the opening quarter on a fluky play.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes will always have some special TV footage of the Kansas City Chiefs celebrating his record-setting touchdown pass in a win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.\n\nThat\u2019s because Tyreek Hill was the one recording it.\n\nMahomes threw for 249 yards with two TD strikes to Hill, but it was the second one that sent the Chiefs\u2019 first-year starter past Hall of Famer Len Dawson for the single-season TD record. It was the 31st for Mahomes \u2014 with six games yet to play \u2014 and it helped lift Kansas City to a 26-14 victory over the Cardinals and another game closer to the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.\n\nHill celebrated the score by leaping into the stands, then commandeering the CBS camera \u2014 earning him an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from the officials and a sharp rebuke from coach Andy Reid.\n\n\u201cThe celebration just came into my head,\u201d Hill said. \u201cFor him to come in and do that, that\u2019s amazing, man. People doubted him \u2014 \u2018He wasn\u2019t going to do this, he wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u2019 I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\nHill had seven catches for 117 yards. Kareem Hunt pounded his way for 71 yards rushing. The defense came up with five sacks and two picks. And the Chiefs\u2019 special teams were nearly perfect, helping to keep the Cardinals (2-7) winless in six meetings at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a grind out there,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cand definitely a team that was trying to come up big in a big-time win to get their program back on track, but most importantly we got the win.\u201d\n\nJosh Rosen had 195 yards passing with a touchdown, but two interceptions and several brutal hits in the fourth quarter no doubt left a lasting impression. David Johnson ran for 98 yards with TDs on the ground and through the air, while Larry Fitzgerald had six catches for 50 yards and passed Terrell Owens for No. 2 on the NFL\u2019s career receiving yardage list in the closing minutes.\n\nFitzgerald has 15,952 yards in 15-year career, trailing only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty close to T.O. His friendship and my relationship with him is valuable to me. He means a great deal to me,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that it comes in another loss.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs\u2019 weekly air show got started on the game\u2019s first play, when Hill ran right past Patrick Peterson to haul in a 38-yard reception. Two plays later, Hill ran past the rest of the Arizona defense and Mahomes found him streaking into the end zone for a 37-yard scoring catch.\n\nArizona answered with a time-consuming 75-yard touchdown drive of its own.\n\nBoth defenses fared better the rest of the half, with the Cardinals sacking Mahomes four times and the Chiefs\u2019 rejuvenated defense getting enough pressure to keep Rosen uncomfortable.\n\nThe Chiefs finally reached the end zone again when Mahomes zipped a third-and-goal pass into double coverage to Hill, who cradled it for his quarterback\u2019s record-setting score.\n\n\u201cListen, he\u2019s had a heck of a year,\u201d Reid said of Mahomes, who was not available after the game because of a family emergency. \u201cHe\u2019s played his heart out and I love the backside of that, how he goes about his business. He has a lot on his plate as far as responsibility goes to run the offense.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s touchdown celebration?\n\n\u201cThat was too much,\u201d Reid said, hiding a smile. \u201cI was not happy.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals stuck with Johnson in the second half, and they slowly grinded their way to another touchdown. He carried it six times and finished a 12-play, 61-yard drive with a TD plunge to get Arizona within 20-14 midway through the third quarter.\n\nBut after the Cardinals got the ball back early in the fourth, Rosen had a screen pass picked by Justin Houston at the line of scrimmage. And instead of marching for a go-ahead TD, the Cardinals watched Spencer Ware dive in for a touchdown to extend a lead the Chiefs would never relinquish.\n\n\u201cThought the guys fought to the end,\u201d Cardinals coach Steve Wilks said. \u201cThere are no moral victories in this game. All credit goes to Kansas City. Well-prepared, good football team.\u201d\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cI think we did a couple things really well. We\u2019ve just got to duplicate it. Our opening drives were pretty long and sustainable, and kept our defense off the field. We had pretty well-timed possessions. A little good nugget here and there, but some bad things to clean up.\u201d \u2014 Rosen.\n\nCOIN-TOSS LOSS\n\nThe Chiefs lost their first coin toss all season when the Cardinals successfully called tails. They deferred to the second half, forcing Kansas City to start on offense for the first time.\n\nINJURIES\n\nCardinals: WR Chad Williams (ankle), LG Mike Iupati (back) and DL Robert Nkemdichi (calf) were inactive. ... RG Justin Pugh left early in the second half with a knee injury.\n\nChiefs: WR Sammy Watkins (foot), SS Eric Berry (heel), LB Frank Zombo (hamstring) and OL Mitch Morse (concussion) were inactive. ... Houston (hamstring) was active for the first time since Oct. 7.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona returns home to face the Raiders next Sunday.\n\nKansas City faces the Rams next Monday night in Mexico City.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "1 of 10 Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield celebrates a 13-yard pass to runningback Nick Chubb in the first half of an NFL football game against the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Before he rolled out of bed, Baker Mayfield had a premonition of near perfection.\n\nMore than a hunch.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up this morning, I was feeling pretty dangerous,\u201d the Browns rookie quarterback said with a smile and a hint of arrogance. \u201cI just woke up feeling really dangerous.\u201d\n\nSomeone should have warned the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nMayfield threw a season-high three touchdown passes and rookie Nick Chubb streaked 92 yards for a TD as the Cleveland Browns ended a four-game losing streak with their best all-around performance in years, a stunning 28-16 win over the Falcons on Sunday.\n\nThe Browns (3-6-1) played their most complete game this season under interim coach Gregg Williams, their defensive coordinator who improved to 1-1 since replacing the fired Hue Jackson.\n\nMayfield outplayed Falcons star quarterback Matt Ryan with an excellent outing that further justifies Cleveland\u2019s decision to take the former Oklahoma QB with the No. 1 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft.\n\nEarlier this week, Williams and offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens urged Mayfield to play loose and not worry about any mistakes.\n\nHe took the message to heart.\n\n\u201cIf you take a step back and watch how he managed the game in the huddle, how he managed the clock, how he managed the check systems and how he managed the overall communication on the offensive side of the ball,\u201d Williams said. \u201cA good next step for him.\u201d\n\nMayfield completed his first 13 passes and finished 17 of 20 for 216 yards. He threw a 28-yard scoring pass to Rashard Higgins, a 13-yarder to Chubb and 11-yarder to Duke Johnson. He went 12 of 12 for 165 yards and two TD passes in the first half, and didn\u2019t throw his first incompletion until 11:14 remained in the third quarter.\n\nTwo plays later, he connected with Johnson to put the Browns ahead 21-10\n\n\u201cIt comes down to just doing my job,\u201d said Mayfield, who appreciated his coaches\u2019 trust. \u201cThem saying they trust me enough to let the ball go, I was brought here for a reason so just go do my thing.\n\n\u201cThat obviously makes me feel comfortable when they say that. It comes down to me doing my job, getting the ball out of my hands. We did a good job of having guys open, finding the holes in their defense and getting completions.\u201d\n\nRyan threw two touchdown passes but the Falcons (4-5) had their three-game winning streak \u2014 and any playoff momentum \u2014 stopped cold.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing because we had been playing better than this the last couple of weeks. We\u2019re better than what we put out there today, but you\u2019re only as good as your last performance. Today was not good enough.\u201d\n\nAnd while Mayfield did damage, Chubb\u2019s record run was the backbreaker.\n\nWith the Browns backed up at their 8, Chubb, who had 176 yards on 20 carries, took a handoff and headed right. He cut toward Atlanta\u2019s sideline, picked up a block and then showed his surprising breakaway speed while finishing the longest run in team history.\n\nChubb\u2019s run broke the previous team mark held by Bobby Mitchell, who had a 90-yard TD run against Washington on Nov. 15, 1959. It was also the second-longest run by a rookie in league history, behind only Bobby Gage\u2019s 97-yard run for Pittsburgh in 1949.\n\n\u201cA great handoff,\u201d Mayfield joked. \u201cWhen I handed it off, it parted like the Red Sea.\u201d\n\nThe score put the Browns ahead 28-10, an unexpected and unescapable hole for the Falcons, who blew a chance to get closer in the fourth when they were stopped inches short of the goal line.\n\n\u201cI told the team I thought we took a step back,\u201d said Falcons coach Dan Quinn. \u201cThat\u2019s tough to see and tough to say. I also told them we must regroup. We\u2019re trying to fight for consistency, and we certainly made improvement over the last three weeks, and we didn\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nJULIO MILESTONE\n\nOne of the few positives for the Falcons was receiver Julio Jones, who had 107 yards and became the fastest player to reach 10,000 with a 30-yard catch in the second quarter. Jones reached the 10,000-yard plateau in his 104th game, 11 quicker than Calvin Johnson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Ryan said of Jones, who is tied with Hall of Famer Randy Moss with 45 career games with 100 yards or more receiving, the most for a player in his first eight seasons. \u201cHe\u2019s a unique and special player. He\u2019s as talented as any player probably that has ever played. His skillset is phenomenal. He works extremely hard. He\u2019s been awesome to be around for his entire career. It\u2019s fun to be a small part of what he\u2019s done so far.\u201d\n\nWISHBONE WISH\n\nKitchens joked earlier in the week he might bring back the \u201cwishbone\u201d \u2014 a three-back formation popular with college teams in the 1970s. And sure enough, the Browns used a variation of the wishbone on several plays.\n\n\u201cIt was something, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Mayfield said, drawing laughter. \u201cIt is something different. We threw a different look. We moved the ball well. It was just a thing to switch up the tempo, and I think it was great for our offense.\u201d\n\nSTRANGE CALL\n\nWhile Mayfield was sublime in the first half, the Browns did have one interception.\n\nRunning back Dontrell Hilliard took a pitch and threw an ill-advised pass back toward Mayfield, who was well covered and the ball was picked by Falcons safety Damonte Kazee, who leads the league with five interceptions.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFalcons: Host the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 18.\n\nBrowns: Bye week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Ram\u00f3n Abila of Argentina's Boca Juniors, right, and Javier Pinola of Argentina's River Plate go for a header during a Copa Libertadores first leg final match in Buenos AIres, Argentina, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.

Boca Juniors and River Plate drew 2-2 Sunday in a passionately contested first leg of the Copa Libertadores final that was delayed by a day because of thunder, lightning and a torrential downpour.\n\nThe two Argentine clubs hold one of the fiercest rivalries in soccer and it had been called \u201cThe Game of the Century\u201d because it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve met in the final of South America\u2019s equivalent of the Champions League. It did not disappoint.\n\nVisiting supporters were not allowed because of concerns for potential violence. But home fans at a sold-out La Bombonera Stadium roared when Boca forward Ramon Abila opened the scoring in the 34th minute with a powerful left-foot shot that went through the hands of goalkeeper Franco Armani into the top left corner. Two minutes later, the raucous noise turned to near silence as River striker Lucas Pratto equalized, sending the ball into the bottom left corner.\n\nThe end-to-end game intensified with further goals.\n\nForward Dario Benedetto made it 2-1 to Boca with a header in first-half stoppage time before Boca defender Carlos Izquierdoz scored an own-goal in the 61st as he tried to deflect a free kick with his head.\n\nBenedetto\u2019s goals had helped Boca reach the final. He proved himself again when he came into the game in the 26th after Cristian Pavon left the field in tears with a muscle injury.\n\n\u201cBoth teams had a good game and the result was fair for both,\u201d Benedetto said. \u201cI think Boca\u2019s soccer was better, but River also had its merits.\u201d\n\nThe match was postponed Saturday because heavy rain flooded the field. The second leg will be played at River\u2019s Monumental de Nunez stadium on Nov. 24.\n\nRiver dominated the start and had the clearest chances but Boca goalkeeper Agustin Rossi made a series of superb saves.\n\n\u201cThe Boca goalkeeper had two or three spectacular saves ... We were shooting to goal well but he was saving some very good shots,\u201d said Pratto, who was voted player of the match. \u201cIt was very good to draw the game and we hope that in the next one we can be champions. It will be \u2018Kill or be killed.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoca could have won in the last minute when veteran striker Carlos Tevez broke through into the box and passed the ball to Benedetto, but his point-blank shot was blocked by River\u2019s Armani, who is considered one of the best goalkeepers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe were ahead twice and we couldn\u2019t hold the result,\u201d Boca coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto said. \u201cWe had the game in our hands, but we let it escape from us.\u201d\n\nComing back twice felt like a triumph for River especially since coach Marcelo Gallardo missed the game. He had been sanctioned for failing to follow a previous suspension that banned him from contacting his players during the tournament\u2019s semifinals.\n\nBoca has won the title six times, one behind Argentine club Independiente\u2019s South American record of seven.

Caught dribbling out the clock at game\u2019s end, Kersey realized the shot clock was going to expire before the game clock did, so rather than allowing himself to add a turnover to his stat line, he passed it.\n\n\u201cI looked to the bench and they were like, \u2018Don\u2019t shoot it,\u2019\u201d he said, explaining his intentions. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to shoot it, but I was like, the shot clock is still on, that means whoever has it is going to get a turnover, so I just held it a little bit and just passed it away.\u201d\n\nAnd earned kudos from his coach in the process.\n\n\u201cI actually was impressed with that crafty move at the end,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nGuy scored 17 in the first half, matching the Colonials\u2019 total, as Virginia (2-0) opened the big advantage.\n\nThe Colonials (0-3) attempted to make a run in the second half, making six of their first nine shots, including four 3-pointers. They got within 42-25 by scoring the first eight points after halftime, but Virginia scored the next six and the visitors never threatened again.\n\nEven so, coach Maurice Joseph appreciated that they never gave up.\n\n\u201cSome grit, fight,\u201d he said of what he liked from his team. The only senior on the roster is walk-on Malcolm Bashari-Rashed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team that\u2019s young and inexperienced,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pay a great deal of attention to our record.

He also played in Virginia\u2019s opener but didn\u2019t score.\n\nBennett joked that Kersey will have to earn his own jersey, and one that fits. Kersey and teammate De\u2019Andre Hunter confirmed that one is on the way.\n\nWhile Kersey enjoyed playing with the school\u2019s name on his back, he\u2019ll like the new one when it arrives. It will bear No. 13 and, if it arrives in time, could make its debut when Virginia hosts Coppin State next Friday.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nGeorge Washington: The Colonials blew a 22-0 lead in their opener, losing 77-74 to Stony Brook in overtime, and things have only gotten more difficult since.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Drew Brees and the Saints rocked Paul Brown Stadium from the opening drive, scoring every time they got the ball except for the last one.\n\nThen they cranked up the music in the locker room until the cinderblock walls were vibrating, too.\n\nFor New Orleans, it was as much fun as it gets in the NFL.\n\nBrees threw three touchdown passes in a blistering first half, moving ahead of Brett Favre for second place on the career list, and New Orleans rolled to its eighth straight victory Sunday, 51-14 over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThen they blasted the music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time,\u201d said Brees, who was 22 of 25 for 265 yards and a near-perfect passer rating of 150.4. \u201cWe know how to have fun when it\u2019s time to have fun.\u201d\n\nBrees led the Saints to touchdowns on all five first-half possessions with a nearly perfect performance \u2014 only two incompletions. His 17-yard TD to Michael Thomas with 2 seconds left in the half gave him 509 career touchdown passes, one more than Favre.\n\nUp next: Peyton Manning\u2019s record 539.\n\n\u201cIf you play long enough, I guess those things happen,\u201d Brees said. \u201cI consider myself very grateful, very blessed.\n\n\u201cJust take \u2019em one at a time, keep plugging along, and hopefully there\u2019s more to go\u201d\n\nBrees had his way with the Bengals\u2019 historically bad defense , even diving over the pile to score a 1-yard touchdown. Cincinnati (5-4) became the first team in the Super Bowl era to give up 500 yards in three consecutive games; New Orleans finished with 509.\n\nThe Bengals matched the most lopsided defeat in franchise history and gave up the second-most points in club history. In the first half alone, the Saints piled up 311 yards and had 21 first downs on 40 plays. Brees was 18 of 20 for 214 yards with three touchdowns in the opening half.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in shock after a loss like that,\u201d linebacker Jordan Evans said.\n\nIn the last four games, the Bengals have given up 481, 551, 576 and 509 yards. They\u2019re on pace to give up the most yards in NFL history.\n\n\u201cObviously, your confidence gets shaken,\u201d coach Marvin Lewis said. \u201cI just addressed that with them. They have to focus and get determined. It\u2019s their job to do it right.\u201d\n\nWith his 3rd pass TD today, Drew Brees passes Brett Favre for the 2nd-most pass TD in NFL history (508).

Ingram had 13 rushes for 104 yards, and Kamara scored twice as New Orleans picked up 244 yards on the ground.\n\n\u201cLook, this was a good game, but it wasn\u2019t a perfect game,\u201d Payton said.\n\nPretty close.

(AP) \u2014 Maryland freshman Shakira Austin stole the ball, dribbled almost the length of court and threw a deft pass to Kaila Charles, who was running down the far side for an easy layup.\n\nWhile the No. 9 Terrapins are still a work in progress, they are already getting key contributions from almost everyone on their deep and talented roster.\n\nCharles scored 22 points, freshman Taylor Mikesell added 15 and No. 9 Maryland won for the second time in three days, beating Dayton 82-71 on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMy teammates were finding me, I was running hard in transition and they were getting me the ball,\u201d Charles said. \u201cIt was kind of easy to make layups when you\u2019re wide open and your teammates are feeding you.\u201d\n\nBlair Watson and Austin had 14 points apiece for Maryland.\n\nAfter routing Coppin State 93-36 in the opener, the Terrapins (2-0) got a tougher fight from the resilient Flyers, who were 13 of 30 from beyond the arc.\n\nRedshirt junior Julia Chandler led Dayton (1-1) with 23 points. Lauren Cannatelli added 12 points and junior guard Jayla Scaife, the team\u2019s leading returning scorer, scored 10 for the Flyers .\n\n\u201cThis was a great game for us,\u201d Dayton coach Shauna Green said. \u201cMaryland is a really good team. This was a good experience and we\u2019re going to learn a lot from this game.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins led by 23 midway through the first half, but Dayton chipped away and cut the margin to 51-41 on a jumper by Cannatelli with 6:56 left in the third quarter.\n\nMaryland coach Brenda Frese called a timeout and Maryland picked up the pressure. The Terrapins forced a pair of turnovers and layup and free throw by Mikesell boosted the lead to 60-43 with 4:37 remaining.\n\nDayton beat Colgate 67-58 on Friday, but the Terrapins provided a much bigger challenge, especially in the front court. Maryland was aggressive inside and finished with 13 steals, including five from Watson.\n\n\u201cI think you saw a great Dayton team and why they\u2019ve been in the NCAA Tournament for so many years,\u201d Frese said. \u201cThey played a tremendously 40 minute game and they never quit. These types of games are the types of games we want to be in.\u201d\n\nWatson made another layup that pushed the lead back to 20 with 3:03 remaining in third quarter and the Flyers never recovered. A pair of free throws by Austin gave the Terrapins 78-58 lead with 6:17 left in the game.\n\nMaryland now leads the all-time series 2-1. The Flyers won the previous meeting 56-53 in 2001.\n\nStephanie Jones finished with 11 points for the Terrapins.\n\nTROUBLESOME TURNOVERS\n\nThe Terrapins committed 25 turnovers, which led to 19 points for the Flyers. Frese said the mistakes are a byproduct of the early season. \u201cWe need to clean that up and as we get more reps together, that will drastically improve,\u201d she said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nDayton: Scaife and Cannatelli are the only starters back from last year\u2019s team that went 23-7 and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the eighth time in nine seasons. Despite the double-digit loss to Maryland, Dayton has several new playmakers in the fold, most notably Chandler and speedy redshirt sophomore Araion Bradshaw, and will be a force in the Atlantic 10.\n\nMaryland: The Terrapins have a deep and talented team that will pose matchup problems for most of their opponents this season. In addition to returning four of their top five leading scorers from last year, Maryland is already getting key contributions from the freshmen duo of Mikesell and Austin.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDayton: Hosts Northeastern on Saturday.\n\nMaryland: Makes the short trip to Washington, D.C., for a game against George Washington on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Matt Kuchar had gone four years, six months and three weeks since his last PGA Tour victory.\n\nThe last few holes Sunday at the Mayakoba Golf Classic must have felt just as long.\n\nKuchar started the final round with a four-shot lead and made only two bogeys in the first 67 holes he played at El Camaleon Golf Club. And then he made back-to-back bogeys, Danny Lee holed a birdie putt from off the 16th green, and Kuchar had no margin for error.\n\nHe finished with three pars, making nervy 3-footers on the last two holes, to close with a 2-under 69 for a one-shot victory and a big sigh of relief.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want a 3-footer on the last hole,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cI was hoping to have a three or four-shot lead for some wiggle room. But man, that felt awfully good.\u201d\n\nLee, the only player to sustain a serious threat against Kuchar, finished with two pars for a 65.\n\nKuchar still wasn\u2019t entirely in the clear. His 15-foot birdie attempt on the 17th rolled about 3 1/2 feet by the hole, and he had to make that for par to stay in the lead. And on the final hole, he left his 30-foot birdie putt about 3 feet short and had to roll that in for the victory.\n\n\u201cThat was some of the best ball-striking I\u2019ve had, and through 60 some holes, awfully good putting,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cAnd then the putter kind of went a little bit on the fritz there coming in.

In a league it was accustomed to dominating until 2013, the 20-time English champions are now further behind City than at any time in the Premier League after 12 games.\n\nSALAH\u2019S STREAK\n\nIn six league games at home, Mohamed Salah has now scored in five of them \u2014 with the only blank coming against City\n\nThe Egypt forward capitalized on some quick thinking for the latest. There were just 14 seconds between the flag being raised for offside, with Fulham having a goal ruled out, and Salah finding the net at the other end of the field.\n\nLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson took a quick free kick to find right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who played in Salah to race in on goal and put the hosts ahead in the 41st minute. Salah now has 34 goals in 36 appearances at Anfield since joining Liverpool in the offseason of 2017.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri doubled Liverpool\u2019s lead in the 53rd minute, a cushioned volley into the corner from Andrew Robertson\u2019s deep cross, as last-place Fulham slumped to a seventh straight loss in all competitions.\n\nARSENAL LATE LEVELER\n\nHaving already drawn against the Manchester clubs, Wolves was heading toward their biggest win of their first season back in the top flight since 2012.\n\nIvan Cavaleiro\u2019s 13th-minute strike put Wolves ahead after capitalizing on a mistake by Granit Xhaka. But Henrikh Mkhitaryan inswinging cross went over everyone in the penalty area and ended up in the far corner of the net to rescue a point for Arsenal.\n\nSARRI RECORD\n\nDespite Chelsea failing to score in a match at Stamford Bridge for the first time this season, the draw with Chelsea was still a landmark for Mauricio Sarri. The Italian has now gone 12 matches unbeaten \u2014 a record start for a new manager in the Premier League.\n\nMarcos Alonso struck the post and a slew of saves from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford also frustrated Chelsea, which came into the game with the second-most goals in the league under Sarri.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FORT DEFIANCE, Ariz.

The two were the most dominant drivers this season and will race next week at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the title against reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr. and Joey Logano.\n\nHarvick finished fifth to close a week in which his team was penalized for cheating. He started from the pole but had a harder day than expected because of a flat tire early in the race.\n\nHarvick was aided when teammate Kurt Busch was wrecked late in the race, taking Kurt Busch out of the running for a championship berth.\n\n___\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing had a disastrous sequence that cost two of its drivers a shot at the championship.\n\nClint Bowyer wrecked during the second stage of Sunday\u2019s race at ISM Raceway. During the caution period for Bowyer\u2019s accident, leader Kurt Busch passed the pace car and was penalized for one lap.\n\nBusch was leading the race when he was penalized. He argued that the pace car was driving slower than pit road speed, and that\u2019s how he passed the car as he ducked off the track.\n\nThe penalty on Busch gave the lead to Martin Truex Jr.\n\nKevin Harvick restarted third.\n\n____\n\n1:25 p.m.\n\nChampionship contender Joey Logano has crashed out of the final warmup race.\n\nLogano is the only driver already qualified for next week\u2019s championship race. He earned his berth by winning at Martinsville three races ago and it allowed him to relax at ISM Raceway. He had nothing on the line and is already looking ahead to the finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nSeven drivers are racing for the final three slots in the championship round.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Harvick has driven through a pack of traffic after falling to 30th and down a lap because of a flat tire. By the time Logano crashed, Harvick had already moved to 19th in the field and back to the lead lap.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nA flat tire may have derailed Kevin Harvick\u2019s run to another championship.\n\nHarvick was dominating Sunday\u2019s race and had led every lap until he ducked onto pit road with a sudden flat tire. Harvick led the first 72 laps but dropped to 30th in the field after the issue. He also went down one lap from the leaders.\n\nChase Elliott won the first stage after inheriting the lead when Harvick had to stop for new tires.\n\nElliott needs to win at ISM Raceway to advance into the championship round next week.\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nKevin Harvick led the field to the start of NASCAR\u2019s final race to set the championship field. The 2014 champion has dominated all weekend at ISM Raceway and is trying to show his team can overcome a cheating scandal and still win the title.\n\nHarvick is a nine-time winner at the track outside of Phoenix and his No. 4 Ford has been the fastest car here since his Stewart-Haas Racing team unloaded it from the hauler. Harvick was fastest in Saturday\u2019s final practices, won the pole, and pulled out to a quick lead when the race began.\n\nHe dominated a week ago at Texas to win and earn an automatic berth into the championship race. But NASCAR ruled that winning car was illegal and stripped Harvick of that slot in the Homestead-Miami Speedway finale. So Harvick has approached Phoenix as if he\u2019s got something to prove while chasing the championship.\n\nSeven drivers are vying for three spots in the title race and only Joey Logano is already qualified into the final four.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "WAGONER, Okla.

BC, which could have contended for a spot in the conference title game, now looks ahead to games at Florida State and at home against No. 12 Syracuse for a chance at a nine-win season that would be its best in a decade.\n\nThe Eagles (7-3, 4-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) dropped five spots in the AP Top 25 on Sunday to No. 22.\n\n\u201cOn a stage like this, you\u2019d like to feel like you got your full complement, you know? But that didn\u2019t happen. And that\u2019s life,\u201d Addazio said after the game. \u201cSo I\u2019m more concerned now about getting ready for Florida State and getting ourselves back in the groove.\u201d\n\nBrown was brought down by defensive tackle Christian Wilkins on the Eagles\u2019 first offensive series, with the 315-pound lineman landing on him with the full force of his body weight. He walked off on his own but went to the locker room soon after and was taken to a hospital during the game.\n\nAddazio said Brown had internal injuries but declined to elaborate. BC spokesman Jason Baum said on Sunday there was no further information on the injury.\n\nWith backup EJ Perry replacing Brown, the BC offense failed to score; the Eagles scored their only points on Michael Walker\u2019s 74-yard punt return. A sophomore who had never thrown a pass in college before, Perry went 12 for 21 for 98 yards in the game.\n\nAddazio said he didn\u2019t know the extent of Brown\u2019s injury. But wasn\u2019t ready to write him off like he did last year, when the quarterback blew out his ACL \u2014 also in the 10th game \u2014 after BC had won three straight ACC games in what was seen as a turning point for a program that had gone winless in the league just two years earlier.\n\nBecause Brown needed most of the next 10 months to recuperate, Perry ran the first-team offense for much of the spring and summer.\n\n\u201cEJ is a stud. We go against him in camp,\u201d defensive lineman Zach Allen said. \u201cThe stuff he can do with his legs, you aren\u2019t going to find a more mobile guy. We have all of the faith in him, and now we have a whole week to help him prepare. ... He\u2019s going to step up and I\u2019m excited for EJ, I really am.

The Blue Devils shot 54 percent from the field and made 12 of 26 3-pointers, shared the ball (22 assists) and took care of it even at their quick pace (four turnovers).\n\nThe question is whether this was a best-case show of Duke\u2019s potential, or a sign of things to come for a team that will \u2014 somehow \u2014 find ways to play better.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of times throughout the game that I felt like we let off on a lot of things,\u201d freshman guard Tre Jones said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched film on the game already and we have picked out on what we need to improve on from that game in particular.

By September, the hybrid grass showed progress for a match between Cruz Azul and Atlas, but it regressed in October. A couple of concerts by the Colombian singer Shakira caused damage and it has not improved since.\n\nArturo Olive, director of the NFL office in Mexico, said recently he was not concerned about the state of the field and that NFL personnel were working along with the groundskeepers from Azteca to get it right for the game.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke (14) is sacked by Ohio State linebacker Tuf Borland (32) during the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in East Lansing, Mich.

The Spartans aren\u2019t exactly at full strength, but this was still an encouraging win for Ohio State. Michigan State had only one red zone opportunity and no touchdowns. The only time the Spartans reached the end zone was on a trick play that was called back for a penalty.\n\n\u201cWe knew exactly what this would be, and it was. That was November football at Michigan State,\u201d Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. \u201cI\u2019m really ecstatic for the defense, for our defense the way they came out.\u201d\n\nThe win didn\u2019t do much for Ohio State\u2019s ranking, which dropped one spot to No. 9 in Sunday\u2019s AP poll . But after allowing 49 points in a loss to Purdue and 31 in a win over Nebraska, the Buckeyes (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten, No. 10 CFP) held the Spartans (6-4, 4-3, No. 18) to 274 yards and 12 first downs.\n\nOhio State lost All-American defensive end Nick Bosa to a core muscle injury Sept. 15, and he decided to leave school and focus on getting ready for the NFL draft. The Buckeyes had held only three teams under 26 points this season \u2014 Rutgers, Tulane and Minnesota \u2014 before Saturday\u2019s game in chilly East Lansing.\n\nMichigan State is without running back LJ Scott, and quarterback Brian Lewerke has had injury issues as well. The Spartans are also without standout receiver Felton Davis. Michigan State used both Lewerke and Rocky Lombardi at quarterback against the Buckeyes. Lombardi was in when a shotgun snap hit the man in motion, and Jones recovered the fumble in the end zone to give Ohio State a 16-6 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a great push out front,\u201d Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \u201cWe continue to try and find ways to be able to run the football. Obviously, we struggled today. We were backed up like five straight times there and really not able to run some of our offense.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans were pinned back for much of the second half because of superb punting by Ohio State\u2019s Drue Chrisman. The Buckeyes\u2019 defense was repeatedly in good situations. On one possession, Ohio State kept Michigan State back near its own goal line, and the Spartans took an intentional safety instead of trying to punt. Jones scored his defensive touchdown a short while later.\n\nIf Ohio State wins at Maryland next weekend, that sets up a showdown with rival Michigan with the division title at stake. That will likely be billed as a matchup between Ohio State\u2019s dynamic offense and Michigan\u2019s stellar defense.\n\nObviously, any improvement by the Buckeyes on the defensive side of the ball is a welcome sign for Ohio State after what\u2019s been an uneven season so far.\n\n\u201cI think it comes down to the brotherhood. We are super close together and we are out there for our brothers,\u201d safety Brendon White said. \u201cWe are not going to try and do too extra. We are not trying to play for ourselves, but we play for our brothers.

For the season, he has thrown for 1,824 yards and 15 touchdowns with four interceptions, and run for 218 yards and four scores.\n\nWimbush ran for 68 yards on 12 carries and was not sacked as the offensive line - center Sam Mustipher, guards Aaron Banks and Tommy Kraemer and tackles Liam Eichenberg and Robert Hainsey - had its way with a Florida State defense that had come into the game allowing just 2.84 yards per rush.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for that kind of consistency as a group, and that includes the tight ends (Alize Mack, Cole Kmet and Nic Weishar),\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey were much more effective and efficient.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame did not lose a yard on any of its 50 rushes.

(AP) \u2014 A fatal cougar attack has reignited debates over hound hunting and cougar management in Oregon. Groups of Oregonians, particularly hound hunters, say that Oregon\u2019s cougar population is growing out of control. Cougar advocates, on the other hand, say that Oregon is over-hunting cougars, which research suggests can lead to an increase in problem encounters.\n\nBut before you can figure out if Oregon\u2019s cougars are being over-hunted or under-hunted, you need to know how many cougars there are in the state.\n\nThe Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife estimates there about 6,600 cougars here, and possibly as many as 7,600. That\u2019s three times higher than the numbers reported Washington or Idaho. It\u2019s even slightly higher than the estimate for California: 4,000 to 6,000 cougars are thought to roam the massive state.\n\nBut hunting groups, ranchers and Oregonians who live in cougar country say the Oregon\u2019s cougar count severely underestimates the state\u2019s actual population. Conservationists argue it\u2019s too high. Biologists and wildlife officials from other states say it\u2019s a lot more complicated, and more than just a question of numbers.\n\nOne of the big reasons Oregon\u2019s number is so much higher than its neighbors\u2019: Oregon\u2019s estimate includes kittens, which rarely survive to adulthood, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported .\n\nOregon does not count the juveniles of any other game species, like elk or bighorn sheep.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they don\u2019t clarify themselves every time says that they want people to assume there are 6,600 big cats running around the state,\u201d said John Laundr\u00e9, a predator ecologist at Western Oregon University. \u201cThey don\u2019t include babies for other ephemeral species, like ducks or deer.\u201d And only adult animals can be hunted.\n\nDerek Broman, ODFW\u2019s state carnivore biologist, said whenever he gives a presentation he makes it clear that all ages are included in official population estimates. But there\u2019s no mention of that on the department\u2019s cougar webpage, and you have to look deep into the cougar management plan find adult cat estimates. A brochure specifies that the population includes all age classes, but never offers adult numbers.\n\nEven if you exclude kittens and juvenile cougars from population estimates, Oregon still reports some of the highest densities of adult cougars in the country.\n\nWashington\u2019s research into cougar densities dates back nearly two decades and includes seven study areas. Across those areas, the state has documented consistent findings: Roughly two cougars for every 100 square kilometers, said Rich Beausoleil, the bear and cougar specialist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. He said Washington\u2019s cougar-density numbers are consistent with what other studies \u2014 except Oregon\u2019s \u2014 report.\n\nOregon Department of Fish and Wildlife\u2019s surveys found adult densities twice that, depending on the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen such high densities anywhere in the world,\u201d said Rob Wielgus, former director of the Large Carnivore Conservation Lab at Washington State University, commenting on a controversial density survey conducted by Oregon.\n\nBeausoleil has spoken to ODFW about the state\u2019s population estimates before, and has criticized the design of Oregon\u2019s studies, which he says will naturally overestimate regional populations. Derek Broman says ODFW controlled for overestimation and stands by their data.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for cougar surveys to arrive at different conclusions, said David Stoner, a cougar biologist at Utah State University. Cougars are extremely hard to study because they\u2019re so hard to find.\n\nODFW says these surveys confirm their statewide population estimates, which they calculate using a model. They estimate statewide density by mapping cougar deaths, and then add expected birth rates. They also tweak the numbers depending on food availability in the region.\n\nLaundr\u00e9 said the growth estimate used in the study is an optimistic \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d one: \u201cA model is only as good as what you put into it. I could make their model show that there were only 3,000 total animals or 10,000 total animals.\u201d\n\nAll of this might seem like an internal debate about the best way to count cougars. Everyone agrees that at one point in the 1960s there were only 200 or so cougars in the state, and today there are several thousand. The cats are in no danger of going extinct.\n\nBut a lot rides on accurate population estimates. Not only do these numbers tell management officials if populations are growing or shrinking, they\u2019re used to help set hunting quotas for each region. Some scientists found that when cougars are over-hunted, problem encounters with humans and livestock increase.\n\nWielgus, who has left Washington for the Bend area, was one of the first to identify such a link.\n\n\u201cIn the 20 years of research I did with WDFW, we conducted the largest study of cougars ever done anywhere. We found that heavy retaliatory killing or preventive killing actually causes increased problems,\u201d he said.\n\nIt works like this: Female cougars have smallish overlapping territories that seem to fluctuate with prey abundance. Male cougars have larger, non-overlapping territories that encompass multiple female ones.\n\nOnly large, older males are capable of holding down these territories, \u201cand you don\u2019t get to be a 10-year-old male by attacking humans or livestock or pets.\u201d\n\nBut Wielgus found that those 10-year-old males were far more likely to be killed by hunters. \u201cAnd we found that when you remove an older male, you have two or three teenage males come in to take their place. And those are the ones that are responsible for most bad encounters between cougars and people, as well as the majority of livestock and pet depredations.\u201d\n\nThis movement of younger animals also means it can be difficult to tell if a population is declining due to overhunting or staying the same.\n\nWielgus is a controversial figure in the predator management community, in part for research indicating that hunting wolves can increase attacks on livestock. He says he was silenced and forced out of his position at Washington State University because of his work.\n\nA smattering of papers have attempted to debunk his cougar research, but even more have supported it. One of the most recent was a massive, 30-year look at hunting and problem cougars in British Columbia. For their part, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife stands by Wielgus\u2019 research and their own: Today, they manage cougars specifically to avoid the consequences of over-hunting.\n\n\u201cOur management philosophy is to manage for the social stability of the animal. We want to promote territoriality,\u201d Beausoleil said.\n\nWDFW\u2019s data shows that when more than 14 percent of a cougar population is harvested in a given region, the population starts to skew young, territories dissolve, and problem encounters increase. To avoid this, they split the state into 49 game management units, and each unit allows 12 percent to 16 percent of cougars to be taken. When one of those units reaches that quota, it closes, and hunters can go to an adjacent unit. It\u2019s not a perfect system: Sometimes, it can take a while to close a unit, and more cougars are killed.\n\nAt first glance, Oregon seems to be following Washington\u2019s no-conflict guidelines: On average, Oregon\u2019s hunters take less than 14 percent of the state\u2019s big cats each year. But unlike Washington and Montana, where there are dozens of game management units used to set cougar quotas, Oregon\u2019s cats are divided into just six large regions, which makes it more difficult to track regional densities.\n\nThe statewide quota for 2018 is 970 human-caused deaths \u2014 a whopping 27 percent of the state\u2019s estimated 3,500 adults. Per the cougar management plan, the quota serves as a mortality cap, and not a target. The statewide quota has never been filled, but some of the game management units regularly approach theirs.\n\nZone A, which includes the region where the hiker was attacked, covers the North Cascades and the coast. As of Nov. 6, its humans have killed 167 of the 180 allowed cougars. ODFW estimates there were 989 cougars of all ages in Zone A in 2015. If half of those were adults, then roughly one third of adult cougars in the region were killed: Research suggests that\u2019s a number high enough to cause conflicts with humans.\n\nOverhunting cougars can have impacts on cougars\u2019 societies, too. Once thought of as loners, recent research has revealed cougars\u2019 social lives to be much more complex than previously thought.\n\nMark Elbroch, the director of the puma program at wildcat conservation organization Panthera, studies cougar communities. He\u2019s found that the mountain lions within one male\u2019s territory function like a society: They interact non-aggressively and seem to frequently share food, a favor that\u2019s apparently returned in the future.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that overhunting will have huge impacts on these social networks and organizations, on the glue that holds them together as functioning groups,\u201d Elbroch said.\n\nAnd anecdotally, he\u2019s seen the impacts of removing one large male from that society. After one of his study males was killed by hunters, he noticed a nearby male start to encroach on the old territory, just enough so that it crossed paths with a female and her two cubs. The female charged the strange male, and died. Her cubs lasted a little while, but eventually both died.\n\n\u201cOne could argue that one bullet killed four mountain lions,\u201d Elbroch said.\n\nODFW\u2019s Derek Broman is dismissive of the \u201csocial chaos\u201d hypothesis. He says the department has conducted its own research, and \u201cthere\u2019s no information to suggest chaos and turmoil. Death and mortality is a common occurrence, even outside of human influence.\u201d\n\nOregon officials may dispute the idea that their management practices lead to more problem cougars. But the state does remove more such animals than neighboring states. In 2017 there were 462 such complaints, and 175 cougars were killed. Those numbers remain fairly stable from year to year, though they\u2019ve risen dramatically in the Willamette Valley.\n\nIn comparison, about 100 cougars are killed in California each year for attacking livestock. In 2016, 46 nuisance cougars were killed in Washington.\n\nHunters say that the best way to combat these problem cats is to increase hunting. But unless a large number of cougars are removed over a large area, more will just move in to take their place. That\u2019s why some are calling for a return to hound hunting.\n\nThe theory is this: Hound hunters, unlike normal hunters, can be selective. If their dogs tree a cougar, the hunter can choose if it\u2019s going to be a worthwhile trophy. If the animal is small or female, the hunter can pull their dogs off the tree, and the cougar can live.\n\nThis, say hound hunting advocates, creates a population of scared cougars, who will run away as soon as they hear a human in the forest.\n\nLaundr\u00e9 and Elbroch are skeptical that hound hunting leads to scared cougars, but other biologists think it\u2019s not impossible.\n\n\u201cHound hunting doesn\u2019t have to be a lethal pursuit,\u201d Stoner noted. \u201cYou have the ability to pursue multiple animals over the course of a season, and can in theory select a nice tom.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, that selectivity targets large toms, the exact animals many biologists say are necessary for maintaining cougar social stability. Indeed, when hound hunting was banned in Oregon, the average age of cats killed dropped.\n\nIn the end, biologists say it\u2019s important to remember that the only way most people will ever interact with a cougar is through their livestock or pets.\n\n\u201cCougars aren\u2019t fearsome,\u201d said Laundr\u00e9, who has tracked and collared more than 250 cougars. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a cat behave aggressively.\u201d\n\nAs Teddy Roosevelt noted after chasing a cougar with hounds and stabbing it to death, \u201cHe was more afraid of us than the dogs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KOPB-, http://www.opb.org", "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Archdiocese of Detroit says an allegation that a priest who died in 1994 sexually abused a child at some point has been found to be credible.\n\nThe archdiocese said in a news release Sunday that the complaint against Monsignor Thaddeus Ozog was brought to a review board and shared with prosecutors.\n\nIt says Ozog was ordained in 1956 and served as pastor or associate pastor at parishes in Detroit, Birmingham, Wayne, Waterford, Flat Rock and Hamtramck.\n\nOzog also served from 1959 to 1975 as an instructor, registrar, dean and rector at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear if the allegation against Ozog came about as part of documents turned over by Roman Catholic dioceses across Michigan in a state investigation of sexual abuse by priests.", "Duke's Zion Williamson (1) drives to the basket as Army's Ben Kinker (30) defends during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in Durham, N.C., Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.

And our guys don\u2019t feel good about themselves right now. And that\u2019s good. Although they turned it around in the second half, they were in a position to lose the game and they responded, and they responded really well.\u201d\n\nMatt Wilson scored 15 points and Tommy Funk added 12 for Army (1-1), and Funk hit back-to-back 3s to pull the Black Knights to 67-61 with just over 12 minutes left.\n\nReddish hit a driving layup, and he and Barrett each hit 3s on consecutive possessions to push the lead into double figures for good.

(AP Photo/Rick Scuteri)\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 The three most dominant drivers of this NASCAR season will fittingly race each other for the championship, a chance for Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. to settle which team is truly the best.\n\nIt was Busch who claimed the latest round, winning for the eighth time this year Sunday to tie Harvick for the most Cup victories. His win at ISM Raceway outside of Phoenix was the final qualifying event for next week\u2019s finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, where it will be winner-take-all between NASCAR\u2019s so-called Big Three and the driver once called \u201cSliced Bread.\u201d\n\nBusch, Harvick and reigning series champion Martin Truex Jr., coined The Big Three because of how they dominated the regular season, advanced into the championship round as expected. Joey Logano, nicknamed \u201cSliced Bread\u201d before his NASCAR debut at age 18 because he was predicted to be \u201cthe best thing since ...,\u201d has the fourth spot.\n\nThe field is two Ford drivers, two Toyota drivers and represents four organizations. Chevrolet was shut out of the finale.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you could pick a favorite necessarily,\u201d Busch said. \u201cI would predict this is the best four, the closest four that have been in our sport in a long time.\n\nBusch and Harvick have gone win-for-win all year, and Busch could have controlled Harvick\u2019s fate late in the race when he was lined up against Harvick teammate Aric Almirola on a restart. An Almirola victory would have eliminated Harvick from the playoffs, which Busch acknowledged considering.\n\n\u201cI did think about it,\u201d Busch said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to win the race. They always want it to play out naturally.\u201d\n\nNow Busch might just have the momentum to take the title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think it gives us a lot (of momentum) but I don\u2019t know, talk is cheap,\u201d Busch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to go out there and perform and just do what we need to do. Being able to do what we did here today was certainly beneficial. I didn\u2019t think we were the best car, but we survived and we did what we needed to do. It\u2019s just about getting to next week and once we were locked in, it was \u2018All bets are off and it\u2019s time to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarvick was the favorite to win Sunday and started from the pole but an early flat tire made Sunday\u2019s race more eventful than Harvick expected.\n\nHe found himself racing late against Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Kurt Busch and Aric Almirola for the fourth transfer spot to Homestead, but Busch was wrecked late and Almirola had to win the race to snatch the berth away from Harvick.\n\n\u201cWe kept ourselves in position all day and there at the end, it was just like everybody wrecking and all over the place,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cWe just needed to stay out of trouble and try to find a safe spot there.\u201d\n\nBrad Keselowski and Kyle Larson, both already eliminated from the playoffs, finished second and third. Almirola was fourth and Harvick fifth.\n\nHarvick was stripped of his berth to Homestead that he\u2019d earned by winning a week ago at Texas when NASCAR ruled his car was illegal. The penalty forced him to requalify and he had to do it without his crew chief or car chief. But he\u2019s a nine-time winner at this track, was fastest in practice, started on the pole and led the first 72 laps before his tire went flat.\n\nThat put Harvick back in 30th and one lap down, and he had to work his way back to the front the rest of the race. He was aided by a flurry of mistakes by the other championship contenders. Clint Bowyer had a flat tire that caused him to wreck, Kurt Busch was wrecked and that accident collected Chase Elliott, who earlier had been penalized for speeding on pit road. Kurt Busch also had been penalized early in the race for passing the pace car.\n\nThe intensity of the race picked up with a flurry of late cautions that began when Ricky Stenhouse Jr. wrecked with 48 laps remaining. Stewart-Haas Racing used split strategy on the ensuing pit stop as Kurt Busch stayed on the track to move into second and Harvick pitted for new tires to restart sixth. NASCAR then stopped the race for the extensive cleanup needed for Stenhouse\u2019s crash and the cars parked on the track for close 11 minutes.\n\nBut Kurt Busch never got to find out if his strategy was the right one as he was promptly wrecked on the restart. Denny Hamlin, trying to keep his streak of winning at least once in every season, aggressively tried to dart to the front and while doing so shoved Busch\u2019s car into the wall. As Busch\u2019s car ricocheted back into traffic he tagged Chase Elliott to end Elliott\u2019s bid to race his way into the finale.\n\n\u201cDenny came out of nowhere and cleaned us out,\u201d said Kurt Busch.\n\nAlex Bowman then spun, NASCAR again stopped the race for a cleanup, and Aric Almirola used the sequence to make his play for the victory. He restarted third, behind teammate Harvick, on the restart.\n\nAlmirola dove to the bottom of the track to slip past Harvick and move into second. Another caution with 17 laps remaining put Almirola on the front row alongside Kyle Busch for the restart with 12 to go. But Almirola didn\u2019t have much for Kyle Busch, who pulled away. With Almirola out of contention for the victory, Harvick was finally in the clear.\n\nMore from ISM Raceway:\n\nLOGANO CRASHES: Logano had a short day at Phoenix because his left rear tire went flat and caused him to spin. He wound up 37th with an early exit, but didn\u2019t think it would hurt his momentum for the championship.\n\n\u201cThese things are out of your control, so it doesn\u2019t really knock your confidence down,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing my team could do different, so there\u2019s really nothing to get depressed about.\u201d\n\nLogano believes he\u2019s the favorite to win the title because by winning the opening race of this round to qualify for Homestead gave Team Penske two additional weeks to focus on the main event.\n\nUP NEXT: The season finale and championship race Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Spokesman Tallman Trask said new regulations can lead to increased sales but the initiative will not lead to \u201conerous restrictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it really boils down to is people are a little unsure of how to respond to new regulations and they go out and buy new firearms,\u201d Trask said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nGun dealers want clarity from state regulators on parts of the new law such as the training requirement. Buyers must show they have completed a \u201crecognized firearm safety training program\u201d in the last five years that covers issues such as handling, storage and suicide prevention. The training must be sponsored by a law-enforcement agency, college or university, nationally recognized organization or firearms training school.\n\nGaughran said his store may develop a \u201cquick test\u201d to administer at the counter or online.\n\nSome parts of the country reported a slump in gun sales following the election of President Donald Trump. Jason Cazes, owner of LowPriceGuns.com in Bellevue, increased his inventory because he anticipated Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what drives sales in the gun business: the possibility of regulation coming or fear in the world,\u201d Cazes said. \u201cThis summer was the worst summer I\u2019ve ever had in sales.\u201d\n\nBruce Smith, manager of Surplus Ammo and Arms in Tacoma, said he\u2019s seen a small increase in business and questions since the election but \u201cit hasn\u2019t been crazy because it\u2019s not federal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows or is pretty inclined to think that under Trump there is probably not going to be federal legislation, so it\u2019s going to be a state-by-state thing,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe panic isn\u2019t there.

The feminist activist group FEMEN claimed responsibility for the protest. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 A feminist activist pretending to be a photographer managed to breach security at a huge international ceremony in Paris and disrupt U.S. Presidential Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade as part of a peace protest.\n\nWith thousands of security forces deployed around the French capital, questions swirled around how the woman and two other activists from feminist group Femen got so close to scores of world leaders gathered on the Champs-Elysees to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\nPhotographers accredited by the French presidential palace noticed that a woman in their midst was using a fake identity, according to Ludovic Marin, an Agence France Presse photographer who heads the media liaison committee with the French presidential palace.\n\nThe photographers alerted French presidential officials as well as police, and the woman was led away, Marin said. However, soon afterward she dashed out onto the Champs-Elysees in front of Trump\u2019s motorcade, shouting \u201cfake peace maker.\u201d\n\nAt that point, she was detained along with two other Femen protesters in the crowds of onlookers along the Champs-Elysees. All three had \u201cfake peace makers\u201d scrawled across their breasts, according to Inna Shevchenko, one of Femen\u2019s leaders.\n\nThe three are facing charges of sexual exhibitionism, a judicial official said.\n\nShevchenko would not comment on the fake photographer ploy. She said all three arrested activists had been in areas open to the general public, and that their action was peaceful.\n\nMarin expressed concern that the woman \u201cusurped the identity\u201d of a legitimate photographer to get permission to cover the high-security event, and that this could have negative consequences for real photographers seeking permission to cover presidential events.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s office would not comment on how the woman was accredited using a false identity.\n\nA Paris police official said authorities were investigating the breach. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner sought to play down the incident, and was quoted by BFM television as saying the women were unarmed and security of the event was \u201cin no way threatened.\u201d\n\nFemen activists have breached security before at major events and staged protests in front of Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and others.\n\nShevchenko said the point of Sunday\u2019s protest was to \u201cdenounce this hypocrisy\u201d of holding an event celebrating peace with leaders such as Trump and Putin \u201cwho represent everything but not peace.\u201d\n\nShe singled out Trump for criticism for his \u201caggressive attitude toward European leaders and hostile ideas\u201d toward multilateral cooperation.\n\nMacron also criticized the kind of nationalism that Trump espouses, but his office insisted on the importance of inviting the American president and other leaders because of their role in World War I.\n\nShevechenko dismissed the \u201csexual exhibitionism\u201d accusation as an effort by French authorities to \u201csay that women\u2019s bodies are supposed to be regarded as sexual by definition. We claim the opposite, that women\u2019s bodies are sexual when women decide it, and they can be political when we decide it.\u201d", "Texas deputy shot in face during standoff out of hospital\n\nLA GRANGE, Texas (AP) \u2014 A Texas deputy who investigators say was shot in the face by a suspect while trying to serve a warrant has been discharged from an Austin hospital.\n\nAn ambulance carrying Fayette County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Calvin \u201cCJ\u201d Lehmann was escorted to his home Saturday by other officers.\n\nLehmann was critically injured Nov. 1 during a standoff in La Grange, 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Austin.

(AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s president said he dissolved Parliament and called elections to avoid possible violence inside Parliament and around the country if a vote had to be taken to decide whether his chosen prime minister or his sacked rival had the majority support.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation Sunday evening, President Maithripala Sirisena said he heard stories from lawmakers on both sides of possible violence in Parliament that could even result in deaths and clashes spreading around the country.\n\n\u201cIt appeared to me that, if I allowed the Parliament to be convened on the 14th, without dissolving it, it could have brought about commotion and fights in every city and every village would lead to very unpleasant and difficult situation for the average citizens of my beloved country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs such, the best solution was not to allow those 225 members in the Parliament to fight each other and allow that to develop into a street fights in every part of the country. It is my duty and the responsibility to ... create the situation for the 15 million voters in this country takes the ultimate decision by choosing their members to the Parliament through a free and fair election.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. and foreign governments have expressed concerns over Sirisena\u2019s decision to dissolve Parliament on Friday and his earlier sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe, who he replaced with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe says his sacking is unconstitutional and that he still has a majority support in Parliament.\n\nSirisena initially suspended Parliament until Nov. 16, delaying the possibility of testing the majority. He then dissolved it after being unable to secure support for Rajapaksa and called for elections to take place on Jan. 5. Several political parties have said they will petition the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to nullify Parliament\u2019s dissolution.\n\nA statement from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s office recently expressed concern.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary-General underlines the utmost importance of respecting democratic processes and institutions and resolving differences in accordance with the rule of law and due process,\u201d his deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, said.\n\nIn his address to the nation, Sirisena also appeared to issue a warning about Wickremesinghe remaining in the official residence of the prime minister.\n\nHe said only his new prime minister and Cabinet ministers were entitled to use state vehicles and assets at a time of transition and said he will deploy police to take over state assets and take legal action against violators if those assets were not surrendered.\n\nSirisena and Wickremesinghe, who were leading traditionally opposed parties, were part of an awkward coalition government until Wickremesinghe\u2019s sacking on Oct. 26.\n\nTensions had been building for some time between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe, who had introduced economic reforms the president did not approve. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, an accusation Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena also has criticized investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka\u2019s long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is considered a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nRajapaksa on Sunday left his longtime political party and joined another, in a move that could weaken Sirisena.\n\nRajapaksa joined the Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front, a party of which he was shadow leader for months. A large number of members of Sirisena\u2019s Sri Lanka Freedom Party, are likely to join Rajapaksa because he has the biggest following among them.\n\nHowever, both Rajapaksa and Sirisena have said they will face the Jan. 5 election together.\n\nHundreds of people gathered in Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s capital, on Sunday for a candle light vigil protesting what they purported an unconstitutional dissolution of parliament.", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 A winter storm snarled traffic and left more than six inches of snow in some areas of central Colorado.\n\nIcy roadways and a crash involving more than a dozen vehicles on Interstate 70 in Denver on Sunday triggered an hours-long closure of westbound lanes of the highway.

We\u2019ve got to play better. We can\u2019t give up 50 points and expect to be a playoff defense, a playoff team.\u201d\n\nThe Sooners have made big plays at times on defense \u2014 Robert Barnes ran back an interception on a 2-point conversion for two critical points against Texas Tech and Tre Brown got a deflection on the 2-point conversion against Oklahoma State.\n\n\u201cGetting critical stops?\u201d McNeill said. \u201cIs that a category? Maybe somebody should look that up. Getting critical stops and stopping the two-point play was pretty big. The two-point play last week for an interception, it helped us win.\u201d\n\nBut the Sooners are struggling, especially in the first half of games. Oklahoma allowed 24 points in the first half against TCU, though one of those scores was on a kickoff return; 31 in the first half against Texas Tech and 28 in the first half against Oklahoma State.\n\nMcNeill aware that there are critics, but he\u2019s focused on his FIDO mantra \u2014 Forget It and Drive On.

The challenges that we got coming up are going to be there. But the great thing for us right now is that every goal we want to be in front of us is right there in front of us.\u201d\n\nOklahoma\u2019s next chance to show improvement will be Saturday against Kansas. The Sooners want to get things right before they face West Virginia\u2019s powerful offense the following week. But even if the Sooners don\u2019t put up the numbers they want, they are most concerned with the number on the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cWhat do I think?\u201d McNeill said. \u201cWin by one.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Stepping up Democratic efforts to shield the Russia investigation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday he would seek to tie a measure protecting special counsel Robert Mueller to must-pass legislation if acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker does not recuse himself from oversight of the probe.\n\nSchumer pointed to Whitaker\u2019s \u201chistory of hostile statements\u201d toward the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cIf he stays there, he will create a constitutional crisis by inhibiting Mueller or firing Mueller. So Congress has to act,\u201d Schumer told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe Democrats, House and Senate, will attempt to add to must-pass legislation, in this case the spending bill, legislation that would prevent Mr. Whitaker from interfering with the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nSchumer sent a letter to the Justice Department on Sunday along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats that calls for Lee Lofthus, an assistant attorney general and the department\u2019s chief ethics officer, to disclose whether he had advised Whitaker to recuse himself from oversight of the probe. The Democrats cited Whitaker\u2019s past public statements, which have included an op-ed article in which he said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated President Donald Trump\u2019s family finances and a talk radio interview in which he maintained there was no evidence of collusion between the Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nThe letter asked Lofthus to explain his reasoning for any recommendation he made to Whitaker regarding recusal and to provide all ethics guidance provided to the acting attorney general.\n\nWhitaker, a Republican Party loyalist and chief of staff to just-ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was elevated Wednesday after Trump forced Sessions out.\n\nWhitaker has faced pressure from Democrats to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller based on the comments, which were made before he joined the Justice Department last year. He has also tweeted an ex-prosecutor\u2019s opinion piece that described a \u201cMueller lynch mob,\u201d which he said was \u201cworth a read.\u201d\n\nThe Mueller protection bill would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek review of a firing and ensure that the person was fired for good cause.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Republicans would agree to add the bill to the spending legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said there is no need for it, but other Republicans, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, have called for the bill since Whitaker was appointed.\n\nSchumer declined to say whether Democrats would be willing to force a government shutdown if Congress did not pass a measure protecting Mueller, suggesting it wouldn\u2019t come to that because of bipartisan support. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t add this and avoid a constitutional crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, we will see what happens down the road.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan Mueller legislation was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in April and was co-sponsored by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker as \u201can attack\u201d on the Mueller investigation and said protecting that probe will be his committee\u2019s top priority. Nadler told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d if Whitaker is still acting attorney general when Nadler becomes Judiciary chairman next year, \u201cone of our first orders of business will be to invite him, and if necessary to subpoena him, to appear before the committee.\u201d", "This undated photo provided by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities shows a World War II-era, truss-style bridge at Mile 1309 of the Alaska Highway near Tok, Alaska.

(AP Photo/Andre Penner)\n\nSAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Ten years after securing his first Formula One title at Interlagos, five-time world champion Lewis Hamilton won the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday and helped his Mercedes team take the Formula One constructors\u2019 title for the fifth straight year.\n\nIt was Hamilton\u2019s 10th victory of the season, finishing 1.4 seconds ahead of Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen.\n\nBut it could have been a very different outcome for the British driver, who struggled with engine problems and medium tires as he waited for rain that never came.\n\nHamilton\u2019s second win in Sao Paulo was only possible after Force India\u2019s backmarker Esteban Ocon clashed with race leader Verstappen on lap 44, causing both cars to spin. At the time, the Red Bull driver led Hamilton by five seconds.\n\n\u201cThat (incident) put us back in contention,\u201d Hamilton said of his rival\u2019s setback. \u201cMax is that go-getter guy and every now and again it bites you. But I am really, really proud here, I don\u2019t care about anybody else.\u201d\n\nOff the track, the 21-year-old Dutchman later confronted \u2014 and pushed \u2014 former Formula 3 rival Ocon, who refused to apologize despite the stop-go punishment he was given during the race. The Force India driver finished 15th.\n\nVerstappen managed to stay in the race after the incident and get closer to Hamilton in the final laps, but it wasn\u2019t enough for his second consecutive victory.\n\n\u201cI hope I can\u2019t find him in the paddock now,\u201d Verstappen said of Ocon before he met the Force India driver after the race.\n\nVerstappen was given an unusual punishment for the pushes and insults he aimed at Ocon \u2014 he will have to perform two days of public service at the direction of motorsport governing body FIA within six months.\n\nFerrari\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen joined Hamilton and Verstappen on the podium.

His teammate Valtteri Bottas finished fifth.\n\nMercedes now has an insurmountable 620 points against Ferrari\u2019s 553.\n\nIt was Hamilton\u2019s 72nd victory in Formula One, a much celebrated one after all the problems he faced during the race.\n\n\u201cWe were managing that in the last part of the race, we were losing some power,\u201d the British driver said.\n\nIn the first part of the race Hamilton kept the advantage he acquired by taking his 10th pole position of the season. Bottas overtook Vettel for second place, and for a moment it seemed Mercedes had the race in the bag already.\n\nVerstappen, the winner of the Mexican GP two weeks ago, started in fifth and quickly overtook the two Ferraris, conquered Bottas on lap 10 and showed he would challenge Hamilton for the win.\n\nAfter the world champion pitted on lap 19, it appeared Mercedes had made the wrong decision by giving Hamilton fresh tires before his rivals. Verstappen only stopped 16 laps later.\n\nWith 31 laps to go, Verstappen successfully challenged Hamilton and started building a lead before clashing with Ocon.\n\nThe British driver initially opened a lead of five seconds over Verstappen. But the Dutchman started climbing back on every lap, thanks to Hamilton\u2019s engine problems and medium tire deterioration.\n\nThe race at Interlagos marked the first time since 1970 there were no Brazilian drivers on the grid. Still, attendance was higher than last year\u2019s race when Felipe Massa bid farewell driving a Williams. Race organizers said around 150,000 fans attended over three days, 10,000 more than last year.\n\nMassa, who lost the 2008 title to Hamilton and is now a TV pundit, was sorry for Verstappen, but impressed with Hamilton\u2019s luck on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe are both huge fans of Ayrton Senna, who nailed some lucky wins every now and then.

Gillum has withdrawn his concession in the Florida gubernatorial race following a recount. \"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" Gillum said. (AP Photo/Steve Cannon)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For much of the country, the 2018 midterm season is over. But unresolved races for governor in Georgia and Florida are raising major strategic questions for Democrats as they turn their attention to the upcoming battle for the White House.\n\nAs in other states, Democrats in Florida and Georgia drew record turnout in last week\u2019s election. The coalition of suburban women, young people and minorities delivered the House to Democrats for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to score decisive victories in the closely watched races for governor in Georgia and Florida, where fresh-faced African-American Democratic candidates for governor trailed their older, white Republican competitors. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams hasn\u2019t conceded her race while Andrew Gillum\u2019s contest in Florida is undergoing a recount.\n\nFor some Democrats, the lesson emerging from the 2018 midterms is that massive turnout can win suburban House races across New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California. But the coalition that produced some success elsewhere may not be enough in Florida, the nation\u2019s premier presidential battleground state, and Georgia, a state Democrats view with increasing optimism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a viable long-term plan to constantly rely on record turnout,\u201d said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, who led former President Barack Obama\u2019s efforts in Florida. \u201cWe have a national issue we have to deal with.\u201d\n\nWhile Gillum and Abrams have much in common, they ran on different messages.\n\nGillum, the 39-year-old mayor of Florida\u2019s capital city, ran as an unapologetic member of the Trump resistance. He openly called for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment. And he accused his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, of blatant racism.\n\nAbrams, the 44-year-old former minority leader in Georgia\u2019s House of Representative, highlighted her bipartisan credentials throughout her bid for governor. While she and Gillum embraced liberal policy priorities, such as \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d she promoted her work with Republicans in the state legislature, even highlighting a handshake with GOP Gov. Nathan Deal in a campaign ad.\n\nStill, both were viewed as rising stars within the evolving Democratic Party, a new generation of Democratic leadership that could expand the party\u2019s appeal among all voters.\n\nRacial divisions appear to have limited their appeal, however.\n\nBoth Gillum and Abrams won African-Americans and young voters by overwhelming margins. But they struggled with older, white voters, particularly noncollege-educated white voters, who make up the core of Trump\u2019s political base.\n\nGillum won 92 percent of black voters, according to VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press. He also won 60 percent of voters 18 to 29 years old, and 54 percent of women.\n\nBut Gillum earned just 44 percent of the male vote. And he won only 39 percent of the overall white vote \u2014 and 35 percent among noncollege-educated white voters.\n\nIt was worse for Abrams, who was poised to become the nation\u2019s first African-American female governor.\n\nShe won 94 percent of Georgia\u2019s black vote, but just 25 percent of white voters. She carried 56 percent of women, but just 40 percent of men. A dismal 19 percent of noncollege-educated white men supported her, according to VoteCast.\n\nNationwide, 43 percent of white voters backed Democrats, including 38 percent of noncollege-educated whites.\n\nThe results \u201cabsolutely\u201d demonstrated black candidates like Gillum and Abrams have a harder time winning in the Trump era, NAACP President Derrick Johnson told the AP.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has done is played to the lowest common denominator and created a culture of intolerance and racial hatred,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou build up negative energy based on fear to a point where there are segments of the population who are reacting to fear and not pure policy considerations.\u201d\n\nLeading Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg agreed that racism likely shaped the elections.\n\n\u201cThis was a big election in which the president used immigration to send a kind of racist message about the need to stand up whites against the invasion,\u201d Greenberg said of Trump\u2019s final-days focus on a caravan of Latin American immigrants heading to the U.S. border to seek asylum.\n\nTrump and his allies took \u201cevery opportunity,\u201d he continued, \u201cto attack black politicians and athletes and others.

(AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court says the fate of a Pennsylvania county seal containing a cross symbol is on hold pending resolution of a similar case in Maryland.\n\nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in September on Lehigh County\u2019s appeal of a federal judge\u2019s order that the county remove the cross from its seal. The appeals court said Thursday it will hold off pending a U.S. Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of a cross-shaped war memorial outside the Prince George\u2019s County Courthouse in Bladensburg, Maryland, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported.\n\nCounty attorney Eric Baxter said the delay isn\u2019t a surprise, given disagreement among courts across the country on how to determine whether religious symbols on public property constitute government endorsement of one religion over another. He said it could be June before the Supreme Court rules in the Maryland case.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation and four of its local members filed the original complaint about the county seal, saying the inclusion of the cross constitutes an endorsement of Christianity. Judge Edward Smith wrote in his September 2017 opinion that, while he didn\u2019t believe the symbol violates the Constitution, he was bound by precedent to side with the Wisconsin-based atheist group. Smith said the county could keep the symbol on older documents, but would have to change it on flags, cars or other property.\n\nIn its appeal, the county argued that a new precedent from the nation\u2019s highest court allows for religious symbols to be viewed in a historical context in some situations. Baxter, an attorney with the Becket Fund, a nonprofit that says its mission is to protect free expression of all religious faith, said the cross is one of a dozen symbols on the seal and was meant to represent the county\u2019s original settlers who were fleeing religious persecution.\n\nThe Lehigh County seal features a cross in the center behind a county building surrounded by other symbols in a circle around it, including a heart, a farmand a factory. Baxter said the seal had been the same for more than 70 years without drawing any complaints.\n\nFoundation attorney Marcus Schneider responded that such a historical argument has no documentation. He said the cross is the flag\u2019s most prominent feature and its religious meaning is \u201cubiquitous across the country.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Morning Call, http://www.mcall.com", "BENNINGTON, Vt.

The American Heart Association conference ending Monday, Nov. 12, 2018 in Chicago revealed a lot about what works and what does not for preventing heart attacks. (Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Fish oil, vitamin D, novel drugs, new cholesterol guidelines: News from an American Heart Association conference over the weekend reveals a lot about what works and what does not for preventing heart attacks and other problems.\n\nDietary supplements missed the mark, but a prescription-strength fish oil showed promise. A drug not only helped people with diabetes control blood sugar and lose weight, but also lowered their risk of needing hospitalization for heart failure.\n\nGood news for everyone: You no longer have to fast before a blood test to check cholesterol. Don\u2019t stop at the doughnut shop on your way to the clinic, but eating something before the test is OK for most folks, the guidelines say.\n\nThey\u2019re from the Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology and are endorsed by many other doctor groups. No authors had financial ties to drugmakers.\n\nHere are highlights from the conference, which wraps up Monday:\n\nCHOLESTEROL\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. High cholesterol leads to hardened arteries that can cause a heart attack or stroke. When guidelines were last revised five years ago, they moved away from just using cholesterol numbers to determine who needs treatment and toward a formula that takes into account age, high blood pressure and other factors to more broadly estimate risk.\n\nThat was confusing, so the new guidelines blend both approaches, setting targets based on the formula and considering individual circumstances, such as other medical conditions or a family history of early heart disease.\n\n\u201cIt will never be as simple as a single cholesterol number,\u201d because that doesn\u2019t give a clear picture of risk, said one guideline panel member, Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones of Northwestern University.\n\nIf treatment is needed, the first choice remains a statin such as Lipitor or Crestor, which are sold as generics for a dime a day. For people at high risk, such as those who have already had a heart attack, the guidelines suggest adding Zetia, which is also sold as an inexpensive generic, if the statin didn\u2019t lower cholesterol enough.\n\nOnly if those two medicines don\u2019t help enough should powerful but pricey newer drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors be considered. Many insurers limit coverage of them \u2014 Repatha, sold by Amgen, and Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron \u2014 and the guidelines say they\u2019re not cost-effective except for folks at the very highest risk.\n\nFinally, if it\u2019s unclear whether someone needs treatment, the guidelines suggest a coronary artery calcium test, which looks for hardening of the arteries, to help decide. It\u2019s a type of X-ray with a radiation dose similar to a mammogram and costs $100 to $300, which most insurers do not cover. Lloyd-Jones and others defended its use.\n\n\u201cHalf of people will have a zero calcium score and can avoid a statin very safely,\u201d a quarter will score high and need treatment, and the rest will need to weigh options with their doctors, he said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Dr. Steven Nissen, who had no role in the guidelines, called them a big improvement but disagreed with \u201cusing a test that involves radiation to decide whether to give a drug that costs $3 a month,\u201d referring to the price of statins. A cheap test to check for artery inflammation would be better, he said.\n\nFISH OIL, VITAMIN D\n\nTwo major studies gave mixed results on fish oil , or omega-3 fatty acids. There are different types, including EPA and DHA.\n\nIn a study of 26,000 healthy people, 1 gram a day of an EPA/DHA combo, a dose and type found in many dietary supplements, showed no clear ability to lower the risk of heart problems or cancer.\n\nBut another study testing 4 grams a day of Amarin Corp.\u2019s Vascepa, which is concentrated EPA, found it slashed heart problems in people at higher risk for them because of high triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, and other reasons. All were already taking a statin, and there\u2019s concern about the results because Vascepa was compared to mineral oil, which can interfere with statins, and may have made the comparison group fare worse. Still, some doctors said Vascepa\u2019s benefits seemed large enough to outweigh that worry.\n\nThe study that tested the lower amount of fish oil in the general population also tested vitamin D , one of the most popular supplements, and found it did not lower the risk of cancer or heart problems.\n\n\u201cI think we need to accept that that\u2019s a good test\u201d and that the vitamin is not worthwhile, said Dr. Jane Armitage of England\u2019s Oxford University. \u201cWe do not see any benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your money on those supplements,\u201d which are not well regulated and are of varying quality, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt of Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nDIABETES\n\nPeople with diabetes often die of heart disease or heart failure, and new diabetes medicines are required to be tested in large studies to show they don\u2019t raise heart risks. One such medicine, Jardiance, surprised doctors a few years ago by lowering the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A second medicine, Invokana, later showed similar benefits but with some worrisome side effects.\n\nA new study tested a third drug, Farxiga, in more than 17,000 diabetics with other heart risk factors and found a lower rate of hospitalization for heart failure or death from heart-related causes \u2014 5 percent among those on the drug versus 6 percent in a placebo group after four years of use. That\u2019s on top of the drug\u2019s known benefits for controlling diabetes.\n\nCertain infections and a serious buildup of acids in the blood were more common with Farxiga but these were rare and are known complications of the drug. It costs about $15 a day, about the same as similar medicines. Farxiga\u2019s maker, AstraZeneca, sponsored the study and many study leaders consult for the company.\n\nOne independent expert, Dr. Eric Peterson, a Duke University cardiologist and one of the conference leaders, said doctors have been eager to know if the earlier studies suggesting these drugs might help hearts were a fluke. Results from the new study, the largest so far, \u201ccould make this class of drugs much more standardly used\u201d for diabetics with high heart risks or heart failure, he said.\n\n___\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

In Britain, women worked in factories, including in the production of weapons \u2014 a key role, given that the side that could produce the most weapons in the war of attrition would ultimately win.\n\nBy 1917, munitions sites, which mostly employed women workers, produced 80 percent of the weapons and shells used by the British Army, according to historian A. V. M.

MGM Resorts is now the official gaming partner of the Jets. The agreement is the most comprehensive and integrated gaming partnership in the league, and the first to go beyond a casino sponsorship.\n\n\u201cWe wholeheartedly agree that our country needs to put an end to gun violence,\u201d MGM Resorts International said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Jets had no comment on the banner.\n\nIn July, MGM sued more than 1,900 victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in a bid not for money, but to avoid liability for the gunfire that rained down from a lone gunman at its Mandalay Bay casino-resort in October 2017.\n\nEarly last month, a panel of federal judges denied a request from MGM to centralize 13 lawsuits stemming from the shooting. MGM had asked to centralize the cases after it filed nine lawsuits in various states against the over 1,900 victims, but said it respected the ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation and would litigate its motions in the courts where the actions were pending.\n\nMGM said at the time that its lawsuits are to avoid years of costly litigation and were focused only on people who have sued the company and voluntarily dismissed their claims or have threatened to sue.\n\nLate last month, MGM and the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys agreed to stay all pending litigation and entered into mediation. All litigation was suspended while the sides attempt to mediate a settlement.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to resolve these matters fairly and promptly, and we and the plaintiffs have asked the courts to suspend all litigation so we can enter into mediation and attempt to reach a resolution,\u201d MGM said in a statement to the AP. \u201cWe hope for a positive outcome so all of those impacted can look forward to the future and continue in their healing.\u201d\n\nA few New York-area politicians had recently slammed the Jets\u2019 partnership on social media, citing the initial lawsuit by MGM.\n\nNew York State Sen.

In the first study of its kind, research by Oregon State University scientists shows that the return of large terrestrial carnivores can lead to improved stream structure and function. (Oregon State University via AP)\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 The return of wolves and cougars to Yellowstone National Park is helping restore a landscape that had been altered in their absence and allowing streams to return to a more natural state, according to a new study.\n\nThe widespread extermination of wolves and cougars early last century meant elk herds that the carnivores prey on were able to grow in size. The swollen herds ate away willow plants and other vegetation along the park\u2019s streams, causing erosion damage.\n\nBut in recent years, resurgent populations of wolves and cougars have restored the park\u2019s natural balance by knocking back elk numbers and changing the herds\u2019 behaviors, according to Robert Beschta and William Ripple of the Oregon State University College of Forestry.\n\nCougars returned in the 1980s and wolves were reintroduced about a decade later. In the years since, the park\u2019s elk population has dropped dramatically. As a result, willows are rebounding and streams are recovering, the researchers said.\n\nThe findings were included in a peer-reviewed study published in the journal Ecohydrology. The researchers cautioned that the healing is in the early stages and could take a long time to complete.\n\nThe idea that bringing back wolves and cougars would have cascading effects across Yellowstone\u2019s ecosystem has long been of interest to researchers.\n\nPrior studies concentrated on the impacts to other animals and plants. Ripple and Beschta took that a step further to see what happens to the landscape itself.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we studied how the reintroduction of wolves, along with other large carnivores, affect non-living landscape features outside of the food web,\u201d Ripple and Beschta said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nJohn Winnie, an associate teaching professor at Montana State University, said he disagrees with the assertion by Beschta and Ripple that changes to elk behavior is what\u2019s driving the effects on the landscape. Winnie says the sheer number of elk plays a more important role.\n\nBut regardless of the mechanism, Winnie says he\u2019s in agreement that cougars and wolves can indirectly influence the park\u2019s streams.\n\n\u201cSimply having more vegetation growing along stream banks is going to change how rivers behave,\u201d Winnie said. \u201cThat\u2019s basic stream ecology.\u201d", "OLPE, Kan.

Tyra announced the termination of head football coach Bobby Petrino, along with three of his assistants. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Louisville\u2019s seven-game skid was bad enough. Worse were the large margins of defeat and opponents\u2019 apparent ease in lighting up the scoreboard.\n\nThat combination spelled the end of coach Bobby Petrino\u2019s second chapter with the Cardinals.\n\nLouisville fired Petrino on Sunday morning with two games left in a spiraling season that includes five blowout losses in which the Cardinals allowed at least 50 points.\n\nThe school announced Petrino\u2019s dismissal with a statement from athletic director Vince Tyra, who wasn\u2019t confident the coach could turn things around next season. He said a new head coach would be chosen soon to restore the program to national prominence.\n\nThe AD said at a news conference later that he considered a number of factors in Petrino\u2019s status, but noted that the three games since Louisville\u2019s bye showed no progress.\n\n\u201cIt was clear the players weren\u2019t responding,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coaches\u2019 and the players\u2019 efforts have to go in the right direction, but I didn\u2019t feel it was going that way.\u201d\n\nPurdue head coach Jeff Brohm, a former Louisville quarterback who later became an assistant under Petrino, has frequently been mentioned as the top candidate to replace him. Tyra said he had \u201ca list in mind\u201d but didn\u2019t want to interfere with potential candidates with the season still in progress.\n\nFor now, second-year safeties coach Lorenzo Ward, 51, would coach Louisville on an interim basis.\n\nAlso let go were quarterbacks coach Nick Petrino, the coach\u2019s son; linebackers coach Ryan Beard and defensive line coach L.D. Scott, Petrino\u2019s sons-in-law; and fifth-year director of football operations Andy Wagner.\n\nLouisville (2-8) lost 54-23 at No. 12 Syracuse on Friday night, dropping to 0-7 in Atlantic Coast Conference play.\n\nPetrino, 57, departs with a 77-35 mark in two stints with Louisville, including 36-26 since returning in 2014. His exit will be expensive for Louisville, which owes him $14 million under terms of his contract extension signed in April 2016. Tyra said Petrino would receive the full buyout.\n\nThe school was left with little choice but to release Petrino with Louisville struggling and sections of empty seats at Cardinal Stadium recently after opening a new north end section in a $63 million renovation project.\n\nLouisville\u2019s stunning freefall comes a season after 2016 Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson capped one of the program\u2019s most remarkable periods under the offense-minded Petrino. Besides becoming the school\u2019s first Heisman winner, Jackson had the program as high as No. 3 in The Associated Press Top 25 and within reach of the College Football Playoff at No. 5 that November.\n\nBut other than sharing the 2016 Atlantic Division title with Clemson, Louisville wasn\u2019t a consistent ACC contender after leaving the Big East.\n\nThis season, the Cardinals have failed to beat a Power Five school and needed second-half rallies to beat FCS Indiana State and Western Kentucky.\n\nAn offensive falloff was expected following the departure of the dynamic Jackson, who broke numerous school and conference records before being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of last spring\u2019s NFL Draft.\n\nHowever, Jackson\u2019s exit ended up revealing a host of deficiencies as Louisville struggled to score. The Cardinals rank at or near the bottom of several ACC offensive categories and Petrino has shuffled quarterbacks Jawon Pass and Malik Cunningham.\n\nTheir defensive weaknesses have been more glaring and left them looking up at the rest of the ACC statistically. The Cardinals have been outscored 291-125 in that span, including a 77-16 thumping at No. 2 Clemson on Nov. 3.\n\nPetrino remained hopeful of improvement, but another lopsided loss ended with him being shown the door.\n\nThe Montana native is 119-56 overall in a college career that included stops at Arkansas and WKU. He also coached 13 games with the NFL\u2019s Atlanta Falcons in 2007. His career has included a lot of wins and some controversy and hard feelings left behind.\n\nHe was 31-9 with Louisville from 2003-06, taking the Cardinals to the Orange Bowl, while also constantly coming up as a candidate for other jobs. He left college for the Falcons and lasted less than a season before taking the Arkansas job.\n\nThat ended with embarrassment. He was fired after getting into a motorcycle accident, which exposed an extra-marital affair with an athletic department employee and Petrino\u2019s lies to his boss.\n\nPetrino resurfaced at WKU for the 2103 season before Louisville gave him another chance. Then-athletic director Tom Jurich re-hired Petrino as the program transitioned from the Big East to the ACC.\n\nBut Jurich is gone as part of the fallout from a series of scandals involving the men\u2019s basketball program that also felled Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino.\n\nPetrino is now out as well, leaving Tyra to make his second major coaching hire after basketball coach Chris Mack in March. In the meantime, Ward must close the season on a high note that proved elusive for Petrino and the Cardinals.\n\n\u201cTalent-wise, we\u2019ve got enough to win with,\u201d Tyra said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to build on in terms of skill and I\u2019m excited about that part of it.

The Guth Foundation contributed $300,000. The assembly hall is named for Jack C.

The committee will also work to increase budget caps so lawmakers can avoid steep cuts to defense and nondefense programs.\n\nThe committee can also conduct oversight of any Trump administration action that involves government funding, such as how much Cabinet members are spending on travel or how much it is costing the Pentagon to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n___\n\nADAM SCHIFF\n\nIntelligence Committee\n\nSchiff, 58, represents parts of Los Angeles, including Hollywood and Burbank. As the top Democrat on the intelligence panel, he has been one of Trump\u2019s favorite foils in Congress. Schiff has repeatedly criticized the House\u2019s Russia investigation, which his GOP colleagues conducted, saying it was inadequate.\n\nNow Schiff will get his chance to conduct his own targeted investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and its ties to Russia. He has said that he wants to look at whether Russians used laundered money for transactions with the Trump Organization. He also wants more information about communications the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had with his father and others about a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer.\n\n___\n\nELIJAH CUMMINGS\n\nOversight and Government Reform Committee\n\nCummings, 67, will likely head the committee that could make life the toughest for the Trump White House because of its broad investigative powers.\n\nCummings would likely seek Trump\u2019s business tax returns and other company-related financial records. He said he will work to make the president accountable, but will also challenge Republicans to uphold their oversight responsibilities, saying, \u201cI think we as a body can do better.\u201d\n\nThe Maryland Democrat, who represents parts of Baltimore city and most of Howard County, has said he would also like the committee to examine prescription drug prices and whether some states have engaged in voter suppression.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a country where it becomes normal to do everything in Trump\u2019s power to stop people from voting,\u201d Cummings said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nHe would also seek to bring Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross before the committee to testify about the decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census.\n\n___\n\nJERROLD NADLER\n\nJudiciary Committee\n\nNadler, 71, has been in Congress since 1992 and has served on the Judiciary Committee for much of that time. He represents a large swath of Trump\u2019s hometown of New York.\n\nHe is expected to make one of his first priorities as chairman protecting special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and requesting that Mueller\u2019s materials are preserved in case he is fired. Nadler said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Matthew Whitaker, whom Trump named acting attorney general last week, \u201cshould recuse himself\u201d from Mueller probe because he \u201cexpressed total hostilities to the investigation\u201d and \u201cif necessary\u201d the Judiciary Committee will \u201csubpoena\u201d him to appear before the committee\n\nThe Judiciary panel would also oversee impeachment proceedings, if Democrats decided to move in that direction. But Nadler has expressed caution about the idea, saying there would have to be \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d from Mueller and some bipartisan support.\n\nThe panel is also expected to look into family separation at the border and the Trump administration\u2019s management of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\nMAXINE WATERS\n\nFinancial Services Committee\n\nWaters, 80, is expected to chair a committee with oversight of banks, insurers and investment firms. She has opposed Republican-led efforts to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and is promising colleagues that she will prioritize protecting consumers from abusive financial practices. The California lawmaker, whose district centers on south Los Angeles County, can also conduct aggressive oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and steps it has taken to reduce enforcement actions against student lenders, pay-day lenders and others.\n\nThe president railed against Waters on the campaign trail this year, frequently mentioning her during his rallies. Waters accuses Republicans of serving as Trump\u2019s \u201caccomplices.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCOLLIN PETERSON\n\nAgriculture Committee\n\nPeterson, 74, is a moderate from a heavily rural congressional district in western Minnesota. He is a strong critic of Trump\u2019s trade policies and could use his platform to highlight how farmers have been harmed by retaliatory tariffs from China and other nations. His top priority now is to get a farm bill passed, if not in the current Congress, then in the next one. Peterson will also have the committee take a close look at the reorganization underway at the Agriculture Department, including the push to move its top independent research office out of Washington.\n\n___\n\nJOHN YARMUTH\n\nBudget Committee\n\nYarmuth, 71, is serving his sixth term from Kentucky, where he represents much of the Louisville area. He\u2019ll put together a budget blueprint that includes Democratic lawmakers\u2019 top priorities. He also has said he will hold hearings on a single-payer health plan modeled on the Democratic push to create \u201cMedicare-for-All.\u201d\n\n___\n\nELIOT ENGEL\n\nForeign Affairs Committee\n\nEngel, 71, who represents parts of the Bronx and New York City\u2019s northern suburbs, has been a consistent critic of the president\u2019s foreign policy. He has told colleagues that one of his top priorities will be to investigate where the Trump administration\u2019s foreign-policy actions are intertwined with the president\u2019s business interests. Protecting the State Department is also a priority for him, including looking into whether career officials have been \u201cpurged\u201d because they were deemed insufficiently loyal to the president.\n\n___\n\nRICHARD NEAL\n\nWays and Means Committee\n\nNeal, 69, who represents western and parts of central Massachusetts, is expected to lead the committee that has oversight of tax and trade issues. He is promising hearings on the $1.5 trillion tax cut Republicans pushed through last year and has said he would consider a middle-income tax cut, but only if rates for the top income earners go up to help pay for it.\n\nThe committee has jurisdiction over trade, and Neal said he expects Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico and Canada to come before his committee soon. The panel is also expected to seek Trump\u2019s tax returns from the IRS, likely triggering a court fight.\n\n___\n\nBOBBY SCOTT\n\nEducation and the Workforce Committee\n\nScott, 71, is poised to lead the Democratic oversight of changes that Secretary Betsy DeVos has enacted at the Education Department. The Virginia Democrat, who represents parts of the Tidewater area, has told colleagues that he would continue work to free students from the burden of crippling debt, ensure workers have a safe job environment and conduct rigorous oversight to the administration\u2019s \u201cderegulatory agenda.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFRANK PALLONE\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee\n\nPallone, 67, hails from north-central New Jersey and was a key player when a Democratic-led Congress passed President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Pallone said he\u2019ll focus on putting forward legislation to protect that law and on lowering the cost of prescription drugs. He\u2019ll likely revisit legislation he has sponsored that would, among other things, restore marketing and outreach efforts to get more people enrolled in health insurance coverage and increase subsidies for poor and middle-income Americans.\n\nPallone said he also wants to boost broadband access, renewable energy and access to clean drinking water.\n\n___\n\nPETER DeFAZIO\n\nTransportation and Infrastructure\n\nDeFazio, 71, has hopes of working with the Trump administration on infrastructure legislation to generate jobs and repair roads, bridges and airports. He said he wants to work fast, before the 2020 presidential election process kicks in and makes it harder for anything substantial to get done. The obvious barrier is finding the money, at a time when the national deficit is already exploding. DeFazio, who represents Oregon\u2019s southern coastal counties, has put a tiny uptick in gasoline and diesel taxes on the table, but that\u2019s a tough sell with lawmakers.\n\nThe committee also has jurisdiction over the General Services Administration, the agency that manages real estate for the federal government, including the lease for the Trump Hotel in Washington. Democrats have sought information about the hotel\u2019s profitability and whether Trump is using the office of the presidency for private gain.\n\n___\n\nADAM SMITH\n\nArmed Services Committee\n\nSmith, 53, says his top national security priority for the next Congress is oversight of the president, from \u201cthe politicization of the military, to his mismanagement of disaster response, to the lack of a consistent policy concerning civilian casualties, to his policies on Russia, and more.\u201d He said the panel needs to conduct aggressive oversight of the Pentagon\u2019s budget and weapons programs to ensure taxpayers are getting the best value. The Democrat from Washington state, who represents the central Puget Sound area, also said it\u2019s also important to safeguard \u201can inclusive military\u201d by eliminating discriminatory barriers.\n\n___\n\nBENNIE THOMPSON\n\nHomeland Security Committee\n\nThompson, 70, of Mississippi, will lead aggressive oversight of actions that the administration has taken on immigration, including its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally and putting their children under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. The committee will also examine the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico, incidents of domestic terrorism by U.S. citizens and what can be done to ensure election security. He represents the western and central parts of Mississippi.\n\n___\n\nRAUL GRIJALVA\n\nNatural Resources Committee\n\nGrijalva, 70, will likely lead a committee that has oversight over national parks and other public lands. The Arizona Democrat has pushed back against the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to expand mining and drilling on federal lands. He\u2019ll conduct oversight into the environmental toll of the administration\u2019s actions. He\u2019ll also emphasize stronger consultation with federal tribes before energy projects are approved. Tribes have complained that the Trump administration moved forward with the Keystone XL pipeline without adequate consultation and analysis of the potential impact on tribal lands. Grijalva\u2019s southwest Arizona district includes parts of Tucson.\n\n___\n\nMARK TAKANO\n\nVeterans Affairs\n\nTakano, 57, who represents the Riverside, California, area, is the favorite to serve as chairman of the committee after being endorsed by Rep. Tim Walz, who won election to serve as governor of Minnesota. The committee will have oversight of efforts to expand access to private health care providers. He says he would work to hold for-profit colleges accountable when they mislead student veterans and that he would continue work to advocate for deported veterans to ensure they get their citizenship and can access their benefits.\n\n___\n\nJIM McGOVERN\n\nRules Committee\n\nMcGovern, 58, will likely lead a panel that determines what bills are debated on the floor and what amendments are allowed to be voted on. McGovern has been critical of Republicans for blocking votes on amendments with broad public support, but it\u2019s unclear how far Democrats will go in reversing those practices. Pelosi has tasked McGovern, who represents central Massachusetts, with coming up with a package of rules governing the chamber, and it\u2019s expected to include a ban on House members sitting on corporate boards.\n\nRep. Julia Brownley of California, 66, is vying to serve as chairwoman. She tells colleagues that she would focus on ensuring the VA has the necessary resources to get veterans care from local health care providers without cannibalizing other VA programs. She would also seek to ensure that the administration takes steps to fill senior leadership vacancies and an estimated 46,000 vacant positions within the VA.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "Leipzig beats Bayer Leverkusen in Bundesliga to go third\n\nLeipzig's Yussuf Poulsen celebrates after scoring his side's third goal during the German first division Bundesliga soccer match between RB Leipzig and Bayer 04 Leverkusen in Leipzig, Germany, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Kei Nishikori hit a backhand so good it threw Roger Federer off his game as the 20-time Grand Slam champion earned a code violation before capitulating in a surprise defeat at the ATP Finals on Sunday.\n\nTwo points away from losing the opening set and on the back foot in a rally, Nishikori hit a stunning shot up the line, which prompted Federer to hit the ball into the crowd and receive a warning for ball abuse.\n\nFederer never appeared to regain his composure and went down 7-6 (4), 6-3 in a first opening match defeat at the season-ending tournament since 2013.\n\n\u201cI thought \u2019What was his argument, why the warning?\u201d Federer said of his exchange with the umpire. \u201cBut nothing more than that. He thought I was angry. I wasn\u2019t. Now I\u2019m angry because I lost, but I wasn\u2019t, so...\u201d\n\nFederer earned the first break points in the opening game of the second set, and took his chance, but Nishikori hit straight back in the following game.\n\nNishikori was the far more composed player from that moment on and broke for a 4-2 lead, before closing out the match for a first win over Federer since 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a big challenge to play Roger,\u201d Nishikori said. \u201cThe first match is not easy.\u201d\n\nSix-time champion Federer, who has reached the semifinals in all but one of his 15 previous appearances at the tournament, will now likely need to win his remaining two round-robin matches to keep alive his chances of claiming the 100th title of his career.\n\nMore thanks to poor returning than good serving, neither man was able to create so much as a sniff of a break of serve in an error-strewn opening set, until Nishikori\u2019s backhand denied Federer two set points with the score at 6-5, 15-30.\n\nA tiebreaker followed and Federer made one of his 20 unforced errors in the set to give Nishikori the first mini-break and a 3-1 lead, which quickly became 6-1.\n\nFederer rallied to save three set points, but Nishikori delivered a well-placed serve out wide to ensure the comeback attempt ended there.\n\nHowever, his concentration deserted him moments later as a double fault gave Federer a break he did little to earn. But the Swiss responded in kind and a wild forehand error leveled the score at 1-1.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately I couldn\u2019t keep the lead that I got early (in the second set),\u201cFederer said. \u201cThat was the key of the match, that sort of 10-minute swing at the end of the first through to maybe 1-1 in the second.\u201d\n\nThe seventh-seeded Nishikori began to relax and was rewarded in the sixth game as he brought up another break point and produced an inside-out forehand Federer had no chance of returning.\n\nDespite having lost his last six meetings with Federer, including two on this court, Nishikori showed no nerves as he dropped just one point in his next two service games, with a forehand error from the Swiss great ending the match.\n\nEarlier, Kevin Anderson made a confident start to his ATP Finals debut with a 6-3, 7-6 (10) victory over Dominic Thiem.\n\nHaving qualified for the tournament for the first time, the 32-year-old Anderson produced a dominant serving display to take the first set, before saving two set points to come through a tense tiebreaker in the second.\n\n\u201cI think it was important, you know, going out there and getting off to a good start,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI definitely felt a little bit nervous.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "GASTONIA, N.C.

(AP) \u2014 A lot of people have given to Rodney Fuson over the years. Although he was homeless, he always tried to give back.\n\nHe gave walks to cars in the middle of the night. He gave inspiration to a local musician, who turned it into a song. He gave long, warm hugs to longtime friends.\n\n\u201cFriend\u201d was a word he used often, but it was by no means overused or an overstatement. Rodney had friends in lots of places, who all agree that the magical, mysterious man shall never be forgotten.\n\nMultiple people have reported on social media that Rodney was found dead Monday morning at his campsite, setting off a chain of prayers, classic Rodney stories and tears from those who knew him best.\n\n\u201cHe could be a pain in the ass, but he was ours,\u201d said Leslie Berez, who met Rodney roughly 15 years ago while working downtown. \u201cThere was something magnetic about him. He took time to talk to everybody and had these wacky, crazy card tricks that just resonated with everyone.\u201d\n\nPart of Berez\u2019s former job at Downtown Grill & Brewery was keeping an eye on the patio and making sure no one was panhandling there. Whenever Rodney saw Berez walking toward him outside the restaurant, he would just give her a wink and walk away, she said.\n\n\u201cEventually it evolved, and I started talking to Rodney,\u201d she said. \u201cHe always had these wacky stories. ... He would never play on a sad story, though.\u201d\n\nBerez never gave him money but would use her employee discount to get him food whenever she could. When Berez returned to working downtown after a four-year hiatus, Rodney returned the favor by walking her to her car following late-night shifts.\n\n\u201cTo me, that is unheard of,\u201d Berez said. \u201cWhen I started working downtown again, he was the first person I thought of. He randomly popped up and gave me a huge hug. He remembered me, which was amazing.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s turn to remember him.\n\nAnybody who has spent substantial time downtown probably has a Rodney story. There\u2019s a good chance the story involves his card tricks, which were always guaranteed to \u201cblow your mind.\u201d\n\nHe was so confident he could blow minds that he was willing to bet everything in his pockets, \u201ceven the damn dirty lint,\u201d he mentioned in one YouTube video.\n\nBut what\u2019s even more powerful than stories about Rodney is Rodney\u2019s story, itself, which he shared with Cruz Contreras of The Black Lillies about a decade back.\n\n\u201cI got to know him playing down at Barley\u2019s,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cHe would help us load in our gear and help look after things. ... The years of working downtown and playing music \u2014 he was just a fixture there. He\u2019s one of those people that when you turn around one day, he\u2019s been a part of your life for 15 years or more.\u201d\n\nOne day, Contreras asked Rodney how he became homeless. The truth was that he used to live in Georgia and was working a good job selling carpets when a relationship ended and sent him on a downward spiral, Contreras said.\n\n\u201cAt that point in my life, I guess the way I looked at the story was that there was some overlap in what I was going through in my life,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cWe are all just a step or two away from a difficult situation like that.\u201d\n\nContrerars turned this story into a song called \u201cMidnight,\u201d which was on The Black Lillies\u2019 first album in 2009.\n\n\u201cHe had been wanting to write a song with me,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cHe always said: \u2018I got some lyrics, I got some lyrics. You just have to set it to some music.\u2019 I guess those were the last conversations we had.\u201d\n\nBerez\u2019s Facebook post about Rodney had 51 comments and 32 shares as of 3:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI was shocked when I woke up this morning and saw how many times that post was shared because I don\u2019t know 90 percent of the people that shared it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe impacted so many people. ... His personality spreads.\u201d\n\nPeople have used social media posts like Berez\u2019s to share stories about Rodney \u2014 stories about him selling socks, selling an Elmo doll and attempting to sell a couch he was somehow carrying through the Old City one day.\n\nBut the stories weren\u2019t just about him looking to make a buck. There also were stories about Rodney buying an ice cream sandwich for a friend and giving up his belt to a man who forgot his own.\n\nDowntown business owner Scott West made his own post about the time he was in trouble for his business practices. Rodney wrote a letter to the judge showing his support.\n\n\u201cDear Judge Phillips,\u201d the letter read. \u201cMy name is Rodney. Although I am homeless, Scott West has always been good to me and treated me with respect. I am writing to ask that you be lenient in your sentencing of him.\u201d\n\nRodney was always good to the people he met, too, Contreras said. Although he is gone, his personality and presence will not be forgotten, he said.\n\n\u201cHe just had this kind of a sparkle in his eye and the grin, and he just endeared himself to people,\u201d Contreras said. \u201cUltimately, it seemed like when things really mattered, he had your back.\n\n\u2033(I feel) genuine sadness. It\u2019s weird. He was part of the community and the Knoxville family and the downtown family community. You have all these different characters, and he was a major character.

Shirley Chisholm matters all this time later because \"we're fighting for the same people who don't have a voice at the table.\" (AP Photo/Andres Kudacki, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In a history-making election, plenty of new and unexpected faces \u2014 many of them black and brown, many of them female \u2014 will now be taking their first steps into their congressional futures.\n\nFor inspiration and example, the list of winners that includes Ayanna Pressley, Lucy McBath, Jahana Hayes, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and others might want to learn from the lessons of Shirley Chisholm, the Brooklyn, New York, native who made history 50 years ago as the first African-American woman elected to Congress.\n\nIt was the start of a national political career in which Chisholm, who died in 2005, fearlessly and relentlessly stood up and spoke out for such causes as civil and women\u2019s rights and that included a run for president just four years after her first federal win.\n\n\u201cWe should be inspired by the fact that she always went up against the status quo,\u201d said Rep. Yvette Clarke, whose Brooklyn district now includes a portion of the area that Chisholm was elected to represent and who introduced a bill earlier this year calling for a statue of Chisholm to be placed at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cShe was able to assert a moral political direction that galvanized people across this nation.\u201d\n\nIn the days before the November 1968 general election, there was a lot of conventional wisdom spouted about the issues Chisholm faced in her first congressional campaign.\n\nHer opponent, civil rights activist James Farmer, had a national reputation, while she was local. He had the endorsement of powerful politicians while she organized on the ground in her Brooklyn community. And he was a man.\n\nA newspaper headline about the race in the days before the election simply referred to her as \u201cwoman.\u201d But Chisholm won the race by a 2-1 margin.\n\nShe didn\u2019t let the institutional power her campaign faced rattle her, said Zinga Fraser, professor and director of the Shirley Chisholm Project on women and activism at Brooklyn College. Instead, Chisholm went with a campaign theme of \u201cunbought and unbossed\u201d and reached out to build a coalition of black women and others who had been excluded from the power structure for their electoral support. It was the same approach she took in 1972, when she ran for president as a Democrat and became the first black major-party presidential candidate, competing in 12 state primaries and winning 28 delegates.\n\nChisholm \u201ccalled herself the people\u2019s candidate because she wanted to bring on a new way to think about democracy, and who was privileged and who had the audacity to run,\u201d Fraser said.\n\n\u201cWe all just take so much strength and inspiration from her, to walk in her footsteps,\u201d said Kimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, an organization that promotes the political power of black women as voters and candidates. \u201cHow she led, how she had no fear of speaking truth to power.\u201d\n\nHayes, a Democratic teacher and first-time candidate who becomes the first black woman that Connecticut has sent to Congress, even referenced Chisholm in her victory remarks Tuesday night, acknowledging the 50th anniversary of Chisholm\u2019s Nov. 5, 1968, election.\n\nChisholm, born in Brooklyn to West Indian immigrant parents, was already the first black woman in the New York state Legislature when she decided to run for the seat representing the newly drawn 12th Congressional District, which included central Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights and had been created in a way that made it more likely Brooklyn would have its first black member of Congress.\n\nAfter winning the Democratic primary, she faced Farmer, nationally known co-founder of the Congress of Racial Equality and leader of the 1961 Freedom Ride, who was endorsed by then-New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and other powerful politicians.\n\nLetitia James, the New York City public advocate who made history Tuesday as the first African-American woman elected to hold statewide New York office as the state attorney general, said Chisholm\u2019s example matters all these years later because \u201cwe\u2019re fighting for the same people who don\u2019t have a voice at the table.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 5, the 50th anniversary of Chisholm\u2019s congressional victory, Rep. Clarke and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who also represents some of what was Chisholm\u2019s district, announced legislation that if it passes would recognize Chisholm with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress.\n\nLessons learned from Chisholm were clearly resonant for black women running for office this year, incumbents and challengers alike, those who won and those who didn\u2019t.\n\nVanessa Enoch, 48, who ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the Ohio congressional seat once held by John Boehner that hasn\u2019t been out of Republican hands in decades, said she identified with Chisholm\u2019s determination to run, in spite of how obvious it was that the power structure had lined up behind her opponent.\n\n\u201cI admire her courage, I admire her stamina to stick with the things that she believed in as she went into those places that were not welcoming to her, her wherewithal to continue to stand her ground and make sure her voice was not ignored,\u201d Enoch said.\n\nChisholm left a legacy, she said, \u201cthat we don\u2019t allow the status quo to continue to be comfortable ignoring our voices and ignoring those things that concern us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDeepti Hajela covers issues of race, ethnicity and immigration for The Associated Press.

And like every Thursday for the past five years, the 63-year-old had found himself with a small group of fellow veterans, trying his hand at yet another new art project.\n\nThe men in the group have all dealt with traumatic experiences since leaving the military. Like Fredrick, they\u2019ve struggled with substance abuse, identified mental illnesses and even lived on the streets.\n\nThe men have been through therapy and counseling and rehabilitation. But they\u2019ve all kept returning to the weekly art program, if for one main reason:\n\nIt gives them peace.\n\n\u201cIt keeps me sober, I know that,\u201d Fredrick said of the program, which is run by the Kentucky Center for the Arts. \u201cIt gives me something to do. It\u2019s better than sitting around at home all day watching television.\u201d\n\nSince 2009, the Kentucky Center for the Arts has organized art programming for a number of Louisville health care facilities through its Arts in Healing initiative, which hires artists to lead classes for people in crisis.\n\nThe goal of the initiative is to inject creativity into the healing process \u2014 a practice that\u2019s been proven to increase self-esteem, decrease patients\u2019 need for pain medication and reduce the length of hospital stays, according to a report from Americans for the Arts.\n\nArts in Healing director Kristen Hughes said the initiative currently offers classes at 17 wide-ranging facilities, including Our Lady of Peace, Volunteers of America and the University of Louisville\u2019s James Graham Brown Cancer Center.\n\nBut its largest client base comes from the Robley Rex VA Medical Center, 800 Zorn Ave., which has asked the Kentucky Center to incorporate art programming into as many of its divisions as possible.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because this VA, this staff started seeing the value,\u201d Hughes said of the program. \u201cIt\u2019s eight years of growing and nurturing and connecting with veterans.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Fredrick was five months sober and was working to secure permanent housing when he came across one of the arts program called Heroes Create!.\n\nThe program was created specifically for veterans who\u2019d experienced homelessness, and it takes place every Thursday at the downtown Salvation Army campus.\n\nWhen he first started attending the class, Fredrick was quiet, like many other veterans, and it took years for him to open up and share details of his upbringing, said lead art teacher Pat Sturtzel.\n\nNow, Fredrick repeats his story easily, talking about the years he spent in an orphanage in Chicago and the decades he spent living on Louisville\u2019s streets.\n\nFor two years in between, Fredrick served as a paratrooper in the army, from which he was honorably discharged in 1978.\n\nWithout a steady job, Fredrick spent years moving between cities before he settled in Louisville in 1986, sleeping most nights at the St. John Center for Homeless Men, 700 E. Muhammad Ali Blvd.\n\nIt was there that Fredrick met a social worker with the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, who helped him file for Social Security and enter a recovery program at the VA medical center.\n\nFredrick took mandatory art classes as part of the program, but he elected to continue them after graduating and finding permanent housing.\n\n\u201cI always kept up with doing some type of artwork,\u201d said Fredrick, who even created an art studio in his one-bedroom apartment. \u201cIt don\u2019t take a genius.\u201d\n\nBut it does take skill, said Dennis Scott, a veteran who\u2019s attended Heroes Create! for about a year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a perfectionist; I\u2019m too left-sided,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI look at stuff and all I see is a lump of clay or a blank sheet of paper. But I like working with my hands.\u201d\n\nScott said he learned about the classes from VA peer support specialist James Taylor, who acts as something of a conversation starter during the sessions. He\u2019s continued to attend because it prevents him from isolating himself from the community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never satisfied with my work, but I enjoy the process,\u201d Scott said. \u201cMost of the stuff I make, I throw away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he told me that,\u201d Taylor said, shaking his head without finishing his sentence.\n\nBut the feeling is something Taylor understands. When he first joined the art sessions as a VA employee, he was scared his artwork would be terrible, and he\u2019d spend days working on projects that other veterans took a quarter of the time to complete.\n\n\u201cI was such a perfectionist,\u201d said Taylor, an air force veteran. \u201d... Finally, they were like, \u2018just let it flow. Don\u2019t even think about it.\u2019 I started doing that, and all of a sudden, I\u2019m starting to make stuff.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong here. That\u2019s the opposite of everything I ever learned.\u201d\n\nHughes, the director of Arts in Healing, said art invites veterans and others who are experiencing trauma to tap into their hearts and souls, to express feelings they might not be able to say verbally.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we acknowledge the whole other side of ourselves,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe see where being in our heads has gotten us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier Journal, http://www.courier-journal.com", "In this Oct. 10, 2018 photo, North Dakota State University student Madison Rodgers, speaks at a coffee shop in Fargo, N.D. Rodgers has been acting as a liaison for school ROTC members who discovered that the state is stripping them of their tuition assistance for next semester. Rodgers, who ran unsuccessfully for a state House seat, says some of the ROTC students are looking at transferring to Minnesota colleges if the student aid is not restored. State officials are scheduled to take up the issue at an emergency meeting later this month. (AP Photo/Dave Kolpack)\n\nFARGO, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Some National Guard students attending North Dakota colleges on ROTC scholarships are scrambling to find ways to stay in school after the state Guard announced it could no longer fund its share of the program.\n\nThe students were expecting free tuition that for years has been covered by a combination of federal and state funds. Lee Bushaw, the Guard\u2019s education services officer, said the state no longer has enough money to cover a shortfall created by both tuition increases and a decline in federal support. Students could be out as much as $5,000 for the spring semester.\n\n\u201cWe kept plugging the holes that were made by the federal government,\u201d Bushaw said. \u201cNow we can\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\nKenneth Hardy, chief of education services for the U.S. Army National Guard, said in the last fiscal year about 30,000 soldiers nationally have received money from their states to supplement their federal payments from both a tuition assistance program and the GI Bill. He said the state funding allows soldiers to take more classes and earn their degree more quickly.\n\nHardy and Bushaw said it\u2019s impossible to tell if other states are having similar issues because each has their own program and separate rules on applying the money.\n\nThe cutback in North Dakota\u2019s tuition assistance hits ROTC scholarship students the hardest because the state tuition assistance program is their primary source of funding. Ryan Schulz, a longtime ROTC recruiter who now works in that capacity at North Dakota State University, said students were shocked to get a letter this fall informing them of the changes for the next semester.\n\n\u201cPlease know that those decisions were not made lightly, it simply came down to a reduction of funds in the state budget,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThe ROTC changes affect about 60 undergraduate cadets and 35 graduate students, most of whom attend North Dakota State.\n\n\u201cEveryone is figuring out what to do for a job next semester and how they are going to pay the rent,\u201d Schulz said.\n\nGuard leaders would not release names of students, citing privacy concerns. Madison Rodgers, a North Dakota State student who on Tuesday lost his bid to get elected to the state House, is acting as liaison for the ROTC members because he said they don\u2019t want to comment publicly.\n\nRodgers said most of students were at the top of their high school classes and are being groomed to become officers and leaders in the military. He said many told him they can\u2019t afford to make up the loss and some are looking to transfer across the river to a college in Minnesota, which has paid full tuition for cadets.\n\nThe program contract, which Rodgers said is about an inch thick and loaded with legal jargon, warns that the payments are subject to the state\u2019s financial health. However, Rodgers said none of the students view it that way and Bushaw acknowledged the Guard \u201cadvertised and explained\u201d that 100 percent of tuition would be paid.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see on any of the National Guard posters that you are going to get your school paid for \u2014 \u2018maybe,\u2019 \u201d Rodgers said. \u201cNo one reads the fine print, especially 17- and 18-year-olds who have never dealt with a contract in their lives.\u201d\n\nBushaw said the decrease in federal coverage is due mainly to a 2014 Defense Department determination that students could not use funding from both the GI Bill and Federal Tuition Assistance program for the same course because it\u2019s a duplication of benefits.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why soldiers and airmen weren\u2019t screaming across the country about that,\u201d Bushaw said. \u201cI knew why they weren\u2019t screaming in North Dakota, because we kept fixing it.\u201d\n\nThe Guard\u2019s general fund appropriation for the 2017-19 biennium was $27.9 million, including just over $3 million for the Tuition and Enlistment Compensation program. North Dakota Sen. Ray Holmberg, who chairs the state Senate\u2019s budget writing committee, said the Guard budget has gone up nearly 9 percent since the Sept. 11 attacks, during which time tuition at North Dakota State rose by 41 percent.\n\nThe Guard is taking its case to the state Emergency Commission on Nov. 19, hoping to get the money for next semester. Mike Nowatzki, spokesman for North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, declined to comment on whether he thought the commission would be receptive.\n\n\u201cThe governor understands that this is the Guard\u2019s top priority and No. 1 recruiting tool and it\u2019s critical to maintaining the Guard\u2019s strength in North Dakota,\u201d Nowatzki said.\n\nSchulz said the abrupt change will hurt recruiting, even if the problem is fixed in the next legislative session\n\nHolmberg questioned whether the Guard was setting the right priorities with its funding, while at the same time acknowledging that tuition increases are beyond both the Guard\u2019s and Legislature\u2019s control. Even so, he said lawmakers \u201cneed to find a mechanism to make sure 100 percent equals 100 percent.\u201d", "On SNL, Pete Davidson says sorry to wounded vet he mocked\n\nIn this Nov. 10, 2018 photo provided by NBC, Lt.

U.S. support for the Kurdish-led forces has resulted in increased tension between Washington and Ankara.\n\nLast month, in a spike in tensions, Turkey said its military shelled Kurdish positions across the border in Syria, east of the Euphrates River.\n\nSince SDF suspended operations, IS has launched several offensives that have left scores of U.S.-backed fighters dead or wounded.\n\nDespite the cessation of ground operations, the U.S.-led coalition continued with its airstrikes against the extremist group.\n\nThe SDF said its fighters captured a senior IS commander in the northern city of Raqqa which until last year was the de facto capital of the extremists.\n\n\u201cThis shows that the organization still has roots and sleeper cells in liberated areas,\u201d it said.", "LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) \u2014 Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba is recovering from an undisclosed illness in Saudi Arabia and still performing his duties, according to a statement released Sunday amid mounting speculation about his health.\n\nThe issue is a particularly sensitive one in the Central African nation. When Bongo\u2019s father died in 2009 after more than four decades in power, Gabonese officials angrily denied French media reports of his death for almost a day, and shut down the internet in the country for several hours.\n\nThe statement said that Ali Bongo was suffering dizziness at his hotel in Riyad, Saudi Arabia on Oct. 24 when he sought medical care at King Faysal Hospital.\n\nThe information about the president\u2019s health is \u201cextremely reassuring\u201d and the president \u201ccontinues to perform his duties,\u201d the presidency said.\n\nThe communique came amid a swirl of rumors over the president\u2019s health back home in the Central African nation.

About a third of the population, estimated to be below 2 million people, live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe elder Bongo, who ruled the oil-rich nation from 1967 until his 2009 death, was viewed by many as the father of the nation. His time in power, though, was dogged by allegations of corruption and the use of oil profits for personal luxuries, including properties in several European and American cities, and lavish trips abroad.\n\nAli Bongo won a special presidential election that was held a few months after his father\u2019s death. The opposition claimed it was rigged.\n\nIn 2016, protesters took to the streets of the capital, Libreville, and the Parliament building was burned after Bongo\u2019s opponent, Jean Ping, accused Bongo of vote-rigging.

(AP) \u2014 In the days since a ferocious, wind-whipped wildfire began tearing through this Northern California town, residents who stayed behind to try to save their property or who managed to get back to their neighborhoods despite mandatory evacuation orders found cars incinerated and homes reduced to rubble. They have tales of harrowing escape and struggling to cope with loss.\n\nOroville businesswoman Tracy Grant has taken in a 93-year-old World War II veteran who doesn\u2019t know if his home in Paradise is still standing after a deadly wildfire swept through.\n\nGrant said Sunday she was handing out hamburgers to evacuees Thursday at the Forebay Aquatic Center, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Paradise, when she encountered Lee Brundige in his car.\n\nHe initially refused the hamburger she offered, saying she should give it to someone who really needed it. She tried to get him to a shelter, but he said he was fine sleeping in his car.\n\nThe next day, she convinced him to come home with her when the sheriff\u2019s office told people to clear out of the parking lot due to worsening air.\n\n\u201cHe looks at me and kind of grunted, \u2018No I don\u2019t want to take advantage of anyone, you\u2019re too kind.\u2019 So I said, \u2019This is my car.

Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are heading to trial starting Monday, Nov. 12, to settle a contract dispute in which Pabst accuses the brewing giant of trying to undermine its competitor by breaking a contract to make their products. (AP Photo/Ivan Moreno)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Pabst Brewing Company and MillerCoors are going to trial, with hipster favorite Pabst contending that MillerCoors wants to put it out of business by ending a longstanding partnership through which it brews Pabst\u2019s beers.\n\nThe case has high stakes for Pabst, whose lawyers argue that the company\u2019s very existence relies on the partnership with Chicago-based MillerCoors, which produces, packages and ships nearly all its products, which include Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Natty Boh and Lone Star. MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it\u2019s not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn\u2019t want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst\u2019s attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst\u2019s ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \u201cstunning documents\u201d obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \u201cfigure out ways to get rid of us.\u201d MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant\u2019s work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \u201cin good faith\u201d to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.\n\nPabst needs 4 million to 4.5 million barrels brewed annually and claims MillerCoors is its only option. It is seeking more than $400 million in damages and for MillerCoors to be ordered to honor its contract.\n\nDuring 2015 negotiations about extending the contract, MillerCoors announced it would close its brewing facility in Eden, North Carolina, and that it eventually might have to shutter another facility in Irwindale, California. Pabst contends that MillerCoors refused to provide any information to substantiate its claim that it would no longer have the capacity to continue brewing Pabst\u2019s beers, and that it wouldn\u2019t consider leasing the Eden facility and would only sell it for an \u201castronomical\u201d price.\n\nPabst says MillerCoors wouldn\u2019t agree to an extension unless Pabst paid $45 per barrel \u2014 \u201ca commercially devastating, near-triple price increase\u201d from what it pays now. At the March hearing, Paris said MillerCoors knew Pabst couldn\u2019t accept that proposal \u201cbecause it would have bankrupted us three times over.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, MillersCoors said Pabst\u2019s proposals to keep the Eden facility open \u201cwere commercially unreasonable\u201d and that Pabst sought \u201ca windfall through litigation\u201d instead of offering to pay enough to keep a facility open. It also said the facility\u2019s closing was \u201cto ensure the longer-term sustainability\u201d of MillerCoors because thousands of new brewers have entered the market over the past decade.\n\nMillerCoors and Anheuser-Busch, which have the biggest U.S. market share at 24.8 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively, have been losing business to smaller independent brewers, imports, and wine and spirits in recent years, according to the Brewers Association.\n\n\u201cThe beer market has shifted and beer lovers are increasingly demanding more variety, fuller-flavor, and local products from small and independent producers,\u201d said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association\u2019s chief economist.\n\nOverall U.S. beer sales have declined, with shipments down from 213.1 million barrels in 2008 to 204.2 million in 2017, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nPabst depends on MillerCoors because the only other U.S. brewer with capacity to make its products is Anheuser-Busch, which doesn\u2019t do contract brewing, Paris said.\n\n\u201cIt really is an existential issue for Pabst because it has no real alternatives,\u201d Paris said at the March hearing.\n\nParis said the report from the consultant MillerCoors hired in 2013 proves the company never intended to act in good faith. Pabst\u2019s attorneys say the report had sections focused on how to \u201celiminate Pabst altogether\u201d and noted that MillerCoors would need to close two breweries \u201cto be sure they don\u2019t have excess capacity for contract manufacturing.\u201d\n\nMillerCoors\u2019 attorney, Eric Van Vugt, said in court that the company didn\u2019t rely on the consultant\u2019s report when it decided to close Eden or when it has contemplated closing the Irwindale brewery.\n\n\u201cIf we keep Irwindale open, yes, we can supply their beer,\u201d Van Vugt said. \u201cNo one disputes that.

(Anthony Souffle/Star Tribune via AP)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Minnesota voters\u2019 choices in Tuesday\u2019s election will give the state another Democratic governor and a Legislature split between Democrats and Republicans, the latest experiment with divided government in Minnesota that has produced mixed \u2014 and sometimes few \u2014 results.\n\nAmid fears of a creeping economic recession, Democratic Gov.-elect Tim Walz, a new Democratic House majority and a Republican Senate will set a two-year budget likely to swell above $46 billion. And they\u2019ll tackle topics that have entrenched both parties at the Capitol like public health care financing and gun law restrictions.\n\nLeaders from both parties expressed confidence they could bridge their partisan divides after Walz is sworn in Jan. 7 and the Legislature returns Jan. 8. But the state\u2019s highest-ranking Republican warned both parties to constrain their agendas inside the nation\u2019s only Legislature where power is split between parties.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s too far out of bounds ... it\u2019s just not going to get there,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of divided government. Minnesotans seem to like that.\u201d\n\nThe results of split power in St. Paul haven\u2019t always been pretty. Lawmakers needed overtime to finish a budget in 2015, when Republicans controlled the House and Democrats had the Senate. Earlier this year, outgoing Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton struck down much of the Legislature\u2019s work, vetoing a package of spending increases and tax tweaks that would have squared Minnesota\u2019s tax code with the federal government.\n\nSome philosophical divides could slow things down in 2019.\n\nThirty-six hours after a commanding win over Republican Jeff Johnson, Walz opened his transition office at the state Capitol and renewed his commitment to two campaign pledges: Raising the gas tax to fund infrastructure improvements and expanding the low-income health care program MinnesotaCare with a public option. Both will figure heavily in budget discussions.\n\nWalz declined to put a firm number on how much he\u2019d propose to raise the per-gallon gas tax. It would be the first such increase since 2008, following Republicans\u2019 efforts in recent years to fund transportation repairs by shifting existing tax revenues and tapping into a budget surplus.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility, as I ran on, you can\u2019t just say you\u2019re not going to do anything in terms of revenue and budgets and you\u2019re magically going to get roads, bridges and transit,\u201d Walz said.\n\nRepublicans kept a one-seat majority in the Senate with a special election win in a conservative district. As Republicans\u2019 only lever of power, it puts pressure on Gazelka to protect the party\u2019s interests.\n\nHe and outgoing House Speaker Kurt Daudt \u2014 now relegated to the minority \u2014 shut down a gas tax increase as unreasonable, given another expected budget surplus next year. And Gazelka dismissed the idea of a public health care option as an unworkable government takeover.\n\nBut there are other, broader budget problems to solve. With a 2 percent tax on health care providers set to expire by 2020, Walz and lawmakers need to work out how to fund an array of public health care programs like MinnesotaCare and Medical Assistance, the state\u2019s name for Medicaid.\n\nWalz said he\u2019ll push to renew that tax before it expires, but Republicans have resisted extending the tax they worked hard to repeal in 2011.\n\n\u201cThat is going to be a big debate,\u201d Gazelka said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answers yet.\u201d\n\nA Democratic sweep through the suburbs could revive debate over new gun law restrictions. Democratic candidates flipped 18 districts to win back control of the House, with all but two coming in suburban districts that may support universal background checks and so-called \u201cred flag\u201d laws, which give families and police a legal path to temporarily remove guns from people who are a danger to themselves or others.\n\n\u201cRight now, they care an awful lot about gun violence prevention,\u201d incoming House Speaker Melissa Hortman said of suburban voters.\n\nFresh off the latest mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California that left 12 dead, Walz vowed to push for those measures in 2019. Similar legislation has been stymied in the Republican-controlled Legislature, but Gazelka said \u201cthere has been some openness.\u201d\n\nWalz said Tuesday\u2019s election should put all powerbrokers at the Capitol on notice.\n\n\u201cIf you missed the message of this election, it\u2019s that people want government to function.

The department also required the southern Nevada plan to be finished by April 27, 2019 \u2014 about two years earlier than expected.\n\nEmmerich said canceling the update could make it more difficult to protect environmentally sensitive land.", "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Federal ocean managers are looking to increase the amount of monitoring that goes on while fishing boats are out at sea.\n\nMany fisheries are subjected to monitoring, which collects valuable data that inform regulations and catch quotas. The New England Fishery Management Council says it\u2019s looking at ways to beef up monitoring in some fisheries to get an idea of the amount of catch and reduce uncertainty about estimates.\n\nThe Federal Register states that the goal of the effort is to \u201censure consistency in industry monitoring programs.\u201d It\u2019s also aimed at increasing monitoring in the Atlantic herring fishery, which is a major source for bait fish and food on the East Coast.\n\nThe federal government is collecting comments from the public on the proposal until Dec. 24.", "CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) \u2014 A foundation has granted $700,000 to the effort to save South Carolina\u2019s Crab Bank, a greatly eroded island and bird breeding area in Charleston Harbor.\n\nThe Post and Courier reports that the grant was needed by organizers hoping to complete a $1.4 million fundraising effort.\n\nThe grant was announced Friday by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The grant was given to Audubon South Carolina, one of the members of the S.C. Coastal Bird Conservation Program coalition. They are working under the auspices of the S.C. Department of Natural Resources to raise the local share of money to restore the island.\n\nCrab Bank was once a vital seabird and shorebird rookery.\n\nThe restoration work involves redirecting soils from the deepening of the Charleston shipping channel to replenish Crab Bank.\n\nAt its peak, the island covered more than 18 acres and nested nearly 4,000 birds. By last summer, erosion had cut the high ground to about an acre and no birds nested.\n\nIt was one of five protected rookeries that helped make for the eye-catching flocks of seabirds and shorebirds that are a wonder of the Southeast coast \u2014 from pelicans flying in formation by the dozens to black skimmers and oystercatchers hunting inches above the water.\n\nThe five rookeries are tiny, uninhabited swaths of sand and reeds where the birds tend nests in huge flocks of mixed species. They are vital habitat for troubled and threatened species. Each one is critical because individual islands tend to wash out, and because a tropical storm or hurricane can wreak havoc along any one of them.\n\nCrab Bank is the only one located in the relative safety of a harbor.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Post and Courier, http://www.postandcourier.com", "Governor-elect Tony Evers, left, and Lt. Governor-elect Mandela Barnes, right, with pillows found on the tour of the Boys & Girls Club of Dane County. State Rep-elect Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison) is right. On Wednesday Nov. 7, 2018 Governor-elect Tony Evers, and Lt. Governor elect Mandela Barnes took a tour of the Boys & Girls Club of Dane County in Madison, Wis. (Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Tony Evers made a lot of promises during his successful campaign against Republican Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 some specific, many more vague.\n\nNow he has to figure out how to deliver \u2014 in the face of a Republican Legislature already scheming to limit his power before he even takes office.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at promises Evers made, the challenges in getting them done, and other factors that will be at play when he takes over as Wisconsin\u2019s 46th governor on Jan. 7.\n\n___\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nEvers, the state schools superintendent since 2009, made increasing school aid a cornerstone of his campaign. He wants to increase spending by $1.4 billion, an idea that Republican legislative leaders call unrealistic. \u201cI would never commit to that number,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said Thursday. Instead, Fitzgerald said the Legislature would likely ignore Evers\u2019 education funding proposal and start from scratch. Given that both Republicans and Democrats campaigned on increasing education funding, it will go up, said Rep. Gordon Hintz, the Democratic minority leader in the state Assembly. The question is by how much, he said.\n\nHIGHER EDUCATION\n\nEvers, who as state superintendent is a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents, supported continuing the tuition freeze for in-state students another two years. He was more vague about funding levels for UW and technical colleges and never released a plan.\n\nROADS\n\nEvers never released a road funding plan. Instead, he said he wanted to talk with all the interested parties to come up with a proposal that could include increasing the state\u2019s 32.9-cents-per-gallon gas tax. Assembly Republicans last year were open to raising the gas tax, but the idea went nowhere in the face of opposition from Walker and Senate Republicans.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nEvers promised on his first day in office to pull Wisconsin out of a multistate federal lawsuit seeking repeal of the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s one promise he\u2019ll be able to easily fulfill. Evers also said he wanted Wisconsin to accept money from the federal government to expand Medicaid. That would bring about $190 million more a year to the state and extend coverage to about 80,000 low-income people. Republicans in the Legislature and Walker enacted a law that requires legislative approval to take the money, making it unlikely Evers will be able to get it given long-held GOP opposition.\n\nTAXES\n\nEvers promised to all but eliminate a manufacturing and agriculture tax credit program that Walker and Republicans enacted; he would cap it at $300,000 of annual income. That would save $300 million, money that Evers wants to use to pay for cutting income taxes for people who earn less than $100,000 a year. While Republicans are typically supportive of cutting income taxes, they oppose ending the tax credit program. That would force Evers to find another way to pay for the tax cut.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT and FOXCONN\n\nEvers wants to eliminate the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., the quasi-private jobs agency Walker created in 2011 that also took the lead in negotiating the Foxconn Technology Group deal. That deal commits up to $3 billion in state subsidies to Foxconn if it meets investment and job-creation targets. It could earn another $1 billion in local incentives. Evers will have a nearly impossible task in doing away with WEDC, since that would require a law change. Republicans are already looking at ways to protect the structure of WEDC by passing laws in a December lame duck session before Evers takes over. Evers would have more power to affect the Foxconn deal that don\u2019t require legislative signoff, such as having the Department of Natural Resources reconsider air and water permits.\n\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\nEvers campaigned on cutting the state\u2019s prison population in half, but he had no specific plan or timeline for doing it. He talked about reducing penalties for nonviolent offenders and other similar moves that would require legislation unlikely to be approved by a Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nGUNS\n\nEvers will almost certainly get nothing he wants related to gun control. He said he was open to toughening training requirements to get a concealed weapon permit. He supports universal background checks for gun purchases and wants to ban rapid-fire \u201cbump stock\u201d devices.\n\nACT 10\n\nEvers said he wanted to return collective bargaining rights for teachers and other public workers that were lost under Act 10, Walker\u2019s most significant legislative achievement. But both Vos and Fitzgerald say that\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cIf he wants to argue about Act 10 and all of the things that make people who eat granola and live in downtown Madison happy, that is his right but that is not where common ground is going to be found,\u201d Vos said.\n\nCOMMON GROUND\n\nWhen asked where he thought Republicans and Evers could work together, Fitzgerald said he expected agreement on fighting opioid abuse and other law enforcement issues he didn\u2019t specify. Hintz said divided government will lead to compromise: \u201cRarely does everybody get everything they want.\u201d Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said, \u201cI would be open to looking for common ground wherever he wants to find it, but we\u2019re not going to compromise any of the principles we have.\u201d", "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Clemency requests are on their way to Gov.

(AP) \u2014 The U.S. government is spending billions of dollars in New Mexico on a wide variety of goods and services and local business owners are building and boosting their bottom line by tapping into the federal procurement progress.\n\nFrom janitorial and office repair to selling valves and machine screws, some business owners sell only a portion of their products to federal agencies, while others devote much of their efforts to seeking and maintaining a mostly federal workload. Still others have been so successful that they are leaving government work behind and focusing more on the private sector, the Albuquerque Journal reports.\n\nJohn Garcia, head of the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s New Mexico office, said about $2.1 billion in federal contracting dollars went to small businesses in the state in fiscal 2017. That spending flows through two national laboratories, Kirtland, Cannon and Holloman air force bases and numerous other federal agencies that operate in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico depends on federal contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough some say we are too reliant on federal contracts,\u201d the expertise that companies gain doing government work can be \u201crolled over into the private sector.\u201d\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not always easy to navigate federal procurement hurdles, Wildflower International of Santa Fe owner Kimberly deCastro says the exacting requirements have given her company the tools to constantly improve and grow.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a 27-year-old marriage and love story. They (government agencies) are an excellent customer and an excellent mentor. I couldn\u2019t have grown my company like I did without it,\u201d deCastro said.\n\nLynn Armijo, owner of Four Winds Mechanical in Albuquerque, says the company she inherited from her father in 2013 was almost at the brink of shutting down while the New Mexico construction industry suffered from the effects of the recession.\n\nThere were too many companies competing for limited work and although she had long been a technician and site superintendent for the company, some customers didn\u2019t want to do business with a woman-owned firm after she took over.\n\nArmijo started bidding for federal jobs with the help of the Small Business Administration and the Procurement Technical Assistance Center in Albuquerque. Both agencies provide free workshops, one-on-one guidance and other resources so local businesses can more easily get certified and compete for government projects.\n\nArmijo, who served in Iraq with the Air National Guard, qualified as a \u201cservice-disabled veteran-owned small business,\u201d one of several certifications that provide preference when it comes to government work.\n\nBusinesses in the state, she said, have had to be dependent on government work because until recently New Mexico\u2019s economy has been stagnant. She said projects like the Facebook data center under construction in Los Lunas and the planned Netflix purchase of Albuquerque Studios will help.\n\nWildflower International has been so successful that it has branched out from doing IT services and hardware for the federal government into the world of data and drones. It has partnered with Albuquerque startup Silent Falcon to provide customers with information collected from unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe new venture will tap into government work, but deCastro said she was surprised to discover the growth opportunities in the private sector. For example, ranchers might need aerial data to survey their cattle or land holdings and wind farms might be interested in data analytics, she said.\n\nThat means she will pivot her company in a way that was unexpected so she can continue to be profitable and take care of her employees. The journey couldn\u2019t have happened without her federal government expertise.\n\n\u201cWe are a true Cinderella story,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Federal authorities are investigating the deaths of two free-roaming horses found shot on national forest land in eastern Arizona.\n\nU.S. Forest Service investigators discovered the dead horses near Heber-Overgaard in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests after receiving a tip last month, The Arizona Republic reported.\n\nThe horses could not be confirmed as belonging to the federally protected Heber herd, but investigators are treating them as such, said Jean Nelson-Dean, a representative of the Forest Service Southwest region.\n\nU.S. law prohibits killing a wild or free-roaming horse on federal lands.

The sidewalk must also remain above street level to allow for drainage, but driveways must be low enough to the ground for cars.\n\nModern cities are built to have more space between houses and wider boulevards so the sidewalk slopes aren\u2019t as noticeable, Murray said.

(AP) \u2014 Is Spokane starting to feel a bit crowded to you?\n\nAbout 740,000 people live in the greater Spokane-Coeur d\u2019Alene metro area, and that figure could swell by nearly 15,000 next year if the projected growth pans out.\n\nMoves, not births, are fueling most of the population gains. The surge of new residents means more traffic, more construction and more conversion of open space into urban areas. For longtime local residents, the change can feel jarring, said Grant Forsyth, Avista Corp.\u2019s chief economist.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who are 50-plus, the region looks completely different, and it feels different because so many people are moving here,\u201d Forsyth said.\n\nJob growth and affordable housing will continue to attract newcomers to the region, he predicted Wednesday at Greater Spokane Incorporated\u2019s annual economic forecast.\n\n\u201cOne of the big draws to the region is that we\u2019re still a cheap date,\u201d he said.\n\nSpokane County\u2019s cost of living is 14 percent below the Seattle area\u2019s and 5 percent below the national average, he said. Although Spokane County\u2019s median home prices have risen to $235,000, they remain a deal compared to other West Coast metro areas.\n\nStrong job growth will continue through the first half of 2019, but could slow during the second half of the year - especially if trade disputes with China escalate, Forsyth said.\n\nIf Amazon hires 1,500 workers next year to staff its West Plains fulfillment center as planned, however, the region is likely to see strong job growth throughout the year, he said.\n\nBut Forsyth thinks it might take Amazon longer than anticipated to hire a workforce of that magnitude. A tight labor market is something local employers will grapple with next year and into the future, Forsyth said.\n\n\u201cHiring that special someone is not going to be easy. Especially if you\u2019re in construction. Especially if you\u2019re in health care,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral hundred business people attended the economic forecast at the Spokane Convention Center.

Nationally, the housing sector is showing signs of weakness, and changes in federal monetary policy could alter the U.S. economy\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cThe length of the expansion was helped by federal policy,\u201d Forsyth said.\n\nThe local economy lagged behind the U.S. economy\u2019s recovery from the Great Recession by about 2 1/2 years, eventually catching up, he said.

Pete Ricketts thanks supporters in Omaha, Neb., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, after winning the election against Democrat Bob Krist. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts is considering a proposal that would change the way agricultural land is taxed to provide relief to farmers who are struggling amid low crop prices.\n\nThe governor floated the idea last week as a way to prevent property taxes from sharply increasing even as the state\u2019s agricultural economy is having troubles. A similar bill stalled in the Legislature in 2017, but Ricketts said he doesn\u2019t think it was fully debated or understood.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Ricketts said in an Associated Press interview. \u201cPeople have had a chance to think about it and look at it, and I think that gives us more of an opportunity to get that passed.\u201d\n\nNebraska now relies on a market-based system when valuing agricultural land, unlike most Midwestern states that levy based on the potential income a property can generate. Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, Wisconsin and the Dakotas all use the latter and typically charge less in agricultural property taxes than Nebraska.\n\nUnder Nebraska\u2019s system, farmland is assessed based on the market price of nearby land parcels that have recently been sold. Investors in recent years have bought such land at a premium, raising property values for the surrounding area even when commodity prices have fallen. The soaring land values result in higher taxes.\n\nFresh off his win in Tuesday\u2019s election, Ricketts said cutting taxes and promoting business growth will remain his top priorities for his next four years in office. He said the Legislature \u201chas been the obstacle\u201d to reducing property taxes because lawmakers have rejected his proposals, but he pledged to continue working with lawmakers.\n\nSome senators have blamed Ricketts for not accepting their ideas.\n\nSen. Steve Erdman, a retired farmer from Bayard, criticized the governor\u2019s tax package in April as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d for property taxpayers and called it \u201cone of the most ridiculous pieces of legislation I have seen in my life.\u201d\n\nNow, Erdman said he\u2019s working with the governor\u2019s staff on a bill that would tax agricultural land based on its potential income instead of its market value.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are buying for purposes other than farming it,\u201d Erdman said. \u201cIt seems very unfair to value 99 percent of ag land based on what happens to 1 percent of it.\u201d\n\nRicketts said he was also interested in the work done by a group of senators who were looking for ways to change Nebraska\u2019s aid formula for K-12 public schools, a major driver of property taxes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be one silver-bullet answer to solve this,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of my job is to try to bring together (urban and rural senators) on property taxes and find something we can agree on.\u201d\n\nOne prominent agriculture group, the Nebraska Farm Bureau, stopped short of endorsing the proposal but left open the possibility. Spokesman Craig Head said the group\u2019s members haven\u2019t yet approved a policy agenda for next year\u2019s session, \u201cbut property tax reform is still a high priority for us.\u201d\n\nOther rural senators said they support the concept but didn\u2019t think it addressed the immediate problem facing rural landowners.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really fix anything,\u201d said Sen. Mike Groene, of North Platte. \u201cTwenty years ago it would have been the answer, because it would have prevented these huge valuation increases we\u2019ve seen. Over the long range it works, but we don\u2019t have time for the long range.\u201d\n\nGroene said the proposal would shift the tax burden to other property owners within a county or school district. Local governments that can\u2019t collect additional revenue because of the policy could compensate by raising their levies \u2014 putting farmers back in the same predicament.\n\nGroene, a blunt-spoken fiscal conservative who owns farmland, said he was fine-tuning a different proposal to address the taxes levied by public schools.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something, or else I\u2019m going to leave this damn state,\u201d Groene said. \u201cI\u2019m sick of this.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte", "NEW LONDON, Conn.

Romano, Connecticut GOP Chairman, calls it a night at 1:35 a.m. with no decision in the Connecticut gubernatorial race at the Bob Stefanowski campaign gathering Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018 in Rocky Hill, Conn. (AP Photo/Stephen Dunn)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 For years, wealthy sections of Connecticut\u2019s Fairfield County appeared unwinnable for Democrats. But that all changed with the 2018 election.\n\nDemocrats managed to defeat Republicans in districts they haven\u2019t held in recent memory, including state Senate and Representative seats in Greenwich. That\u2019s the home of Connecticut\u2019s new governor-elect, wealthy businessman Ned Lamont, who became the first Democrat since 1876 elected to an open governor\u2019s seat in Connecticut and who has succeeded a fellow Democrat.\n\nParty leaders appeared somewhat surprised by the level of their success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a seat we\u2019ve ever had or come close to having,\u201d Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney said of the 36th Senate District, which includes Greenwich, New Canaan and parts of Stamford. Greenwich attorney Alexandria \u201cAlex\u201d Bergstein, a former Republican, defeated five-term incumbent Republican Sen. Scott Frantz by more than 600 votes. The seat was last held by a Democrat in 1930. The party also won Greenwich\u2019s 150th House seat, ending a century of Republican control.\n\nMeanwhile, veteran Republican state Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton lost to 22-year-old Democrat and recent Georgetown University graduate Will Haskell, who was motivated to run because of Republican President Donald Trump and was endorsed during the campaign by former President Barack Obama.\n\nLooney said he believes a combination of changing voter registration, opposition to Trump and the candidates\u2019 hard work and platforms fueled the Democratic Election Day wins. The party now controls the Senate by at least a 23-12 margin, with one race facing a recount. There was previously an 18-18 partisan split. In the House of Representatives, Democrats have at least a 90-58 majority, with three recounts pending. Democrats have had a slim 80-71 majority.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we saw encouraging headed into the election was the large increase in registration, from the time of the presidential election until now. It was far greater than the comparable period between 2012 and 2014,\u201d Looney said. \u201cSo we thought that was a sign of people moving in our direction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, he said, have seen a large increase in their party\u2019s registrations since 2016, even in heavily Republican towns. The trend, he said, was most pronounced in Fairfield County, which borders New York.\n\nMany see anger toward Trump as a major catalyst for that trend.\n\n\u201cFairfield County women? They were outraged at the behavior that their children were seeing on television. They were outraged. I saw it everywhere,\u201d said Bill Finch, a former Democratic mayor of Bridgeport and a state senator who campaigned for Lamont. \u201cFairfield County women wanted to send a message.\u201d\n\nJ.R. Romano, chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party, said he agrees that voters in wealthy parts of Fairfield County have become more willing to vote Democratic since the election of Trump. But he contends that\u2019s to the detriment of people living in less affluent parts of the state.\n\n\u201cThey are correct. Wealthier people who can afford to be offended by Donald Trump punished a single mom in East Haven, a hard-working family in Norwich, because they\u2019re recession-proof, they\u2019re not feeling the burden of what\u2019s happening in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the Democrats are turning into the party of wealth, while Republicans are trying to fight for hard-working middle class Americans.\u201d\n\nAnd Romano contends that a larger Democratic majority in General Assembly, coupled with a Democratic governor, will disproportionately harm those residents.\n\n\u201cSomeone in Fairfield County that gets tired of Connecticut\u2019s tax rate, they can just easily buy another home in another state,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case for people living in Ansonia, Connecticut. That\u2019s not the case for people living in these blue-collar communities. They\u2019re trapped here and they\u2019re feeling the burden.\u201d\n\nRomano said Democrats are already talking about legislation they\u2019ll offer in the new session that he claims will increase the cost of living in Connecticut, such as highway tolls. He sees the flips as temporary, given the closeness of the races.\n\nFormer Republican U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays, a political moderate whose old district includes much of Fairfield County, called Romano\u2019s comment about Fairfield County voters \u201cstupid,\u201d saying \u201cthat tells you why the Republicans are facing the problems they are facing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense and it\u2019s a poor excuse for a failure to build the party,\u201d Shays said, noting that Trump\u2019s tax-cutting plan benefits mostly the wealthy.\n\nShays was not surprised by what happened on Election Day. He was the last Republican member of New England\u2019s House delegation in 2008 when he lost the 4th District seat to Democrat Jim Himes, who has since held onto the seat.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party hardly exists in the Northeast. It\u2019s become a mixture of a Trump party and just a lack of enthusiasm in general,\u201d he said, theorizing that \u201calmost anyone\u201d would have defeated him if he was running for re-election this year. In the era of Trump, Shays said Republican candidates in Fairfield County now face the prospect of being punished at the polls for not speaking out against Trump and not receiving the party\u2019s nomination if they do criticize the president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d he said of the legislative losses. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s a party that has just lost its way, totally and completely.\u201d", "PORTSMOUTH, Ohio (AP) \u2014 A professor is suing officials at his small, public university in Ohio after receiving a written warning for violating its nondiscrimination policy by not addressing a transgender student using the gender terms preferred by that student.\n\nNicholas Meriwether filed a federal lawsuit this week against officials at Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, roughly 85 miles (137 kilometers) south of Columbus.

Very unofficially, we have had at least 15 fatal overdoes in Burlington County hotels and motels in 2018.\u201d\n\nCoffina said the introduction of fentanyl, \u201cwhich is 50 times more powerful than heroin,\u201d has transformed the ongoing epidemic to \u201cessentially a game of Russian roulette.\u201d Nationally, the prosecutor said, motels and hotels have been susceptible to a higher risk of overdoses as the ongoing drug epidemic \u201crages on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking initiative represents another approach we are incorporating into our efforts to save as many lives as possible from this deadly scourge,\u201d Coffina added.\n\nAs a part of the new initiative, the Prosecutor\u2019s Office Gang, Gun and Narcotics Task Force has also prioritized hotels and motels as a focus of its investigative and enforcement activities in 2018, the office said.\n\nHotel staffers joined local law enforcement at a drug education and training program Wednesday. The three-hour session included the introduction of the program and the opioid crisis; a naloxone demonstration on a dummy; and a panel discussion with law enforcement officials from Bordentown, Maple Shade, Mount Laurel and the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nHotel employees were instructed on how to identify individuals they think may be at risk for a potential overdose, and also how to keep themselves safe from exposure to dangerous drugs while maintaining guest rooms and common areas of the properties.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office said statistics from NJ Cares show there have been 135 suspected fatal overdoses in Burlington County this year, which is on pace to surpass the 143 deadly overdoses last year. Naloxone has been deployed more than 770 times across the county this year.\n\n\u201cOpioids kill 175 people every day in the U.S.,\u201d Assistant Prosecutor Michael Angermeier said. That large death toll is similar to having a 9/11-type event 20 to 30 times a year in the country, he said.\n\nMount Laurel police Detective Sean Bristow said because of his town\u2019s proximity to Interstate 295, the New Jersey Turnpike and other major highways, \u201cwe\u2019re a hub in this area.\u201d Prostitution and drug deals are the biggest crimes they see at hotels and motels, he said.\n\n\u201cOverdoses in hotels has just grown rampantly,\u201d Bristow said. \u201cWe\u2019re using Narcan quite a bit. It just seems to be getting worse and worse.\u201d\n\nProsecutor\u2019s office Detective Steve Laramie gave a demonstration about how to use naloxone to revive an overdose victim. The office supplied hotel workers with naloxone kits, supplied by Virtua.\n\nCoffina thanked the health system for partnering with the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are very, very grateful for Virtua\u2019s enthusiastic support of our efforts to save lives in Burlington County, not only through Safe Overnight, but also through their support in providing naloxone to our municipal police departments,\u201d Coffina said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2SXMxcF\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier-Post (Cherry Hill, N.J.), http://www.courierpostonline.com/", "Suit by bicyclist hit by police vehicle will head to trial\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 A woman\u2019s lawsuit seeking damages for injuries she suffered when a police vehicle struck her during a bike ride will head to trial now that Indiana\u2019s high court has declined to hear the case.\n\nThe state Supreme Court has ruled it would not review a state Court of Appeals decision that ordered a trial to determine whether Sheila Gonzalez is entitled to damages for her injuries.\n\nThe Hobart woman was bicycling with her two children in July 2014 when she was struck by a vehicle driven by a Chesterton police detective.\n\nGonzalez sued the officer, the town of Chesterton and the Porter County Drug Task Force.\n\nThe (Northwest Indiana) Times reports that a Porter County judge initially dismissed her suit, but Indiana\u2019s appeals court reversed that ruling in May.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.nwitimes.com", "CRANSTON, R.I.

(AP) \u2014 Immersing himself in the wild western adventures of the African-American Buffalo Soldiers has been a return to some familiar themes and narratives for graphic designer and comic book artist Stan Webb.\n\nWebb and writer Dion Lee released the first issue of the comic book \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d in early October. But the characters and storyline have stuck with them for close to 20 years, since the two originally published the first four books of \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d in the early \u201990s.\n\nWebb recalled the work involved in traveling along the east coast to independent comic expos and conventions, spreading hype about \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d the old-fashioned way.\n\n\u201cYou printed up a bunch of books and then you hit the road and sell them, and that\u2019s how we did it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut life got in the way as we got older; I got married, (Lee) got married, we had kids and life got in the way.\u201d\n\nThe duo had collaborated on comics since their school days. Webb said they were big fans of comics like Superman and Spider-Man growing up and would work on ideas for their own comics during summertime.\n\nWebb honed his skills at Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art in New Jersey, where he also learned about animation and graphic design.\n\n\u201cIt was a real treat to have a teacher who was actually in the comic book business and I really learned a lot from that school as far as illustration was concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he\u2019d come back home to Lynchburg from college, Webb recalled visiting the late teacher and historian Henry Powell, a family friend, on Saturdays to listen to him wax on about history \u2014 national to local. One of the discussions that particularly caught his ear compared the Tuskegee Airmen, the decorated African-American pilots who flew during World War II, to the Buffalo Soldiers, a group of African-American army men who fought Native Americans to help settlers move west in the late 1800s.\n\nWebb said he was familiar with the Tuskegee Airmen but knew nothing about this other black military unit that wasn\u2019t mentioned in textbooks. The Buffalo Soldiers piqued his interest and Powell loaned him more niche history books to learn from.\n\n\u201cThe more I read up on it, the more I like the history behind it,\u201d he said.\n\nPowell asked Webb if he\u2019d be willing to draw illustrations for a children\u2019s book that\u2019d introduce them to the Buffalo Soldiers. Webb said the two met for months brainstorming ideas for the book, and eventually the prospective project morphed into a comic book he and Lee dreamed up, based on the historical material Powell provided them. He said Powell thought pursuing the comic route was a great idea and the first book in the \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d is dedicated to him.\n\nFor their comic, Webb and Lee filled the Buffalo Soldiers\u2019 historical narrative with characters they thought up themselves, like the hero, Tom Wilson.\n\nMost of the Buffalo Soldiers were illiterate and couldn\u2019t record their own exploits, Webb said. He said white cavalry units in the same areas as the Buffalo Soldiers \u2014 largely from the Dakotas down to Texas, as far out as Arizona \u2014 didn\u2019t keep good records of the black units and there isn\u2019t much historical literature about the 10th Cavalry unit. So, Webb said he and Lee decided to focus their story on what is known about the 10th Cavalry.\n\n\u201cWe might embellish a few things here and there, but we try to stick as much to the history (and) what was in the history books at the time that we can pull from,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the Civil War right behind them, Webb said the soldiers fought through segregation, prejudice and disadvantage. At the time, the U.S. Army refused to integrate and instead pushed segregated black units \u2014 later becoming known as Buffalo Soldiers \u2014 out west, into America\u2019s no man\u2019s land.\n\n\u201cAnybody that was . out west and going into dangerous territory, they requested the Buffalo Soldiers because they had a really good record and they knew they would be in good hands,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Webb and Lee decided to stop publishing \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d in the \u201990s, they said they still kept the ideas and storyline flowing over the years as they kept in touch.\n\nBesides their kids transitioning into adulthood, Lee said the white supremacist-led Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville last year and the political climate surrounding that rally helped energize him to try and push the Buffalo Soldiers\u2019 little-known story back into the spotlight.\n\n\u201cI thought that we needed to inject something different, something more positive, something new into the current climate,\u201d he said.\n\nLee, who also lives in Lynchburg, said he sees \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d as counterprogramming to history on U.S. slavery and as another, different perspective to black history.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a gap between what you hear about slavery and the Tuskegee Airmen,\u201d he said. \u201d. So to fill that gap and to fill that void and to provide new information and some history that a lot of people didn\u2019t know about . you combine the lack of knowledge with Mr. Powell\u2019s passion and Stan\u2019s passion about the project: that\u2019s what made me want to pursue it.\n\nWhile there have been a few African-American heroes from comic book giants like DC and Marvel over the years, Webb said he hasn\u2019t seen a lot of change in the same white heroes stealing the show. Even within the independent comics scene \u2014 made more accessible than ever now with technology and the internet \u2014 he said black comics typically see more of a cult following.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see some that\u2019ll pop up every now and then but you still don\u2019t see it as much as you should, I think. I don\u2019t know what the real reason why you really don\u2019t but it\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nWebb said he\u2019d like to publish 10 issues of \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d \u2014 one or two 60-page issues a year \u2014 and see where the series takes him and Lee from there. Next year, he said he\u2019d like to tap up comic conventions and expos nearby to reintroduce the comic to new audiences. A few readers, like members of Buffalo Soldier associations, have asked Webb to keep them in the loop for the reboot.\n\nHe and Lee are also exploring new, innovative ways to bring their story to readers: a side story for \u201cBuffalo Soldier\u201d is online in an interactive format and the two are hammering out the best digital medium for \u201cBuffalo Force,\u201d a futuristic sci-fi spinoff of their original creation. For \u201cBuffalo Force,\u201d he said they\u2019ve experimented with using cellphone scanning apps to help tell their story.\n\nA graphic artist for Dayrich whose work can be seen in the Lynchburg Museum, at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Poplar Forest and at Amazement Square, Webb said he\u2019ll sometimes pepper in some comic art during his typical work day: filling in some ink or color on a panel, drawing up a quick sketch or jotting down an idea as it comes to him.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s a little harder getting back into it because I\u2019ve got to pull out my old drawings of the characters and all . getting back into drawing horses again, and people on horses, so it takes a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I try to work on it every day.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News & Advance, http://www.newsadvance.com/", "Group looks to help next nonprofit in need of a makeover\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H.

Or their early interest in alternative spirituality \u2014 Julie in the Chinese zodiac, Catie in Wicca and Buddhist philosophy.\n\nCatie started identifying as a witch around the same time Julie did, which was after graduation, when she decided to get a tarot reading from a professional.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t know quite why I\u2019m here, but I want to get more interested in metaphysics,\u2019\u201d Julie said.\n\nThe reader \u2014 a Wiccan high priestess \u2014 told her a number of things: to find a goddess, to buy a crystal, to read the book \u201cWicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner\u201d by Scott Cunningham. It was that last suggestion that changed Julie\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWhen I was reading that book, it made me cry in happiness because I realized that I had been a witch all this time and never really had the word for it,\u201d Julie said. \u201cNo one ever said to me as a little kid, like, \u2018Yes, you can grow up to be a witch as a viable life path.\u2019\u201d\n\nYes, Julie and Catie are witches. That\u2019s how they identify. Not as Wiccans, which is a specific religious affiliation. Not as the Harry Potter kind of witch, or the scary fairytale kind. Modern witchcraft is an amalgamation of different beliefs, but Julie and Catie define a witch, loosely, as anyone who practices magic. And magic, in turn, is equivalent in their minds to the Buddhist concept of praj\u00f1a, or the Chinese belief in ch\u2019i.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s energy,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAnd then the practice of magic is infusing that energy with your intention and anchoring that in the physical world. To send that intention out into the universe, or whatever you want to call it, and then wait for the effect to echo back to you.\u201d\n\nThe two are used to getting dismissed, but think about it: What is a spell but a very active form of prayer, trusting that your own will \u2014 combined with the wisdom of the universe \u2014 can manifest exactly what you need? Julie, a certified yoga teacher, even ties in the Hindu concept of koshas, five layers of the self that should all be aligned before you cast a spell. It\u2019s Maslovian psychology, perfectly tailored for the modern age. Can you use your cell phone to do magic? The answer is yes, according to Catie. Anything done with intention is magic. Making soup for a sick friend. Visiting your grandmother in the hospital. Witchcraft is just learning to take that innate power and crank it up to 11.\n\nIt\u2019s a belief simple enough \u2014 and accessible enough \u2014 that Julie and Catie are betting a business on it. This January, they founded the Moonhaven School of Magic, a popup academy with a full curriculum of mystical courses. Classes cover divination and Norse runes, mythology and faerie lore, and they all trace back to a progressive millennial ethos. Julie and Catie make sure to highlight topics like the ethics of magic, or intersectionality and cultural appropriation in modern craft.\n\nBecause in 2018, magic is woke. Magic is a lifestyle. The hashtag \u201cwitchesofinstagram\u201d has nearly two million posts with selfies and hand-drawn art and tongue-in-cheek branded content, like a heather grey T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cSage, Crystals & Trap Music.\u201d There are active online communities debating ethical crystal sourcing and the environmental sustainability of essential oils. Witchcraft is even popular enough to have a discernible economic impact in Frederick, where three businesses have opened this year to support it.\n\nThere\u2019s Moonhaven, of course, and In//Sight Frederick, a one-woman tarot reading company opened in February by Anna See-Jachowski. The 29-year-old offers readings every other Saturday at 11:11 Caf\u00e9 and every other Sunday at Vini Culture, plus by private appointment and at the occasional special event at other businesses around the city.\n\nLike Julie and Catie, she identifies as a practicing witch (she even spent her third wedding anniversary in Salem, Massachusetts). There\u2019s also a strong progressive streak to her practice. Anna\u2019s mother, a Reiki healer, first gave her a deck of tarot cards in middle school, but her interest returned again recently when she saw a friend promoting a new tarot deck on Instagram. Produced by an artist\u2019s collective called Slow Holler, the sold-out deck featured illustrations by queer Southern artists and subverted many of the gendered symbols on traditional tarot cards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a healing, beautiful deck, and it\u2019s what I started using more and more with friends,\u201d said Anna, who identifies as queer herself.\n\nWitchcraft, to her, is more of a personal belief system, wrapped up in universal principles like mindfulness and a reverence for nature. But that\u2019s the beauty of it as a spiritual practice. Witchcraft isn\u2019t tightly defined. It isn\u2019t exclusive. It\u2019s personally liberating for Anna, who spent most of her childhood at the Mother Seton School in Emmitsburg.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not knocking people who practice Christianity or Catholicism, if that\u2019s your belief system,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will say, for me, it always felt like I was left out of it. Whereas magic has always been something that embraces people all across the gender spectrum. It\u2019s a form of spirituality that celebrates everyone who\u2019s a part of it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an aspect of witchcraft that Catie calls \u201cmagical activism\u201d and Anna calls \u201csocial justice in action.\u201d There might be millions of people who identify as witches, but magic, as a concept, still feels subversive enough to break down institutional norms. It\u2019s why a coven from Brooklyn gained so much attention when they gathered to publicly hex Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh. Or why so many witches also embrace feminism, or intersectionality.\n\n\u201cMagic is empowering in the sense that you can cast an empathy spell, or a justice spell, and feel like you have a role in things that are going on,\u201d Catie said. \u201cOr even in the nature of how we treat shamanism, which has a long tradition of cross-dressing. Witchcraft has been around for so long, there\u2019s a sense that we\u2019re all one family and we hold space for everyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from the perceptions of witchcraft in the 1970s and \u201980s, when magic was more closely associated with cults and satanic rituals. Frederick still has one coven that dates back to 1989, the Root of the Circle Witches, but it\u2019s a different type of beast altogether, with an emphasis on nude rituals and cryptic pseudonyms. The coven\u2019s leader, who identified himself as Luxas Aureaum, said he can remember a time when Wicca and paganism were considered interchangeable with satanism and demonic possession. That kind of misinformation still floats like flotsam in the general sea of pop culture, he said, but his coven has also witnessed the recent cutesification of witchcraft. There\u2019s the upcoming \u201cCharmed\u201d remake, as one example, or the slick Netflix remake of \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201d More generally, there\u2019s the current blend of the occult with Eastern traditions and the wellness industry.\n\n\u201cWe keep up on these things,\u201d Luxas said tartly. \u201cI think they\u2019re drawing from things like shamanism and yoga to make it more contemporary. But in no way is anything like that \u2014 yoga or any of the aesthetics of the New Age \u2014 any part of witchcraft.\u201d\n\nEven if older witches don\u2019t agree with it, the intersection between wellness and magic makes modern witchcraft much more commercially viable. Julie and Catie offer a class called Self-Care for the Modern Age, and many of their practices utilize some of the same tools embraced by the holistic community. Incense, candles, essential oils \u2014 they can all be used in magical rituals or as a way to unwind at the end of the long week. There\u2019s a universal appeal.\n\n\u201cI think the idea behind magic is that just like love or light, it\u2019s in everything,\u201d Anna said. \u201cIt encourages self-awareness and self-love, first and foremost.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a cultural movement that supports shops like Alchemy No. 119, a new wellness boutique that opened on East Patrick Street in May. Owner Pattee Brown isn\u2019t a witch, per se (she describes herself as an intuitive \u2014 someone who can sometimes glean personal information from complete strangers), but her shop carries healing crystals and talismans along with self-help guides and meditation journals. Just a few doors down is Anam Cara Apothecary, a holistic health store opened four years ago by the mother/daughter duo of Ayme Clark and Chelsea Matuskey. Again, Ayme and Chelsea don\u2019t identify as witches, but their store carries a whiff of the mystical, with beautifully bottled essential oil tinctures and shelves stocked with semi-precious stones. There\u2019s citrine, amethyst, and tiger\u2019s eye in glittering stacks, with signs that promise the stones can manifest wealth, luck, and self-worth, respectively.\n\nBoth stores profit from the growing popularity of witchcraft, even if they don\u2019t directly associate with the lifestyle. For Pattee, the movement is indicative of a growing focus on spirituality and emotional well-being, of a new generation with a more tangible focus on physical and mental health.\n\n\u201cWhat I see happening in downtown Frederick is just a microcosm of a bigger picture \u2014 this shift in consciousness happening in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI see a spiritual awakening insofar as people are more open to something as simple as chakra energy or the exchange of ideas between people, even if you don\u2019t know them. And it seems to be steeped in the culture of witchcraft because that\u2019s something people weren\u2019t looking at before.\u201d\n\nThe growth of witchcraft, at least for Chelsea, can trace back to the same social media platforms that helped magic become such a broadly appealing subculture. And the language used in the community is just part of the attraction \u2014 after all, she and her mother have capitalized on it. The tagline for Anam Cara Apothecary, which specializes in topical essential oil remedies, is \u201cwhere science meets magic.\u201d The back of the store is a custom \u201cpotion blending bar,\u201d where customers can create their own essential oil blend.\n\nVisually, too, witchcraft is attractive. The tools used in rituals \u2014 flowers, crystals, runestones \u2014 are aesthetically pleasing and infinitely customizable.\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen an altar not on Instagram?\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cHave you ever not seen a crystal collection on Instagram? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not real. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a shadow over this stuff.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s an unmistakable link between alternative medicine and the underlying philosophy of modern witchcraft, which pays lip service, at least, to the subversion of some institutional practices. Anam Cara was founded to provide an alternative to mainstream medical care, based off concerns that Ayme and Chelsea \u2014 both practicing reflexologists \u2014 were hearing from their clients. Ayme, a crystal healer and clinical aromatherapist, embraces claims about some of her products that fall well outside accepted medical knowledge (including that crystals can help relieve mental health symptoms like depression or anxiety).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t identify as being a witch, but I identify with being one who understands nature and respects its magic,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I get upset when I see people not give legitimacy to nature\u2019s strengths.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an increasingly common feeling. Spending on alternative and complementary medicines topped $33.9 billion in 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Market research suggests their use is only continuing to grow. And while not all healers identify as witches, there are plenty of witches who identify as healers. Julie, for example, has logged more than 2,000 hours as a yoga instructor and considers herself both a teacher and a healer. And Anna, a licensed social worker for Hospice of Washington County, hopes to one day incorporate tarot readings into her practice.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about tarot is that it kind of opened the door for me to explore the identity of being a healer, whether that\u2019s through psychic work or Reiki or things of that nature,\u201d she said. \u201cIt validated that aspect of myself in a way I hadn\u2019t opened up to before.\u201d\n\nIt makes sense in the context of today\u2019s world, where core institutions have been shaken by sometimes shattering revelations. Alternative medicine looks more appealing in the light of the opioid epidemic, spurred by misleading marketing by major pharmaceutical companies. Religious institutions like the Catholic Church are grappling with recurring reports of sexual abuse and intolerance towards the LGBTQ community. It\u2019s easy to embrace witchcraft, long associated with feminism, when countless powerful men have faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Who\u2019s to say a crystal can\u2019t help manifest desires in the real world?\n\nIt feels empowering just to think that it can.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Frederick (Md.) News-Post, http://www.fredericknewspost.com", "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 When Kentucky\u2019s GOP-dominated legislature made changes to the state\u2019s troubled pension system, thousands of teachers protested by rallying at the state Capitol and forcing the closure of more than 30 school districts.\n\nRepublicans worried the vote would haunt them in November. Their fears seemed warranted in May, when House Majority Floor Leader Jonathan Shell was defeated by a high school math teacher in a Republican primary who had never run for public office before.\n\nBut on Tuesday, there was no teacher backlash at the polls. Of the 49 Republican legislators who voted for the bill and ran for re-election, four of them lost. That includes Republican Rep. DJ Johnson, who lost by one vote in a race that could be headed to a recount.\n\nMeanwhile, eight lawmakers \u2014 including five Republicans \u2014 who voted against the pension bill were defeated or are trailing in either the primary or general election. They included Democratic Rep. Linda Belcher, a former public school teacher and administrator, and Republican Rep. Phil Moffett, who lost to special education teacher Tina Bojanowski.\n\nThe results have encouraged some of the legislature\u2019s Republican leaders, who are urging their members to be less timid when the legislature reconvenes in January.\n\n\u201cMy message to Republicans in this election is that you can take a tough vote on a controversial issue and run for re-election in a difficult environment and still win,\u201d said Damon Thayer, the Republican floor leader in the state Senate. \u201cIf you go out and run a good campaign and explain to people why you vote the way you voted, you\u2019re not going to get punished for it.\u201d\n\nHouse Democratic leader Rocky Adkins said Democrats were thwarted by a combination of \u201cdark money\u201d GOP ads and President Donald Trump\u2019s Kentucky visit in early October, which he said energized Republican voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the conclusion can be drawn on just that one issue,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats also benefited from outside spending. The political action committee Kentucky Family Values, whose donors include the Kentucky Education Association, spent more than $1.1 million during the election.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Phillip Pratt voted for the pension bill. By the fall, he was locked in a close race with Jenny Urie, a high school history teacher. She campaigned on the pension issue, posting videos of some of the teacher rallies at the Capitol and pledging to protect the pensions if elected. Urie said the Republican Party of Kentucky responded by mailing ads to voters comparing her to Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. She lost by more than 3,000 votes.\n\n\u201cThat energy we had about the pension bill got overshadowed by the nationalization of our campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is current in the news kind of overshadowed things that happened nine months ago.\u201d\n\nThe results could be troubling for Democrat Andy Beshear, the attorney general who is running for governor in 2019. Beshear has focused his campaign on support for teachers, including picking an assistant high school principal as his running mate. As attorney general, he sued to overturn the pension law, arguing the case himself before the state Supreme Court in September. A ruling is expected next month. But the election results indicate the issue of teacher pensions might not have the political power Beshear was counting on.\n\nBut Beshear is confident courting teachers will be a winning strategy for him, mostly because of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s comments criticizing teachers who oppose his policies.\n\nJonathan Shell, the former House majority leader who lost to a teacher in the Republican primary, says he believes Republicans will keep winning if they stick to their principles.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to listen to the protests and the mobs,\u201d he said.", "FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Reverend David Hall\u2019s office is still undergoing some changes.\n\nIn the four months, he has been a part of Valley Chapel United Methodist, a small, yet dignified, brown and white church that sits on Pleasant Valley Road, he has still been adding personal touches to the office that he inherited. Bookshelves that span an entire wall are filled with theology texts, a dark wood desk is a resting place for stacks of folders and papers, and a black music stand against the wall next to the window carries lesson outlines for the bible study class he teaches on Wednesday nights.\n\nIn 11 or so years, or sooner if he\u2019s appointed somewhere else, he will have to retire and clear out the office to allow his successor to fill the office with his personal effects. But Rev. Hall doesn\u2019t want to leave.\n\nHe likes it here.\n\n\u201cWhere is God leading me? Where is God saying He wants me next?\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cI do feel God has led me here. I feel that the appointment is valid. It\u2019s a good appointment for me. It\u2019s a good match.\u201d\n\no o o o o o\n\nAlthough he was born in Charleston, West Virginia almost 62 years ago, Rev. Hall spent much of his childhood moving around for his father\u2019s vocational rehabilitation counseling work, then his father\u2019s research. Then, his father became a teacher and the family finally settled down.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was in fifth grade, I had been to seven different schools,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cFirst grade, one place. The first half of second grade, someplace else. The second half of second grade. Third grade, in one place. The first half of fourth grade, in one place, and then the second half of fourth grade in another. Fifth grade, six, seventh, eighth, ninth, in one place, and then I graduated somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school, Rev. Hall studied to be a music teacher at West Virginia Tech and then taught music and band in some of the schools in southern West Virginia before becoming the choir director at Montgomery. While a choir director of his church in 1995, Rev. Hall was planning the worship service.\n\nHe was reading Jeremiah 1-10 and suddenly realized God was speaking to him through the text. In the passage, God tells Jeremiah that he will go where God sends him and say what he told Jeremiah said.\n\n\u201cIn reading that scripture, God was no longer talking about Jeremiah,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cHe was talking about David Hall. I talked to my pastor, and my pastor said \u2018Consider you may have been called into ministry.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe next three years of his life were spent in Candidacy, a process which begins as a period of exploration and is followed by the formal application, mentoring, meeting additional requirements, and evaluations of spiritual, personal and professional qualifications.\n\nFinally, in 1998, Rev. Hall entered into Seminary was ordained a deacon in 2003 and, three years later, ordained as an elder in the United Methodist Church. Rev. Hall was then appointed from church-to-church \u2014 spending five years in Kentucky, two years in Princeton, New Jersey, nine years in Bluefield, West Virginia, and four years in Spencer \u2014 before receiving his appointment in Fairmont.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Seminary, I thought \u2018This is crazy. Nobody can do this,\u2019\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cBut, that\u2019s the whole point. It\u2019s not what I can do, it\u2019s what God does through me.\u201d\n\nWhile in high school, Rev. Hall said he felt even then he was being encouraged by to become a bigger part of the church but said he didn\u2019t listen because he wanted to go into music. But, looking back, he knew he was miserable.\n\nNow he feels content and knows he is where he\u2019s supposed to be.\n\n\u201cThe first 40 years of my life were spent in music,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cThe next 40 years will be in ministry.\u201d\n\no o o o o o\n\nRev. Hall was not new to the Methodist Church and had grown up with it, just like the Methodist Church is not new to the United States, as it had also grown up with the country.\n\nRev. Hall\u2019s family, from Scotland, were all Scottish Presbyterians, and in his youth, he had also gone to Sunday school in the Presbyterian church. When the family lived in St. Alban\u2019s, his father was the father of the Presbyterian Men at Highlawn Presbyterian Church.\n\nHowever, the family switched to the Methodist Church \u2014 his mother\u2019s church \u2014 and Rev. Hall eventually became the president of the Methodist Youth Fellowship and also went to summer camps. Rev. Hall said, in the past, the United Methodist Church was extremely active \u2014 there were even four churches in Pleasant Valley.\n\nWhile the system of faith and worship, as well as the belief in and worship of a personal God or gods, is what defines religion, Rev. Hall doesn\u2019t like that term.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t call it religion,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cReligion is man\u2019s attempt to reach God. Christianity is God\u2019s attempt to reach man. So, I\u2019m a Christian and I profess faith in Jesus Christ. Religion is something that I try to fight because religion is a man-made institution and I don\u2019t like man-made institutions. I\u2019m not in favor of a democracy, or a republic. I\u2019m in favor of a theocracy where God is in charge.\n\n\u201cThe United States is founded on religious freedom. That meant that we would be free to practice our faith. What happened is they ended up saying we have the freedom from religion, which, I guess, in a sense we do. But, that would break the hearts of our founding fathers.\u201d\n\nRev. Hall was appointed to Fairmont\u2019s United Methodist Church after the previous pastor moved to Sistersville, and said the pastor who replaced him at his previous church was from Friendsville in Maryland. Since the pastor who replaced that pastor was previously in Sistersville, Rev. Hall said the four of them did a \u201cdosie-do.\u201d\n\nAlthough Rev. Hall and his family came from Marshall territory, he said the family is learning to appreciate West Virginia football. Rev. Hall also said Fairmont is a wonderful place.\n\nRev. Hall likes the environment and said there\u2019s a lot of things to do in the area. He also was blown away by the fact that he could be in Pennsylvania in an hour and the high activity of the Valley Chapel.\n\n\u201cThe culture here isn\u2019t very different,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cIt\u2019s very open, very friendly. West Virginians are, by-and-large, nice people. I was concerned when we moved first north to Spencer that it was going to be clannish, or \u2018we don\u2019t welcome strangers\u2019. I was welcomed there. I have been welcomed here by very friendly people, much like any other part of the state of West Virginia...For the most part, West Virginians are caring, loving, very open.\u201d\n\no o o o o o\n\nOne of the things Rev. Hall needs to do when he gets to a new place is to find the meaning of the town in which he will preach.\n\n\u201cPart of the job of the new pastor is to learn what Valley Chapel\u2019s all about,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cWhat Bentons Ferry is all about. We\u2019re all called to proclaim the gospel, we\u2019re all called to reach the needy, and help, and all these things, but how do we do it differently than someone else? What makes Valley Chapel, Valley Chapel? What makes us special here? What makes Valley Chapel unique?\u201d\n\nRev. Hall recalled his previous appointment in Kentucky, and how that calling was taking young pastors and turning them into more mature pastors. In Bluefield, he said was very involved in the community, but had also been there for nine years.\n\n\u201cHere, I haven\u2019t quite found my place yet,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cBut, I\u2019ve only been here four months. I\u2019ve just got to figure out what makes Valley Chapel \u2014 what makes Bentons Ferry \u2014 unique in their own setting and how can I guide them into doing what God has called them to do.\u201d\n\nRev. Hall mentioned how the church just made about 1,400 pounds of sausage to sell this past week, how the boy scout program (Troop 7) is one of the largest in the area, how the preschool is very prevalent.\n\n\u201cThis church is very active,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cVery community-minded, looking for ways to help out, looking for ways to participate in community activities, and I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m just the guy who points these things out. I preach a little bit, teach a little bit. I\u2019m basically just here to help the ministry and to point them in the right direction.\u201d\n\nRev. Hall said his duties are to organize the \u201clife of the church\u201d. While they consider him the pastor, which means he essentially runs the show, Rev. Hall has never been like that.\n\n\u201cThe Methodist Church was founded on the laity,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cWhen the people came from Europe and moved to what was then the colonies, it was the lay people \u2014 regular, down-to-earth-folks, working laborers \u2014 that brought Methodism with them.\u201d\n\nRev. Hall said while preachers moved between the various churches in the area, it was the people who belonged to those churches that ran the church. He considers himself the rallying point, rather than the commander.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the CEO of Valley Chapel,\u201d Rev. Hall said. \u201cI\u2019m not the CEO of Bentons Ferry. I\u2019m here to help the church to do its ministry. The Church is the people. I\u2019m here to help them do their job...I\u2019m here to teach and preach and help wherever I can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Times West Virginian, http://www.timeswv.com", "Their father served in World War I, but his daughters cannot recall ever hearing him speak of his wartime experiences.\n\n\u201cFrom what we\u2019ve read about it, that\u2019s quite typical,\u201d said Roberta Williams Lee. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of (the veterans) really wanted to talk about it. He didn\u2019t volunteer anything.\u201d\n\nSo, it was a surprise and a joy earlier this year \u2014 as we approach the centennial of the war\u2019s end \u2014 when they began sorting through a box of letters their mother had kept in the attic through the years and discovered correspondence between their father and his family while he was at war.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so wonderful to have the letters,\u201d said Eda Williams Martin. \u201cHis positive outlook . his love of life and his sense of humor came through. It\u2019s almost like getting to know him again in a different way.\u201d\n\nAdded Lee, \u201cWhen we read the letters in their handwritten form we could almost hear our father speaking to us.\u201d\n\nWalter Williams\u2019 three children \u2014 Martin, 87; Lee, 84; and Alice Williams Vining, 80, who lives in Michigan \u2014 compiled their fathers\u2019 letters, along with letters to him from his parents and siblings that he brought home with him from France after the war, into a book they published primarily for family: \u201cVoices From World War One: A Virginia Soldier and His Family.\u201d\n\n...\n\nThe sisters grew up in Richmond\u2019s West End, near the University of Richmond. Their father, who was born in Richmond in 1893, graduated from the University of Virginia with his undergraduate and law degrees before the war.\n\nHe came home to run a mortgage business with several close friends, opting to lead a quiet, orderly life \u2014 his daughters remembered him leaving every morning at precisely the same time on the streetcar and returning home at the same hour every evening, whistling as he came in the door \u2014 that perhaps a law career would not have afforded.\n\n\u201cHe was a quiet, unassuming man with a wonderful sense of humor,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe loved music. He bought records, and played them all the time at home. I think one word \u2014 modest \u2014 should be added.\u201d\n\nReading the letters added two words to her description: brave and patriotic.\n\nWilliams died in 1971, at age 78. His wife, Eda Carter Williams, lived until 2002, when she died at 96.\n\n\u201cAfter my mother died, we went through her many things,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThere was a box of letters, but we had so much to do, and there so many letters\u201d \u2014 Martin said it was a large collection because her mother saved everything, including \u201call the letters I wrote from camp\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat we just put them aside for another time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother time\u201d didn\u2019t arise until this past January, when the sisters began poking through the papers and found the World War I letters.\n\n\u201cA treasure,\u201d Martin said.\n\nThis morning when I woke up in my small crowded dugout and found that there was about a couple of inches of water in there too and that my blankets were all wet and that I was in immediate danger of being in the same fix, the proper thing for me to do would be to shrug my shoulders a half a dozen times (and a few extra times to get warm perhaps) and then in a mild way to blame it on the war. But I will have to confess that I have not become quite so philosophic and my first word was a real good old American \u201cdamn\u201d (and a few extra ones to warm me up perhaps).\n\n\u2014 Walter Williams, writing from the Western Front during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive\n\nTheir father reported to the Army in May 1917, on the day before his 24th birthday. In letters, he writes about his training at Camp Lee (now Fort Lee) and later from Europe and even as he waits months to come home after the war. In a long letter dated a week before the armistice was signed, he took time to write about gardens he encountered and the roses and chrysanthemums that \u201cremind me of crisp Fall and everything pleasant that comes along with this time of year.\u201d\n\nHis sisters believe their father was putting the best face on a terrible situation \u2014 \u201cHe must have seen a lot of death and dying,\u201d Martin says \u2014 so as not to worry his family. What also comes through clearly is his devotion to his family. Williams was one of six children \u2014 his older brother, Carrington, was a doctor who served simultaneously in a medical unit in France \u2014 and four sisters.\n\n\u201cI really believe that writing those letters and knowing how much his family loved him really sustained him throughout the war,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHis war experience shaped his life in ways his children couldn\u2019t fully know. Besides his own time in the trenches and under fire, Williams lost his best friend, George Wayne Anderson, who was killed only days before the armistice. He lived out his life prizing time with his family and friends.\n\nThe sisters spent hours and hours on the phone talking about the letters, reading and transcribing them. Organizing them into context for the book was \u201cso much fun,\u201d Lee said. \u201cEvery now and then, we\u2019d disagree about something, and we\u2019d talk it over. I think we worked well together. That was one of the wonderful things about doing it.\u201d\n\nThe sisters have donated the letters to the Virginia Museum of History & Culture, and they\u2019re left with the book and a better understanding of just who their father was.\n\n\u201cIt was enlightening to us,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt was important knowing our father before we were born. It\u2019s almost like having a conversation with him, in a way.\u201d", "WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Traditionally, the autumn harvest signals the end of the growing season, but that isn\u2019t the case anymore in the Wheeling area.\n\nIn fact, leaders of Grow Ohio Valley and several local farmers are demonstrating that vegetables and herbs can be grown locally throughout the winter. New technology and equipment, coupled with innovative techniques, allow farming to prosper even in cold weather.\n\nDanny Swan, Grow Ohio Valley\u2019s co-founder and head farmer, commented, \u201cGrowOV and other local farmers are \u2018cracking the code\u2019 on growing food year-round here in Wheeling. The end of summer no longer means the end of quality produce.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit organization\u2019s urban farm on Wheeling Heights offers a living example of how winter crops can be cultivated, harvested and stored. Located on the west side of Vineyard Hill at the former Lincoln Homes site, the GrowOV farm now contains two high-tunnel greenhouses, with a third greenhouse ready to be erected, along with outdoor garden beds. Temperature, moisture and insect population can be controlled within the greenhouses, he said.\n\nThe enclosed, cold-protected spaces allow for an extended growing season for a variety of vegetables. \u201cWe can grow all through the winter,\u201d Swan said.\n\nHe remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s really amazing what you can grow year-round. Pretty much all of the greens and roots appreciate cooler temperatures, and, with attention to detail and proper techniques, many of our common vegetables can thrive and be harvested, straight through the coldest months of winter.\u201d\n\nThe greenhouses and outdoor growing areas are pond-irrigated. Swan said a ditch was dug to collect spring water and transport it to a pond on the property; water is then pumped from the pond to the growing area. \u201cIt\u2019s better for plants to use untreated water,\u201d such as the abundant supply from springs along the hillside, he said.\n\nAn extensive list of veggies suitable for cold-weather cultivation includes squash, cabbage, broccoli, bok choy, several varieties of lettuce, spinach, beets, turnips, radishes, carrots and onions.\n\n\u201cAll of those things will grow in the winter,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMany of the herbs will grow through the winter . There are eight different kinds of winter squash we\u2019ll have this winter.\u201d\n\nGrowOV\u2019s nearby headquarters on Grandview Street features a root cellar and two rooms designed for cold storage of harvested crops.\n\n\u201cWe have our own root cellar, where we store winter squash, apples, potatoes and sweet potatoes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will last months in a properly conditioned root cellar.\u201d\n\nAs part of its mission to achieve regional food security, GrowOV is working with area farmers to develop \u201caccess to safe, affordable food all year-round,\u201d Swan said. A public market, which is set to open next year in Wheeling\u2019s Robert C. Byrd Intermodal Transportation Center, will provide a site \u201cwhere farmers can sell their safe, affordable crops,\u201d he added.\n\nGrowOV representatives are talking with farmers about erecting additional high-tunnel greenhouses on their farms. Based on sales projections, Swan said, \u201cWe need 30 across the Ohio Valley.\u201d\n\nCurrently, area farms furnish produce for community-supported agriculture (CSA) weekly subscriptions and for GrowOV\u2019s mobile market summer sales. Local growers also are expected to be a prime source of products for the planned public market.\n\nDuring the summer, 30 to 40 farmers supplied produce to GrowOV\u2019s food hub. \u201cA food hub is just a place to aggregate and distribute food,\u201d Swan explained.\n\nFood grown at GrowOV\u2019s urban farm supplements the participating farmers\u2019 crops for CSA subscription boxes, market sales and orders from Ohio County Schools. \u201cWe can serve those sales outlets, and we\u2019re always trying to grow those sales outlets,\u201d he said.\n\nThis past summer, he said, \u201cWe needed 1,000 pounds of tomatoes a week. No farmer can grow that (amount) in a week.\u201d\n\nSwan explained, \u201cThe mission of our farm is to grow food to fill in gaps in the local food market, and to make sure these markets are supplied really well . We\u2019re always looking to take a noncompetitive stance.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, he anticipates demand for locally-grown food will increaese when the public market opens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get new farmers on board and expand growing opportunities and expand growing seasons with high tunnels and root cellars,\u201d he said.\n\nExtending the growing season through winter also helps farmers spread their cash flow over 12 months, he noted.\n\nAs a nonprofit entity, GrowOV can take risks that individual farmers might be unable to take in their operations.\n\nWith a goal to create new markets for local farmers, Swan said, \u201cWe\u2019re using existing agricultural support from the West Virginia University Extension Service and West Virginia Department of Agriculture to help these farmers succeed as we\u2019re growing these markets.\u201d\n\nIn October, the first apple was picked from an orchard that GrowOV planted on the east side of Vineyard Hill two years ago. A couple of trees are 10 feet tall already, he said, but about two more years of growth is needed before the orchard produces a meaningful harvest.\n\nThe group continues to use its site on 18th Street for summer crops and leases land at Sandscrest Retreat and Conference Center, along GC&P Road, to grow pumpkins and other crops that require more space. GrowOV also works in partnership with area schools and other organizations to educate the public on growing and eating healthy food.", "DOVER, Del.

It took me three years to write. I had everything perfect for my research, but once I went to the Philippines I was able to actually experience the atmosphere for myself.\u201d\n\nThe book is based on the diaries of American nurses caught up in the Japanese occupation of the Philippines soon after Pearl Harbor.\n\n\u201cI read an article on those nurses and it just aggravated me,\u201d Ms. Jones said. \u201cI was so angry to think that some man told them to never mention what happened. I just wrote it out of anger, as a lot of tears went into that book.\n\n\u201cBut while I was there the people were super friendly. It was overwhelming. It was long days.

Even though I made up the story, it could be true, but it isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut I did make sure that everything in the story pertaining to the plot was accurate.

(Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)\n\nLIVERPOOL, England (AP) \u2014 Mohamed Salah capitalized on some quick thinking by Liverpool to maintain his impressive scoring record at Anfield in a 2-0 win over last-place Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nStraight after Fulham had a goal disallowed for offside, Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson took a quick free kick to find right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who played in Salah to race in on goal and open the scoring in the 41st minute.\n\nThere were just 14 seconds between the flag being raised for offside and Salah finding the net at the other end of the field.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri scored the other goal in the 53rd minute, a cushioned volley into the corner from Andrew Robertson\u2019s deep cross, as unbeaten Liverpool won for the ninth time in its opening 12 games.\n\nIn six league games at home, Salah has scored in five of them \u2014 the only blank coming against title rival Manchester City. The Egypt forward has 34 goals in 36 appearances at Anfield since joining Liverpool in the offseason of 2017.\n\nIt was a seventh straight loss for Fulham in all competitions, keeping the pressure on manager Slavisa Jokanovic heading into the two-week international break. The London team\u2019s only win since returning to the Premier League was in late August and it hasn\u2019t scored a goal in its last three league losses.\n\nWhile Salah could yet match his prolific scoring from last season, when he finished as the league\u2019s top scorer with 32 goals, two more factors are making Liverpool a more irresistible force as the team looks to become English champion for a 19th time \u2014 and first since 1990.\n\nBought from relegated Stoke for 13 million pounds ($17.2 million), Shaqiri is proving to be an astute offseason purchase by manager Juergen Klopp, with the playmaker mostly being used for the easier matches to give Liverpool some creativity when faced with packed defenses. In the past three weeks, he has set up the winner for Salah at Huddersfield, scored at home to Cardiff and now Fulham.\n\nLiverpool also has rarely been as resolute at the back: This was its seventh clean sheet in the league, with the team yet to concede more than one goal in a game.\n\n\u201cWe scored a lot of goals last season,\u201d Robertson said, \u201cbut this season we have been solid at the back as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Australian MP Julie Bishop takes part at the opening panel of the World Economic Forum Global Future Council in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018.

Democrats who gained new or expanded powers in state elections are gearing up for a left-leaning push on gun control, universal health care and legal marijuana. Meanwhile, some Republican legislatures that have cut taxes and limited union powers are adjusting to a new reality of needing to work with a Democratic governor. The midterm elections Tuesday, Nov. 6, increased Democratic relevance in state capitols that have been dominated by Republicans during the past decade. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File)\n\nFrom New York to New Mexico, residents in a number of states can expect a leftward push for expanded health care coverage, gun control, education funding and legalized recreational marijuana as Democrats who gained new or stronger powers in the midterm elections seek to put their stamp on public policy.\n\nWhile Republicans remain in charge in more states, Democrats nearly doubled the number of places where they will wield a trifecta of power over the governor\u2019s office and both chambers of the state legislature. Democrats also broke up several Republican strongholds, forcing GOP lawmakers who have been cutting taxes and curbing union powers to deal with a new reality of a Democratic governor.\n\nAll told, Democrats gained seats in 62 of the 99 state legislative chambers, according to data provided by the National Conference of State Legislatures (Nebraska is the lone state with a single legislature). Democrats also added seven new governorships.\n\nIn New York, where a new Democratic-run Senate will provide the missing link in liberals\u2019 political power, the expansive agenda could go beyond guns, pot and health care to also include more protections for abortion rights and higher taxes on millionaires.\n\n\u201cWe will finally give New Yorkers the progressive leadership they have been demanding,\u201d said Sen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who stands to lead the Senate when the new session begins in January.\n\nThe U.S. is a deeply divided nation politically, a fact reflected in a midterm vote that gave Democrats the U.S. House while adding to the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate. But within states, the overall outcome of the 2018 elections was a continued trend of one-party control \u2014 Democrats in some places, Republicans in others.\n\nFor the first time since 1914, there will be only one state \u2014 Minnesota \u2014 with its two legislative chambers led by different parties.\n\nIf Republican gubernatorial candidates maintain their slim leads in Florida and Georgia, Republicans will hold full control over the governor\u2019s office and legislative chambers in 22 states compared with 14 for Democrats. Just 13 states will have a split partisan control between the governor\u2019s office and legislature, nearly matching the 60-year low point set in 2012.\n\nThere also has been a decrease in ticket-splitting between governors and state attorneys general, with the number of such divisions expected to decline from 12 to 10 as a result of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cThis is the most hyper-polarized, hyper-partisan time we\u2019ve see in generations, and nobody can deny that,\u201d said Illinois state Sen. Toi Hutchinson, a Democrat who is president of the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nIllinois is one of a half-dozen states where Tuesday\u2019s election put Democrats in control of the governor\u2019s office and legislature.\n\nDemocrat J.B. Pritzker, who ousted Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, wants to legalize and tax recreational marijuana. He also has promised to push for a constitutional amendment to replace Illinois\u2019 flat income tax system with a progressive one that requires the wealthy to pay a greater share.\n\nDemocrats also are planning aggressive agendas in other states where they expanded their political power:\n\n\u2014 Nevada is expected to pass a ban on bump stocks on guns as the state Legislature meets for the first time since the October 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip. Democrats also will be pushing to spend more on education, expand Medicaid coverage, raise the minimum wage and require employers to provide paid sick leave.\n\n\u2014 In New Mexico, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth said minimum wage and teacher pay increases will be at the top of the agenda. Democrats also could overhaul the state\u2019s approach to climate change, gun control and marijuana.\n\n\u2014 In Colorado, Democrats are planning a renewed push to expand health coverage, adopt gun controls, boost public education funding and enhance environmental protections.\n\n\u2014 In Maine, new Democratic Gov.-elect and Attorney General Janet Mills has vowed to finally expand Medicaid. Voters demanded that in a 2017 referendum, but the effort has been slowed by departing Republican Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nThe states shifting to Democratic dominance can look to New Jersey, which held its governor\u2019s election in 2017 and replaced a Republican with a Democrat. With the Legislature already controlled by Democrats, the state promptly tightened gun regulations, passed a paid sick-leave requirement and restored funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been like Christmas every day for liberals. It took a last-day deal before the budget expired over the summer to avoid a state government shutdown as Democrats disagreed over which taxes to raise. Lawmakers have missed their own deadlines on legalizing marijuana for adults, and some advocates are upset the state has not moved faster to boost the minimum wage.\n\nNew Jersey state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat who\u2019s been in the legislature since 1992, said there\u2019s a big difference in legislative debates when there\u2019s one-party control.\n\n\u201cIt is more about details than the broader principles,\u201d she said.\n\nSome states that became accustomed to Republican control over the past decade also will be making adjustments.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers have been privately discussing ways they could limit the rule-making powers of Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers, who narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald said they are looking at reconstituting boards to make sure they have equal representation.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Republican-led Legislature did something similar after Democrat Roy Cooper won the governor\u2019s race in 2016. But Cooper successfully sued over a law weakening his influence over the state elections board.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Laura Kelly\u2019s election as governor immediately recasts the debate over several big fiscal issues.\n\nShe supports expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid health coverage as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act. While bipartisan backing for that has grown, supporters had not achieved the legislative supermajorities that would have been needed to overcome the opposition of Republican Govs. Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.\n\nKelly also is pledging to reinstate an executive order barring anti-LGBT bias in state hiring and employment decisions, something Brownback rescinded in 2015.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer broke a Republican trifecta while campaigning to \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d and replace aging water pipes with a multibillion-dollar infrastructure plan. But tax increases or increased borrowing could be a tough sell in the Legislature, which remains under Republican control.\n\nThe next Senate majority leader, Republican Sen. Mike Shirkey, signaled that he would oppose raising Michigan\u2019s corporate income tax and said he would fight any attempt to repeal Michigan\u2019s right-to-work laws \u201cwith every ounce of my body.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who control the Minnesota state Senate said they will fight Democratic Gov.-elect Tim Walz if he follows through with a proposal to raise the gas tax to pay for infrastructure improvements. A number of states have taken that step in recent years to fund road repairs. That includes states where Republicans control the legislature and governor\u2019s office, including Indiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee.\n\nSplit power at the Minnesota Legislature also could lead to gridlock on the top issue from the election \u2014 health care. Walz campaigned on expanding one of the state\u2019s low-income health care programs to offer a public option, but Senate Republicans have shot that down as an unworkable government takeover of health care.\n\n___\n\nLieb reported from Jefferson City, Missouri, and Mulvihill from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

The 45-year-old Englishman hadn\u2019t won anywhere for more than three years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit emotional, to be honest,\u201d Westwood said, his voice breaking as he battled to hold back tears. \u201cYou\u2019re never sure whether you\u2019re going to be able to do it again. Until now my emotions have felt really under control all day, which is what I\u2019ve been working hard on.\u201d\n\nWestwood saved his best \u2014 as well as his tears \u2014 for last at Gary Player Country Club as the best round of the day and only the second 64 of the week saw him finish on 15 under overall, a three-shot win over Garcia (70), with Oosthuizen (69) third on 11 under.\n\nHe made an eagle on No. 2 and six birdies in all, five of them on the back nine, as he charged to his 24th European title and 43rd career victory in the penultimate event of the season. His birdies on Nos. 16 and 17, set up by pin-point iron play as the pressure mounted, settled a fascinating final-round battle between him, Garcia and Oosthuizen.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to hit fairways and stick to my game-plan and hit it in the right places, Westwood said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of a process that I\u2019m going through with my golf swing and I\u2019m starting to see better shots. The 7-iron into 17 is probably one of the best shots I\u2019ve ever hit.\u201d\n\nGarcia had led from the start and had a two-shot advantage over Oosthuizen and was three ahead of Westwood after three rounds. But Westwood\u2019s finish proved irresistible.\n\nDown the stretch, Garcia couldn\u2019t make any birdies on the last six holes.

A study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists released in 2018 concluded that valuable species of shellfish, including softshell clams, have become harder to find on the East Coast because of degraded habitats caused by a warming environment. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Valuable species of shellfish have become harder to find on the East Coast because of degraded habitat caused by a warming environment, according to a pair of scientists that sought to find out whether environmental factors or overfishing was the source of the decline.\n\nThe scientists reached the conclusion in studying the decline in the harvest of four commercially important species of shellfish in coastal areas from Maine to North Carolina \u2014 eastern oysters, northern quahogs, softshell clams and northern bay scallops. They reported that their findings came down squarely on the side of a warming ocean environment and a changing climate, and not excessive harvest by fishermen.\n\nOne of the ways warming has negatively impacted shellfish is by making them more susceptible to predators, said the lead author of the study, Clyde MacKenzie, a shellfish researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is based in Sandy Hook, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cTheir predation rate is faster in the warmer waters. They begin to prey earlier, and they prey longer into the fall,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cThese stocks have gone down.\u201d\n\nMacKenzie\u2019s findings, the product of a collaboration with Mitchell Tarnowski, a shellfish biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, appeared recently in the journal Marine Fisheries Review. The findings have implications for consumers of shellfish, because a declining domestic harvest means the prices of shellfish such as oysters and clams could rise, or the U.S. could become more dependent on foreign sources.\n\nThe scientists observed that the harvest of eastern oysters from Connecticut to Virginia fell from around 600,000 bushels in 1960 to less than 100,000 in 2005. The harvest of the four species declined from 1980 to 2010 after enjoying years of stability from 1950 to 1980, they found.\n\nThe scientists reported that a positive shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation led to the degradation of shellfish habitat. The oscillation is an irregular fluctuation of atmospheric pressure that impacts weather and climate, which in turn affects things like reproduction and food availability for shellfish.\n\nThe study mirrors what Maine clam harvesters are seeing on the state\u2019s tidal flats, said Chad Coffin, a clammer and the president of the Maine Clammers Association. Maine\u2019s harvest of softshell clams \u2014 the clams used to make fried clams and clam chowder \u2014 dwindled to its lowest point since 1930 last year.\n\nIt will take adopting new strategies, such as shellfish farming, for the fisheries to survive, Coffin said.\n\n\u201cClammers aren\u2019t the reason there\u2019s no clams,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to adapt, we need to focus our efforts on adapting to the environment we have.\u201d\n\nSome near-shore shellfish harvests in the U.S. remain consistently productive, such as the Maine sea scallop fishery, which takes place in bays and coastal areas in the winter. The state\u2019s scallop fishery bottomed out at about 33,000 pounds in 2005, but has climbed in recent years, and its 2017 total of almost 800,000 pounds was the most since 1997.\n\nMany in Maine attribute the health of the fishery to conservative management, said Alex Todd, a scallop fisherman who also works the waters off Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cUp and down the coast, there have been good years recently compared to 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the scientists\u2019 findings track with others who have studied the impact of warming waters on shellfish, such as Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. Beal, who was not involved in the study, has said rising seawater temperature could spell \u201cdoom and gloom for the clamming industry and probably for other industries as well.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s especially true of valuable species that are important food items, like clams and mussels, he said.\n\n\u201cNone of this can be attributed to overfishing, a term that is used willy-nilly and applied erroneously to these declines in commercially important shellfish,\u201d Beal said.", "BURLINGTON, Vt.

Technologies via AP)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 In three years, the Uber Eats restaurant food delivery service has grown from an experiment to serving much of the U.S. and major cities worldwide.\n\nBy year\u2019s end, the ride-hailing company says it will cover 70 percent of the U.S. population and be in 243 metro areas, mainly by expanding into smaller cities. It\u2019s already in over 300 cities in 36 countries with many international deliveries done by bicycle.\n\nJason Droege, an Uber vice president who leads Uber Everything, the unit that explores how to build new businesses off the Uber network, says Eats is growing as fast as the ride-hailing service did in its early days. He talks about the future of the service and demand for getting food delivered to your home. Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: Is there a particular demographic group that uses Uber Eats?\n\nA: Certainly younger generations use it more. It\u2019s more like how they eat. I think there\u2019s a convenience premium for people who are coming of age now versus people who already have their habits set. If you look back, fast casual was something that was just getting going when I was 10, 11 years old. My generation is very used to going to a restaurant and doing take out, versus maybe the previous generation might have been used to \u2018hey, let\u2019s go get groceries.\u2019 Take out has been on the rise ever since the mid- to late-80s. Now you have a generation who wants the additional convenience. Maybe they want to stay home and watch Netflix, or use social media, or they want the access to hundreds of restaurants.\n\nQ: What kind of range do you serve from a customer\u2019s home?\n\nA: We want to make sure that the food arrives hot and delicious. If the food is in the car too long, that\u2019s bad. It\u2019s more about the time than it is about the business because we want that experience to be high quality. Uber has always believed that the faster you can get your ride, or your food, changes how consumers think about the level of convenience. So we\u2019ve been focused from the beginning on getting food delivery from 40 to 45 minutes (from the order time) down to, I think our global average is now 31 minutes. Usually when people are ordering they\u2019re hungry. So we see that people use the product more when it\u2019s delivered faster, so we focus a lot on speed.\n\nQ: How did you know that people would want more than pizza delivered to their home, was it testing?\n\nA: Sometimes we do tests and they work, sometimes we do tests and they didn\u2019t work. Uber historically has done stunts. Uber ice cream, where we delivered ice cream on demand for a few years, or there was Uber puppies and Uber kittens, where a car would roll up and you\u2019d play with some kittens in the back. We did those actually very locally. One common thread you saw is when a city, like the city of Fresno put on the local barbecue spot that was hard to get to, had really long lines, you saw a lot of demand. From the early days, we noticed that when we put popular restaurants on Uber and delivered them on demand, those are some of our most consistently successful stunts. Even in our marketing promotions we saw food and Uber had some connectivity. So we had some signal, but experimentation is what really pushed us there.\n\nQ: Is Eats a profit-making entity?\n\nA: We\u2019re focused on growth now, so we\u2019re investing aggressively. We feel really good about the economics of the business. Before we went into expansion, we actually got to a point where we saw the path to profitability, which is why we decided to invest aggressively.\n\n____\n\nFollow Tom Krisher: https://twitter.com/tkrisher", "", "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Brimin Kipkorir of Kenya has won the 36th Athens Marathon in the third fastest time, beating Ethiopia\u2019s Tesfa Wokneth by almost two minutes.\n\nKipkorir broke away from the leading group after 25 kilometers to win the hilly course in 2 hours 10 minutes and 56 seconds, 19 seconds off the course record set by his compatriot Felix Kandle in winning the 2014 race.\n\nWokneth was second in 2:12:52 and fellow Ethiopian Asmeraw Mengistu was third in 2:13:20.\n\nTwo other Kenyans rounded out the top 5.\n\nShelmith Muriuki of Kenya won the women\u2019s race \u2014 and was 17th overall \u2014 in a personal best of 2:36:46, beating fellow Kenya runner Rebby Koech (2:38:54) and Greece\u2019s Eleftheria Petroulaki (2:46:09)\n\nA record 18,750 runners started the race Sunday morning."]
