(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Bryson DeChambeau saw signs of greatness last season on the PGA Tour when he won three times against the strongest fields this side of the majors.\n\nHe started a new season headed down the same path.\n\nIn his only fall start, DeChambeau never shot worse than 66 over four days in Las Vegas, holed an eagle putt from just inside 60 feet on the 16th hole and closed with smart play for pars to win the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open on Sunday by one shot over Patrick Cantlay.\n\n\u201cI was coming out here to try and kick rust off and was able to play some good golf,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe eagle putt took him from a one-shot deficit to a two-shot lead when Cantlay made bogey from a deceptive lie in the bunker ahead of him on the 17th hole. DeChambeau won for the fourth time in his last 12 starts on the PGA Tour and moved to No. 5 in the world ranking.\n\nHe had to survive a wild back nine at the TPC Summerlin in which four players had a share of the lead at some point.\n\nCantlay, trying to become the first player to win back-to-back in Las Vegas in nearly 20 years, made a 15-foot birdie putt on the par-5 16th hole to take a one-shot lead. But from a bunker right of the green on the par-3 17th, Cantlay was fooled by the amount of sand under his ball and flubbed the shot.\n\nDeChambeau wasn\u2019t entirely sure where he stood. He could see Cantlay made the putt on the 16th hole and had to ask if it was for birdie or eagle. DeChambeau easily cleared the water, and his ball went just over the back of the green. He thought he hit it perfectly. Then, he thought he might have hit it too hard. It held its line at the end, and DeChambeau responded with a big uppercut.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t given a reaction like that in a while,\u201d he said.\n\nCantlay birdied the 18th for a 65, but it wasn\u2019t enough when DeChambeau played the final two holes conservatively for pars to finish at 21-under 263.\n\nDeChambeau won for the third straight season, and fifth time overall on the PGA Tour.\n\nThe 25-year-old American began his big run with a playoff victory at the Memorial, and then won consecutive FedEx Cup playoff events in New Jersey and Boston. He said he was playing Las Vegas to shake off a little rust, and it turned into another victory.\n\n\u201cI thought I had it in me, but I didn\u2019t know if I could do it,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cLast year I saw signs of something great. I didn\u2019t know where it would lead me. But I think it led me in the right direction.\u201d\n\nNot since Jim Furyk in 1998-99 had anyone successfully defended his title in Las Vegas, and Cantlay looked as if he might get it done when he drove the green on the par-4 15th for a two-putt birdie, and then rolled in another good birdie after having to lay up on the 16th. His tee shot into the 17th was a fraction away from catching a slope and feeding toward the hole. Instead, it tumbled into the bunker to set up what appeared to be a relatively simple shot.\n\n\u201cWhen I dug my left foot in, it didn\u2019t have a bunch of sand, and then obviously when I hit my shot there was more sand under the ball and didn\u2019t anticipate that,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cIt was a tricky one and I hit a poor shot.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only player stung by the outcome.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover had a 4-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole that would have given him a share of the lead with three holes to play. Glover missed the putt, and then missed a 30-inch par putt. One hole later, he was three shots behind.\n\nGlover finished with a triple bogey for a 71 and tied for seventh. He shot 61 on Saturday.\n\nPeter Uihlein, who shared the 54-hole lead with DeChambeau, didn\u2019t make a birdie until the 11th hole, finished bogey-bogey for a 75 and tied for 23rd.\n\nSam Ryder was one shot behind when his second shot to the par-5 16th bounced off a knob and back into the water. He managed to save par and birdied the last hole with a 15-foot putt for a 62 to finish alone in third.\n\nRickie Fowler (63), Abraham Ancer (66) and Robert Streb (68) were another shot behind.\n\nDeChambeau won for the fifth time in just his 68th start as a pro on the PGA Tour, dating to his victory in the John Deere Classic in 2017.", "JACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 At times, it seemed like the politicians addressing the Mississippi Economic Council last Thursday were mainly there to boost or oppose Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s bid to retain the U.S. Senate seat to which Gov. Phil Bryant appointed her.\n\nLt. Gov Tate Reeves even made it explicit, saying he wasn\u2019t going to talk about the 2019 state elections, which relieved him of affirming that he would indeed run for governor.\n\n\u201cThe most important elections to the future of Mississippi\u2019s economy are the ones taking place next Tuesday,\u201d Reeves told attendees at the council\u2019s Hobnob event at the Mississippi Coliseum.\n\nBut Attorney General Jim Hood, the Democrat who seeks to deny Reeves\u2019 ascension to the governor\u2019s chair, didn\u2019t get the memo. Hood made the case that members of the state\u2019s chamber of commerce should consider supporting him. The organization has stuck close to Reeves, with MEC President Scott Waller praising him Thursday for delivering a signature goal of the group, a phase-out of Mississippi\u2019s franchise tax on business capital.\n\nIt was an unusually animated speech for Hood, and at times sounded as if it came from an alternate universe rather than the one occupied by the state\u2019s Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to tell you how great things are, but let me tell you the truth about what our economy is,\u201d Hood said. \u201cMississippi has the worst economy of any state in the union.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that the special session earlier this year that ended in a deal for more money for roads was \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d in part because it didn\u2019t produce as much money as was needed to cover the needs of the state highway system. Hood also criticized Mississippi\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid, arguing that\u2019s the root cause of rural hospital struggles.\n\nThis is the challenge that Democrats have. Has growth been poky for years in Mississippi coming out the recession? Yes, and it still is, compared to the rest of the nation. But it would have been an easier case to make in 2014 or 2015, when the state\u2019s economy slid back into recession while the rest of the nation was growing. It would have also been easier in 2016 and 2017, when Gov. Phil Bryant was making mid-year budget cuts or lawmakers were whacking the budgets of state agencies.\n\nSince then, things have gotten better, both in terms of the economy and state tax receipts. Average weekly wages in the first quarter of 2018 were up about 2 percent, while the state\u2019s economy has added 20,000 jobs this year.\n\n\u201cI guess the lowest unemployment in Mississippi\u2019s history just doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Bryant, clearly mocking Hood. \u201cTell that to the 77,000 Mississippians who have a job now that didn\u2019t have a job in 2011.\u201d\n\nBryant, taking offense at Hood\u2019s downcast assessment of his two terms in office, threatened to take to the campaign trail to \u201cstrip some bark. I\u2019m not going to stand by and let any politician criticize what we have accomplished.\u201d\n\nReeves, for his part, didn\u2019t keep his promise to not talk about 2019. After praising educational improvement and the road funding deal, he offered a preview.\n\n\u201cI look forward to talking about our vision for the future of Mississippi \u2014 a vision that includes a balanced budget, a vision that includes less debt on the books, a vision that includes fewer taxes,\u201d he said.\n\nHood will have to overcome that pitch, plus Republican affirmations that things are getting better. But maybe Hood is more aware of this challenge than he lets on. After all, at one point during Thursday\u2019s speech, he said: \u201cLeadership is about telling people something maybe they don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJeff Amy has covered politics and government for The Associated Press in Mississippi since 2011. Follow him on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy .", "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Though an election looms Tuesday, Louisiana\u2019s politicians, prognosticators, and campaign donors already have moved on, looking to the 2019 races when voters choose the governor, six other statewide elected officials and state lawmakers.\n\nThat\u2019s the big election year.\n\nIn political circles, conversations regularly turn to whether Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards can win re-election and which Republicans might enter the race against him, rather than how Louisiana\u2019s congressional incumbents will fare on this week\u2019s ballot or who will fill out a one-year term as secretary of state.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the governor historically is the center of Louisiana\u2019s political universe. Or maybe it\u2019s because the U.S. House races are less interesting when no one seems likely to be ousted. Or maybe it\u2019s that folks can\u2019t get jazzed about a secretary of state job that\u2019s largely a ministerial position.\n\nWhatever the reason, the 2018 elections have been overshadowed nearly from the start by the 2019 competitions.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, seemingly ready to jump into the governor\u2019s race against Edwards, isn\u2019t even waiting until the Dec. 8 runoffs wrap up this year\u2019s election cycle. He said he\u2019ll announce whether he\u2019s in or out of the gubernatorial contest by Dec. 1.\n\nKennedy already picked up an early endorsement last week, from Republican state Rep. Jay Morris of Monroe, who emailed supporters saying he hopes Kennedy will run. Morris described Kennedy as bringing \u201ca conservative and common sense approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Kennedy doesn\u2019t kowtow to anyone even if they are powerful donors. That kind of integrity is rare in government,\u201d Morris wrote.\n\nEdwards certainly appears to have moved to campaign mode, with his office releasing weekly videos touting the accomplishments of individual Cabinet agencies since the governor took office in 2016. Outside groups and PACs backing Edwards are active on social media promoting the governor and trashing those who might run against him.\n\nAlready one GOP candidate has entered the race. Eddie Rispone filed state paperwork in October declaring his candidacy for the election.\n\nThe wealthy Baton Rouge businessman, founder of an industrial contracting company and longtime donor to conservative candidates isn\u2019t well-known outside of political groups yet. But Rispone said he\u2019s willing to put up $5 million or more of his own money to change that, making him a major contender in the race as soon as he got into it.\n\nIf he decides to add himself to the gubernatorial candidate list, Kennedy would be a formidable candidate, maintaining high approval ratings with voters. He also wouldn\u2019t have to give up his U.S. Senate seat to run against Edwards, though already speculation is rampant about who might fill that Senate position if Kennedy were to win the governor\u2019s race.\n\nOther Republicans still mulling the race include U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham, Attorney General Jeff Landry, state Sen. Sharon Hewitt, and Louisiana Association of Business and Industry President Stephen Waguespack. As he seeks re-election to his congressional seat on Tuesday\u2019s ballot, Abraham ran what just as easily could be seen as a biographical ad introducing him to a broader audience in case he enters the governor\u2019s race.\n\nEdwards\u2019 approval ratings have hovered around 50 percent in recent polls, and he\u2019s already reported raising $5 million for his re-election bid. He said he\u2019s proud to run on his performance, \u201cand I look forward to earning another four years by continuing to put Louisiana first.\u201d\n\nMillions of dollars from donors inside and outside of Louisiana are expected to pour into the race, with Republicans trying to reclaim a seat they feel should be theirs and Democrats trying to hold onto a seat they believe shows their candidates can win in conservative states.\n\nBeyond the governor\u2019s race, other statewide incumbents are gearing up re-election bids. Republican Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser recently promoted raising $500,000 during two fundraisers that were described as kick-off events for his 2019 campaign.\n\nTerm-limited lawmakers are jockeying for other political jobs they can land in the next term.\n\nAnd the winner of this fall\u2019s election for secretary of state will have to turn around and run again next year to hold onto the seat.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Melinda Deslatte has covered Louisiana politics for The Associated Press since 2000.

(AP) \u2014 Snapping the ball was a challenge Sunday for the New York Jets, and things didn\u2019t get any better after that.\n\nCenter Spencer Long reinjured a finger and had half-dozen off-target shotgun hikes, which compounded problems for quarterback Sam Darnold. He threw four interceptions \u2014 including a pick-six after he snared a high snap \u2014 and the Jets never reached the end zone in a 13-6 loss to the Miami Dolphins.\n\n\u201cWe need to be more consistent, myself included especially,\u201d Long said. The injury on the middle finger of his right hand, which he dealt with earlier this season, finally forced him from the game.\n\nDarnold stayed in to take more rookie lumps for the Jets (3-6). His most costly mistake was a pass toward the sideline intended for tight end Eric Tomlinson. Linebacker Jerome Baker cut in front for his first career interception and scored the game\u2019s only touchdown untouched.\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to get it over him,\u201d Darnold said.\n\nAs for the inconsistent snaps, he said: \u201cIt disrupts timing, but there\u2019s no excuse for how I played out there.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s score put Miami ahead 13-3 with 11 minutes left. Darnold threw two more interceptions in the final 2\u00bd minutes, both on fourth-and-long.\n\nDarnold finished 21 for 39 for 229 yards with four sacks and a passer rating of 31.8. That\u2019s the third time he has been below 40.\n\n\u201cI just have to be sharper,\u201d he said. \u201cPersonally, I have to have a better plan when I get to the line of scrimmage. I\u2019ve got to know exactly where to go with the ball. If No. 1 or 2 isn\u2019t there, I have to go to (No.) 3.\u201d\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said he\u2019s not thinking about replacing Darnold with veteran Josh McCown.\n\n\u201cNot right now, no,\u201d Bowles said.\n\nHis critique of Darnold\u2019s performance: \u201cThere are plays he would like to have back.\u201d\n\nInterceptions aren\u2019t a new problem \u2014 Darnold came into the game tied for the NFL lead with 10 . And lack of scoring is a familiar issue, too \u2014 the Jets have 33 points in the past three games, all losses.\n\nSafety Jamal Adams called the latest defeat a 53-man effort but added, \u201cIt\u2019s the same, same, same stuff. It\u2019s frustrating. I\u2019m not going to hold my tongue for anything anymore. Enough is enough. I\u2019m not a loser.\u201d\n\nDespite a day of sputtering offense, the Jets had chances to pull the game out.\n\nTrailing 6-3, they reached the Miami 20 early in the fourth quarter, but a sack and delay of game penalty forced them back, and Jason Myers missed a 50-yard field goal try.\n\n\u201cWe were in it until the end,\u201d Bowles said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t make enough plays to win it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "STANARDSVILLE, Va.

But he only ran nine times for a measly 17 yards through the opening two quarters, when Washington\u2019s best gain was 22 on a scramble by quarterback Alex Smith.\n\nNearly sacked, Smith spun out of a defender\u2019s arms and turned it into a run up the sideline ending with a pop from Atlanta\u2019s Brian Poole that was so big it drew an \u201cOhhhhh!\u201d from spectators.

(AP Photo/Richard Rodriguez, File)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jason Witten vividly remembers Tony Romo\u2019s return to the home of the Dallas Cowboys for the first time as a broadcaster last year after retiring as the storied franchise\u2019s all-time passing leader.\n\nNow it\u2019s the 15-year tight end\u2019s turn.\n\nWitten\u2019s move from the field to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d booth was a little more sudden and surprising than Romo\u2019s decision to join CBS after he had lost his job to Dak Prescott.\n\nThe club\u2019s career leader in catches and games was still a starter when he left, and probably a little more beloved than his best friend and former quarterback. The fans figure to illustrate as much when the Cowboys (3-4) host the pro team from Witten\u2019s home state, the Tennessee Titans (3-4), on Monday night.\n\n\u201cIt will certainly be emotional for me,\u201d Witten said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be after 15 years and so many relationships inside that building with fans and teammates and management and coaches and all that stuff?\u201d\n\nUnlike Romo, Witten had a ceremony to say goodbye in the spring after he had already started his offseason training at the team\u2019s facility. The announcement days before his 36th birthday came after the realization that it would be difficult for Witten turn down a chance to be one of the NFL\u2019s lead analysts.\n\nAlso unlike Romo, Witten\u2019s transition has been rough. He\u2019s been criticized more than Romo, who was an instant hit by showing the ability to predict plays and has shown more an ability to connect with viewers.\n\nThe most notable moment for Witten so far came when he slipped and said Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers had pulled \u201canother rabbit out of his head\u201d with a tying touchdown pass late in a 33-30 overtime win against San Francisco.\n\n\u201cI would never walk into something like that and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m going to be on this level from minute one,\u2019\u201d Witten said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be perfect but I think over time if you listen, you win them over by saying, \u2018Man, the guy is sharing a lot of football with us that we didn\u2019t necessarily know.\u2019\n\n\u201cI believe in myself. I believe I\u2019ll be good at it.\u201d\n\nWitten will have a friendly audience at AT&T Stadium, regardless of whether people are watching from their devices in the stands.\n\n\u201cHis leadership in the locker room and the practice field throughout games was off the charts and a great example for all of us how to go about your job,\u201d Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cA rare guy, a special guy we are all fortunate to have been around.\u201d\n\nThe obvious question is whether Witten will hesitate to criticize Prescott, or Garrett, or any of the tight ends trying to replace him. Prescott thinks so.\n\n\u201cI expect Witten to be critical,\u201d said Prescott, who had Witten for his first two years in the league, both as the Dallas starter. \u201cI tell the story about when I first came in, how tough he was on me then. So now I don\u2019t expect it to be any different.\u201d\n\nWitten kept his composure during his 15-minute retirement speech in May at team headquarters, about 35 miles from the stadium. It should be pretty easy to do the same when he\u2019s shown from the booth, mostly likely after a tribute video on the giant screen that hangs above the field.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why when I made the decision back in May, why I put so much time into it, was because I knew once I did I wasn\u2019t going to allow myself or was going to try really hard not to get to the emotions of it all,\u201d Witten said. \u201cWill it be different? Absolutely. Will be it be awkward going into that stadium? Of course it will be.\u201d\n\nJust as it was for Romo a year ago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "NORWOOD, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio native and singer-songwriter John Legend has headlined an early voting rally with Democrats in suburban Cincinnati.\n\nLegend co-hosted the rally with congressional candidate Aftab Pureval (AF\u2019 tab-PYUR\u2019 vawl) and other Democrats in Norwood on Sunday.\n\nLegend told the crowd the Republican Party \u201cis afraid of democracy.\u201d Pureval and a marching band later led the crowd to the nearby Hamilton County Board of Elections, where hundreds lined up to vote.\n\nTom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, also attended the event.\n\nPureval is challenging GOP incumbent U.S. Rep.

The federation said it had never sought the help of any company to take the \u201cSupercopa\u201d to the U.S.\n\nIn Spain, the league oversees the first and second divisions, while the federation organizes tournaments such as the Super Cup and the Copa del Rey.\n\nThe Super Cup pits the Spanish league champion against the Copa del Rey winner in a one-match final at the start of the season. This year\u2019s game was played between Barcelona and Sevilla in Tangier, Morocco.\n\nThe federation told The Associated Press it was Relevent that proposed having the Super Cup game in Miami in 2019. The federation said it had rejected the offer.\n\nIt said Relevent recently invited federation president Luis Rubiales to a dinner in New York as he was in the city for other business, but the federation denied this was to discuss the Super Cup game. The group\u2019s proposal had already been rejected by then and the meeting never happened.\n\nThe league\u2019s idea to play games in the U.S. to promote its brand has been supported by many but has also been met by criticism from soccer officials and some fans and clubs in Spain. The dispute has become a tug-of-war among the several stakeholders, with all sides trying to weigh-in and defend their ground.\n\nThis latest dispute seems unlikely to improve the situation.\n\n\u201cIt is scandalous to offer the Spanish Super Cup in the USA to the same organization that has a partnership with LaLiga (Spanish league) while telling LaLiga it can\u2019t stage a match stateside,\u201d Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the AP in a league email written in English.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is an inherent problem with a process when the federation deciding on approval is negotiating a similar deal concurrently,\u201d Tebas claimed. \u201cWhen it comes to the LaLiga match in the US, decisions and opinions by the governing bodies haven\u2019t been based on what\u2019s in the best interest of football globally, but how it impacts self interests and leverages business negotiations on unrelated matters.\u201d\n\nThe federation is yet to approve the league\u2019s request over the Barcelona-Girona game. While asking for clarification about the plan, the federation argued the league failed to show the overseas game would comply with Spanish and international regulations and TV broadcast contracts.\n\nIt also said the regular-season match away from Spain could harm the other 18 league clubs.\n\nThe Super Cup game doesn\u2019t affect other teams but Spanish fans would face a lengthy trip across the Atlantic for both matches. The league has offered compensation packages for Girona fans willing to watch the game in the U.S., including paid trips to Miami and partial reimbursement of season-ticket packages.\n\nThe FIFA Council recently opposed the league game plan after receiving a request to take a stance from CONCACAF and the federations in the United States and Spain, which both have a say on whether the game can be played, along with European governing body UEFA. FIFA\u2019s permission for the match is not mandatory but its opposition was a setback for the league.\n\nThe league said it is prepared to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if FIFA somehow prohibits the match, and it is also ready to go to court in Spain if the Spanish federation rejects its request to play abroad. The federation hasn\u2019t yet made a final ruling.\n\nThe league last week launched a campaign to show that American fans are behind the game, asking them to sign an online petition showing their support.\n\nThe league has a 15-year partnership with Relevent to promote soccer and bring games to the United States. The group operates the International Champions Cup, a tournament played around the globe during the European offseason in July and August.\n\nStaging the game in the U.S. is seen as an important step for the league to continue expanding internationally and to close the gap on the powerful English Premier League.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "", "", "", "", "LITCHFIELD PARK, Ariz.

Howard \u2014 and led the Bucs back to within 35-28 in the fourth quarter before running out of steam.\n\nFitzpatrick threw two costly interceptions \u2014 one on the game\u2019s second possession which led to Carolina\u2019s first touchdown, and other late in the fourth quarter that sealed the Bucs\u2019 fate.\n\n\u201cWe know we have the talent, it\u2019s just we can\u2019t keep digging ourselves in these holes, especially on the road,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe deficit \u2014 and Carolina\u2019s offensive firepower \u2014 proved too much.\n\nTight end Greg Olsen called the versatility the Panthers now have on offense with players like McCaffrey, Samuel and D.J. Moore is unlike anything he\u2019s seen since his arrival in Carolina in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe have guys who are so explosive, so dynamic and so good in the open space,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cWe can give them balls on handoffs, throw it to them all \u2014 they\u2019re very unique in that regard. I don\u2019t know what we have had this many guys who are that dynamic with the ball in their hands.\u201d\n\nThat was evident throughout.\n\nMcCaffrey leaped a defender on a reception in the flat and kept going, racing 32 yards for a first down. Samuel\u2019s 33-yard TD on the reverse included the speedster reversing field and running a combined 103 yards , according to NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats. And Olsen, the cagey veteran, hauled in a one-handed catch in the end zone \u2014 his third TD in three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe were playing with momentum and when you\u2019re playing like that, we have a lot of juice coming our way so it does make it very fun,\u201d McCaffrey said.\n\nSaid Newton: \u201cWhen it\u2019s clicking, it\u2019s clicking.\u201d\n\nBREAKING THE PATTERN\n\nBucs coach Dirk Koetter is eager to find a solution for his team, which seems to be stuck in a repeating pattern.\n\n\u201cWe go out, we get behind, we get killed in the second quarter, then rally like (heck) in the third quarter and then everybody thinks we\u2019re back in it and then we fade off at the end,\u201d Koetter said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely the pattern that we\u2019re in.

(AP) \u2014 Julio Jones set his sights on the end zone, twisted to break a tackle and lunged toward the promised land.\n\nA swarm of teammates rushed over from the sideline, jumping around in jubilation to celebrate the end of the star receiver\u2019s 12-game touchdown drought.\n\nJones was back in the end zone where he belongs, and the Atlanta Falcons looked like the team they were predicted to be in a 38-14 blowout of the Washington Redskins on Sunday that extended their winning streak to three games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a brotherhood,\u201d said Jones, who made seven receptions for 121 yards and caught his first TD pass since Nov. 26, 2017.\n\n\u201cWe support one another. If anybody scores, I\u2019m trying to be the first one over there. Nobody hates on each other on this team. Everybody loves when other people go out here and excel and make plays.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons (4-4) made plenty of plays in flexing their offensive muscles with the kind of balanced attack they\u2019ve lacked in an injury-marred season that so far has failed to live up to expectations. Matt Ryan completed 26 of 38 passes for 350 yards and four touchdowns, including the 35-yard screen to Jones that set off a team-wide celebration.\n\nEven though losing four of its first five games didn\u2019t give Atlanta much to celebrate, putting up 491 yards on Washington has players excited about their current position and what more they can accomplish this season.\n\n\u201cThe start to the season was not what we were looking for, but we\u2019re halfway through it, we\u2019re 4-4 and we\u2019re in the mix,\u201d said Ryan, who had touchdown passes of 39 and 10 yards to running back Tevin Coleman and a 40-yarder to rookie receiver Calvin Ridley .\n\n\u201cThe good football teams that I\u2019ve been a part of in my career are the ones that have gotten better as the year\u2019s gone along. Halfway through, I think we\u2019re a better football team than we were at the start and we\u2019ve got to keep it trending in that direction.\u201d\n\nNowhere is that progress more evident than on the ground, where Coleman ran for 80 yards and Ito Smith had 66 yards and a rushing touchdown. The Falcons surpassed 100 yards rushing for the first time since Week 2.\n\n\u201cThe big guys, they put the work in,\u201d said coach Dan Quinn, whose team didn\u2019t punt until midway through the third quarter and converted its first eight third-down opportunities. \u201cWe know we are at our best when both the run game and our pass game are in balance. And today we had that, and the results were there.\u201d\n\nAtlanta\u2019s 30th-ranked defense did its part, too, holding Washington to 35 first-quarter yards and making a crucial stop after Ryan was picked off by Quinton Dunbar \u2014 just the quarterback\u2019s third interception this season.\n\nThe NFC East-leading Redskins (5-3) could blame poor tackling, ill-timed penalties and a series of injuries along the offensive line for the end of their three-game winning streak.\n\nAlready without left tackle Trent Williams after surgery to repair his dislocated right thumb, Washington lost left guard Shaun Lauvao to a left knee injury, right guard Brandon Scherff to a left shoulder injury and struggled to stop the Falcons when it mattered.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the preparation, just the executing,\u201d Washington safety D.J. Swearinger said. \u201cGot to be better. Got to be disciplined. Got to be disciplined in our efforts.\u201d\n\nSwearinger and other players blamed officials for part of the Redskins\u2019 disciplinary trouble that added up to 10 penalties for 147 yards.\n\nAdrian Peterson was held to 17 yards on nine carries a week after rushing for 149 yards at the New York Giants. Alex Smith was 30 of 46 for 306 yards, an interception and a touchdown pass to Josh Doctson.\n\nKAZEE\u2019S PICK AND THROW\n\nFalcons safety Damontae Kazee effectively ended any chances of a Redskins comeback when he picked off Smith with about seven minutes left. After the play, Kazee ran toward the corner of the stadium full of Falcons fans and did his best Ryan impression by throwing the ball to the top of the lower deck.\n\nKazee said he was trying to get the ball to his nephew in that corner of the stands and isn\u2019t worried about punishment.\n\n\u201cI get fined every week,\u201d Kazee said. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nSMITH\u2019S RUN\n\nAs inconsequential as Washington\u2019s ground game was, Smith had its longest gain of the day on a scramble that helped set up a touchdown. With Peterson blocking for him, the 34-year-old picked up 22 yards before being stopped on a crushing shoulder-to-shoulder hit from Brian Poole at the Atlanta 19.\n\nINJURIES\n\nFalcons: Calvin Ridley was cleared to return after being evaluated for a head injury. ...

His 1-yard run made it 20-6 in the third quarter, and the 36-year-old showed his determination by missing only one play after being flattened during a sprint from the pocket with just over 13 minutes left.\n\n\u201cBen just got the wind knocked out of him,\u201d coach Mike Tomlin said.\n\nThe Ravens (4-5) scored only one touchdown in their third straight defeat, managing two field goals in the first half while falling behind 14-6. Baltimore had converted 72.4 percent of its red zone opportunities into TDs \u2014 the fourth-best percentage in the NFL \u2014 but on this day a 1-for-4 performance didn\u2019t cut it.\n\n\u201cTo hold those guys to field goals in the first half when they were down there was significant,\u201d Tomlin said.\n\nPittsburgh opened the second half with a drive that lasted nearly seven minutes and ended with a 1-yard plunge by Roethlisberger. The conversion sailed wide to the right, keeping the score at 20-6.\n\nDown by two touchdowns and facing a potential two-game deficit in the AFC North, the Ravens reacted. Joe Flacco completed six passes in a 75-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Alex Collins .\n\nThe defense followed by forcing the game\u2019s first three-and-out, but the Baltimore offense failed to sustain the momentum.\n\nAfter the Ravens punted. Roethlisberger was collared from behind by Za\u2019Darius Smith and remained on the ground for several minutes. Joshua Dobbs came in, completed a 22-yard pass to JuJu Smith-Schuster, then gave way to Roethlisberger.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge play,\u201d Roethlisberger said of Dobbs\u2019 first-down toss.\n\nThe drive led to a field goal for a 10-point cushion with 8:26 remaining.\n\nBaltimore got another field goal to get within a touchdown with 5:23 to go, but never threatened thereafter. It was not at all the way the Ravens wanted to enter their long-awaited bye week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go into our bye week trying to get rested up, trying to get healthy,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to come out swinging the last seven games and find a way to make the playoffs.\u201d\n\nIn the first half, Roethlisberger threw 29 passes and showed his kicking prowess as Pittsburgh took control.\n\nWith the Steelers facing a fourth down from the Baltimore 38, Roethlisberger lined up in shotgun formation and popped up a 27-yard punt \u2014 his seventh career kick.\n\nEric Weddle drifted back to catch the kick and took it back 18 yards, perhaps the only disappointing aspect of Big Ben\u2019s day.\n\n\u201cIt would have been good if Weddle didn\u2019t go back and catch it,\u201d Roethlisberger lamented. \u201cIt would have been inside the 5, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens then settled for a field goal one play after Flacco failed to see wide-open Lamar Jackson on the right side near the end zone. Jackson, a rookie quarterback who\u2019s been used in a variety of ways, went in motion on the play and was left uncovered.\n\nRoethlisberger put Pittsburgh ahead with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Conner, and the Steelers made it 14-3 on a 6-yard TD catch by Antonio Brown.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSteelers: None reported.\n\nRavens: Starting offensive tackles Ronnie Stanley (ankle) and James Hurst (back) were on the inactive list. ... CB Tavon Young hurt his right ankle in the fourth quarter and did not return.\n\nTRIBUTE TO SYNAGOGUE VICTIMS\n\nRoethlisberger wore cleats emblazoned with a Star of David in response to the late-October shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The Star of David was in yellow and served as the upper part of the Steelers logo. There were also the words, \u201cStronger Than Hate\u201d on each shoe.\n\nRoethlisberger and his wife are friends of Michele Rosenthal, a former team employee. Two of Rosenthal\u2019s brothers were among the 11 killed in the attack.\n\nMR. TOUCHDOWNS\n\nConner has 10 touchdowns , most by a Steelers player through eight games since 1950.

(AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 With almost every flick of his right wrist, the legend of Patrick Mahomes grows.\n\nAnd he\u2019s just beginning.\n\nOnly 10 games into his NFL career, Kansas City\u2019s young quarterback is doing things that have never been done before.\n\nMahomes passed for 375 yards, threw three touchdown passes \u2014 two to Cleveland native Travis Kelce \u2014 and continued the best start by a QB in 68 years as Kansas City\u2019s impossible-to-handle offense kept rolling with a 37-21 win on Sunday over the Cleveland Browns, who played their first game since coach Hue Jackson\u2019s firing.\n\nKareem Hunt, who also has Cleveland connections, had two scoring runs and one receiving for the Chiefs (8-1), who came in averaging 36.3 points with an offense overloaded with weapons for Mahomes.\n\nThe 23-year-old used all of them in winning his first pro matchup against Baker Mayfield and the Browns (2-6-1).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun,\u201d said Mahomes, who was hurt by a couple drops. \u201cIt makes my job a lot easier knowing that I can trust these guys are going to be in the right spot. They\u2019re taking care of their business. They\u2019re running the routes and making route adjustments on the fly just because they\u2019ve looked at the film and know how to do those things.\u201d\n\nMahomes and Mayfield didn\u2019t match their epic college meeting in 2016, when they combined for more than 1,700 yards in offense. But the Chiefs put on another impressive offensive show with 499 total yards, averaging 8.6 per snap.\n\nBrowns defensive end Myles Garrett said preparing for Mahomes and Kansas City\u2019s air-and-ground show is nothing like playing against it.\n\n\u201cTheir offense has a nice tempo and he gets the ball out of his hand pretty quick, so it\u2019s hard to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cHe spreads the ball around really well and everybody is getting touches. You don\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to go to next.\u201d\n\nIn his second season, Mahomes, who made just one start as a rookie, already has 29 TD passes and 3,185 yards, the most by any QB through 10 games since 1950. He has passed for at least 300 yards in eight straight games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird deal \u2014 he just goes out there and plays,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cHe works hard. He loves doing it. He just goes about his business the way that you\u2019re supposed to do it.\u201d\n\nCleveland lost its fourth straight, but it looked better under interim coach Gregg Williams than it did with Jackson, fired on Monday after going 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nMayfield threw two TD passes to Duke Johnson and finished 29 of 42 for 297 yards with one interception.\n\nThe Browns came in facing a monumental task in trying to slow Mahomes and an offense with speed, depth and no noticeable weaknesses.\n\nThings got much tougher for Cleveland when starting cornerback Damarious Randall (groin) was scratched and E.J. Gaines (concussion) and rookie Denzel Ward (hip) both got hurt in the first half.\n\nKansas City scored a touchdown on its first three possessions and the Chiefs only had the ball for 11:29 in the first half as the Browns were able to control the clock.\n\nThe Chiefs picked up where they left off in the third quarter with Mahomes firing a 13-yard TD pass to Kelce, giving Kansas City a 28-15 lead.\n\nKelce couldn\u2019t stop smiling as he talked about his QB.\n\n\u201cYou mean Showtime Mahomes?\u201d he said. \u201cHe came in with the understanding this thing could be very special. We added a few pieces to the puzzle and the offensive line is playing lights out. It\u2019s a combination of everything that\u2019s making him feel comfortable out there.\u201d\n\nMAYFIELD HEAD SHOT\n\nMayfield was checked for a concussion and cleared after a questionable hit late in the third quarter.\n\nMayfield was backpedaling and being wrapped up by Chris Jones when the rookie QB was struck in the helmet by Chiefs defensive back Ron Parker, who came in late but was not penalized. The NFL\u2019s on-site medical spotter called down and Mayfield had to leave the game to be checked for a head injury.\n\n\u201cI think the rule is if they see me messing with my helmet, they are going to take precaution,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWhen you get hit in the head, your helmet moves around so I am going to shift it so it fits correctly. It is just interesting how it works. I had to come out of the game and take the exam.\u201d\n\nLUCKY STREAK\n\nThe Chiefs won the coin toss for the ninth consecutive week and elected to defer.\n\nHOMETOWN HERO\n\nA Cleveland native, Hunt bought more than 100 tickets for the game and had them given to the players and coaches at his high school alma mater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true that I\u2019m able to do something like that,\u201d said Hunt, who rushed for 91 yards. \u201cIt\u2019s a stadium I used to drive by almost every day.\u201d\n\nLINE SHIFT\n\nBrowns rookie left tackle Desmond Harrison sat out with an unspecified illness and was replaced by Greg Robinson, a former No. 2 overall pick who made his first start.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Host Arizona on Nov. 11\n\nBrowns: Host Atlanta on Nov. 11.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Drivers race down the front stretch as the green flag drops during the NASCAR MENCS AAA Texas 500 auto race at Texas Motor Speedway, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Fort Worth, Texas.

For a first-year linebacker, it was a surprisingly polished touchdown celebration.\n\nBaker bested fellow rookie Sam Darnold, scoring the game\u2019s only TD on a 25-yard interception return with 11 minutes left, and a resilient defense helped the Miami Dolphins beat the hapless New York Jets 13-6 on Sunday.\n\nDarnold threw four interceptions and took four sacks, and the Jets went 2 for 15 on third and fourth down.\n\nThe hobbled Dolphins (5-4) endured another wave of injuries and the mysterious departure of safety Reshad Jones, who pulled himself out of the game.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Minnesota Vikings turned their defensive line loose on Matthew Stafford in a dominant performance that would have made the old Purple People Eaters proud.\n\nThis unstoppable pass rush was led, predictably, by Danielle Hunter.\n\nHunter had 3 1/2 of Minnesota\u2019s franchise-record 10 sacks plus a fourth-quarter fumble return for a touchdown , tormenting Stafford and the Detroit Lions all afternoon in a 24-9 victory by the Vikings on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe knew he liked to throw the ball down the field, so that\u2019s something that really helped us a lot because he held on to the ball,\u201d said Hunter, who moved into the NFL lead with 11 1/2 sacks for the season. \u201cSo as long as we executed the rush plan, we knew we\u2019d be able to get back there.\u201d\n\nHunter also was credited with nine tackles and four quarterback hits. The Vikings (5-3-1) limited the Lions (3-5) to a season-low 214 total yards, and their pressure on Stafford was so intense he literally had pieces of rubber pellets from the artificial turf flushed out of his left eye in the second quarter. The Lions had a streak of 25 consecutive games with at least 14 points come to a crashing halt.\n\n\u201cThe fault is on everybody,\u201d said Stafford, who was sacked a total of 13 times over the first seven games. \u201cI have to get the ball out faster.\u201d\n\nAfter Dalvin Cook dropped a pitch from Kirk Cousins and A\u2019Shawn Robinson recovered at the Detroit 28 with Minnesota leading 17-6, the Lions converted a fake punt to keep that drive alive. Two plays later, Stafford ran right on the short side of the field and tried an option-style flip that Kerryon Johnson was unable to secure, and Hunter scooped it up on his way to the easy score.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he pitched it. He could\u2019ve just run,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cI thought it was a pass all the way, but I guess he didn\u2019t want to get hit or something.\u201d\n\nThat happened a lot, including a total of three times in the second quarter on two separate possessions inside the Minnesota 20 that forced the Lions to settle for field goals by Matt Prater.\n\nAfter a throw by Cousins to Adam Thielen near midfield was intercepted by Darius Slay, the Lions made it as far as the 12-yard line. Hunter sacked Stafford on consecutive snaps, sharing the first one with Everson Griffen.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a freak of nature. He looks like a superhero,\u201d Griffen said of the fourth-year defensive end. \u201cI expected that from him.\u201d\n\n2.5 sacks \u2714\ufe0f\n\n\n\nFumble recovery \u2714\ufe0f\n\n\n\nTouchdown \u2714\ufe0f @NFL , look no further for your NFC Defensive Player of the Week. pic.twitter.com/4iC3CTnPV9 \u2014 Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) November 4, 2018\n\nNine of the 10 sacks by the Vikings came from their front four, including 2 1/2 by backup defensive tackle Tom Johnson. During the heyday of the Purple People Eaters, the Vikings had nine sacks in a game in 1968, 1969 and 1970. They also did it in 1993. But this was the record-setter, thanks to a well-timed mix of blitzes called by coach Mike Zimmer and the relentless rush by Hunter and his friends up front.\n\n\u201cWe know if we give them time, they\u2019ll get there,\u201d safety Harrison Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to be a part of.\u201d\n\nHE\u2019S COOKIN\u2019\n\nWith one burst through a big hole in the left side of the line , Cook made clear he\u2019s healthy again with a 70-yard gain in the second quarter to set up a short touchdown catch by Thielen. According to the NFL\u2019s NextGen Stats tracker, he averaged 22.07 mph during that run for the fastest in the league this season. The Lions have allowed a rush of 50-plus yards in four different games this year.\n\nNOT THIELEN IT\n\nThielen\u2019s streak of 100-yard receiving games ended at eight in a row, leaving him in a tie for the record with Lions legend Calvin Johnson. The Lions double-covered him often, taking advantage of the absence of fellow standout Stefon Diggs to rib injury, and Thielen finished with only four receptions for 22 yards.\n\nSTACKS OF SACKS\n\nThe previous high sack total for Stafford in his career was seven, against the Vikings in 2015. He has been sacked five times or more on 15 different occasions, six of those by the Vikings. The Lions are 3-12 in those games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big shot to our pride,\u201d left guard Frank Ragnow said.\n\nUH-OH\n\nThe opening kickoff was ominous for the Lions when Prater slipped after his leg swing, an unintentional squib the Vikings returned to their 35. Practice squad promotion Chad Beebe caught back-to-back passes on the first drive of his NFL debut. The second one netted 13 yards on fourth-and-2 from the Detroit 37. Latavius Murray finished the march with a 1-yard touchdown run.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nLions: DE Ziggy Ansah (shoulder) returned from a six-game absence with had a sack in the closing seconds of the second quarter that forced the Vikings to settle for a field goal. ...

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Jake Browning was angry and probably had every right to be.\n\nAfter four seasons as Washington\u2019s starting quarterback, the last thing Browning expected was to be benched because of the Huskies\u2019 offensive woes.\n\nInstead of letting the benching a week ago against California fester, Browning responded as Washington hoped, throwing one touchdown and running for another in the Huskies\u2019 27-23 victory over Stanford on Saturday.\n\nThe win returned the Huskies (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) to the AP Top 25 at No. 20 and kept alive their Rose Bowl chances heading into a weekend off. If the Huskies beat Oregon State on Nov. 17 and knock off rival Washington State in the Apple Cup, they will play in the Pac-12 Championship game with a chance at a reasonable consolation prize for a season that began with College Football Playoff aspirations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot of things in my career and I feel like I\u2019ve responded to all of them,\u201d Browning said after the victory over Stanford. \u201cYou can question a lot of things about me, but I\u2019m pretty mentally tough and I\u2019m not going to let something shake me.\u201d\n\nBrowning wasn\u2019t great against Stanford, throwing for only 194 yards, and Washington\u2019s offense stagnated after a dynamic first half in which the Huskies scored on their first three drives. But he avoided any major mistakes and finished off one of the more trying weeks in his Washington career with a victory.\n\nBrowning was benched late in the third quarter of the Huskies\u2019 12-10 loss at California on Oct. 27. It was a questionable decision considering the Huskies were leading when the benching occurred and backup Jake Haener almost immediately threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown.\n\nBrowning didn\u2019t mince words in expressing his displeasure, but he tried to keep it out of the eye of his teammates and the public so as not to be a distraction heading into the Stanford game. That included a conversation with coach Chris Petersen.\n\n\u201cI was pretty frustrated ... but had to move on,\u201d Browning said. \u201cDidn\u2019t let that affect our season. Sat down, hashed it out. It\u2019s a little bump in the road but coach (Petersen) is my guy and been through a lot with him and like I said I tried to handle it as maturely as possible so it didn\u2019t become this huge drama or whatever. Tried to move on to this game and if we won this game everyone would feel better and luckily we did that.\u201d\n\nPetersen agreed that Browning should have been upset and if he wasn\u2019t, there might have been a bigger problem.\n\n\u201cI know that kid inside and out and if he wasn\u2019t upset ... that he got pulled out I probably wouldn\u2019t have put him back in,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThat\u2019s Jake. He\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s a competitor. I would have expected nothing different.\u201d\n\nBrowning said dealing with the benching was nothing compared with his sophomore season when he played about half the year with a shoulder injury that required surgery after the season ended and not once giving a full indication of how hurt he was along the way. That was the best season of Browning\u2019s career; he was named the Pac-12 offensive player of the year and led Washington to a spot in the national semifinals. The Huskies won\u2019t get back there this year, but still having a chance at a conference title to close out his career is plenty of motivation.\n\n\u201cThat was something I was thinking about when I got benched for those two drives was crazy stuff happens in this league and if I mentally fold, which I\u2019ll never do, then that really could have an effect on this team,\u201d Browning said, \u201cwhich is why I tried to handle it really maturely and continue to just keep pushing the issue in practice and continue to get better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 A restaurant facade has collapsed and injured two people in Boston.\n\nThe Boston Fire Department tweeted Sunday that the facade of the single-story commercial building that houses the Common Ground Allston in the city\u2019s Allston neighborhood collapsed shortly before 3 p.m. Photos of the scene tweeted out by the department showed large chunks of the restaurant\u2019s roof and facade had crashed onto the sidewalk in front of the brick building.\n\nThe department said two people were injured, one of them critically.

The official office of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp said Sunday, Nov. 4, it is investigating the state Democratic Party in connection with what it said was an attempted hack of the state\u2019s online voter database that will be used at polling places in Tuesday\u2019s election. (Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia\u2019s online voter database morphed into a last-minute curveball in one of the nation\u2019s hottest governor\u2019s races, with Republican nominee Brian Kemp making a hacking allegation against Democrats just as reporting emerged of a gaping vulnerability in a system that Kemp controls as secretary of state.\n\nKemp\u2019s office did not detail any nefarious acts by Democrats, offering no evidence for Sunday\u2019s unusual action that effectively means the state\u2019s chief elections officer began a probe of his partisan opposition days before an election.\n\nPolls suggest Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams are locked in a tight race that even before Sunday had evolved into a bitter back-and-forth over voting rights and ballot security.\n\nThe state Democratic Party called Kemp\u2019s accusation \u201ca reckless and unethical ploy\u201d and said he was using the FBI to support \u201cfalse accusations.\u201d\n\nAccording to interviews conducted by The Associated Press and records released by the Georgia Democratic Party, the saga built steam quickly in the days before Kemp\u2019s statement.\n\nAn attorney who represents election-security advocates already suing Kemp over his job performance said a private citizen alerted him Friday to a suspected major flaw in the voter database that is used to check in voters in Tuesday\u2019s midterm.\n\nThe lawyer, David Cross, notified both the FBI and Kemp\u2019s counsel Saturday morning. But the citizen had separately informed the Georgia Democratic Party, whose voter protection chief then sent an email to two computer security officials.\n\n\u201cIf this report is accurate, it is a massive vulnerability,\u201d wrote the official, Sara Tindall Ghazal. Party officials provided the AP with the email, its recipients\u2019 names redacted.\n\nNeither Cross nor the state party went public.\n\nBut reporters for the online news outlet WhoWhatWhy obtained a copy of the Ghazal email and the email that Democratic Party officials received from the private citizen who discovered the flaw, Richard Wright.\n\nThey published a story Sunday just as Kemp\u2019s office released the statement accusing the Democrats of attempted hacking. \u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cybercrimes,\u201d said Candice Broce, who works for Kemp.\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director at the state Democratic Party, said no one from Kemp\u2019s office notified the Democratic Party or asked any question about the correspondence before issuing its public announcement of an investigation. DeHart called it a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d to cover up the weaknesses in a system Kemp runs.\n\nWhoWhatWhy\u2019s story said five security experts had reviewed the Wright complaint and independently confirmed that the database is vulnerable to hacking.\n\nOne of those experts, University of Michigan computer scientist Matthew Bernhard, told the AP that anyone with access to an individual voter\u2019s personal information could alter that voter\u2019s record in the system.\n\nAnother computer security professional who reviewed the vulnerability \u2014 without attempting to probe it for fear of prosecution \u2014 is Kris Constable of PrivaSecTech in Vancouver, Canada. \u201cAnyone with security chops would have detected this problem,\u201d he said, \u201cso (the system) clearly has never been audited by any computer security professional.\u201d\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on the matter. A representative for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the agency had been notified, but it deferred to Georgia officials for details.\n\nCross, the attorney who said he alerted the FBI, said Wright doesn\u2019t wish to speak publicly. Cross described Wright as a businessman with \u201csome background in software.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in the voting integrity lawsuit against Kemp, issued a statement decrying his outsourcing of the the voter registration database and electronic poll book voter check-in system to a third party, PCC Technologies.\n\n\u201cThere are still immediate steps that Secretary Kemp and the State Election Board can take to mitigate some, but not all, of the risk for Tuesday\u2019s vote,\u201d the group said.\n\nEfforts to reach PCC for comment have not been successful.\n\nThe drama played out on a day Kemp campaigned alongside President Donald Trump in Macon. Trump made no mention of the issue at the rally and earlier, as he left the White House for Georgia, said he didn\u2019t know anything about it.\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud.\n\nAbrams, who would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor, has called Kemp \u201can architect of voter suppression\u201d and says he\u2019s used his current post to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp counters that he\u2019s following state and federal law and that it\u2019s Abrams and her affiliated voting advocacy groups trying to help people, including noncitizens, cast ballots illegally.\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying about the possibility that the losing side will not accept Tuesday\u2019s results as legitimate.\n\nThe accusation is not the first from Kemp accusing outsiders of trying to penetrate his office. Immediately after the 2016 general election, Kemp declared that DHS tried to hack his office\u2019s network, an accusation dismissed in mid-2017 by the DHS inspector general as unfounded.\n\nEven before he was running for governor, Kemp faced criticism over Georgia\u2019s election system.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s centrally managed elections system lacks a verifiable paper trail that can be audited in case of problems. The state is one of just five nationwide that continues to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don\u2019t leave a paper trail.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp\u2019s office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn\u2019t fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia voters \u2014 6.7 million at the time \u2014 as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp\u2019s office laid the blame for that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp\u2019s behalf.\n\nIn the voting integrity case, a federal judge last month endorsed the plaintiff\u2019s arguments that Kemp has been derelict in his management of the state election system and that it violates voters\u2019 constitutional rights with its lack of verifiability and reliability.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Colleen Long and Jill Colvin in Washington and Ben Nadler in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "Man dies after being taken to hospital from California jail\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif.

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 No. 5 Georgia is heading back to the Southeastern Conference championship game behind a new running back tandem that has capably stepped in for the dynamic duo that led the Bulldogs to the national championship game last year\n\nThe Bulldogs had to replace New England Patriots first-round draft pick Sony Michel and Cleveland Browns second-round pick Nick Chubb , who combined to run for 2,572 yards and 31 touchdowns a year ago.\n\nBut they still have D\u2019Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield, who are pretty darn good in their own right. Swift and Holyfield ran for a combined 271 yards Saturday as Georgia (8-1, 6-1 SEC, No. 6 CFP) clinched its second straight SEC East title with a 34-17 victory over Kentucky (No. 9 CFP), which entered the weekend leading the nation in scoring defense.\n\n\u201cI think our one-two punch is one of the best in the country,\u201d Swift said.\n\nSwift and Holyfield helped set up an SEC championship game showdown with No. 1 Alabama (9-0, 6-0, No. 1 CFP), a rematch of last year\u2019s College Football Playoff final that the Crimson Tide won 26-23 in overtime.\n\nAlabama clinched the SEC West championship Saturday with a 29-0 victory at LSU , the same team that trounced Georgia 36-16 last month. Alabama outrushed LSU 281-12 and is outscoring teams by 37.2 points per game.\n\n\u201cTo be able to come in here and play the way we played and have the success we had, I think it just gives us nothing but confidence going into the rest of the season,\u201d Alabama running back Damien Harris said.\n\nBoth division champions have three straight home games to end the regular season before meeting Dec. 1 in Atlanta. Georgia hosts Auburn, Massachusetts and Georgia Tech to close the regular season. Alabama welcomes Mississippi State, The Citadel and Auburn to Tuscaloosa.\n\nGeorgia likely must win out and earn its second straight SEC title to get back to the playoff. That means Swift and Holyfield must maintain their late-season momentum.\n\nSwift rushed for a career-high 156 yards against Kentucky on just 16 carries. That followed a 105-yard performance in a 36-17 victory over Florida .\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene as a freshman in 2017 by rushing for 618 yards in a complementary role, Swift said Saturday that he\u2019s been dealing with nagging injuries much of this year but is now feeling good. He showcased his speed on an 83-yard touchdown and demonstrated his elusiveness while making moves around defenders on a 20-yard score .\n\nHolyfield, the son of former heavyweight champion boxer Evander Holyfield, also had a career high against Kentucky, rushing for 115 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole lot of difference in their styles,\u201d Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. \u201cI know one\u2019s a slasher and one\u2019s a bruiser, but they\u2019re both (guys with) really good vision, good backs. They run hard. The best thing they do is protect the ball.\u201d\n\nTheir season stats are remarkably similar.\n\nHolyfield, a junior, has rushed for 674 yards and five touchdowns while averaging 6.5 yards per carry. Swift has run for 622 yards and seven touchdowns with an average of 6.3 yards per carry.\n\nHolyfield says watching Chubb and Michel last season helped teach him and Swift how to handle sharing the rushing load this year.\n\n\u201cI think we kind of learned how to feed off each other,\u201d Holyfield said.\n\nSwift and Holyfield have helped Georgia average an SEC-leading 233.8 yards rushing per game as the Bulldogs have gained 5.76 yards per carry. Last season, Georgia led the SEC with 258.4 yards rushing per game and gained 5.79 yards per carry.\n\nGeorgia has continued running the ball effectively even with a much younger offensive line. Georgia\u2019s first-team offensive line against Kentucky included one senior (Lamont Gaillard), two sophomores (Andrew Thomas and Solomon Kindley), a redshirt freshman (Isaiah Wilson) and a true freshman (Cade Mays). Freshman Trey Hill replaced an injured Gaillard at center early in the game.\n\nThat success has Georgia believing it\u2019s capable of more than a division title.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think we\u2019ve scratched the surface of what we really can do,\u201d Swift said. \u201cThis team has a tremendous amount of talent.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 Sevilla couldn\u2019t manage more than a 0-0 draw at Real Sociedad on Sunday and lost ground to Barcelona at the top of the Spanish league.\n\nThe draw left second-place Sevilla four points behind Barcelona, which rallied to win 3-2 at Rayo Vallecano on Saturday. Barcelona also gained from a draw by third-place Atletico Madrid at Leganes on Saturday and a loss by fourth-place Alaves at Eibar on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe went after the three points from the first minute but we lacked accuracy in the counterattacks,\u201d Sevilla defender Daniel Carrico said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity we couldn\u2019t leave with the three points.\u201d\n\nSevilla coach Pablo Machin was content with the away draw.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that by the end of the season there will be two teams fighting for the title and another very close to them,\u201d Machin said. \u201cSeveral teams will be fighting for fourth place and we are privileged to be in contention for these positions.\u201d\n\nBarcelona\u2019s city rival Espanyol has a chance to get within three points of the lead if it defeats struggling Athletic Bilbao at home on Monday.\n\nReal Madrid moved from ninth to sixth after a 2-0 win against Valladolid on Saturday, but it remains seven points behind Barcelona.\n\nReal Sociedad, 13th in the standings, hasn\u2019t won in five matches at its renovated Anoeta Stadium.\n\nTHRILLING FINISH\n\nSevilla rival Real Betis drew with Celta Vigo 3-3 in a thrilling game at Benito Villamarin Stadium.\n\nBetis relinquished a two-goal lead and then went behind in the 84th minute, but the hosts salvaged the draw with a superb free kick by Sergio Canales in the 87th.\n\nSpain striker Iago Aspas nearly gave Celta the lead again a minute later when he struck the crossbar.\n\nCelta dropped to 11th place and Betis is 14th.\n\nBUSY VAR\n\nAlaves missed a chance to stay in second place after a 2-1 loss at Eibar in a match marked by a series of video reviews.\n\nAlaves\u2019 goal by Manu Garcia less than five minutes into the game was initially disallowed for offside but the call was changed by VAR.\n\nVAR also reversed a penalty awarded to Eibar midway through the first half because the foul was committed outside the area, with Alaves defender Ruben Duarte red carded. In the second half, video review led to a red card for Eibar player Pablo De Blasis for a dangerous foul.\n\nEibar equalized with a goal by Joan Jordan in the 69th and Pape Diop got the winner in stoppage time.\n\nIt was the first setback for Alaves after three straight wins.\n\nRELEGATION DANGER\n\nVillarreal couldn\u2019t manage more than a 1-1 draw against Levante at home, staying only one point away from the relegation zone.\n\nAlfonso Pedraza scored the equalizer for Villarreal in stoppage time after Levante had taken the lead with an own-goal by defender Funes Mori in the 77th.\n\nIt was the sixth consecutive league game without a win for Villarreal, which began the season with high expectations after a fifth-place finish last season.\n\nLevante hasn\u2019t lost in six straight matches in all competitions.\n\nHUESCA\u2019S WOES\n\nPromoted Huesca was set to leave last place but conceded a stoppage-time goal in a 1-1 home draw against Getafe.\n\nPlaying in the top tier for the first time, Huesca hasn\u2019t won since the first round, a run of 10 straight matches.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Authorities say the ex-boyfriend and father of the son of \u201cGrowing Up Hip Hop\u201d star Angela Simmons has been killed in Atlanta.\n\nPolice said in a statement that a man was shot several times Saturday afternoon after an argument at a southwest Atlanta house.\n\nThe Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office identified\n\nThe victim was identified as 37-year-old Sutton Tennyson by the medical examiner\u2019s office in Fulton County.\n\nSimmons posted on Instagram a picture of Tennyson holding their son and thanked him for her greatest gift, adding \u201cI\u2019m hurting.

(AP Photo/Larry Papke)\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kevin Harvick gave the checkered flag to a young fan he brought onto the track to take a selfie \u2014 one with the winning driver and car that will have a shot at another NASCAR Cup championship.\n\nHarvick rocketed past polesitter Ryan Blaney in overtime Sunday, after the third restart in the final 35 laps, to win the Texas fall race for the second year in a row and take one of the four championship-contending spots for the season finale in two weeks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to count our fingers and toes to try to figure out how we\u2019re going to make it. We want to earn it,\u201d said Harvick, who led 177 of 337 laps. \u201cToday we earned our way in and we\u2019re going to go and race again next week and try to win another race and see what we can do at Homestead.\u201d\n\nAfter taking the inside on the first two restarts, and briefly losing the lead after the second one, Harvick opted to start from outside for the green-white-checkered finish. By time they got to the backstretch, Harvick had pushed his No. 4 Stewart-Haas Ford in front of Blaney and raced to his eighth win of this season and 45th overall.\n\n\u201cI thought if I could keep him from finishing the corner I could drive back by him,\u201d Harvick said. \u201cIt all worked out.\u201d\n\nOf Harvick\u2019s 32 starts in the Lone Star State, his only two wins are the last two fall races to get into the final four. The 2014 Cup champion has 20 top-10 finishes at the 1 1/2-mile track. He won both stages Sunday, marking the fourth time this year he did that and went on to win the race.\n\nWith Harvick and Martinsville winner Joey Logano in the No. 22 Ford of Team Penske locked in, the series goes to Phoenix next week with only two spots up for grabs for the championship run at Homestead.\n\nKyle Busch, a seven-time winner this year, and defending Cup champion Martin Truex Jr. are among the other six title contenders. They are comfortably above the cut line for points, but Chase Elliott or any of Harvick\u2019s three SHR teammates \u2014 Clint Bowyer, Aric Almirola and Kurt Busch \u2014 could advance with a win in Phoenix.\n\nLogano was third at Texas. Elliott was sixth, followed by Kurt Busch and Almirola, who had also gone to the rear at the start of the race for unapproved body modifications. Truex, who was close to clinching a title spot before that bump-and-run by Logano on the final lap to win at Martinsville last week, finished ninth.\n\nKyle Busch was 17th and Bowyer 26th after starting on the front row but making contact with Denny Hamlin on the first lap.\n\nAfter the first of the late restarts, Harvick was on the inside and was able to keep Blaney from clearing him on the backstretch. Harvick was already starting to rebuild his lead \u2014 it had been nearly 4 seconds before the caution \u2014 when another yellow flag came out.\n\nHarvick was on the inside again for the next restart, but Blaney was able to get by him for the lead. Blaney led seven laps before Harvick went under him and was again putting distance between them before Joey Gase\u2019s spin brought out the last of eight cautions.\n\n\u201cThey were hard. They were challenging,\u201d Blaney said about the restarts. \u201cThat was really the only shot we had to beat him, to be honest with you. We got by him one restart and I just couldn\u2019t hold him off. ... The last one, he took the top, like I knew he was going to go. He motored around me.\u201d\n\nTruex had to start at the rear of the field because of an engine change. He also dealt with a loose tire and had a pass-through penalty during the race for driving through too many pit boxes, and was a lap down before getting that back one the first of the late cautions.\n\n\u201cWe got a little bit of luck on our side after that to be able to get back on the lead lap. Happy about that for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cTo start exactly where we were I think is a decent day. The only difference is there\u2019s one less spot available.\u201d\n\nLOOK OUT LOGANO\n\nTruex has vowed that Logano won\u2019t win the Cup title after what happened at Martinsville. Now Almirola is upset with Logano after one of the late restarts in Texas.\n\n\u201cHe just continues to make things harder on himself,\u201d Almirola said.\n\nAfter working himself back to the front of the field, Almirola said Logano \u201cabout wrecked\u201d them both after coming down into his door in Turn 3.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the way he wants to race me when he\u2019s already locked into to Homestead and we\u2019re out here fighting for our lives, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Almirola said. \u201cWhen Homestead comes around, if I\u2019m not in, he\u2019ll know it.\u201d\n\nLogano said they were still racing at the end in a tight turn.\n\nERROR TO THE BACK, AND A SPIN\n\nJimmie Johnson was sent to the rear of the field after the No. 48 Chevrolet twice failed prerace inspection.\n\nNASCAR later said it erred in penalizing Johnson at the start of the race because his car passed inspection the third time. He had qualified 23rd for his 600th start with Chad Knaus as his crew chief.\n\n\u201cThere is no format for the teams to communicate to the tower. So, whatever the tower says is the way it is,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis is just one of a few calls that have been wrong due to that situation. I don\u2019t know how they do it.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s teammate with Hendrick Motorsports, William Byron in the No. 24, was sent to the back of the field after three failed inspections.\n\nJust short of 100 laps into the race, Johnson got loose and wiggled in front of Byron that led to contact and a spin for the No. 24.\n\nUP NEXT: The last race in the third round of the playoffs, Sunday at Phoenix.

But Tuesday\u2019s election also will decide the makeup of the state Legislature.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Don Young, who has served in the House since 1973, faces a challenge from independent Alyse Galvin. Republican Mike Dunleavy and Democrat Mark Begich are vying to succeed independent Gov. Bill Walker.\n\nWalker ended his campaign last month, days after his lieutenant governor resigned over what Walker has called an inappropriate overture to a woman. Walker voted early on Friday and said he voted for Begich.\n\n\u201cI consider I voted for Alaska,\u201d Walker said. He has offered qualified support for Begich, saying Begich\u2019s positions on issues like a state fiscal plan and Medicaid expansion are in line with his.

But I can\u2019t help that,\u201d he said.\n\nBegich said there is momentum behind his campaign. But he said he worries about voter confusion since Walker\u2019s name remains on the ballot. Walker ended his campaign after the deadline to withdraw had passed.\n\n\u201cI think it gives us even a better chance of winning this race\u201d the more people know that Walker is out, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a tight race.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nMATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Waiting on the southern end of a bridge that leads to the United States, Humberto Alvarez Gonzalez warily follows the progress of the caravan winding through Mexico with the goal of reaching the border.\n\nAlvarez and about two dozen other people are waiting in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, because U.S. customs officers say there\u2019s no space to process them. They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.\n\nNow, Alvarez, a 32-year-old from Cuba, is worried that large waves of migrants in a caravan still more than 800 miles away from the border might provoke the U.S. government to reject them altogether.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to enter before the caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that the group of migrants will reach us and that they will judge us together with them.\u201d\n\nAsylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. President Donald Trump last week threatened to detain asylum seekers in large tents and send as many as 15,000 active-duty soldiers to the border. He\u2019s also spoken of closing the border.\n\nU.S. government officials say the bridges remain open to asylum seekers. But in South Texas, the busiest corridor for unauthorized border crossings, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stand at the center of bridges to check documents and stop most asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in San Diego, people at the San Ysidro crossing wait more than a month, and volunteers operate an informal take-a-number system to spare migrants from having to wait in line or sleep out in the open. Inspectors there typically process about 100 claims a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not turning people away, it\u2019s asking them to wait,\u201d CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said recently. \u201cWe are taking people in as we have capacity to do so.\u201d\n\nAt the bridge where Alvarez and dozens of others wait, security guards on the Mexican side hold back asylum seekers until U.S. border inspectors tell them how many people they will accept. Some days, five or 10 people are allowed. On other days, the asylum seekers said, no one is.\n\nAt another bridge separating Brownsville and Matamoros, four women and their children slept under a blue tarp on the bridge. The tarp had been left behind by previous asylum seekers. One of the women said she had waited there for two days.\n\nSeeking asylum at a port of entry is legal under U.S. law, as government officials have reaffirmed this year. Trump has proposed banning people crossing illegally between ports of entry from claiming asylum \u2014 something many immigration experts say he can\u2019t do under the law.\n\nThe U.S. fielded nearly 332,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double that of two years earlier and the highest of any country in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And many asylum seekers wait for years to have their claims adjudicated, a delay criticized by administration officials and immigration lawyers alike.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions ruled in June that fleeing gang or domestic violence would generally not be considered grounds for asylum, a decision that would affect many people\u2019s claims.\n\nJodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, said she believes the government was trying to frustrate asylum seekers into giving up.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using a lot of ruse and double-speak to try to circumvent the law,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo women and three children were waiting Saturday at the center of the bridge between McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, a day after soldiers had installed concertina wire on the bridge and the riverbank below.\n\nAfter some time, an official from Mexico\u2019s migration bureau came up to the group of five and directed them off the bridge, away from U.S. customs.\n\nAssociated Press journalists followed as the official and then a private security guard led the group back into Mexico and into a migration bureau office. An employee inside the building would not let the AP interview the group, and U.S. border inspectors on the bridge declined to comment.\n\nAt the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, Alvarez continued to wait with others from all over the world: Honduras, Peru, Venezuela and Cameroon.\n\nThey insisted they will only enter peacefully and lawfully, waiting their turn at the bridge.\n\nJavier Mederos Mendez, a 44-year-old from Havana, said he was fleeing political repression because he disagreed with the ruling Castro family. He said he had flown from Cuba to South America, then crossed through jungles and violence-torn areas of Central America and Mexico to reach the bridge.\n\nHe and others had seen people drown or starve along the way.\n\nAsked what he thought of Trump\u2019s announcements about asylum, Mederos said, \u201cIt would be unfair of me to decide what is good or bad for a country.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cI will wait as long as necessary until they receive me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.", "COLUMBUS, Ga.

Stevens has been fired by the struggling Kings just 13 games into his second season in charge. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The struggling Los Angeles Kings fired head coach John Stevens on Sunday just 13 games into his second season in charge.\n\nWillie Desjardins will be the Kings\u2019 interim head coach for the rest of the regular season, general manager Rob Blake said.\n\nLos Angeles also fired assistant coach Don Nachbaur and hired former Kings forward Marco Sturm to replace him on Desjardins\u2019 staff.\n\nLos Angeles is last in the overall NHL standings after a 4-8-1 start and last in the league with 2.15 goals per game. The Kings have been outscored 45-28, but they had won two of their past three games following a six-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to get the compete and the passion back,\u201d Blake said after announcing his second coaching change in 19 months. \u201cWe need our players emotionally involved. It\u2019s difficult to win when you\u2019re not. We expect Willie to bring that passion and that excitement to this team.\u201d\n\nThe Kings beat Columbus 4-1 on Saturday in Stevens\u2019 final game in charge. Desjardins, the former Vancouver head coach, will lead practice Monday and will debut behind the bench when the Kings host rival Anaheim on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Kings still have a wealth of top-end NHL talent including Hart Trophy finalist Anze Kopitar, Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Drew Doughty and high-scoring forward Jeff Carter alongside newcomer Ilya Kovalchuk. But with goalie Jonathan Quick missing all but four games because of injuries, Los Angeles has stumbled through the past 3\u00bd weeks with its top-heavy roster of well-paid veterans, inconsistent depth players and a patchy defense.\n\n\u201cYou look at training camp and you look at the regular season to where we are now, the expectations have not been met,\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe have really good players. We have players that can make plays. We expect them to make plays, and we expect them to play with that level of compete, and it hasn\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nStevens took over in 2017 after seven years as an assistant in Los Angeles under Terry Murray and Darryl Sutter. The former Philadelphia Flyers head coach was an assistant on the Kings\u2019 Stanley Cup-winning teams in 2012 and 2014.\n\nStevens\u2019 promotion was an attempt to create a new mentality for the Kings while maintaining some continuity to Sutter, whose grinding style of hockey won the only two Stanley Cup titles in franchise history. Sutter\u2019s coaching and former general manager Dean Lombardi\u2019s clever moves won two championships, but also left the Kings with a relatively slow, veteran-laden roster that struggled to compete consistently in the speed-based NHL after 2014.\n\nThe Kings went 45-29-8 in Stevens\u2019 debut last season, finishing fourth in the Pacific Division and getting swept by Vegas in the first round of the playoffs. Stevens went 51-39-9 overall in Los Angeles, including four games as the Kings\u2019 interim head coach in the 2011-12 season between the tenures of Murray and Sutter.\n\nEverything went wrong quickly for Stevens, although Blake said he saw concerns from training camp onward. After adding Kovalchuk as a free agent last summer, Los Angeles got off to its awful start this fall while playing largely without Quick and forward Dustin Brown, who were both out with injuries for long stretches.\n\nQuick is currently out for several weeks after undergoing knee surgery, leaving inexperienced Jack Campbell as Los Angeles\u2019 top goalie. The Los Angeles farm system\u2019s inability to produce above-average players in recent years has dramatically thinned the big-league club\u2019s depth and competitiveness, but the Kings\u2019 top-end talent isn\u2019t producing its share either, according to Blake.\n\n\u201cWe have some real good players,\u201d Blake said. \u201cWe need them playing at a higher level. It\u2019s been an issue this season that we haven\u2019t had everyone going the right direction. (That\u2019s) partly the reason for this change.\u201d\n\nBlake said he has no long-standing connections with Desjardins, the Canucks\u2019 head coach from 2014-17. After Vancouver missed the playoffs in his final two seasons, Desjardins coached the Canadian men\u2019s national team to bronze medals at the Pyeongchang Olympics last February.\n\nThe Kings clearly also think highly of Sturm, whose 14-year NHL playing career included 17 games with the Kings. He has been the head coach of the German national team since 2015, leading his nation to a silver medal in Pyeongchang.\n\nThe 40-year-old Sturm will spend one more week coaching Germany in the Deutschland Cup before reporting to Los Angeles. Blake said the Kings chose Sturm because of his \u201cnew generational coaching style\u201d and his skills in \u201cplayer relations.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "IRONDALE, Ala.

He doesn\u2019t even follow NASCAR closely anymore.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m so invested in it and it\u2019s been so close to me, I don\u2019t think I can follow without wanting to participate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would impossible for me. I try not to pay too much attention. ... If I\u2019m going to follow it every week and do all of that, I might as well come, and then I might as well drive, and then you\u2019re right back into it.\u201d\n\nEdwards earned 28 Cup victories in 445 starts from 2004-16, with top 10 finishes in nearly half of those races (220). He was in the top four of the NASCAR playoff chase five times, including his last season when he came 10 laps way from winning the title. His best were runner-up finishes in 2008 and 2011.\n\nHis visit to Texas, only the second time he\u2019s been at a NASCAR track during a race weekend the past two seasons, came when he joined IndyCar driver Helio Castroneves for their inductions Saturday into the Texas Motor Speedway Hall of Fame.\n\nEdwards won four Cup races at Texas, matching Bristol as the tracks where he got his most wins.\n\nAs for driving again, Edwards said he has the feeling \u201csomething will come up that will be really, really fun and natural to go do, and I\u2019ll drive a little bit more. But definitely I\u2019m not going to sign a three-year contract to go run for a Cup championship.\u201d\n\nHe misses road courses, and has spoken to some people about doing testing on those. There could be some dirt track or late model racing.\n\nBut NASCAR teams are no longer even calling him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of conversations with people, but none in the last year or so,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI think everyone pretty much understands that I\u2019m not really interested in coming back and doing anything too serious right now.

It is great times at the moment.\u201d\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s other game, second-place Chelsea breezed past Crystal Palace 3-1 at Stamford Bridge.\n\nCITY SLICKERS\n\nCity needed only five minutes to take the lead against Southampton, Wesley Hoedt putting through his own net following a neat move involving Aguero, David Silva and Leroy Sane.\n\nSterling then quickly laid on the second as Aguero became the ninth player to reach the landmark of 150 Premier League goals.\n\nIt was proving a nightmare return for Southampton manager Mark Hughes, who was in charge at City between 2008-09, as his side conceded a third goal when Sterling supplied a cross and David Silva lashed the ball home.\n\nSouthampton, without a win in six league games, replied in the 29th when Danny Ings was brought down in the box and picked himself up to stroke the penalty past goalkeeper Ederson.\n\nBut City restored its three-goal cushion on the stroke of halftime with Aguero taking advantage of a mistake by Cedric Soares and crossing for Sterling to get his fifth league goal of the season.\n\nSterling added his second of the game midway through the second half before Sane completed the rout in stoppage time.\n\n\u201cWe played excellently without, and especially with, the ball,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe were aggressive in the final third, but we were lucky to score the goal in the last minute of the first half.

(AP) \u2014 Californians will help determine which party controls the U.S. House, choose a successor for the state\u2019s longest serving governor, and weigh in on ballot measures to repeal a tax increase and expand rent control in this year\u2019s midterm election.\n\nCandidates made their final pitches Sunday as campaign volunteers furiously worked to make sure their voters show up at the polls or postmark their ballots.\n\nIt\u2019s California\u2019s fourth election since voters adopted a primary system that allows two candidates of the same party to face off.\n\nThat\u2019s produced contests between two Democrats in a handful of federal and state races, showcasing the party\u2019s dominance over Republicans in the nation\u2019s most populous state.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know ahead of Tuesday:\n\nWHO VOTES, AND WHEN\n\nMore than 19.6 million Californians are registered to vote. That\u2019s about 78 percent of eligible voters, the highest percentage of registered voters in a midterm election since 1950.\n\nMost California voters \u2014 more than 13 million \u2014 received mail-in ballots and more than 3 million people had cast them as of Friday, according to county data compiled by the non-partisan Political Data, Inc.\n\nRepublican, older and white voters are more likely to vote early.\n\nAs the election gets close, though, voters younger than 50 are returning early ballots at a higher rate than they did during the primary.\n\nThat\u2019s also true in Orange County south of Los Angeles, one of the biggest battlegrounds for the U.S. House.\n\nThat could be a good sign for Democrats hoping for a \u201cblue wave,\u201d said Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data.\n\nHOW THE COUNT WORKS\n\nAs long as California ballots are post-marked by Election Day and received by Friday, they will be counted.\n\nBut because so many voters cast ballots by mail, it takes weeks for every ballot to be counted.\n\nThat means the outcome of close races may not be known until well after Election Day.\n\nDepending on how Democrats fare in the rest of the country, the nation could end up waiting on California to learn which party takes control of the U.S. House.\n\nORANGE COUNTY\n\nOrange County is experiencing an unusual amount of pre-election buzz and activity from Democrats, reflecting its importance as a national battleground for the U.S. House.\n\nU.S. Sen.

Dianne Feinstein planned to bring her re-election bid to the city of Irvine on Sunday night alongside gun control activists from Parkland, Florida, but cancelled due to a cold, her campaign manager Jeff Millman said. Her opponent, state Sen.

A handful of voters waited to cast ballots early in the morning, with some saying they wanted to vote early to be sure their vote counted and avoid any Election Day lines.\n\nTHE GOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate John Cox offered a California-themed take on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan while speaking to supporters in Sacramento. He promised to make California \u201caffordable and livable again\u201d and to make it \u201cgolden again,\u201d a play on the state\u2019s nickname the Golden State.\n\nCox has made California\u2019s high housing costs and high poverty rate a central theme of his campaign. He was joined in Sacramento by Republican U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock who is expected to hold his seat, and Republican Andrew Grant, who is seeking to oust Democratic U.S. Rep. Ami Bera. The three rolled in on a green campaign bus emblazoned with Cox\u2019s slogan \u201cHelp is on the way,\u201d with voters waiting in lawn chairs and waving signs.\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, spoke at a barbecue organized by a Los Angeles labor organization where volunteers made phone calls to voters.\n\nHe told the crowd that Los Angeles\u2019 and California\u2019s diversity is its strength.\n\nHe\u2019s driving across the state on a blue campaign bus with the word \u201cVOTE\u201d on one side and his slogan \u201cCourage for a change\u201d on the other.

Dana Rohrabacher; and Katie Hill, Rep. Steve Knight\u2019s opponent.\n\nMore than $367 million has poured into campaigns to support and defeat the 11 measures on California\u2019s ballot, which include eliminating restrictions on rent control, requiring cage-free eggs, and spending billions on affordable housing and homelessness prevention.\n\nProposition 8, which would cap the profits of dialysis companies, is by far the most expensive, with dialysis companies contributing $111 million in opposition. That\u2019s the most raised on any one side of a ballot measure in the U.S. since at least 2002. A whopping $67 million of it comes from the Denver-based DaVita Inc.\n\nThe battle over rent control, Proposition 10, is the second most expensive \u2014 with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation\u2019s $25 million versus $76 million from the real estate industry.\n\nProposition 6, the gas-tax repeal, features a lopsided spending battle.

In some of the more competitive races, results may not be known for days as counties update vote counts throughout the week.\n\nMoney has poured into the state against Initiative 1631, which would charge large carbon emitters\u2019 fees on fossil fuels used or sold in the state or electricity generated within the state starting in 2020. Opponents have raised more than $31 million, mostly from oil companies, a state record for statewide initiatives.\n\nVoters will also decide the fate of I-1639, which toughens background checks for people buying semi-automatic rifles, increases the age limit to 21 for buyers of those guns and adds firearm storage provisions.\n\nInitiative 1634, backed by the soda industry, would prohibit local governments from imposing new taxes on soda or grocery items.\n\nInitiative 940 is a measure designed to improve police training in de-escalation tactics and eliminate a requirement that prosecutors prove officers acted with malice to get a conviction in negligent shootings.\n\nAmong the congressional races, the hotly contested open seat in the 8th Congressional District has been one of the costliest in the nation as Democrats see a potential pickup that could help determine control of the U.S. House. Dr. Kim Schrier, a Democrat and pediatrician, and Republican Dino Rossi, a former state senator who had previous unsuccessful runs for governor and the U.S. Senate, are vying to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert, who is retiring after more than a decade.\n\nIncumbents are seeking re-election in the other nine U.S. House races, though national attention is focused on three key races including the 8th. In the 5th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Cathy McMorris Rodgers faces Democrat Lisa Brown, a former chancellor of Washington State University who previously served as majority leader in the state Senate.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District, Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is facing a strong challenge from Democrat Carolyn Long, a political science professor at Washington State University\u2019s campus in Vancouver.\n\nIn the race for U.S. Senate, former state GOP chairwoman Susan Hutchison is challenging Democratic Sen.

Bunko.\n\nThe development is \u201can extremely good sign,\u201d Bunko said, adding that the academy is \u201cgrateful for the outpouring of support and optimistic for Aurora\u2019s recovery.\u201d\n\nThe falcon will continue to be evaluated and will get antibiotics to prevent infection, Bunko said.\n\nArmy officials at West Point apologized Sunday for the injuries to the falcon and promised a full investigation.\n\n\u201cWe are taking this situation very seriously, and this occurrence does not reflect the Army or USMA core values of dignity and respect,\u201d the academy said in a statement.\n\nSam Dollar, Air Force\u2019s falconry team adviser, told The New York Times on Sunday that two West Point cadets took the birds, threw sweaters over them and stuffed them into dog crates. Dollar said the cadets turned over the birds Saturday morning, with Aurora\u2019s wings bloodied \u2014 likely from thrashing inside the crate.\n\n\u201cI think they had them for a couple hours and then they realized it was a bad mistake,\u201d Dollar told the newspaper. \u201cWhen Aurora started thrashing around in the crate, they decided that wasn\u2019t a good thing.\u201d\n\nAurora is the Air Force Academy\u2019s official and oldest mascot. On the school\u2019s falconry page, the bird is described as a white phase gyrfalcon, which is a \u201cfalcon species that is extremely rare in the wild and whose beauty will take your breath away.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you are federally licensed, you can\u2019t even touch them,\u201d Dollar said, adding the Air Force cadets who work with the birds spend two months in training and are tested before they can handle them.\n\nThree percent of all falcons are gyrfalcons, and 1 percent of those are white, according to the website. The school acquired Aurora 22 years ago as a gift from the association of graduates.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - This combination of March 8, 2018 file photos shows California gubernatorial candidates, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, left, a Democrat and John Cox, a Republican, in Sacramento, Calif. The candidates oppose each other on a variety of issues including health care, immigration and gasoline taxes. (AP Photos/Rich Pedroncelli, file)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California\u2019s race for governor pits Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and former San Francisco mayor, against Republican businessman John Cox. Here\u2019s a look at where they stand on issues that have shaped the race:\n\nGAS TAX REPEAL (Proposition 6)\n\nLawmakers and outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown last year raised gas taxes by 12 cents to 41.7 cents per gallon and vehicle registration fees by $25 to $175 per year to pay for road repairs.\n\nCox is chairman of the group that collected signatures asking voters to repeal it. He has made rolling back the increases \u2014 and requiring voter approval for any future hikes \u2014 a centerpiece of a campaign focused on reducing taxes and regulations.\n\nNewsom supports the gas tax increase, saying repeal would end critical road construction happening across the state and take away the jobs that accompany them.\n\n___\n\nOTHER TAXES\n\nCox says high taxes are crippling California and contributing to a high cost of living that drives people to more affordable states. He\u2019d like to reduce the income tax and overall state spending, but acknowledged that\u2019s unlikely to happen with Democrats controlling the Legislature.\n\nNewsom says he\u2019ll begin a long-term process to reform the state\u2019s notoriously volatile tax code, which leads the state budget to mirror the stock market\u2019s boom and bust cycles. California\u2019s income tax rate is too high and not competitive with other states in the West, he says.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our economy is not taxed, and as a consequence we are very indulgent in taxing the remaining part of our economy,\u201d Newsom told The Associated Press.\n\nNewsom declined to say whether he\u2019d like to add a sales tax on services or had other ideas in mind, saying \u201cI want to put everything on the table.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nUnder Brown and his predecessor, Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, California has pursued aggressive efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nNewsom supports those policies, including a goal of generating 100 percent of energy from clean sources, and pledges to continue them.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has a responsibility, has an important international role to play,\u201d he said in the lone debate with Cox.\n\nIn a contrast with Brown, Newsom opposes hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial method of extracting oil and gas.\n\nCox has expressed doubt about the extent to which humans contribute to climate change but doesn\u2019t go any deeper, saying he\u2019s not a scientist. And he questions the expense attached to the aggressive policies.\n\n\u201cAre we getting enough of an impact on the world\u2019s atmosphere to justify the cost to the people of this state?\u201d Cox asked at the same debate.\n\n___\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nNewsom advocates policies that help immigrants living illegally in California, including expanded public benefits and legal defenses against deportation. He also wants comprehensive immigration reform at the federal level and opposes building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cImmigration has advanced the economy of this state in profound and pronounced ways,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nCox frequently blasts California\u2019s \u201csanctuary state\u201d law that restricts cooperation between law enforcement and federal immigration authorities \u2014 a policy Newsom supports. He supports building the border wall and calls for more aggressive immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live next to MS-13 and I don\u2019t think any of us do,\u201d Cox said earlier this year, referring to a violent gang formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by El Salvadoran immigrants.\n\n___\n\nDONALD TRUMP\n\nAfter trying to distance himself from Trump early in the race, Cox embraced the president and was rewarded with a series of laudatory tweets that helped him consolidate support among Republicans and finish second in the June primary to secure a ballot slot in the general election.\n\nTrump never came to California to campaign for Cox, who has walked a tightrope during his race against Newsom \u2014 staying close enough to the president to satisfy Republicans who back Trump but not so close to alienate independents he needs to attract to win. He notes he and Trump are successful businessmen looking to bring their talents to politics and praised Trump for the strong economy, but said \u201cI\u2019m running my own campaign here.\u201d\n\nNewsom, meanwhile, abhors Trump and pledges to continue California\u2019s efforts to stymie the president\u2019s agenda. Brown has helped lead California\u2019s strong opposition to Trump policies, challenging environmental, immigration and other policies in court and finding ways to thwart them under state law.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nNewsom backed a California Nurses Association proposal this session to eliminate insurance companies and give everyone state-funded health coverage. It was blocked in the Assembly but it\u2019s become a rallying cry and litmus test for many voters on the left.\n\nNewsom said he\u2019s studying international models and promises to aggressively pursue something that would work in California to achieve \u201cuniversal health care, regardless of pre-existing condition, ability to pay and immigration status.\u201d\n\nCox is adamantly opposed to a government-run health care system, which he says would lead to long wait times, massive tax increases and a system controlled by health care lobbyists.\n\nHe\u2019s been less specific about what he\u2019d change with California\u2019s health care system but makes clear he opposes more government intervention and providing coverage to immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\n___\n\nHOUSING\n\nNewsom has pledged to build 3.5 million new housing units by 2025. That\u2019s the number experts say is needed to catch up with current needs and keep pace with demand. Critics say it\u2019s unrealistic in a state that has never built so many homes so fast. He also calls for building more subsidized housing.\n\nCox notes that it\u2019s significantly cheaper to build homes in Indiana, where he owns more than a dozen apartment complexes, than in California. He pledges to get rid of strict regulations that he says drive up the cost of construction and to reform the California Environmental Quality Act, which critics say is abused by development opponents to block new construction or delay it through years of lawsuits. CEQA, as it\u2019s known, requires local governments to identify and mitigate environmental harms from construction projects.\n\nBoth candidates oppose Proposition 10, a ballot measure that would pave the way for expanded rent control. Opponents say it would lower real estate values, further decreasing the state\u2019s housing supply by discouraging construction.\n\n___\n\nBULLET TRAIN\n\nCox opposes the state\u2019s largest infrastructure project \u2014 a high-speed rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco. He\u2019s blasted the project for significant cost overruns and setbacks and pledged to end \u201cthe crazy train\u201d championed by Brown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted billions on this job,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone the minute I am governor.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s position on the train has shifted. He joined with then-Gov. Schwarzenegger to campaign for voter-approved bonds to help finance the project in 2008. Years later, with costs skyrocketing, he questioned whether it was the best use of the money.\n\nNow, he says he supports the project but is concerned there\u2019s no plan in place to raise much of the estimated $77 billion cost.\n\n___\n\nWATER\n\nCox says California needs more reservoirs and other storage facilities, which he says are vital for California\u2019s massive agriculture industry and will be a priority if he\u2019s elected.\n\nHe has blasted a plan by state water officials to increase flows on the lower San Joaquin River to save salmon and other fish but that would deliver less to farmers in the Central Valley.\n\nNewsom says he\u2019d look to expand the adoption of technologies that reduce water use, such as drip irrigation and remote sensors to ensure fields and yards don\u2019t use more water than they need. He\u2019s also talked up water recycling and replenishing groundwater.\n\nCox opposes a plan, strongly backed by Brown, to build two massive tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta to remake the system of delivering water from Northern to Southern California. Newsom says he\u2019d prefer to see the $17 billion project scaled back.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Girl Scouts sing as hundreds of community members turn out in the rain Sunday evening, Nov. 4, 2018, for a candlelight vigil at Halmstad Elementary School in Chippewa Falls, Wis., in remembrance of three fourth grade Girl Scouts and a parent who died Saturday, after being struck by a pickup truck while their troop was picking up trash along a rural highway.

(AP) \u2014 After 20 years of making an impact, a famous bird of prey is retiring in Minnesota.\n\nAlice will be retiring in Houston, where she lives with her caretaker Karla Bloem, who founded the International Festival of Owls and the International Owl Center, the Winona Daily News reported .\n\nThe city of Houston hired Bloem in 1996 to develop plans for a nature center.

(AP Photo/Otto Kitsinger, File)\n\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Idaho voters will elect a new governor, decide who will be their U.S. representatives and make decisions on a pair of initiatives about expanding Medicaid and gambling.\n\nA ballot initiative called Proposition 1 seeking to legalize historical horse racing devices that opponents say are the equivalent of illegal slot machines has drawn millions of dollars both for and against the measure ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nProposition 2 would expand Medicaid to an estimated 62,000 working Idaho residents believed to be in a gap population that earns too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to qualify for insurance subsidies. It got a late boost last week when Idaho Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter announced his endorsement in television ads.\n\nIn the race to replace Otter, Democrat Paulette Jordan is vying to become the first woman and first Native American governor. She faces a tough challenge in Lt. Gov. Brad Little, a southwestern Idaho rancher.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what\u2019s on the ballot:\n\n___\n\nPROP 1\n\nAn initiative seeking to legalize historical horse race betting devices that opponents say are slot machines in disguise is in the home stretch in what could be a close race.\n\nThe initiative, if passed, would allow historical horse racing machines at places that have a minimum of eight days of live horse racing. Backers, who have spent more than $3 million in advertising, say the machines will save live horse racing in the state.\n\nOpponents say the devices are the equivalent of slot machines.\n\nMore than $3 million has been spent to defeat the measure, mainly by the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe, which has a casino in Worley with slot machines that could face competition.\n\n___\n\nPROP 2\n\nThis initiative, if passed, would expand Medicaid to an estimated 62,000 working Idahoans believed to be in a gap population that earns too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for insurance subsidies.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid while states pick up the rest. Backers say the initiative would save Idaho $400 million in the first year. Otter gave the initiative his backing last week.\n\nThe primary argument against expansion has been that accepting federal dollars only comes with regulatory burdens that do not help lower the growing costs of medical care.\n\n___\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nRepublican Lt. Gov. Brad Little, a rancher who has been in elected office for the past 16 years, is trying to defeat Democrat Paulette Jordan, a former lawmaker and member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribal Council who if elected would become the first woman and first Native American governor of the state. Both seek to replace Otter, who has served three-consecutive four-year terms as the state\u2019s chief executive.\n\nLittle is a longtime Republican lawmaker who has served as lieutenant governor since 2009. Little has said that his priorities for the office will be ensuring that Idaho residents have access to good jobs, a good education system, affordable health care and that he will work to \u201cprotect our quality of life.\u201d Little says expanding Medicaid is not his first choice, but if voters approve Proposition 2 he\u2019ll work with lawmakers to implement it.\n\nJordan said state leaders have failed to adequately fund public education and that she would increase public school funding by saving elsewhere, particularly by stopping out-of-state prison spending and by expanding Medicaid, which she said would save $400 million in the first year.\n\n___\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nDemocrat Kristin Collum, an Army veteran and software engineer who describes herself as a moderate willing to collaborate with both sides for \u201cTeam Idaho,\u201d is facing former state Rep.

They\u2019re running to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador who opted to run for governor, but lost in the primary.\n\nFulcher and McNeil have starkly different ideas on environmental regulations, health care and immigration.\n\nFulcher says families have been disenfranchised by regulations that limited logging and mining, and that has led to forest overgrowth and catastrophic wildfires. McNeil said that Fulcher as a state legislator worked to give control over resources like property owners\u2019 mineral rights to special interests.\n\n___\n\n2nd CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nDemocrat Aaron Swisher, who holds degrees in economics and finance, faces a tough task in trying to unseat 10-term incumbent Mike Simpson, a Republican and powerful House member.\n\nSimpson wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which he said will create more competition among health care providers. Swisher said he supports the Affordable Care Act and a single-payer health care system.\n\nOn climate change, Swisher said he\u2019s in favor of solar and wind energy while also using a carbon tax to cut back on carbon-based fuels.

Wilson is a longtime classroom teacher who has served on the state Board of Correction and Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter\u2019s education task force.\n\nThe state remains far from its goal of having at least 60 percent of young adults obtaining a college degree or career training certificate, and Ybarra and Wilson differed on their solutions. Wilson said increased early childhood education is the key. Ybarra said research shows early childhood education pays off, but programs shouldn\u2019t be mandated by the state.\n\nYbarra says that under her leadership, graduation rates are up, educator pay is improving, and high school students can get a jump start by earning college credits.\n\nWilson said that during Ybarra\u2019s tenure, Hispanic, Native American and impoverished children have fallen behind, with a 25 percent achievement gap between those populations and other Idaho students.\n\n___\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nIncumbent Republican Lawerence Denney, a farmer from Midvale, faces Democrat Jill Humble, a registered nurse and mental health counselor.\n\nWhere the two candidates differ most is on trying to balance ease of voting and higher voter turnout with making sure ballots are secure and limiting opportunities for voter fraud.\n\nHumble favors mail-in voting because states that have it see greater voter turnout.

I didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d Siefarth said as he was walking in downtown Salem. \u201cBut since he\u2019s been in office, I think the conservatives are doing some things that are moving the country in the right direction.\u201d\n\nSiefarth voted for Buehler, feeling he could do more on tackling issues like homelessness.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time at least to give the Republican party in Oregon an opportunity, to see what they can do,\u201d Siefarth said.\n\nWith Oregon facing an unfunded liability of $22 billion in its pension system, Buehler says he\u2019d seek cuts in state and local government employees\u2019 pension plan and health benefits.\n\nOnline campaign ads for Brown have gone after Buehler on that point, featuring public employees like teachers and firefighters saying Buehler would cut their retirement pay, making it harder to recruit and retain qualified people.\n\nA lot more voters are deciding who will be governor this time around.\n\nDue to Oregon\u2019s \u201cmotor voter\u201d program, in which people obtaining or renew drivers licenses are automatically registered to vote, voter registration rose by 24 percent from 2,068,798 in 2010 to 2,731,048 in 2018. People don\u2019t have to declare party affiliation at the DMV, which has increased the number of unaffiliated voters. It is those unaffiliated voters who might be the decisive factor in the race.\n\nEarly voter turnout was record high, even though the percent of those voting early roughly equaled the percentage seen in the last midterm elections because of population growth and increased voter registration.\n\nBrown said she\u2019s confident a large Democratic turnout - and Independent Party candidate Patrick Starnes dropping out and endorsing her last week - will translate into victory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about the level of enthusiasm on the ground,\u201d Brown said.\n\nShe rejects Buehler\u2019s characterization of himself.\n\n\u201cHis track record is not that of a moderate Republican,\u201d Brown said, noting that he opposed legislation that expanded Medicaid coverage to children who are in the United States illegally and that he supports repealing Oregon\u2019s sanctuary state law.\n\nBuehler believes that enough voters are upset with Oregon\u2019s dismal record on education - it\u2019s among the last in the nation in graduation rates - and the pension debt that it will carry him on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Gillian Flaccus in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A former contract worker for the Chicago Public Schools has been charged with illegally downloading employees\u2019 personal data.\n\nCook County Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Tom Simpson says Kristi Sims of Hickory Hills conducted background checks on district employees.

LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Missouri voters on Tuesday will consider a ballot measure that supporters say would make state government more ethical. Constitutional Amendment 1, the so-called \u201cClean Missouri\u201d proposal, aims to replace Missouri\u2019s system for drawing state legislative districts with a model designed to have the number of seats won by each party more closely reflect its statewide vote.\n\nHere are the key provisions of Amendment 1:\n\n___\n\nSTATE DEMOGRAPHER:\n\nCurrently, state House and Senate districts in Missouri are redrawn after each census by bipartisan commissions. Members are appointed by the governor from nominees submitted by the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAmendment 1 would create a new position of nonpartisan state demographer who would propose maps to commissioners that reflect the parties\u2019 share of the statewide vote in previous elections for president, governor and U.S. senator. Criteria of \u201cpartisan fairness\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d would outrank more traditional criteria such as geographically compact districts.\n\n___\n\nLOBBYIST INFLUENCE:\n\nThe ballot proposal would prohibit lawmakers from accepting gifts worth more than $5 from lobbyists. It would require lawmakers to wait two years after the end of their last term before becoming lobbyists.\n\n___\n\nRULES FOR LAWMAKERS, CANDIDATES:\n\nAmendment 1 would make lawmakers subject to the state open-records law. It would prohibit legislative candidates from raising political money on state property.\n\nCampaign contribution limits for legislative candidates would be lowered slightly, from the current $2,600 for all candidates to $2,500 for Senate candidates and $2,000 for House candidates.\n\n___\n\nSUPPORTERS:\n\nBackers of the proposal say the goal is to prevent partisan gerrymandering, and Missouri isn\u2019t alone in seeking to reform the process. Measures also are on the ballot in Colorado, Michigan and Utah, though each state\u2019s details vary. However, each has received funding from a little-known organization bankrolled by a Texas billionaire couple, John and Laura Arnold. Their Action Now group has poured $7.7 million into the redistricting campaigns, accounting for one of every four dollars raised by groups backing the ballot measures, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.\n\nThe enhanced attention to the drawing of legislative district lines comes as Democrats and Republicans alike are trying to position themselves to take charge of the task after the 2020 Census.\n\nThe campaign for the Missouri initiative is run by a Democratic consultant and has received money from groups that typically back Democrats, including a $250,000 donation from billionaire and progressive activist George Soros through the lobbying arm of Soros\u2019 philanthropic network. That, and support from groups representing labor, teachers, abortion-rights and other left-leaning causes has led some Republicans to cast Clean Missouri as a partisan effort to help Democrats gain ground against GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate.\n\n___\n\nOPPONENTS:\n\nAmendment 1 survived a court battle after Republican-aligned attorneys claimed it violated the state constitution by addressing multiple topics.\n\nA state judge agreed, but a panel of the Western District Court of Appeals ruled in September that the \u201cmultiple provisions all relate to a single central purpose: regulating the legislature to limit the influence of partisan or other special interests.\u201d\n\nThe initiative was opposed in court by the president of the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a Republican voter who was represented by the law firm of Missouri Republican Party Chairman Todd Graves. Graves said voters may believe they\u2019re voting for ethics reform, but they\u2019re really considering \u201ca radical change in the way that we draw legislative districts.\u201d", "HARTSELLE, Ala.

Installing a wall also would have a low impact on marine life, and minimize the coastal footprint and impact on coastal processes.\n\nThe rock revetment is estimated to cost $3.4 million to $6 million and offers the same protection as the seawall. It would require a wider footprint.\n\nA managed retreat inland would require a feasibility study because it could cost the county anywhere from $20 million to $25 million to purchase and condemn private lands. Utilities would need to be moved, and residents on Puamana Place would need to find a different entry way.\n\nIf the county were to do nothing, the lower road would likely be reduced to a one-lane road and eventually convert into a pedestrian and bike road, Ono said.

(AP) \u2014 A push by Democrats to flip a Republican-held congressional seat that represents the Little Rock area and a state Supreme Court race that has drawn heavy spending by a conservative interest group have drawn the most attention in Arkansas\u2019 midterm election.\n\nThe campaigns for the 2nd Congressional District and state Supreme Court seats became increasingly bitter and expensive in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election, especially from outside groups that have been airing attack ads and sending mailers. The races have overshadowed an election in which Democrats face long odds of making gains in the solidly Republican state.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office hasn\u2019t predicted how many of Arkansas\u2019 nearly 1.8 million registered voters will cast ballots in the election, but more than 350,000 had voted early through Friday.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the top races:\n\nFLIPPABLE SEAT?\n\nRepublicans have a solid hold on Arkansas\u2019 four U.S. House seats and President Donald Trump easily won the state two years ago, but Democrats believe they have a chance to flip a Little Rock-area district by focusing on the incumbent\u2019s vote to repeal the federal health care law.\n\nDemocrat Clarke Tucker is trying to unseat two-term Republican Rep. French Hill in the 2nd Congressional District, which represents Little Rock and seven surrounding counties. Tucker is a state legislator who regularly talks about his battle with bladder cancer and his support for the Affordable Care Act, especially its protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHill has run a series of ads attacking Tucker by trying to tie him to national Democratic figures such as Nancy Pelosi and portraying him as soft on immigration. Both candidates condemned a political action committee\u2019s pro-Hill radio ad that suggested Democrats would lynch black people if they won the midterm election.\n\nCOURT FIGHT\n\nAn Arkansas Supreme Court justice\u2019s re-election fight is a repeat of the spring campaign, with an outside group spending heavily to defeat her and facing a lawsuit from her over its attack ads. Justice Courtney Goodson is running against David Sterling, an attorney for the state Department of Human Services, in the non-partisan race.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday rejected Goodson\u2019s request to halt attack ads and mailers from a Washington-based group. Goodson had sued the Washington-based Republican State Leadership Committee, which has spent $1.2 million in recent weeks attacking her or promoting Sterling, to try and stop the group\u2019s ads and mailers, which she says are defamatory and misleading.\n\nREPUBLICANS FAVORED\n\nRepublicans are in a strong position to sweep Arkansas\u2019 seven partisan statewide offices, as well as the other three congressional districts.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson faces a longshot challenge from Democrat Jared Henderson, a former Teach for America executive. Hutchinson has touted the more than $150 million in tax cuts he has signed into law since taking office and his proposal to cut taxes further next year. Henderson has criticized Hutchinson over the state\u2019s work requirement for its Medicaid expansion program.\n\nIn east Arkansas\u2019 1st Congressional District, Republican Rep.

An eviction hearing is also set for Friday in Vernon Superior Court.\n\nPurtill argues in court documents that Cook has refused to vacate the property, despite a probate court judge\u2019s order from 2017 that stripped him of the role of executor of his wife\u2019s will and ended the life tenancy bestowed on him in it.\n\nCook argues in court documents that his tenancy can\u2019t simply be revoked by a judge\u2019s order.

Voters in Colorado will consider a proposal to tightly restrict where new oil and gas wells can be drilled in the state in the election on Tuesday, Nov. 6. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Coloradans are mulling whether to tightly restrict where new oil and gas wells can be drilled, with Tuesday\u2019s vote marking the latest chapter in a long, bitter and expensive debate that could have a ripple effect in other energy rich states.\n\nProposition 112 requires that new wells be at least 2,500 feet (750 meters) from occupied buildings and \u201cvulnerable areas\u201d such as parks, creeks and irrigation canals. It also allows local governments to require even longer setbacks.\n\nThe state, which ranks seventh in the nation in domestic oil production and fifth in natural gas production, currently requires setbacks of 500 feet (150 meters) from homes and 1,000 feet (300 meters) from high-occupancy buildings such as hospitals and schools.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the intent of this ballot measure is to ban oil and gas development in the state,\u201d said Karen Crummy, a spokeswoman for the industry funded group Protect Colorado. \u201cThere\u2019s no proof that a 2,500-foot setback would have any greater protection than we have now. It\u2019s kind of a number they picked out of a hat.\u201d\n\nAnalysts with the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates the industry, say the measure will put about 85 percent of non-federal land in the state off-limits to drilling and will prevent energy development on large swaths along the Front Range urban corridor \u2014 a conclusion supporters of the proposal say is overstated and misleading.\n\nThe proposal doesn\u2019t apply to federal land, which makes up about 36 percent of the state.\n\nProtect Colorado, which has raised nearly $38 million in the fight compared to only about $1 million by the proposition\u2019s supporters, warns that if it passes, other businesses that rely on the oil and gas industry \u2014 from restaurants to construction companies to hotels \u2014 also will take a hit.\n\nA consortium of business groups released a study in July concluding that by 2030, there would be up to 147,800 fewer jobs in Colorado, up to $1.1 billion in lost tax revenue for state and local governments and up to $141 billion in lost oil and gas production if the measure passes.\n\nBut the dire warnings didn\u2019t stop backers from collecting an estimated 123,000 valid signatures to put the proposal on the ballot. They argue bigger setbacks will better protect people and the environment and will give property owners more certainty about the location of new wells.\n\nAnne Lee Foster with the group Colorado Rising said the predicted effect on jobs is \u201cgrossly overestimated,\u201d and the state report concluding that most non-federal land would be off limits doesn\u2019t account for directional drilling.\n\nDirectional drilling, which is often more difficult and expensive, involves boring underground horizontally and could be used to access pockets of gas from beyond a setback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a ban. It\u2019s not going to shut down the industry. They\u2019ll still be able to extract minerals,\u201d said Foster, noting that Colorado has about 55,000 active wells that are not affected by the proposal. \u201cThe numbers are wildly exaggerated. It\u2019s scare tactics to avoid even the simplest of safety regulations.\u201d\n\nShe points to an analysis by Peter Maniloff, an assistant professor of economics at Colorado School of Mines who studies energy and environmental policy. Maniloff concluded that 42 percent of non-federal lands would still be available for new drilling if the proposition passes, assuming operators could drill up to a mile horizontally from any location.\n\nProposition 112 is the result of seven years of work that included organizing at the state and local level, lawsuits, several failed attempts to get the issue of the ballot and a trip to the Colorado Supreme Court. It gained traction as more and more people moved into once isolated areas dotted by wells and crisscrossed by pipelines, and some analysts say the newfound momentum could bleed into other states that also are dealing with similar conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some of those states that maybe move a little more purple \u2014 the Ohios and Pennsylvanias out there versus Texas \u2014 might be looking at this a little more or seeing the potential for these types of issues to arise,\u201d said Tanya Heikkila, a University of Colorado-Denver professor who has been studying the oil and gas industry for about six years.\n\nShe added that national environmental groups are likely paying close attention to what happens Tuesday and thinking about how to push for similar limits in other states, especially where oil and gas walks up against urban areas.\n\n\u2014 AMENDMENT 74\n\nColorado voters also are considering a companion measure backed by the oil and gas industry that would make it easier for property owners to seek compensation from the government for actions that diminish their property\u2019s value.\n\nSupporters argue that Amendment 74 could be used if expanded setbacks prevent drilling for oil and gas. But critics warned it would unleash litigation involving a wide variety of claims, including zoning changes, and taxpayers would have to foot the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like anything government does that could potentially impact the value of someone\u2019s property, they would have a case to request compensation for that,\u201d said Heikkila, who describe the possible passage of the amendment as a political nightmare. \u201cThis could be the full-employment law for property lawyers.\u201d\n\nHeikkila initially thought neither of the initiatives would pass, but seeing the intensity of the television ads and the politics on both sides, she said, \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s a coin toss at this point.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Man with history of trespassing on UNM campus is arrested\n\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Democrats, the midterm elections have been a beacon in the dark, a chance to re-emerge from the political wilderness and repudiate a president they view as a dangerous force.\n\nBut on the cusp of Tuesday\u2019s vote, many Democrats are as anxious as they are hopeful.\n\nTheir memories from 2016, when they watched in disbelief as Donald Trump defied polls, expectations and political norms, are still fresh. And as Trump travels the country armed with a divisive and racially charged closing campaign message, the test for Democrats now feels at once similar and more urgent than it did two years ago: They failed to stop Trump then, what if they fall short again?\n\n\u201cPart of what\u2019s at stake here is our ability to send a message that this is not who we are,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing 2016 campaign.\n\nThis year, history is on Democrats\u2019 side. The sitting president\u2019s party often losing ground in the first midterm after winning office, and for much of 2018, voter enthusiasm and polling has favored Democrats as well.\n\nPrimary contests filled the Democratic roster with a new generation of candidates, including several minority candidates who could make history in their races. While the fight to regain control of the Senate, largely playing out in conservative states, may prove out of reach for Democrats, the party has been buoyed by its ability to run competitively in Republican-leaning states such as Texas and Tennessee.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 focus is largely on snatching back the House and picking up governors\u2019 seats in Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere. The party is also seeking redemption in the Midwest where Trump won over white, working-class voters who had backed Democrats for years. In Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Democrats appear poised to regain ground.\n\nSuch victories would build momentum behind the party\u2019s shift toward a new generation of candidates who are younger, more diverse, with greater numbers of women and more liberal than Democratic leadership. They would also signal that Trump\u2019s hard-line positions on immigration and his penchant for personal attacks turn off more voters than they energize.\n\nA good night for Democrats on Tuesday would provide a blueprint for how the party can successfully run against Trump in the 2020 presidential race. At least two dozen Democrats are waiting in the wings, eager to take on Trump.\n\nBut the president has proved once again to be a powerful political force late in a campaign.\n\nEven with his daily airing of grievances on Twitter and an approval rate below the average for his recent predecessors at this point, he has almost single-handedly put Republicans in a stronger position this fall. He\u2019s aggressively appealed to his loyal, core supporters with a sharply anti-immigrant, nationalist message and by casting Democrats as outside the mainstream.\n\n\u201cA vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to really put extreme far left politicians in charge of Congress and to destroy your jobs, slash your incomes, undermine your safety and put illegal aliens before American citizens,\u201d Trump said during a rally Saturday in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nIf Republicans hang on to control of Congress, Trump will almost certainly be emboldened. Democrats would be left with difficult questions about a path forward.\n\nFor example, how can Democrats assemble a winning coalition in 2020 if they fail to appeal to the moderate suburban voters who hold sway in the congressional districts that decide which party holds a House majority? And how will Democrats, if they fall short, sustain the energy from young people and women who have marched in protest of Trump, registered to vote and volunteered for the first time this election season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the election is not what we hoped for that people will say, \u2018it\u2019s too hard\u2019 and become disengaged,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as Clinton\u2019s communications director during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAs Americans participated in early voting this weekend, that same anxiety was palpable among some voters.\n\nIn Southern California, lifelong Democrat Theresa Hunter said she didn\u2019t take Trump seriously in 2016. But she sees a chance for Democrats to render their judgment on the president by pushing his party out of power in a different branch of government.\n\n\u201cTo see his party jump on board and march in lockstep is what\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Hunter, a 65-year-old retired salesperson from Lake Forest, California.\n\nA few hours north, California voter Lawrence Reh was casting his ballot. Afterward, his voice quivered and he wiped back tears as he voiced frustrations about Trump and his worries about the direction of the country.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make any progress in this election, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll go from here,\u201d Reh said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco and Amy Taxin in Lake Forest, California, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for the AP since 2007.

(AP) \u2014 Concerns about voter registrations and the security of electronic voting machines are looming over the upcoming election in Tennessee\u2019s largest county.\n\nTwo lawsuits have been filed in connection with Tuesday\u2019s pivotal election in Shelby County, the largest by population in Tennessee and the one that includes Memphis. Election officials there have pushed back against allegations of voter suppression and that they are not doing enough to protect the election process.\n\nTennessee features a race for governor and a tight U.S. Senate race between Republican Marsha Blackburn, who served 16 years in the U.S. House, and Democrat Phil Bredesen, a former Tennessee governor. The Senate race is being closely watched nationally as Democrats try to flip the seat in a state with relatively low voter turnout.\n\nA pair of related political groups, of BlackPAC and Black Progressive Action Coalition, has infused $3.4 million into the Senate race to turn out the black vote in Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville. The efforts include direct mail, radio ads, door knocking, and phone calls.\n\nDisputes over voter registrations have emerged in Georgia, Missouri, and Tennessee. Late last month, the Tennessee Black Voter Project and the NAACP filed a lawsuit in Shelby County Chancery Court over more than 36,000 registrations delivered to the Shelby County Election Commission. Election officials said about 55 percent were invalid because they were incomplete, were duplicates from previously registered voters or had come from convicted felons.\n\nThe black voter project and the NAACP said their representatives witnessed multiple legal violations by elections officials during early voting. NAACP President Derrick Johnson came to Memphis to urge people to vote despite what he called attempts at voter suppression \u201cthat should give us all pause.\u201d\n\nElections Commission administrator Linda Phillips said in a statement it appears the Black Voter Project intentionally withheld completed voter registration forms it had collected until the Oct. 9 deadline to try to \u201ccreate chaos.\u201d Election Commission spokeswoman Suzanne Thompson said one person registered to vote 22 times.\n\nA chancellor ordered the Election Commission to allow people with incomplete registrations to correct problems and vote on electronic voting machines, not provisional ballots, on Election Day. But the Court of Appeals in Tennessee blocked most of the injunction, ruling that those who fix incomplete applications on Election Day will have to cast provisional ballots.\n\nAlexander Wharton, an attorney for the Black Voter Project, told The Commercial Appeal that he was disappointed in the appeals court ruling. Wharton said his biggest concern is that people are told how to fix registration applications so that they don\u2019t make the same mistake on Election Day, possibly invalidating their provisional ballot.\n\nBredesen said the Election Commission \u201cneeds to clean up its mess and get its act together.\u201d Blackburn said she hopes \u201ceveryone who has registered to vote and is entitled to vote will be able to vote.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is related to the security of Shelby County\u2019s electronic voting machines. Voting integrity advocates, led by former Memphis City Council member and Democrat attorney Carol Chumney, asked a federal judge to force the Election Commission to perform rigorous security checks on its voting systems, including having the U.S. Department of Homeland Security perform risk and vulnerability assessments.\n\nElection officials and Election Commission lawyer John Ryder, a Republican, say the county has plans in place to ensure fairness and accountability of the voting machines and the voting process.\n\nU.S. District Judge Thomas Parker declined Chumney\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order ahead of early voting, saying it was not the federal court\u2019s place to tell county officials how to conduct elections.\n\nChumney also asked the judge to require that the county move to a voting system with paper ballots and a voter-verifiable paper trail for future elections. The machines provided by the county\u2019s current voting system vendor, Election Systems & Software, do not have such a paper trail.\n\nShelby County\u2019s voting machines were purchased more than a decade ago, making them and the software they use unreliable and vulnerable to manipulation, Chumney said.\n\nParker has not ruled directly on the voting systems issue. But he did address it in his ruling denying the restraining order.\n\n\u201cChoosing voting systems is a decision mainly reserved for state and local authorities, not the federal courts,\u201d Parker wrote.\n\nLater in the ruling, Parker urged Shelby County voting officials \u201cto continue studying the efficacy of the current voting system and to implement better procedures as they become available.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Mattise contributed from Nashville.", "", "", "", "First place finishers Mary Keitany of Kenya, left, and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia pose for a picture at the finish line of the New York City Marathon in New York, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Candidates for Montana\u2019s closely-contested U.S. Senate race face a grim reality as they press toward Tuesday\u2019s finish: There\u2019s a dwindling pool of voters left after large numbers already cast their ballots before Election Day.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester is facing another stiff re-election challenge after President Donald Trump made an unprecedented four trips to Montana to stump for Republican challenger Matt Rosendale. Control of the Senate is potentially at stake.\n\nMore than 300,000 voters had cast their ballots by Sunday, two days ahead of the Nov. 6 election. That\u2019s almost 43 percent of all of the state\u2019s registered voters, suggesting turnout will be high and also bolstering expectations among election watchers most voters will cast absentee ballots.\n\nOn Sunday, the incumbent Tester was making several campaign stops across western Montana. He had a final rally Monday in the city of Great Falls alongside Gov. Steve Bullock and Democratic U.S. House candidate Kathleen Williams.\n\nRosendale, the state auditor, was attending church services in the state capital of Helena on Sunday and spending time with his family, said spokesman Shane Scanlon.\n\nBoth sides have made pitches to veterans as part of their closing election arguments.\n\n\u201cIf you want this country to live up to the promise we made our veterans, to make sure our veterans have health care and education benefits and housing benefits, you\u2019ve gotta\u2019 vote,\u201d Tester said during a Sunday rally in the college town of Missoula.\n\nHe added that his opponent was a \u201cguy from Maryland\u201d backed by East Coast interests. Rosendale is a real estate developer who moved to Montana from Maryland in 2002.\n\nA day earlier in the city of Bozeman and with the president at his side, Rosendale said Tester in two terms had failed to fix the problems facing veterans and has opposed Trump on tax cuts and his picks for Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cTo all of the veterans, you can rest assured that when I\u2019m in the United States Senate, President Trump and I will keep our promises to veterans,\u201d Rosendale said.\n\nThe Republican senate candidate has been boosted by a forceful White House campaign to unseat Tester.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has gone after the Democrat since April, when Tester derailed the president\u2019s first-choice for Veterans Affairs secretary, Ronny Jackson, with allegations of drunken behavior, overprescribing prescription drugs and fostering a hostile work environment.\n\nJackson denied the allegations, which have been referred to the Pentagon\u2019s Inspector General for investigation.\n\nContinuing the White House blitz for Rosendale, Vice President Mike Pence on Monday is scheduled to appear near the city of Kalispell for the candidate and Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte, who is seeking to return for a full term after taking office in a special election last year.\n\nDespite the last-minute activity, increasingly fewer votes are still up for grabs, according to absentee voting data from the Montana Secretary of State\u2019s office.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the frenzied pace will let up in a race that\u2019s drawn more than $60 million from outside groups and in donations. The spending marks record for the state and has meant airwaves saturated with negative political advertisements.\n\nAlso driving interest this election season is Williams\u2019 attempt to become the first Democrat to win Montana\u2019s lone House seat since 1997 and citizens\u2019 initiatives to raise tobacco taxes and tighten rules on mining pollution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at a huge turnout already,\u201d said Jason Adkins, assistant professor of political science at Montana State University Billings.\n\nHe added: \u201cIf it\u2019s a race that\u2019s going to tight, you want as many people to turnout as you can. Especially in Montana, where we don\u2019t have strong party identification, you have to get out the vote for everyone.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Sri Lankan civil rights activists hold placards during a demonstration outside the official residence of ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sunday, Nov 4, 2018.

Thousands of Sri Lankans also protested in the capital in the past week demanding Sirisena immediately convene Parliament.\n\nSirisena\u2019s moves have triggered a power struggle that some observers have called a constitutional crisis.\n\nSince his ouster, Wickremesinghe has remained at Temple Trees, the official residence of the prime minister \u2014 insisting he is still the legitimate leader because he commands majority support in Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with The Associated Press that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa\u2019s party is attempting to buy support in Parliament.

Renick\u2019s \u2014 that always-bustling spot along Route 23 in northern Pickaway County where generations of families have taken their children to pick the perfect pumpkin, to get an apple cider slushie, to craft a life-sized scarecrow, to race through the corn maze \u2014 was closing for good.\n\n\u201cIt is time,\u201d David said simply. He and his wife, Linda, are both 70. They have four grown children and eight grandchildren, and their fifth great-grandchild was making his entrance into this world even as the couple spoke Tuesday about the importance of spending more time with family. They decided at some point in this 10-week season at the market that this would be their last.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a favorite saying, \u2018It\u2019s better to wear out than to rust out,\u2019\u201d David said.\n\n\u201cAnd I was starting to rust,\u201d Linda added with a laugh.\n\nStanding inside the market that is practically a museum \u2014 antiques and family heirlooms cover every shelf and wall, including Grandma\u2019s canning tins and canister sets and Linda\u2019s father\u2019s fishing gear \u2014 Ashley Estep tried to keep it together as she talked about the market closing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just one big family,\u201d Estep said, tearing up. \u201cI love the Renicks.

Boys would generally be put to work in the 30-acre pumpkin patch, planting and hoeing and cutting stems. But then there also was asparagus to harvest and melons to raise and corn to pick and ... well, you get the idea. Running the market and tending the acreage that supports it (the family has 500 acres here, and 280 up the road) is a lot of work.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get Linda started about the baking. Tuesday afternoon, she and Estep took turns tending to the 28 pumpkin pies baking in the steel ovens in the back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of fun here, but it\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d said Linda\u2019s best friend, Marty Adams, as she helped a customer choose the right variety of apples. \u201cDave and Linda?

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Voters are once again deciding whether to raise income tax rates to fund public education in Colorado \u2014 the third such ballot measure in the tax-averse state since 2011.\n\nAmendment 73 will increase the state individual income tax rate for people who earn more than $150,000 a year and raise the corporate income tax rate to fund preschool through 12th grade.\n\nSupporters of the proposal, which is expected to raise an additional $1.6 billion annually for schools, hope the political landscape and the state\u2019s priorities have changed since voters rejected similar measures in 2011 and 2013 by 2-1 margins. They argue the state needs a sustainable source of income after funding was cut following the 2008 recession, forcing some school districts to resort to a four-day school week, limit teacher salaries, narrow course offerings and increase class sizes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to provide some definitely needed funds for schools all across the state,\u201d said Lisa Weil with the group Great Education Colorado. \u201cThe way it does that is by dealing with what is right now an upside down tax structure\u201d that benefits the wealthy.\n\nColorado currently spends about $9.7 billion a year on education, with $6.6 billion going to school districts through a formula in state law.\n\nThe measure will set a graduated individual income tax rate for people who earn more than $150,000, affecting about 8 percent of individual and joint filers. Those who earn $150,000 or less a year will not be affected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fair way to raise taxes, and the dollars are going to be spent on things that are high priorities,\u201d Weil said. \u201cThis is going to be a game changer. This is going to change the lives of hundreds of thousands of kids.\u201d\n\nThe measure will raise the current flat tax rate from 4.63 percent to 6 percent for corporations and will set new assessment rates for property taxes levied by school districts.\n\nThe non-residential assessment rate will be reduced from 29 percent to 24 percent, and the residential rate will be reduced from 7.2 percent to 7 percent. But critics say the new fixed residential rate amounts to a tax increase because the rate was projected to fall to 6.1 percent next year.\n\nThey also argue that the measure will be bad for small businesses and the economy.\n\nLeading up to Tuesday\u2019s vote, opponents painted the amendment as a $1.6 million blank check that doesn\u2019t guarantee increased teacher salaries or improved academic performance.\n\nKatie Kruger, co-chair of the \u201cNo on 73\u201d campaign, said the measure \u201ctriggers a tax increase on thousands of small businesses, farms and dual-income families.\u201d\n\nA similar amendment that was soundly defeated in 2013 would have raised $950 million for K-12 education by also increasing the 4.63 flat tax rate. Under that measure, the first $75,000 of taxable income would have been taxed at 5 percent, and income above that would have been taxed at 5.9 percent.\n\nIn 2011, Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposition to raise $2.9 billion for schools by increasing the 4.63 flat tax rate for households and businesses to 5 percent for five years and raising the state\u2019s sales tax from 2.9 percent to 3 percent.\n\nBut this year\u2019s initiative comes after a series of nationwide protests that highlighted low teacher salaries and underfunded schools.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is so different,\u201d Weil said. \u201cIt\u2019s responding to a different time but also responding in a different way. ... I think people understand the urgency a whole lot more. People are much more aware of the need and attuned to what it means for communities.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/3bedeedff5a34c1d87247ff1fbba5590\n\nLelisa Desisa of Ethiopia wins men\u2019s New York City Marathon\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia wins men\u2019s New York City Marathon.", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Sinema is facing Republican Martha McSally in the race to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring. (AP Photo/Bob Christie)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A contentious race that will end with Arizona\u2019s first female U.S. senator and a governor\u2019s race featuring Republican Doug Ducey against challenger Democrat David Garcia as Ducey seeks a second term top the ticket in the state\u2019s 2018 general election.\n\nThe race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake pits Democrat Kyrsten Sinema against Republican Martha McSally.\n\nThe contest has seen more than $90 million in spending, including more than $58 million by outside groups backing one candidate or the other, according to Federal Election Commission reports. That jaw-dropping number is no surprise to any Arizona residents who have turned on their TVs or listened to radios in the past several months. The ads clog the airwaves.\n\nThe Senate race is considered one of the nation\u2019s most competitive, as Sinema paints herself as an \u201cindependent\u201d centrist who can work across the aisle and has backed President Donald Trump\u2019s initiatives more than 60 percent of the time. The three-term congresswoman currently represents parts of Phoenix and Tempe.\n\nMcSally has focused on border security and boosting the nation\u2019s military while attacking Sinema, labeling her as a leftist who is too radical for Arizona. McSally is a former Air Force pilot who has served two terms representing a Tucson-area congressional district and has run as a strong Trump backer.\n\nSinema has repeatedly focused attention on McSally\u2019s 2017 vote to repeal of the Affordable Care Act, saying the action shows she will not protect patients with pre-existing conditions. But McSally now says she would protect those patients.\n\nIf Sinema wins, it will be a sign that Arizona is in play as a swing state, and she\u2019ll become the state\u2019s first Democratic senator since the mid-1990s.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Ducey has focused on border security, a booming state economy and the need to remain focused on making the state\u2019s business climate better to boost job growth.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t particularly highlighted education, an area where he is seen as vulnerable, especially after a strike that saw 75,000 teachers marching on the Capitol this spring and more than 1 million schoolchildren out of class because their schools were closed.\n\nGarcia has focused on the state\u2019s underfunded schools while attacking Ducey for what he says is his failure to prioritize school funding. He\u2019s taken a different tack than Sinema, running as a progressive candidate, coming out against Trump\u2019s plans for a border wall and calling for more humane treatment of immigrants, especially children. The Democrat said he would like to see Immigration and Customs Enforcement transformed into a new agency that protects borders while respecting human rights.\n\nThat led to attacks from Ducey, and public polling shows the governor with a solid lead as Election Day nears.\n\nAll nine Arizona seats in Congress are also on the ballot, with Democrats hoping to pick up southern Arizona\u2019s 2nd Congressional District seat, being vacated by McSally.\n\nFormer Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, is taking on Republican Lea Marquez Peterson. Democrats are working to hold the 1st and 9th districts, which Sinema is vacating, to bring the Democratic-GOP split to 5-4 if Kirkpatrick prevails.\n\nThe 8th District in northeastern metro Phoenix features a rematch of an April special election that saw Republican Debbie Lesko narrowly beat Democrat Hiral Tipirneni. That district features a heavy Republican registration advantage, so Lesko is favored, but Tipirneni is campaigning hard and thinks she could win.\n\n\u201cWe know that we are out there every day reaching out to voters,\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re having independents continue to engage with us, moderate Republicans come over that are really focused on the issues and the solutions that we\u2019ve put forward.\u201d\n\nThe other five districts, three held by Republicans and two by Democrats, aren\u2019t seen as competitive. Still, Democrats have fielded candidates that are actively campaigning in the three GOP-heavy districts, a rarity for those districts.\n\nAlso on the ballot are four other statewide offices: secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. All are seen as competitive for either party. And two seats on the Corporation Commission, the five-member body that regulates utilities, are on the ballot, with two Democrats running against two Republicans.\n\nFive ballot measures are before voters, including Proposition 305, which asks voters whether to approve a massive increase in Arizona\u2019s private school voucher program approved by the Legislature and Gov. Ducey in 2017 over unified opposition from Democrats. Public school advocates collected enough signatures to put the law on hold pending a statewide vote, and a no vote rejects the law.\n\nThe other top ballot measure is a voter initiative known as Proposition 127, which would require utilities to get 50 percent of their power from renewable resources like solar by 2030. Arizona utilities backed by top Republican leaders are pouring cash into the effort to defeat the proposal from environmental advocates backed by billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s NextGen America PAC.\n\nThree other measures would block new taxes on services, remove some power from the state\u2019s independent public campaign finance commission and change cost-of-living increases in two state pension plans, those for corrections officers and elected officials.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Singer Lee Greenwood points at President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence as he sings during a campaign rally, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Jacky Rosen, a first-term Democrat from Las Vegas who has branded Heller as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the president and highlighted his shifting stances on GOP plans to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law. Obama and other high-profile Democrats have stumped for Rosen in Las Vegas, along with the powerful casino workers\u2019 union, Culinary Union Local 226.\n\nTo fire up Nevada Republicans on his behalf, Heller has rallied with Trump, Pence and Trump\u2019s children Ivanka and Donald Jr. in the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\n\nPence and the Trumps have also been making appearances for Republicans hoping to flip two swing U.S. House districts in and around Las Vegas.\n\nRepublican Danny Tarkanian, son of former University of Nevada, Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, is running for Rosen\u2019s open seat, as is Democrat and education philanthropist Susie Lee.\n\nLee ran for the seat in 2014 but lost a primary election, and Tarkanian has run unsuccessfully for a number of Nevada offices over the years.\n\nThey\u2019re running in the 3rd Congressional District, the state\u2019s most evenly divided, which covers southern parts of Las Vegas, Henderson and extends to the state\u2019s southern border with Arizona and California.\n\nNorth of that, Nevada\u2019s 4th Congressional District wraps in urban areas of Las Vegas with a wide stretch of desert, rural areas and mountain towns. The seat is held by Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen, who decided not to run again amid allegations of sexual harassment, which he has denied.\n\nTwo former congressmen who each held the seat for a single term are hoping to replace him.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Steven Horsford, who held the seat from 2013 to 2015 until losing to Republican Cresent Hardy \u2014 his opponent again this year. Democrats have a slight advantage in the district, but they aren\u2019t as reliable as Republicans when it comes to voting in midterm elections like this year\u2019s.\n\nIn the governor\u2019s race, Republican Attorney General Adam Laxalt is looking to hold an office his grandfather, Paul Laxalt, once held. His opponent is Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisolak, a Democrat who oversees a body governing the Las Vegas Strip and nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s population.\n\nNevada hasn\u2019t had a Democratic governor in two decades, but the state\u2019s outgoing moderate Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval has declined to back Laxalt.\n\nThe winner will have veto power over the state\u2019s new congressional and legislative maps drawn after the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nBesides the governor\u2019s race, Democrats are trying to win five statewide offices held by Republicans. Close battles include the attorney general\u2019s race, between Democrat Aaron Ford, the Nevada Senate majority leader, and Republican Wes Duncan, the former assistant state attorney general.\n\nIn the secretary of state\u2019s race, incumbent Republican Barbara Cegavske is being challenged by Democratic state Assemblyman Nelson Araujo, who would become the state\u2019s first openly gay person elected to statewide office if he wins.\n\nNevada could make another first on Election Day by electing the country\u2019s first female-majority Legislature. Women would need to win at least five more seats for the Assembly and Senate \u2014 including four competitive seats \u2014 to take the majority. And in only-in-Nevada fashion, it\u2019s likely voters in one Assembly district will elect Republican brothel owner Dennis Hof \u2014 despite Hof\u2019s October death.\n\nAuthorities have said no foul play is suspected in the 72-year-old\u2019s death, but it came after ballots already had been mailed to voters. If he wins in the heavily-GOP district, another Republican will be appointed to fill the seat.\n\nVoters will also settle six ballot questions, including Question 3, which would break up a monopoly in Nevada by electric utility NV Energy, which has drawn about $100 million in campaign spending from those who support and oppose the move.\n\nAnother ballot measure, Question 6, would require the state to get more of its energy from renewable sources. More than $6 million has been raised for the effort, most of it coming from California billionaire Tom Steyer\u2019s group, NextGen Climate Action.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of Sept. 21, 2018, file photos shows Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, left, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, right, during their first Senate debate in Dallas. Win or lose Texas' high-profile Senate race on Tuesday, Nov. 6, both Cruz and O'Rourke probably still have bright political futures, perhaps even plausible White House aspirations. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News via AP, Pool, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Republican Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke probably have bright political futures, perhaps even plausible White House aspirations, regardless of which one wins their high-profile Texas Senate race.\n\nAround Labor Day, when polls showed onetime punk rocker O\u2019Rourke closing in on flipping a Senate seat in the country\u2019s largest Republican-dominated state, speculation abounded that O\u2019Rourke could be a 2020 presidential hopeful.\n\nPolitical observers have suggested an upset, or even a close loss, could catapult O\u2019Rourke to national prominence, allowing for the same transformation from longshot to national political star that he\u2019d already undergone in his home state.\n\nO\u2019Rourke shrugged off such talk and, as it turned out, he probably peaked then. Polls now show Cruz with a consistent, if modest, lead.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t diminish O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise from virtual unknown outside his remote hometown of El Paso to one of this election\u2019s most talked-about national figures. He shattered Senate race fundraising records with donations from supporters across the country, fueling optimism about his potential staying power outside Texas.\n\n\u201cTalent and charisma translate,\u201d said Texas Democratic strategist Matt Angle, adding he\u2019d rather see O\u2019Rourke bolster the Texas Democratic Party\u2019s future than look nationally. But he also said the idea that politicians have to wait their turn to move up the ranks died with President Donald Trump\u2019s emergence, meaning O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise can resonate beyond this race.\n\n\u201cThe notion of waiting in line is going away,\u201d Angle said. \u201cThere\u2019s an understanding that, in both parties, there is a vacuum at the top for somebody to really step into a leadership role.\u201d\n\nCruz, meanwhile, finished second in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and has made no secret about wanting to try again post-Trump. He could do that from the Senate, but since he has built his entire career around presidential aspirations, even a stunning and potentially humiliating defeat wouldn\u2019t necessarily derail those.\n\n\u201cIf you lose with your honor intact, able to build a national donor file and email list, get millions of dollars in earned media, then you become a bit of a commodity,\u201d said Republican strategist Brendan Steinhauser, who ran Texas Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s successful 2014 re-election campaign. \u201cPeople often pay you to speak. You write a book. You go on a tour. You start a PAC. You support candidates and causes, and it actually elevates your profile.\u201d\n\nTurning lesser-race losses into White House campaign success isn\u2019t new. Jimmy Carter lost Georgia\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1966 but eventually recovered to win the post four years later and the White House six years after that. Richard Nixon lost the 1960 presidential race, then ran unsuccessfully for governor of California two years later, but captured the White House in 1968. The best example might be former Sen. Rick Santorum, who lost his 2006 Senate re-election bid in Pennsylvania by 18 points only to finish second in the 2012 Republican presidential primary.\n\nLeaving politics temporarily also has allowed top Democrats and Republicans to become TV commentators, keeping them in the spotlight without having to explain unpopular votes or actions taken in office. After losing the 2008 Republican presidential primary, ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee used his own Fox News show to keep his name in the headlines prior to launching a 2016 White House bid. A similar path might give Cruz the chance to define where he fits in a future GOP no longer defined by Trump, while O\u2019Rourke could further boost his beyond-Texas bonafides.\n\nRory McShane, a Las Vegas-based Republican media consultant who has clients in seven states this cycle, said it would likely be O\u2019Rourke, not Cruz, wondering about his immediate future after Election Day \u2014 but that it doesn\u2019t have to be a career-ender.\n\n\u201cI think that what Beto has that almost no other Democrat in the country right now has is this ability to appeal, at least in some way, to blue-collar, rural Democrats,\u201d McShane said.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s message of bipartisan optimism and willingness to visit deeply conservative corners of Texas where Democrats rarely venture helped him draw large crowds, not unlike Trump in 2016.\n\nMcShane said even a losing O\u2019Rourke could do something like head the Democratic National Committee: \u201cThat is a position where he can be on television every night, where he can maintain his relationship with donors and build new relationships.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Cruz has poked fun at suggestions O\u2019Rourke could be a future presidential contender, gleefully tweeting results from a recent CNN poll showing O\u2019Rourke in eighth place among possible 2020 Democratic White House candidates.\n\nCruz himself began preparing for his 2016 presidential run as soon as he got to the Senate and has generally been non-committal when asked if he\u2019ll finish his full term should he win on Election Day. O\u2019Rourke says he\u2019ll stay all six years and, as for running for president, \u201cIt\u2019s a definitive no.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t win,\u201d he\u2019s said \u201cwe\u2019re back in El Paso.\u201d\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t be the first to change his mind.

(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed, File)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s recent assertion that U.S. troops should respond to rock-throwing migrants \u2014 a hypothetical scenario \u2014 as if they were armed has sparked a debate about the appropriate use of force.\n\nNigerian troops swiftly used Trump\u2019s comments about the migrants as justification for a deadly crackdown on demonstrators over the weekend.\n\nFrom the Gaza Strip to Africa and Europe, security forces have faced stone throwers in very different ways, from firing live rounds to limiting themselves to non-lethal means.\n\nA 1990 U.N. document calls on law enforcement officials to show maximum restraint and to use firearms only in cases in which an \u201cimminent threat of death or serious injury\u201d is identified.\n\nThese standards have been interpreted differently around the world.\n\nLast week, Trump called attention to a migrant caravan of several thousand Central Americans making their way toward the U.S. border. It is a largely peaceful procession, though some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexico police, hurling stones.\n\nAlthough the caravan is still some 1,200 kilometers (800 miles) from the border, Trump has mobilized troops and declared that if U.S. soldiers face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \u201crifles.\u201d\n\nTrump later said he was merely calling for the arrests of stone throwers.\n\nBut following Trump\u2019s comments, Nigeria\u2019s military sent out a tweet that appeared to use his words as justification for shooting and killing Shiite protesters. It later removed the tweet.\n\nOmar Shakir, the Israel-Palestine director of the international group Human Rights Watch, said he fears Trump\u2019s comments could encourage other forces to loosen their rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s brazen, inflammatory statements, days before U.S. midterm elections, have already been seized on by rights abusers to justify more expansive open fire standards,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is a look at how countries around the world respond to stone throwers.\n\nISRAEL/PALESTINIANS:\n\nIsraeli forces have been confronting Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for decades. Israeli tactics have evolved over the years, particularly with the increased use of what are presented as non-lethal crowd-dispersal tools such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nIsraeli officials say that live fire is used only as a last resort, when soldiers\u2019 lives are threatened. But critics accuse Israel of unnecessarily, and perhaps illegally, using deadly force.\n\nIn recent months, for instance, over 160 Palestinians have been killed during mass protests along Gaza\u2019s border with Israel. Many have been unarmed.\n\nIsrael says threats go beyond stone throwing, and that protesters throw grenades and firebombs, or try to break through the border to attack Israeli civilians.\n\nDavid Tzur, a former commander of Israel\u2019s paramilitary Border Police, said non-lethal force is sufficient in most cases, but that troops could be justified using live fire in more chaotic situations, if a moving vehicle is pelted with stones in a tense locale, for instance.\n\nGREECE:\n\nIn Greece, firebombs and stone-throwing are routine occurrences at anarchist demonstrations held on most weekends. Police typically respond with tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowds.\n\nIn 2008, a policeman fired his gun at a group of youths in central Athens, killing a 15-year-old protester. The death sparked two weeks of riots in major cities across Greece, and the policeman was jailed for murder.\n\nMIGRANTS IN EUROPE:\n\nMigrants making their way to Europe have clashed with security forces in various countries.\n\nIn Spain, migrants from Africa have on several occasions stormed across the border, assaulting police officers with acid, skin irritants and other objects.\n\nBut police are not permitted to use live ammunition and have not even used rubber bullets against migrants since a much-criticized crackdown in 2014. Spanish police did use rubber bullets last year in clashes with Catalan separatists.\n\nHungary, which takes one of the hardest lines against migrants, used only tear gas and water cannons in a major clash with migrants three years ago. One Syrian migrant, however, was sentenced to five years in prison on terrorism charges for entering the country illegally and throwing stones at police.\n\nKASHMIR:\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, a disputed territory divided between India and Pakistan, protesters have long viewed stone throwing as legitimate protest against Indian rule.\n\nIndia has often responded with tough measures, including live fire and metal pellets that have killed, maimed or blinded hundreds of people over the last decade. India says its troops are in life-threatening situations that justify the heavy use of force.\n\nProtesters caught throwing stones at soldiers and police \u2014 often identified through video recordings of demonstrations \u2014 are usually accused of attempting to murder government officials, a charge that carries long imprisonment. Many stone throwers have been shot dead by soldiers.\n\nRebels have been fighting Indian control since 1989. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Aijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India; Elena Becatoros in Athens; Thomas Adamson in Paris; Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary; Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain, and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "Karen Khachanov of Russia poses with the trophy after winning the final match of the Paris Masters tennis tournament against Novak Djokovic of Serbia at the Bercy Arena in Paris, France, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

But I don\u2019t want to talk about that,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI want to talk about how well (Khachanov) played all week and absolutely deserved to win today.\u201d\n\nAsked again whether it was a case of emotional fatigue, after such an intense tussle with Federer, Djokovic repeated his praise for Khachanov.\n\n\u201cKaren played really well and he deserved to win,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cAll the credit to him.\u201d\n\nAlthough Djokovic broke in the fourth game to move 3-1 up and then led 30-0 on serve, the unseeded Khachanov broke him straight back and the momentum abruptly shifted away from Djokovic.\n\n\u201cI stepped in more inside the court,\u201d Khachanov said. \u201cI started to move him and maybe he didn\u2019t expect that I could do it after being down 3-1 with a break.\u201d\n\nDjokovic seemed agitated at times and twice turned to his box to remonstrate about an unspecified issue during the first set.\n\nKhachanov broke for 6-5 when he hit a powerful shot down the line that Djokovic could only scoop back into the net. The Russian won the first set with a big first serve that Djokovic could not return, stretching out his racket in vain as the fizzing ball clipped the frame.\n\nDjokovic struggled to handle Khachanov\u2019s brutal two-handed, cross-court backhands from the baseline, which often landed near his ankles, and dropped his serve again to trail 2-1 in the second set. He had to save three more break points in the seventh game to hold for 4-3 down.\n\n\u201cHe was playing big from the back of the court, flat backhands and forehand. He can really hurt you,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cHis serve is really, really strong and precise.\u201d\n\nAfter both players held to love, Khachanov showed no nerves \u2014 even though he was in his first Masters final \u2014 and served out the match.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point when Djokovic chopped a backhand return wide. The imposing Khachanov thrust both his arms in the air and, moments later, knelt down to kiss the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough season. And this title, it\u2019s a good year-end I would say,\u201d Khachanov said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m not crying, but still I\u2019m really happy.\u201d\n\nDjokovic will return to No. 1 in the rankings for the first time in two years on Monday, but the Serb will be disappointed at missing out on a 73rd career title, having withstood the best of Federer on Saturday.\n\nStill, the Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion has plenty to feel good about after a 22-match winning streak, and he remains favorite for the season-ending ATP Finals in London, beginning Nov. 11.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m satisfied of course and I\u2019m going to be No. 1 tomorrow. What more can I ask for? I mean, I won 20-plus matches in a row and had a most amazing last five months,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting into (the) season finale feeling good about my game.\u201d\n\nThe 22-year-old Khachanov, ranked 18th, is the first Russian to win here since Nikolay Davydenko in 2006. Marat Safin won it three times before that.\n\nTwo-time Grand Slam champion Safin won the last of his Paris Masters titles in 2004, when Khachanov was a young boy.\n\n\u201cI watched (Safin\u2019s) matches but later, not at the age of eight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just really proud of myself that I could be in this list of winners.\u201d\n\nKhachanov added this title to the Kremlin Cup in Moscow last month for his third title of the year and fourth overall.\n\nHe had won his previous three finals, and said his 100 percent record helped him when he stepped on court against the 14-time Grand Slam champion.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018OK, (Djokovic) has, I don\u2019t know, 70 titles and I have three,\u2019\u201d Khachanov said. \u201cBut 3-0, you know?

Proposals for a $1-per-pack increase in Indiana\u2019s current 99-cent cigarette tax cleared the House last year and in 2016, but failed to win approval in the Senate.\n\nNo action was taken on the issue in the 2018 legislative session.\n\nThe reports acknowledge that Indiana has seen a steep decline since 2011 in fatal overdoses involving prescription opioids, but notes that there\u2019s been a rapid rise in the synthetic opioid fentanyl.\n\nSmoking and second hand smoke cause a total of 12,500 deaths in Indiana each year, according to one of the reports.\n\nThe two studies found that businesses lose about $2.8 billion per year in productivity due to tobacco use, while Indiana families face a combined $1,125 per household in additional state and federal taxes to cover health care costs for tobacco use.\n\nKevin Brinegar, president and CEO of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, said Indiana needs to take action to address the opioid and tobacco epidemics because they \u201cthreaten the physical health of our state, the quality of life for all Hoosiers and our shared economic prosperity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdopting proven policies to address these twin crises would preserve thousands of lives, save taxpayers money and position our state as a more attractive location for companies and employees.\u201d", "PUTNAM, Conn.

A shooter killed one person and critically wounded four others at a yoga studio in Florida's capital before killing himself Friday, officials said. (Tori Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat via AP)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A man trying to stop a shooting attack on a Florida yoga studio said Sunday that he wrestled with the attacker after his gun jammed, a move credited with giving others time to flee the rampage that killed two people and wounded six others.\n\nYoga student Joshua Quick spoke to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Sunday and said he grabbed Scott Paul Beierle\u2019s gun after it jammed, and hit him.\n\nTallahassee Police have identified Beierle as the man who posed as a customer to get into the studio Hot Yoga Tallahassee during a Friday night class and started shooting. Police said Beierle, 40, then turned the gun on himself but authorities have offered no motive in the attack.\n\nQuick said Beierle was able to grab the gun back and then pistol-whipped him.\n\n\u201cI jumped up as quickly as I could,\u201d said Quick, who had visible facial injuries. \u201cI ran back over and the next thing I know I\u2019m grabbing a broom, the only thing I can, and I hit him again.\u201d\n\nIt gave some in the studio time to flee.\n\n\u201cThanks to him I was able to rush out the door,\u201d Daniela Garcia Albalat told Good Morning America. She was in the class and thought she was going to die. \u201cHe saved my life.\u201d\n\nTwo women \u2014 a 61-year-old faculty member at Florida State University, and a 21-year-old FSU student \u2014 were fatally shot.\n\nDr. Nancy Van Vessem was an internist who also served as chief medical director for Capital Health Plan, the area\u2019s leading health maintenance organization. She was also a faculty member at Florida State and a mother.\n\nMaura Binkley, who grew up in Atlanta and was a double major in English and German, was set to graduate in May.\n\nBeierle was described as a brooding military veteran and former teacher, who appeared to have made videos detailing his hatred of everything from the Affordable Care Act to girls who\u2019d allegedly mistreated him in middle school. The videos were posted four years ago, and were removed from YouTube after the shooting.\n\nNumerous disturbing details about him have emerged. He\u2019d once been banned from FSU\u2019s campus and had been arrested twice for grabbing women even though charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nBeierle, who had moved to the central Florida town of Deltona after getting a graduate degree from FSU, appeared to post a series of videos on YouTube in 2014 where he called women \u201cwhores\u201d if they dated black men, said many black women were \u201cdisgusting\u201d and described himself as a misogynist.\n\nA Tallahassee police spokesman would not confirm or deny the videos were Beierle\u2019s. However, the man speaking in the videos looks like Beierle and biographical details mentioned in the videos match known facts about Beierle, including details of his military service. The poster\u2019s YouTube username included the word \u201cScott,\u201d Beierle\u2019s first name. The existence of the videos was first reported by BuzzFeed.\n\nA woman who filed a police report against Beierle told The AP she\u2019s never forgotten how \u201ccreepy\u201d he was.\n\nCourtnee Connon was 18 in 2012 when, she said, Scott Paul Beierle grabbed her buttocks at a Florida State dining hall. She declined to press charges, however.\n\nShe learned of Beierle\u2019s involvement Friday when a local reporter found her name in a police report and called her.\n\n\u201cI was totally just shocked,\u201d she said. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve been feeling a little guilt. If I\u2019d pressed charges, would that have stopped him from doing this? How was he not monitored somehow?\u201d\n\nFour years after that, Beierle was arrested for misdemeanor battery after a young woman said he approached her at the swimming pool of a Tallahassee apartment complex, complemented her rear end and offered to rub sunscreen on it, records show. The woman said she declined the offer and, according to an affidavit, Beierle then slapped her on the buttocks and grabbed her.\n\nThe top prosecutor for the office that handled Beierle\u2019s 2016 charge, William N. \u201cWillie\u201d Meggs, has no personal recollection of that case. However, since the 2012 battery charges were dropped, Meggs said, it would have been routine for Beierle to receive a deferred prosecution deal.\n\n\u201cIt would not have been atypical as a first-time offender for him to get diversion,\u201d said Meggs, since retired as state attorney for Florida\u2019s Second Judicial Circuit. \u201cWe should have called the victim to make sure she was OK with him getting diversion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the court file whether that occurred, and the woman didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment. The AP doesn\u2019t publicly identify sexual assault victims unless they choose to speak.\n\nCourt records indicate prosecutors agreed to dismiss the battery charge after Beierle completed a six-month diversion agreement requiring him to stay out of trouble, not drink alcohol to excess and to follow a psychologist\u2019s recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, yoga teachers in the Florida capital and the country at large were horrified such a violent act could unfold in a place intended for tranquility and nonviolence.\n\nSome teachers wondered what they would tell their students.\n\n\u201cAs an instructor when you start every class, you ask students to close their eyes to relax, because you\u2019re in such a safe space,\u201d said Amanda Morrison, a Tallahassee instructor.\n\nThe safety of her students is on her mind as she prepares to teach a class Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already thinking about locking the doors once class starts,\u201d she said.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Michael Biesecker contributed from Washington.", "The Latest: Funeral plans are pending for Utah Guard major\n\nSoldiers attend a news conference where Gov.

So I called my brother and I said, \u2018pick me up,\u2019\u201d said Perkins, 19, a freshman at the University of St. Thomas, a private and mostly white school in St. Paul, Minnesota. \u201cHe said that\u2019s what they want you to do \u2014 you have to stay there and stay strong.\u201d\n\nOften overlooked amid the recent intense spasms of hatred \u2014 11 dead in Pittsburgh synagogue, two African-Americans gunned down in a Kentucky grocery store, 13 mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats \u2014 are nearly daily flashes of hate that are no less capable of leaving their victims with deep and permanent emotional wounds.\n\nIn October alone, there were dozens of examples of the kind of hatred that smolders without ever reaching national attention. It stretched from coast to coast, targeting victims because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and myriad other differences.\n\nAn Indiana woman was arrested last week after leaving a racist letter directed at African-American neighbors, urging them to leave the neighborhood because black people weren\u2019t welcome. As early voting started in North Carolina, a black Republican volunteer was accosted with slurs and had a gun pulled on him at a polling place, leading to one man\u2019s arrest. An Uber passenger in Colorado was arrested after threatening his Middle Eastern driver and chasing him down the street because police said he \u201chated all brown people.\u201d Violent clashes broke out in New York City after a speech by the founder of a far-right group, leading to three arrests.\n\nIn a Texas courtroom, a man was sentenced to 24 years in prison on Oct. 17 for torching a mosque near the U.S.-Mexico border last year because of what authorities said was a \u201crabid hatred\u201d of Muslims. In sending the arsonist to prison, Judge John Rainey declared: \u201cThis must stop. It is like a cancer to our society,\u201d adding that incidents like this create \u201cfear all over the world.\u201d\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said xenophobic rhetoric is feeding the anxiety of the current political moment, and that anxiety is prompting fear and promoting resentment and \u201call the worst impulses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a moment where hate crimes are on the rise,\u201d said Greenblatt. \u201cWe need more than ever for our leaders to ratchet back the rhetoric. People feel like they\u2019re on edge across the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s critics have accused him of fanning the flames with his divisive political rhetoric \u2014 something the president pushed back against Friday. He put the blame back on reporters for \u201ccreating violence\u201d with he has called \u201cfake news\u201d stories.\n\nSeveral cases happened on college campuses, which strive to reflect the nation\u2019s diversity but sometimes attract its intolerance.\n\nAt more than 40 colleges, racist flyers or stickers were found posted on campus in October, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which has reported a surge in activity by white supremacist groups since Trump took office.\n\nAt the College of the Holy Cross in central Massachusetts, a student was beaten in an assault that officials say was motivated by the victim\u2019s sexual orientation. No one has been arrested in connection with the crime.\n\nStudents at DePauw University in Indiana reported four separate cases of hate speech in October. In three, racial and homophobic slurs and threats were yelled from cars passing by campus. In another case, a threat with the N-word was found in an elevator on campus.\n\nAnti-Semitic posters appeared at the University of California, Davis, blaming Jews for allegations of sexual assault that were made against Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Several Jewish groups on campus wrote a letter demanding a stronger response from the school\u2019s administration, saying Jews on campus have faced mounting prejudice in recent years.\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is very real and alive on our campus,\u201d the letter said. \u201cJewish students should not have to be scared of walking on campus. Students are choosing not to openly identify as Jews through our clothing.\u201d\n\nFor Perkins, the red lettering marred the image of the friendly, welcoming campus that was sold to him by college officials.\n\nThe incident led to a student protest that prompted the school to cancel class for a town hall meeting discussing racial tensions on campus.\n\nSince he found the note Oct. 19, Perkins has become more withdrawn, he said, less outgoing. And although he decided to stay at St. Thomas, he\u2019s left to wonder who on campus felt such hatred for him, and why.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already the odd one out, and the words, the hatred behind it really made me mad,\u201d he said. \u201cDegrading someone based on the color of their skin, I just couldn\u2019t understand why someone would do that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP National Writer Errin Haines Whack and AP researcher Monika Mathur contributed to this report.", "Former President Barack Obama speaks during a Get Out The Vote rally to campaign for Illinois gubernatorial candidate J.B.

(AP Photo/Andrew Welsh-Huggins)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 An Ohio physician and medial professor believes medical cannabis should be used to treat opioid addiction in a state that saw a record number of overdose deaths last year.\n\nDr. F. Stuart Leeds has been preparing data and research to submit to the State Medical Board of Ohio as it considers expanding the current list of conditions for which doctors can recommend medical cannabis. Leeds acknowledges the limited data, but he said some of the most telling research comes from his patients, some of whom are dealing with opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cPatients have been conducting their own self-experiments on a variety of street drugs for decades,\u201d said Leeds, who practices and teaches family medicine at Wright State University outside of Dayton. \u201cThey know more about what marijuana will do for their chronic pain and addiction problems than we do.\u201d\n\nLeeds is on the registry of Ohio physicians who can recommend but not prescribe medical marijuana for 21 qualifying medical conditions, such as epilepsy and chronic pain. Opioid use disorder is currently a qualifying condition in three other medical marijuana states: New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\n\nOhio\u2019s Medical Board is accepting petitions on adding qualifying conditions through the end of the year and will consult with experts before making a decision sometime next year. Cannabis products are expected to become available in Ohio dispensaries in the next few months following delays in rolling out the program.\n\nSome experts don\u2019t think treating opioid addiction with marijuana is a good idea, including Dr. Mark Hurst, director of the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. Hurst declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press, but he told the Cincinnati Enquirer in August: \u201cThere is no scientific evidence that marijuana is an effective treatment for opioid addiction.\u201d\n\nBrad Lander, a clinical psychologist in the department of addiction medicine at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, is also skeptical. He said marijuana impairs judgment, motor control and memory, and is linked to amotivational syndrome, which causes apathy and a decreased interest in activities.\n\n\u201cPatients smoking marijuana don\u2019t have the real motivation to do therapy to maintain long-term recovery or improve their lives,\u201d Lander told the AP.\n\nLander does agree with Leeds that there could be a possible short-term use for medical marijuana: easing the harsh withdrawal symptoms from tapering off buprenorphine, an opioid-like drug used by people in recovery to stave off cravings for heroin and prescription painkillers.\n\nLander said he is also open to the possibility of using CBD oil, which contains only tiny amounts of the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that makes user high if it\u2019s proven effective in treating addiction.\n\nOhio has had one of the highest per capita overdose deaths rates in the country with opioids largely contributing to more than 4,800 unintentional fatal overdoses last year. Leeds, who will ask the Medical Board to also add anxiety as a qualifying condition, noted that unlike opioids, it\u2019s virtually impossible to die from a marijuana overdose.\n\nIn suburban Dayton, John Helpling said he used a variety of prescription pain medications after lower back surgery in 2007 left him with peripheral neuropathy and a burning pain in his foot. The 57-year-old said pain pills \u201cpretty much make me feel useless.\u201d\n\nHe began a regimen of CBD oil and marijuana earlier this year and thinks he\u2019s on a path to putting his life back in order. He said he stopped taking prescription medications in April and has spoken with his doctor about obtaining legal cannabis products when they become available in Ohio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling better now,\u201d Helpling said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling more healthy. I feel like I have more purpose.\u201d\n\nCannabis products were supposed to become available on Sept. 8, but the date has been pushed back because of delays in the application and certification process for companies seeking to grow, test and sell marijuana products. Helpling said he\u2019d prefer buying legal medical marijuana that has been tested for impurities and toxic pesticides, something not guaranteed in marijuana purchased off the street.\n\nLeeds acknowledges there is limited data on whether cannabis can help treat opioid addiction and said doctors will have to consider \u201cwhat the lesser evil might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to approach this with some trepidation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t pretend this drug has no value.

President Donald Trump insists his new North American trade deal will deliver a victory for U.S. factory workers by returning many high-paying jobs to the United States. Maybe. But a review of the agreement suggests that job gains for the U.S. would likely mean higher prices for consumers and more inefficiencies for businesses. The biggest winners might end up being robots and the companies that make them.(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump insists his new North American trade deal will deliver a victory for U.S. factory workers by returning many high-paying jobs to the United States.\n\nMaybe. But a review of the agreement suggests that it could also mean higher prices for consumers and more inefficiencies for businesses. And the biggest winners might end up being robots and the companies that make them.\n\nAs Americans vote in the midterm elections, Trump is heralding the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as a triumph for his antagonistic trade policy \u2014 an approach that he says will usher in \u201ca new dawn for the American auto industry and the American auto worker.\u201d\n\nThe pact, unveiled Sept. 30, does appear to meet some of Trump\u2019s goals: It could shift more factory production to the United States, thereby reversing a long-standing flow of jobs to lower-wage Mexico. And it could result in better working conditions and perhaps higher pay for Mexico\u2019s long-suffering laborers.\n\nBut shifting away from a business model that relies on Mexican labor would likely mean higher-priced cars for American consumers. And North America\u2019s automakers could become less competitive compared with rivals in Europe and Asia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to keep North America competitive as a manufacturing hub,\u201d said Michael McAdoo of the Boston Consulting Group.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, much of the manufacturing work that does return to the United States would likely be done by robots in America\u2019s increasingly automated plants, not by human workers.\n\nThe deal \u2014 known by its acronym, USMCA \u2014 is meant to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trump had long condemned the 24-year-old NAFTA as a killer of American jobs. He even banished its name once the new deal was struck.\n\nNAFTA had erased most trade barriers separating the United States, Canada and Mexico. Trade among the three surged. But many U.S. manufacturers moved factories and jobs to Mexico to capitalize on cheaper labor. Those manufacturers could then ship cars and other goods back to the United States and Canada, duty-free.\n\nTrump demanded a new deal more favorable to American workers. Negotiations began in August 2017 and eventually produced USMCA.\n\n\u201cThese measures will support many hundreds of thousands of American jobs,\u201d Trump declared early last month.\n\nUSMCA isn\u2019t a done deal. It has yet to be signed by the leaders or ratified by the legislatures of the three countries. Some Democrats have expressed support for the pact. But if their party regains control of the U.S. House in Tuesday\u2019s elections, it\u2019s far from clear that its leaders would want to hand Trump a victory.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Canadian and Mexican lawmakers might think twice about ratifying the deal unless Trump frees them from the import taxes he\u2019s imposed on steel and aluminum in a separate dispute.\n\nTo qualify for duty-free benefits, USMCA requires carmakers to acquire 75 percent of auto content from within North America \u2014 up from 62.5 percent under NAFTA. That means more content would have to be homegrown in higher-wage North America, not imported more cheaply from elsewhere.\n\nAt least 40 percent of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least $16 an hour. That would likely benefit the United States or Canada \u2014 not Mexico, where auto assembly workers earn an average of just $7.34 an hour and parts workers $3.41 an hour.\n\nGladys Cisneros of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Solidarity Center, which advocates for unions, said she doubts the $16-an-hour wage requirement would do much for Mexican workers.\n\n\u201cNot a single auto parts or auto assembly plant pays that much\u201d in Mexico, Cisneros said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get them ... to $16 anytime soon.\u201d\n\nTony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, noted that for years Mexican governments sought to keep wages low to give their country a competitive edge.\n\n\u201cMost American leaders understood that,\u201d Payan said. \u201cThey simply didn\u2019t address it because it was good for business. Cheap labor was good for business.\u201d\n\nBut President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, wants to reform Mexican labor practices and raise wages.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump is finding here is a more receptive environment in Mexico to do exactly what he wants Mexico to do,\u201d Payan said\n\nUnder USMCA, Mexico is supposed to formally authorize workers to form independent unions. Mexican unions have traditionally been co-opted by employers and the government and done little for workers. Laborers have been fired for trying to bargain on their own for better pay and working conditions.\n\nA weak labor movement is one reason NAFTA didn\u2019t much help Mexicans despite the influx of jobs there. A study by the Colegio de Mexico found that the wage gap between the U.S. and Mexico actually widened under NAFTA. U.S. autoworkers made 5.4 times as much as their Mexican counterparts in 1994. By 2016, they were earning 9.1 times more.\n\nUnder NAFTA, workers were represented by \u201cbogus trade unions \u2014 very corrupt,\u201d said Jesus Seade, who represented the incoming Lopez Obrador administration in the USMCA talks. \u201cNow, all that is going out the window.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe. Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray told The Associated Press that the agreement doesn\u2019t oblige Mexico to do much beyond implementing a vague constitutional amendment requiring workers to have a say in labor contracts.\n\nWhether conditions truly improve for Mexican workers depends on whether the Lopez Obrador administration pursues \u201crobust and really thoughtful labor reform that allows workers to collectively bargain,\u201d Cisneros said.\n\nIn the meantime, businesses are studying the agreement to determine what it could mean for their operations and supply chains.\n\nSome companies may move operations from Mexico to the United States. Others might decide that the USMCA\u2019s duty-free benefits aren\u2019t worth the cost of complying with the 75 percent North American content requirement and producing more cars in higher-wage factories. And they have an alternative: They can ignore USMCA rules and just absorb the 2.5 percent car tariff that most countries pay to export to the United States under World Trade Organization rules.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether those companies could continue to pay only the 2.5 percent WTO tariff should Trump carry out a threat to impose tariffs of 20 percent to 25 percent on all autos imported to the United States. The U.S. and Mexico agreed that 2.6 million Mexican cars would be exempt from any such auto tariffs. But whether these exemptions would apply to cars that failed to meet USMCA standards isn\u2019t clear.\n\nIn such ways, the new trade pact \u2014 and any corporate maneuvering to bypass its requirements \u2014 could raise manufacturing costs in North America and put its factories at a disadvantage to Asian and European rivals.\n\n\u201cCompanies are evaluating where they can produce competitively in order to access emerging markets in Asia, South America and elsewhere,\u201d Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote in an assessment of the deal. \u201cClunky new rules and higher costs make America, Mexico and Canada a considerably less attractive hub.\u201d\n\nEven if the new pact does help return some production to the United States, it\u2019s unclear that it would produce many jobs. America\u2019s factories are increasingly automated.\n\n\u201cThe United States continues to be a manufacturing powerhouse, but manufacturing jobs are increasingly rare,\u201d said Rice\u2019s Payan. \u201cRobots are doing the work.\u201d\n\nAfter studying USMCA, in fact, investment strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute predicted that \u201cthe long-term winners will be companies in the automation and robotics space.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Wiseman on Twitter at https://twitter.com/PaulWisemanAP", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic U.S. Rep.

But Republicans, including current Gov. John Kasich, have held the district for more than 35 years. GOP President Donald Trump won it in 2016 by more than 10 points.\n\nDemocrats had high hopes in southwest Ohio\u2019s 1st House district, after Aftab Pureval emerged as a rising star with a major local upset in 2016 for Hamilton County clerk of courts. Challenging GOP Rep. Steve Chabot, Pureval has drawn national Democratic support, millions in campaign funds, and extra attention as the son of immigrants from India.\n\nPureval says it\u2019s time for change and new ideas in Washington. In a recent debate, Chabot, 65, called Pureval, 36, a \u201chandsome guy\u201d with \u201ca great smile.\u201d Chabot, seeking a 12th term, described their race as between a show horse and himself, a workhorse.\n\nPureval\u2019s campaign has been beset by miscues, leading to the final-week ouster of his campaign manager and other staffers.\n\nElsewhere, Democratic candidates are hoping for a \u201cblue wave\u201d of politically energized women and other voters repulsed by Trump\u2019s rhetoric and style.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of people with buyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d Gasper said, referring to Trump.\n\nEast of Cincinnati, first-time candidate Jill Schiller has stayed energetic against third-term Republican Rep.

(AP) \u2014 Rhode Island\u2019s two representatives in the U.S. House say they\u2019re asking voters for another term so they can continue to fight for the state.\n\nDemocratic Reps. James Langevin and David Cicilline said they feel they have unfinished business in Washington, whether that\u2019s making health care and prescription drugs more affordable, rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure or trying to reduce gun violence.\n\nLangevin faces Republican Salvatore Caiozzo on Tuesday, and Cicilline faces Republican Patrick Donovan.\n\nLangevin, of Warwick, is seeking a 10th term to represent the 2nd Congressional District in western Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cI want to continue the fight on behalf of Rhode Island for a stronger middle class, better jobs with higher wages, affordable health care, quality education, the things that make a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Langevin said in a recent interview.\n\nLangevin is particularly proud of a bill he pushed for to strengthen career and technical education, and he would like to remain in Congress to help ensure it\u2019s robustly implemented. He also won support for measures to provide better support for caregivers of veterans, to better protect people with disabilities as they travel, and to ensure climate change is addressed as part of the national security strategy.\n\nHe has prioritized protecting the national and economic security against cyberthreats as co-chairman of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus.\n\nCaiozzo, a retired businessman from West Greenwich, ran for the seat in 2016 as an independent, finishing last. Caiozzo says that Rhode Island \u201cdeserves better\u201d and that he wants to go to Washington to help its residents, particularly veterans, the elderly and the disabled.\n\nHe has told voters that he is neither left nor right, that he\u2019s a moderate and that he could solve problems in Washington.\n\n\u201cI want to be the voice of Rhode Island in Washington,\u201d Caiozzo said Wednesday.\n\nCaiozzo wants to support the state\u2019s fishing and farming industries, reduce federal intervention in state education policy and reform Social Security to ensure it\u2019s fully funded.\n\nLangevin has raised $1 million this election cycle and spent nearly $700,000, according to federal filings.\n\nCaiozzo raised $5,000. He thinks Republican donors are focused more on Rhode Island\u2019s gubernatorial race.\n\nCicilline, of Providence, is seeking his fifth term in Congress representing the 1st Congressional District, which covers the easternmost part of the state. He faces Donovan, a stay-at-home father of four grown children who lives in Newport.\n\nCicilline has a rising profile in the national Democratic Party. He plans to run for assistant Democratic leader if he is re-elected and his party retakes the House. He is outspoken in his criticism of the president on topics such as immigration and Russia.\n\nDemocrats will prioritize addressing the rising cost of health care, particularly prescription drugs, investing in infrastructure and reforming how money is spent in elections, Cicilline said. He is also trying to make college affordable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to deliver real results for Rhode Island, and I\u2019d love to have the privilege of doing that for two more years,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure Rhode Island\u2019s voice is heard in Washington and continue to get things done for my constituents.\u201d\n\nA proposal Cicilline has been working on for years to help manufacturers was signed into law this year. It allows the federal government to designate defense manufacturing communities, to strengthen national security innovation.\n\nCicilline is proud he was able to help name a post office in Bristol after an Army Green Beret who was killed in Afghanistan, 1st Sgt. P. Andrew McKenna, and proud of successfully securing federal funding for local first responders and other groups.\n\nDonovan has tried to cast himself as someone who would be more attuned to residents\u2019 needs. He said he would prioritize lowering the cost of energy by using readily available renewable energy, to help working people who are struggling. He wants to pursue purchasing power from Hydro-Quebec.\n\nHe describes himself as an \u201cenvironmental Republican\u201d and said he\u2019d change the way prescription drugs are disposed of, both to protect the environment and prevent misuse.\n\nHe says he would also work to lower the price of prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be of service to your congressional district, and you\u2019re supposed to do good,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cMy intention is to do no harm to my constituency.\u201d\n\nCicilline has raised about $1.5 million this election cycle and spent $1.3 million, according to federal filings. Donovan said he hasn\u2019t filed a federal report because he has raised less than $5,000.", "LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Tom Thurman had two-time United States poet laureate Natasha Trethewey booked to come from Chicago to Lexington to do an interview for the new documentary he was making for KET.\n\nWhen he contacted her to see if all of the travel arrangements were in order, she replied, \u201cyes, I am actually going to come.\u201d Her response struck Thurman as an odd way to put it.\n\nThen Trethewey volunteered that her house had burned down that week, and she and her family were essentially homeless. At one point, she was wandering around a CVS looking for toiletries and clothes. But she was determined to still make the trip.\n\n\u201cDuring all this chaos and upheaval she came down here anyway, because it was that important to her to be in the documentary, because she loves Robert Penn Warren and admires him that much. It was a testament to how much she believes in his work and how much he contributed to American letters,\u201d Thurman recalls.\n\nIn a state that has produced dozens of literary lions past and present, the Western Kentucky native is at a level all his own.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Kentucky authors, it\u2019s really hard to argue against Robert Penn Warren being at the top of the mountain,\u201d Thurman says. \u201cHe\u2019s the only writer in American history to win a Pulitzer Prize in fiction and poetry, and he won two in poetry. You can certainly say he is the most acclaimed Kentucky writer.\u201d\n\nAnd Thurman knows from Kentucky artists, having produced short- and full-length documentaries about a wide variety of Kentuckians, including actor Harry Dean Stanton, Centre College glass artist Stephen Rolfe Powell and the Louisville-based musical hybrid band Appalatin.\n\nThurman\u2019s latest project was born out of a re-read of a timeless classic, \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men,\u201d Warren\u2019s novel about populist Southern Governor Willie Stark.\n\n\u201cThe sheer force of the language prompted me more than anything else,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cNaturally, when people talk about \u2018All the King\u2019s Men,\u2019 they gravitate toward talking about the plot. But when you distance yourself from the actual story and just look at the elevation of the language combined with the very earthy nature of the characters and the dialogue, that combination is what prompted me to pursue this project further.\u201d\n\nFor an example, during a recent interview, Thurman recites a line: \u201cMan is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud. There is always something.\u201d\n\nSo, he pitched the idea of Warren documentary to KET, and the network said yes. It premieres Monday night on KET.\n\nThe film lead to a deep dive into Warren that went well beyond the iconic novel, which became an almost equally acclaimed 1949 movie that won three Oscars including best picture and best actor for Broderick Crawford as Willie Stark.\n\nAfter all, the title, \u201cRobert Penn Warren: A Vision\u201d is borrowed from Warren\u2019s book-length poem about naturist, artist and fellow Kentuckian John James Audubon.\n\nWarren started writing poetry as a teenager in Guthrie, near the Tennessee border and went on to study at Vanderbilt, the University of California at Berkeley, Yale and ultimately Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Exploring his career, Thurman started down many paths he did not anticipate.\n\n\u201cHe wrote very eloquently on race in this country,\u201d Thurman says of Warren. \u201cThat was a focus I didn\u2019t think initially I would be exploring, but as I dug deeper into his work and read books like \u2018The Legacy of the Civil War,\u2019 \u2018Segregation: The Inner Conflict in the South,\u2019 and then the book \u2018Who Speaks for the Negro,\u2019 that became more and more important to me to explore those works.\u201d\n\nAnd he found a distinct evolution from Warren\u2019s early essay, \u201cThe Briar Patch,\u201d which defended racial segregation in the 1930s agrarian collection \u201cI\u2019ll Take My Stand,\u201d to later works that recanted those views and soberly considered \u201cthe burden of the past on the present,\u201d as TV producer and former Warren student David Milch puts it in the film.\n\nIn addition to gathering voices such as Trethewey and Milch, as well as Kentucky figures such as poet Frank X Walker, the film lead Thurman to nuggets such as 41 reels of home movies from the 1940s and \u201950s at Western Kentucky University\u2019s Robert Penn Warren Center and interviews Warren did on \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show.\u201d\n\nThe latter was extremely valuable for getting Warren\u2019s own voice in the film, a bit of a trick as Thurman notes Warren wasn\u2019t talk show hopping like contemporaries such as Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote in the 1960s and \u201970s.\n\n\u201cThe lack of pretense in his presentation on \u2018Dick Cavett\u2019 was striking,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cHe was also very eloquent in talking about his upbringing in Western Kentucky and how he was so fond of his grandfather, who fought in the Civil War and would explain military strategies in the dirt with a stick, whether it was Civil War strategy or ancient Roman times.\u201d\n\nOne of Thurman\u2019s discoveries was his ambition was to be a Pacific fleet admiral, but he was blinded in one eye in an accident, which disqualified him for military service.\n\n\u201cSo Robert Penn Warren read those thousands of books and wrote those books with one eye,\u201d Thurman said.\n\nOf course, the most famous of those books has come up many times in discussions of the current political landscape, though Thurman says the film was not intended to push any particular agendas. The themes of \u201cAll the King\u2019s Men\u201d are timeless, he says. Whether it\u2019s a coincidence or planned, the KET premiere Monday will come right after KET\u2019s forum with 6th Congressional District candidates Republican incumbent Andy Barr and Democratic challenger Amy McGrath.\n\n\u201cPeople have described \u2018All the King\u2019s Men\u2019 as the great American political novel, and in that regard, I think it will remain relevant permanently when we discuss the American political landscape,\u201d Thurman says.\n\nAnd Thurman wants his film to be timeless as well.\n\n\u201cMy job is to tell a story about Robert Penn Warren\u2019s life and his work in the hope that it will inspire people to read or reread his work and draw their own conclusions. \u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com", "1 of 6 This undated photo shows the entrance to Bell Witch cave in Adams, Tenn., reportedly where the witch that haunted the Bell family for three to four years starting in 1817 retreated to after the disturbances ceased. (Rick Perry/The Tennessean via AP)\n\nADAMS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The legend of the Bell Witch has been passed down through generations in Tennessee for more than 200 years. Today, the story of one of the state\u2019s most famous hauntings lives on through the work of Bell Witch historian and author Pat Fitzhugh. And, according to one descendant of the Bell family, the witch herself remains a part of the family\u2019s life.\n\nFitzhugh shared his telling of the Bell Witch legend in Brownsville on Friday, Oct. 26, speaking to a full room of believers, skeptics and one direct descendant of the infamous John Bell \u2014 Lucy Bell, now Lucy Butler. Born and raised in Memphis, Butler said she grew up hearing the stories of the Bell Witch and wanted to hear Fitzhugh\u2019s version of the legend that is so ingrained in her family\u2019s history.\n\nThe legendary haunting that has since become the basis for multiple television productions and the Hollywood film \u201cThe American Haunting\u201d began with John Bell in an area called Red River, Tennessee \u2014 now called Adams \u2014 in 1817.\n\nWhile tending his farm, Bell reportedly saw a strange animal \u2014 what appeared to be a black dog with the head of a rabbit. In the coming weeks, Bell, his wife Lucy and his children began to hear pounding noises on the outside of their cabin, Fitzhugh, author of \u201cThe Bell Witch Haunting\u201d and \u201cThe Bell Witch: The Full Account,\u201d told the crowd. These escalated to voices and eventually the entity \u2014 which would be called a \u201cspirit\u201d by a local preacher \u2014 began to act out physically, throwing pillows across rooms, tugging on the children\u2019s bed sheets and physically assaulting Betsy Bell, John Bell\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe family kept the haunting to themselves, perhaps out of fear of retaliation from a staunch Baptist community, Fitzhugh said.\n\n\u201cWould you call for help?\u201d Fitzhugh asked. \u201cNot if you were an elder of the Red River Baptist Church, only 125 years after the Salem Witch Trials, and in the buckle of the Bible Belt.\u201d\n\nEventually, John Bell shared his experiences with one of his closest friends, and the two went to a local preacher for help. All three men swore to keep the seemingly supernatural experiences a secret, but just weeks later, people from Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky were traveling to the Bell farm to see the house and the family for themselves, Fitzhugh said. And this made the haunting worse.\n\n\u201cThe more people who tried to talk to this thing ... the more attention it was paid, the louder it became, as though it was feeding off of people\u2019s fear,\u201d Fitzhugh said.\n\nAccording to Fitzhugh\u2019s research into the legend, the entity began beating the children and tripping adults with greater intensity. Its voice became more clear, at times low and melodic and at others a shrill screech. And it announced its intention: to kill John Bell.\n\n\u201cMr. Bell is a bad man,\u201d the entity purportedly said, according to Fitzhugh.\n\nThe identity of the entity that reportedly tormented the Bell family is widely disputed. According to legend, the entity itself gave multiple answers about who it was and why it was haunting the Bell family.\n\nIn one case, it claimed to be the spirit of a Native American whose grave had been disrupted by one of the Bell boys, Fitzhugh said. At a different time, it claimed it was the doing of the Bell family\u2019s neighbor, Kate Batts. This story stuck, and the Bell Witch is often referred to as \u201cKate.\u201d\n\nFitzhugh said Kate Batts was an outcast in the Red River community, having little money and doing the majority of the hard physical labor on her family\u2019s farm for her husband, who was paralyzed in an accident. She had a habit of trying to impress people, making a scene and trying to be the center of attention, Fitzhugh said.\n\nBatts strongly denied any connection to the haunting, but the entity began responding to the name Kate.\n\nThe name \u201cBell Witch\u201d is said to have been coined by President Andrew Jackson after he came to the Bell home for an exploratory visit. Some of the Bell children had fought with Jackson when he was a general, and Jackson owned land not far from the Bell\u2019s homestead, Fitzhugh said. According to legend, when Jackson and his men arrived at the Bell farm, the horses refused to cross the property line until a disembodied voice allowed them passage.\n\nThe entity was largely absent from Jackson\u2019s visit, only attacking one of Jackson\u2019s men when he commented that the witch was scared of him because he had a silver bullet called the \u201cwitch tamer\u201d in his pistol, Fitzhugh said.\n\nBut Fitzhugh himself said he doesn\u2019t believe this story; Jackson had good reason to visit the Bells, he said, but an encounter with the spirit is unlikely. Fitzhugh said he has yet to find any reputable record of Jackson\u2019s alleged visit, except for one contested manuscript titled \u201cOur Family Trouble,\u201d by Richard William Bell.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Bell Witch story,\u201d Fitzhugh said. \u201cControversy after controversy after controversy. There\u2019s never a dull moment.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the Bell family\u2019s initial four-year ordeal with the Bell Witch, John Bell became seriously ill, Fitzhugh said.\n\nBell, who was approaching his seventies, began struggling to eat, claiming that it was difficult for him to swallow. He suffered frequent episodes that would likely be classified as seizures today, Fitzhugh said. He believes that Bell actually suffered from a disorder of the central nervous system. According to legend, the witch laughed at Bell\u2019s misfortunes.\n\n\u201cThe entity, nicknamed Kate, had quite the personality,\u201d Fitzhugh said. \u201cEven though most of the time it was talking ugly and cursing, there were times she would laugh, and it was usually at someone\u2019s misery.\u201d\n\nJohn Bell died in 1820 at the age of 70. Legend says John Bell\u2019s son, John Bell Jr., found poison next to his bed. The Bell Witch is believed to have poisoned Bell and reportedly laughed and sang at his deathbed and during his funeral, Fitzhugh said.\n\nThe haunting died down after John Bell\u2019s death, until the entity turned its attention to Betsy, who was newly engaged to a man named Joshua Gardener. The witch\u2019s antics eventually convinced Betsy to break off her engagement to Gardener, who later moved to West Tennessee.\n\nHe became a county sheriff and justice of the peace in the Henry County area and ended up in Weakley County, where he and his brother started a railroad, Fitzhugh said. He died wealthy at the age of 84.\n\nThe Bell Witch disappeared for a time before coming back to say that she would return in seven years, Fitzhugh said. When she returned to John Bell Jr. in 1828, she is said to have spoken to him for three nights about the past, present and future. She then said she would return to John Bell\u2019s most direct descendant in 107 years, in 1935. But no tales from 1935 forward exist as part of the original legend.\n\n\u201cSome say she did return, but most people say she never left the place,\u201d Fitzhugh said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been there and always will be, and there\u2019s always something going on there.\u201d\n\nLucy (Bell) Butler is a direct descendant of John Bell Jr., named after John Bell\u2019s wife, Lucy. Lucy Bell was allegedly one of only three people the witch actually liked. Butler said that stories of the witch were part of her childhood.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty interesting because things did happen, and we would just naturally turn and say, oh, the Bell Witch did that,\u201d Butler said.\n\nButler said she believes that the witch is not confined within the limits of the Bell family\u2019s farm in Adams, but follows her family wherever they go.\n\nShe said she and her daughter Jennifer have seen the black dog in the original legend, and when Jennifer was growing up, they often saw a giggling girl running around their house at night.\n\n\u201cI was thinking that might have been the Bell Witch ... that would have been the sweet side of her,\u201d Butler said. The little girl would play with Jennifer\u2019s toys, and the family dog was not afraid of her, Butler said. \u201cShe stayed, she would come out at night, and she was sweet and giggled. (She) would watch over Jennifer,\u201d she said.\n\nNot everyone in Butler\u2019s family believed in the witch or wanted to talk about the legend. Butler said her grandfather, a Methodist preacher, refused to allow one word about Kate to be spoken in his presence. But Butler said she thinks this could be because of a negative experience he might have had with the entity.\n\n\u201cI can go through the bad people in my family and see things that have happened and why, and then I see the good things,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBecause the Bell Witch, Kate, whoever you want to call her, she did have a good side ... to the people she liked.\u201d\n\nButler said the entity did not like her father, a smooth-talking, good-looking actor in Memphis who happened to have some alleged involvement with the Florida mafia. Butler recalls one incident that happened when she was a child just before her father was about to host a gathering at their home. Butler\u2019s father had purchased a stereo system, a considerable luxury in the 1960s. Butler said she walked downstairs to find her living room filled with thousands of crickets marching toward the music room, where they climbed into the stereo system and ruined it.\n\n\u201cI think she punished the people that needed to be punished,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut I think she also took care of the ones that she liked.\u201d\n\nButler\u2019s husband, Larry Butler, was skeptical of the story at first. In fact, he even drove out to the Bell farm with a Bible in hand to confront the supposed witch in a cave on the property. The cave was closed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it was,\u201d Larry said.\n\nHe recalls one strange incident he witnessed while he was alone in Lucy\u2019s apartment. He said the jewelry Lucy had hanging up in her bedroom started shaking, so he investigated to see if an air vent could be causing movement. Finding nothing, he retreated to the living room. A tassel hanging from a lamp started spinning rapidly in circles, Larry said.\n\n\u201cI said, that\u2019s it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSaturday morning, daylight, I walked out. (Lucy) had the whole month\u2019s rent paid, (but) I moved them out of there. It freaked me out.\u201d\n\nNeither Larry nor Lucy has experienced anything since, they said. Lucy considers herself to be a devout believer in God and prays every morning, but she said that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t also believe that the Bell Witch still exists.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a lot of people that don\u2019t believe in her, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got their personal opinion. I just believe it ... I\u2019m sure the stories I heard growing up helped, but I saw a lot of things. Things happened. I was there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Jackson Sun, http://www.jacksonsun.com", "Alabama schools get new students from Florida after Michael\n\nDOTHAN, Ala.

It's one of two proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot this year. (AP Photo/Susan Haigh)\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 The fate of two proposed amendments to the state constitution will be decided Tuesday by Connecticut voters, who will see the questions on their ballots with races for governor, Congress and other offices.\n\nOne asks whether to create a so-called lockbox to keep money designated for transportation projects from being spent elsewhere. Another asks whether to place limits on the General Assembly when it attempts to transfer or sell state-owned property to a non-state entity.\n\nConnecticut last had a ballot question in 2014, when voters rejected a proposed amendment that could have allowed early voting.\n\nSome highlights of this year\u2019s ballot questions:\n\n____\n\nTRANSPORTATION LOCKBOX\n\nThe concept of protecting money generated from transportation-related taxes and fees has been debated for years in the General Assembly. A coalition of labor organizations, environmental groups and transportation organizations has been pushing for the change.\n\nLawmakers passed resolutions in 2015 and 2017 that led to the proposed state constitutional amendment appearing on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. If voters approve the proposed amendment, the change will become part of the state constitution.\n\nThere\u2019s been some criticism the lockbox concept would not prevent future raids, but proponents including Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and Republican Senate Leader Len Fasano argue it\u2019s a good start. Fasano has argued the lockbox is needed to bring \u201cpredictability and stability\u201d to Connecticut\u2019s infrastructure spending, something businesses have been seeking.\n\n\u201cIs this perfect? No. But you can\u2019t let the perfect get in the way of the good,\u201d Fasano said.\n\nThe change would preserve the state\u2019s Special Transportation Fund as a permanent fund and require the money be used exclusively for transportation purposes, including paying transportation-related debt.\n\nThere\u2019s been no real organized opposition to the lockbox amendment.\n\n__\n\nSTATE LAND TRANSFERS\n\nA hotly contested bill that would have allowed private developers to acquire 17 acres of state-owned land in Haddam was the impetus for a proposed constitutional amendment placing limits on the transfer and sale of state-owned property.\n\nUnder the so-called Haddam land swap deal, which ultimately fizzled in 2012, the property overlooking the Connecticut River would have been swapped for 87 wooded acres owned by developers.\n\nEnvironmental and conservation groups have since pushed for a constitutional change that would require a public hearing before any property is transferred to a non-state entity by the General Assembly. If the property is controlled by the state Departments of Agriculture or Energy and Environmental Protection, the legislature would have to approve it by a two-thirds majority in both chambers.\n\nConservation groups say 270,000 acres of state-owned forests and parks are at risk under the current system, which allows the General Assembly to hand over ownership. Eric Hammerling, executive director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, has said any measure short of a constitutional amendment could be circumvented by lawmakers.\n\nThere was some opposition to the constitutional amendment during the legislative debate, with some lawmakers warning of unintended consequences by requiring public hearings.\n\n__\n\nWHERE TO FIND THE QUESTIONS\n\nSome voters will have to turn over their election ballot to find the two questions.\n\nThere are 29 cities and towns where there will be two-sided ballots, according to the secretary of the state\u2019s office. In some communities, the ballot questions may be on the second side.\n\nEach polling place will have copies of the proposed amendments and an explanation.", "", "GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J.

Guzman's trial is set to begin Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, with jury selection. Opening statements are expected on Nov. 13. (U.S. law enforcement via AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 He is accused of having a hand in dozens of murders, of using his drug cartel to smuggle more than 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, even pulling off running the massive operation from behind bars. That\u2019s when he wasn\u2019t busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns at his upcoming New York City trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case\u2019s sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns for a trial that is starting Monday with jury selection. Opening statements are likely Nov. 13.\n\n___\n\nWITNESSES IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defense says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their cooperation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to cooperate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman\u2019s asks, \u201cHow much can you get rid of in a month?\u201d\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\n___\n\nFORTIFYING THE COURTHOUSE\n\nAt pretrial hearings leading to the trial, heavily armed federal officers and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled outside. Anyone trying to attend the hearings was put through airport-style metal detectors at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself.\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one\u2019s hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they\u2019ve ever heard of \u201cEl Chapo\u201d along with, \u201cHave you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\u201d\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors\u2019 contention that Guzman\u2019s cartel \u201cemploys \u2018sicarios,\u2019 or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKEEPING AN EYE ON EL CHAPO\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman\u2019s history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a mile-long (1.6 kilometer-long) tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe logistical problem for his keepers: The case is being prosecuted across the East River in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nFor pre-trial hearings, authorities opted to transport him to and from jail by shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge to make way for a police motorcade that included a SWAT team and an ambulance, all tracked by helicopters.\n\nThe judge indicated he thinks the time and expense involved would add up to a logistical nightmare \u2014 and an inconvenience for New Yorkers who rely on the bridge to commute \u2014 for a trial expected to last as long as four months. He said there would be adjustments, but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nThere\u2019s now speculation that a special cell for Guzman has been set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the night after his days in court.\n\nBut no one is saying.

Only at the end does it really get around to food with the words: \u201cThen, we will cook and serve and be happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe team is number one and that is who we are as a company,\u201d said Shaya, explaining the genesis of his and his wife\u2019s new venture, Pomegranate Hospitality , which includes restaurants in New Orleans and Denver, and the environment he hopes to create for the company\u2019s nearly 150 employees.\n\nDiscussions about new restaurants generally revolve around the food. And at Saba the piping hot pita bread or the blue crab hummus is discussion-worthy. But long before the first plate of shakshouka was served, Shaya and his team focused on how to create an inclusive work environment different than the toxic restaurant workplaces exposed by the #MeToo movement.\n\nJust over a year ago, Shaya was part owner and executive chef of three restaurants in the Besh Restaurant Group, headed by New Orleans chef John Besh, including his James Beard-awarding winning namesake Israeli restaurant.\n\nThen a story in NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune detailed allegations of sexual misconduct in Besh\u2019s company, causing Besh to step down. Shaya wasn\u2019t personally accused of misconduct but the story detailed allegations of harassment at two of his restaurants. Shaya was quoted in the story about concerns he had over BRG\u2019s then-lack of a human resources department. Shaya has said that\u2019s what led to his firing \u2014 something Besh\u2019s company disputed. A messy legal battle ensued during which Shaya lost all rights to his namesake restaurant.\n\nFast forward to current day: Shaya sits at Saba discussing the policies and procedures Pomegranate has put in place to ensure a safe working environment.\n\nThe interview process includes questions way beyond whether a person has waited tables before (\u2018What was the last gift you bought for somebody?\u2019). Management holds 30- and 90-day chats with new employees and then every six months. The restaurants are closed Monday and Tuesday so everyone has a guaranteed two days in a row off.\n\nWomen populate high-profile roles including executive chef in New Orleans. About 60 percent of each restaurant\u2019s staff is women. They\u2019ve adopted ideas from other restaurants including a system used by Erin Wade at the Oakland, California-based Homeroom to deal with sexual harassment and a code of conduct for guest chefs used by Raleigh, N.C.-based restaurateur Ashley Christiansen.\n\nService is limited during 2:30 to 4 p.m. so the staff can sit together for a meal, often accompanied by staff presentations to their co-workers. Some topics are work-related. But employees are also encouraged to share what interests them. During a recent session, cook Timmy Harris talked to the waiters, managers, and cooks about existentialism, Southern literature and author Walker Percy.\n\n\u201cIt kind of drives home the point that this is a place for people to develop themselves. It\u2019s not just a restaurant. We\u2019re not just slinging pita,\u201d Harris said after.\n\nShaya said he can\u2019t talk much about what happened while working at BRG for legal reasons but says now that he and his wife own their company they\u2019re able to create the structure they want.\n\n\u201cEven in our restaurants someone will be inappropriate at some point,\u201d Shaya said. \u201cAnd I know that when that happens people are going to jump on it because people have really bought into the values.\u201d\n\nExperts say many issues have contributed to sexual misconduct in the restaurant industry, including a tipping structure that can inhibit servers \u2014 often women \u2014 from complaining about out-of-line customers, little training for managers and high turnover. Restaurants\u2019 small size \u2014 often family-owned or single units \u2014 has historically meant they don\u2019t have strong HR policies, said Juan Madera, an associate professor at the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management.\n\nAllegations of sexual misconduct at restaurants and the wider #MeToo discussion have been a \u201cwakeup call for restaurants,\u201d Madera said. He\u2019s hearing from restaurant associations and others who want to figure out how to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nRaleigh, N.C.-based chef and restaurateur Ashley Christiansen, who talked with Shaya about his new venture, says a restaurant\u2019s HR presence is as important as the food or the linen service. She says it\u2019s difficult to measure how much progress has been made across the industry since the growth of the #MeToo movement, but she sees cause for optimism.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s the thing I talk about more than food now, and I think that\u2019s a positive thing,\u201d she said.\n\nShaya says his new venture hasn\u2019t been without problems. He\u2019s fired one person who was cursing at another employee. But he\u2019s also been inspired by staff members calling out someone who makes an off-color joke or not tolerating negativity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken it down to the very basics of kindness, and we stick to it and I feel that we\u2019ve attracted a lot of people who believe in that,\u201d he said.\n\n__\n\nFollow Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.", "MONTPELIER, Vt.

Bukaty, File)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 The battle over who will represent Maine in the largest congressional district east of the Mississippi River is the most expensive political race in state history, leading to more television campaign ads than any other state and underscoring millions of dollars of so-called \u201cdark money\u201d pouring into the race.\n\nThat boils down to a rate of 26 commercials per hour, or about one every two minutes, according to the Wesleyan Media Project.\n\nBut whether those never-ending ads fueling the Democrat and Republican duking it out in Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District will sway voters is unclear with a few days to go before the state\u2019s Tuesday election.\n\n\u201cThere are a ton of ads. It\u2019s pretty shocking how many ads there are,\u201d said John Hafford, a business owner in Medway. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m most alarmed with is how negative it\u2019s become. It\u2019s getting pretty rough out there.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. House race in the 2nd District, which covers most of the state and is overwhelmingly rural, has already broken records to become the most expensive in the state\u2019s history, with over $12 million in spending by outside groups so far.\n\nThat includes $2.3 million spent by liberal Patriot Majority USA, a nonprofit that doesn\u2019t have to disclose who funded its ads against Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin. The congressman has tried to use misgivings about such spending to his advantage and argues that Democrats who have long railed about big money in politics are playing the same games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s millions and millions of dollars pouring into this race from Nancy Pelosi, the extreme radical from San Francisco, or Maxine Waters. All this dark money,\u201d Poliquin said, in a recent campaign ad.\n\nHis challenger, Democratic state Rep. Jared Golden, who has decried dark money and distanced himself from Pelosi, recently vowed to require such groups to disclose their donors. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to House Speaker Paul Ryan and funded partly by untraceable money, has spent $3 million to oppose Golden.\n\n\u201cA huge amount of money is going into that race. That tells you how close the race is, how important the race is, not just in Maine but nationally,\u201d said Mark Brewer, a political scientist at the University of Maine.\n\nMeanwhile, at the state level, Democrats boosted by hard-to-trace money still have the spending advantage over Republicans with a few days to go before Election Day. National liberal groups like the Democratic Governors Association and the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee have contributed heavily in Maine, partly in hopes of gain influence in redistricting following the 2020 census in Maine.\n\nDemocrats \u2014 who currently boast just 13 governors \u2014 also hope to win the governor\u2019s mansion and the state Senate, which Republicans currently control 18-17.\n\nState campaign finance records show $9.6 million has been spent to boost Democratic candidates for state office, compared with $3.6 million spent helping Republicans.\n\nAt least $1.6 million in contributions to Maine races this year comes directly from groups that don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, including the League of Conservation Voters and Planned Parenthood\u2019s advocacy arm.\n\nDemocrats have outspent Republicans in Maine in recent years, and that hasn\u2019t always meant victory. While polling suggests frustration among some Mainers toward President Trump and outgoing GOP Gov. Paul LePage, the increasingly polarized state\u2019s vast 2nd Congressional District gave a historic single electoral vote to Trump in 2016.\n\nIn 2014, outside spending totaled $14.6 million in Maine state-level races. That year, $4.7 million was spent boosting Republican candidates, compared with $9.9 million on Democrats.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Sharp contributed to this report.", "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.

Her phrase \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being sick and tired\u201d was a rallying cry for the movement.\n\nOn Aug. 22, 1964, Hamer testified at the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City in opposition to the seating of an all-white Mississippi delegation. Although her efforts were defeated, her testimony was broadcast nationally. One year later, the Voting Rights Act was passed.\n\nStockton\u2019s Board of Trustees approved the naming of the event space in December. The proposal was developed by Distinguished Professor of Social Work and Africana Studies Patricia Reid-Merritt and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and Religion Joseph Walsh.\n\nHigh, who worked for many years as executive assistant to former Stockton President Vera King Farris and is now a member of the Stockton Foundation Board, said she thinks the college is playing a leadership role in highlighting Hamer\u2019s efforts.\n\nCity Councilman Kaleem Shabazz, who filled in for Mayor Frank Gilliam, said he was also at the 1964 convention, protesting outside on a soapbox at the age of 16. After the dedication, Shabazz said he didn\u2019t know at the time that history was taking place.\n\n\u201cThis is a good day. Fannie Lou Hamer is someone we need to continue to lift up,\u201d Shabazz said. \u201cThat fight that Fannie Lou Hamer led, we are still fighting and we have to continue to fight.\u201d\n\nThe dedication included a musical performance by Stockton Professor of Music Beverly Vaughn, who said the dedication was significant for the college and for Atlantic City.\n\n\u201cFor Stockton to take a stand, I think that\u2019s sending out a message,\u201d she said.\n\nThe event included a video message from Hamer\u2019s daughter, Jackie Hamer Flakes.\n\n\u201cMy mother would have loved to be here for this occasion,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a huge blessing because when she was growing up she didn\u2019t have a chance to get the education that is afforded to our young people these days.\u201d\n\nStockton President Harvey Kesselman said the university previously had not named an event space for someone who was not affiliated with the university.\n\n\u201cAnd who better ought we begin that tradition with,\u201d Kesselman said.\n\nHe said he hopes Stockton will stand for the same principles as Hamer.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2P4Ixsx\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Press of Atlantic City (N.J.), http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com", "FILE - In this Aug. 25, 2018 file image made from video, a severely malnourished seven-year-old Amal Hussein \u2014 whose name means \"hope\" in Arabic, is weighed at the Aslam Health Center in Hajjah, Yemen.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nThe rebels, known as Houthis, said they repelled the latest offensive on Hodeida, killing or wounding 215 troops, but did not provide a breakdown. They said they destroyed 20 armored vehicles over the past 24 hours.\n\nFierce fighting also erupted in the provinces of Bayda, to the south, and Saada, a Houthi stronghold in the north, they added.\n\nThe offensive came despite recent calls by the Trump administration for a cease-fire by late November.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015 when the Houthis occupied northern regions and forced the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition supporting the largely exiled government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign, causing thousands of deaths. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\nThe coalition accuses the Houthis of acting as Iran\u2019s proxy.\n\nThe war has led to one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises. Three-quarters of Yemen\u2019s people require life-saving assistance, according to the U.N. Population Fund. An estimated 10,000 people have been killed and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation from a looming famine.\n\nThe regional director of the U.N. children\u2019s agency, Geert Cappelaere, said the warring sides in Yemen make it difficult to deliver and distribute humanitarian aid to the country.\n\nHe said the situation is a \u201cliving hell\u201d for all Yemeni children, singling out the death last week of 7-year-old Amal Hussein who had suffered from severe malnutrition.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Amal is not the only Yemeni child suffering that fate,\u201d he told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. \u201cThirty thousand children in Yemen die every single year of malnutrition as one of the most important underlying causes.

Voters in four states \u2014 Colorado and Montana in 2012 and California and Washington in 2016 \u2014 also approved questions aimed at nixing the court ruling.\n\nThe voters in those states essentially instructed their congressional delegations to support an amendment overturning Citizens United, without offer specific language. In Massachusetts, which doesn\u2019t allow statewide advisory questions, the referendum would take the step of creating a citizens commission to research the issue and suggest possible amendments.\n\nThe goal is to guarantee everyone has an equal shot at getting the ear of lawmakers \u2014 something he said the current political system fails to do, said Ben Gubits, political director for American Promise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long trend in our democracy working for the folks that make large campaign contributions \u2014 wealthy individuals, corporations and some unions \u2014 while the rest of the average citizens don\u2019t have a voice,\u201d he said.\n\nThe call to overturn Citizens United has bipartisan support, Gubits said. His group counts members of both parties on its advisory council, which includes former Wyoming U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican, and former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee for president in 1988, he said. Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren have said they will vote for the question.\n\nThe group disputes that laws limiting political spending violate the First Amendment, Gubits said, arguing money doesn\u2019t equal speech.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\nPaul Craney, spokesman for the conservative-leaning Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, said the ballot question is wrong-headed.\n\n\u201cIs money speech?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nBut increasingly, Craney said, money isn\u2019t the only way to amplify one\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cA lot of people out there have a big following on social media that can communicate with a lot of people, and it costs them nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo more and more you\u2019re starting to see that money is not the only way to have speech.\u201d\n\nThe Citizens United ruling helped make it easier for corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of money trying to persuade voters to cast their ballots for or against a candidate. While the ruling did not lift the ban on companies and unions giving money directly to candidates for federal office, it let them spend money trying to influence voters as long as the money was not being spent in coordination with a campaign.\n\nMany groups have ramped up their political spending without publicly disclosing the sources of their money by forming \u201cdark money\u201d groups classified as social welfare organizations by the IRS. They can advocate for or against a candidate, run phone banks and donate to so-called super PACs. The nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics has tallied about $133 million spent so far this election cycle with no disclosure of donors, compared with about $177 million spent in 2014\u2032s midterms.\n\nThe question would instruct the newly formed commission to recommend potential constitutional amendments to establish that corporations do not have the same constitutional rights as human beings and that campaign contributions and expenditures may be regulated.\n\nAny resident of Massachusetts who is a U.S. resident could apply to serve on the 15-member, unpaid commission. The governor, secretary of the commonwealth, attorney general, House speaker and Senate president would each appoint three members.\n\nLetting politicians appoint members is a problem, Craney said.\n\n\u201cWhenever you empower elected officials or politicians to regulate the public speech, the First Amendment is under attack,\u201d he said.\n\nThe main task of the commission would be to release a report that would take a look at the impact of political spending in Massachusetts and any limitations on the state\u2019s ability to regulate corporations and other entities in light of the Citizens United ruling.\n\nThe question also gives the commission the task of making recommendations for possible constitutional amendments and suggesting ways to advance those proposed amendments.\n\nThe proposed law would take effect Jan. 1, 2019. The commission\u2019s first report would be due by the end of December and would be delivered to Congress and the president.\n\nThe group is hoping new amendment could be added to the Constitution by 2026, Gubits said \u2014 a process that would require its approval by two-thirds of the U.S. House and Senate and ratification by three-fourths of the states, 38 in all.\n\n\u201cWe passed 12 amendments in the 20th century alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that we used to do just back when people wore powdered wigs.\u201d\n\nThere have been just 27 amendments added to the Constitution \u2014 including the first 10, the Bill of Rights, ratified in 1791.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "MADISON, Wis.

Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to seize House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s congressional seat that\u2019s been under Republican control for 23 years, reclaim the majority in the state Senate and retake the attorney general\u2019s office after more than a decade of GOP control.\n\nWhat to watch in Tuesday\u2019s election:\n\nTHIRD TERM OR SWAN SONG?\n\nWalker has won election to governor three times in eight years, including defeating a 2012 recall. Now he has his sights on winning a third term, a feat that would earn him a special place in state history; Republican Tommy Thompson is the only other Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term. But Walker is in the fight of his life against Democratic challenger Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent. With Democratic enthusiasm high, polls show the race is a toss-up. The two have argued over school funding, how to pay for road work and preserving health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n___\n\nSENATE RACE\n\nBaldwin is seeking her second term against Republican state Sen. Leah Vukmir, a nurse who has cast herself as a \u201cmom with a cause.\u201d She closely aligned herself with President Donald Trump while drawing stark contrasts with Baldwin on every major issue.

Baldwin, whose mother was addicted to painkillers, has admitted that mistakes were made in the response to Tomah, but she worked with the family of a veteran who died there to pass a bill addressing the problem. Baldwin has focused on health care, arguing that Vukmir\u2019s plans to vote for repealing the Affordable Care Act would be bad for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n___\n\nREPLACING RYAN\n\nDemocrats would like nothing more than to take Ryan\u2019s congressional seat representing southeastern Wisconsin. Ryan has held the seat for two decades, but he decided in April to retire at the end of this year. Democratic iron worker Randy Bryce and Ryan protege Bryan Steil are vying to fill the void. Bryce has become a national figure for Democrats, nicknaming himself \u201cIron Stache,\u201d a play on his job and his thick mustache, and generating $6 million in contributions. Steil, an attorney, worked for Ryan for a year in Washington and has the speaker\u2019s endorsement.\n\n___\n\nSCRAPPING FOR THE SENATE\n\nWisconsin Democrats have been relegated to the sidelines since Republicans took control of both legislative houses and the governor\u2019s office in 2011. Democrats think they can finally change that. The GOP holds a nearly insurmountable majority in the Assembly but only a three-seat edge in the Senate. Surprise wins in a pair of special Senate elections earlier this year have given Democrats hope that voter disgust with Trump is trickling down to local races and they could retake the chamber. If Democrats can hold five seats they already control and flip two they\u2019ll win a 17-16 majority. Democrats\u2019 hopes are riding on three female challengers: Kriss Marion, Lee Snodgrass and Julie Henszey. They need to go two-for-three to give Democrats a chance at the chamber.\n\n___\n\nLEGAL EAGLES\n\nThe ballot\u2019s undercard features what\u2019s become a bitter race between Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel and Democratic challenger Josh Kaul. Schimel has labeled Kaul as inexperienced, pointing out repeatedly his only experience as a prosecutor was a four-year stint as an assistant federal prosecutor in Baltimore. Kaul, son of the late former Democratic Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager, has pounded Schimel over delays in testing thousands of sexual assault evidence kits, spending $10,000 on coins for police officers emblazoned with Schimel\u2019s motto \u201cKicking Ass Every Day\u201d and joining a multistate lawsuit challenging the ACA. Polls show them about even.\n\n___\n\nCYBERSECURITY IN MIND\n\nWalker on Friday activated the Wisconsin National Guard to make its cybersecurity team available to help the state if needed. Wisconsin was among the states targeted by Russian hackers before the 2016 election.

(AP) \u2014 Fights for U.S. House seats are shaping up as the most closely watched contests in Pennsylvania as the Democratic Party aims to recapture the U.S. House majority.\n\nRepublican losses in the state wouldn\u2019t be surprising because the party of the president historically does poorly in midterm elections.\n\nBut Democrats have another reason to believe they can flip up to six seats and help the party erase the 23-seat Republican House majority. A state Supreme Court decision in January threw out six-year-old congressional district boundaries as unconstitutionally drawn to benefit Republicans. Under that map, Republicans won 13 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 18 House seats in three straight elections even as Democrats dominated statewide elections.\n\nThe replacement districts approved by the court\u2019s Democratic majority are fueling more competitive contests.\n\nA look at key races:\n\n____\n\n1st District\n\nFreshman Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is trying to fend off a stiff challenge by Democrat Scott Wallace in a closely divided district in Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs. Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent who succeeded his brother in the seat, has a centrist voting record and has tried to put distance between himself and President Donald Trump.\n\nWallace, a longtime Democratic Party donor, was co-chairman of the Wallace Global Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that supports liberal social movements.\n\nIt is shaping up as Pennsylvania\u2019s most expensive U.S. House race. More than $12 million has flowed in from national party organizations and other outside groups, primarily to attack Wallace and boost Fitzpatrick\u2019s image. Wallace is heavily funding his campaign and outspent Fitzpatrick nearly 5-to-1 in the July-September quarter.\n\nDemocrats have a slight registration advantage in the Bucks County-based district, and Democrat Hillary Clinton eked out a win there in 2016\u2032s presidential contest.\n\n____\n\n5th and 6th Districts\n\nDemocrat Mary Gay Scanlon and Democrat Chrissy Houlahan are expected to win these open congressional seats in southeastern Pennsylvania that now heavily favor Democrats after years of Republican control.\n\nScanlon, a longtime public interest lawyer, would succeed Republican Rep. Pat Meehan, who resigned from the 5th District seat in April while under an ethics investigation for using taxpayer money to settle a former aide\u2019s sexual harassment complaint.\n\nHoulahan is a former Air Force engineer and athletic apparel company executive. She would succeed two-term Republican Rep. Ryan Costello, who decided not to seek another term in the 6th, which has become less hospitable to Republicans.\n\n____\n\n7th District\n\nDemocrat Susan Wild and Republican Marty Nothstein are vying for an open congressional seat in eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley, a district whose new boundaries favor a Democrat after two decades of Republican control.\n\nSeven-term Republican Rep. Charlie Dent decided against seeking re-election in a potentially hostile political environment, and he resigned in May. Wild is a longtime lawyer in Allentown, and Nothstein is a gold medal-winning Olympic cyclist in the 2000 Sydney games and a Lehigh County commissioner.\n\nIn the redrawn district, Democrats have a 62,000-voter registration advantage. Meanwhile, Democratic Party-aligned groups have spent more than $1.5 million attacking Nothstein or boosting Wild.\n\n____\n\n8th District\n\nThree-term Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright in northeastern Pennsylvania is being challenged by Republican John Chrin, a former investment banker who moved from New Jersey to run.\n\nThe district is anchored by Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, and Democrats have a 75,000-voter registration advantage there. Still, about half of the district is new to Cartwright and Trump would have won it by nearly 10 points in 2016.\n\nThose dynamics are giving Republicans hope for an upset victory. The National Republican Congressional Committee has spent more than $550,000 on TV ads attacking Cartwright.\n\n_____\n\n10th District\n\nThree-term Republican Rep. Scott Perry, owner of one of the most conservative voting records in the U.S. House, finds himself in a substantially less conservative district and his toughest re-election campaign. Challenging him is Democrat George Scott, a fellow Army veteran.\n\nMore than $2 million from outside groups has flowed in to the contest, including at least $700,000 to attack Scott from a super PAC that is aligned with Trump. The district, which includes the cities of York and Harrisburg, has a Republican registration edge of about 23,000, but there are also 79,000 independent or third-party voters.\n\nScott, a Lutheran pastor, says he believes he can win with support from independent voters and Republican moderates who reject Perry\u2019s conservativism.\n\n_____\n\n11th District\n\nFreshman U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker is trying to hold off a challenge by a first-time candidate, Democrat Jess King, in a conservative district where Republicans have a 100,000-voter registration advantage in the district and Trump won it by 26 points in 2016.\n\nSmucker, a former state senator who owned his own a construction company, professes confidence he can win. Still, two polls in recent weeks have shown King trailing by single digits, and Republicans are not disputing that finding.\n\nKing has spent her career in nonprofit anti-poverty work, drawn by her Mennonite faith. King is endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and has gone toe-to-toe with Smucker in fundraising without accepting corporate campaign contributions or getting help from Democratic Party organizations.\n\nLast month, Vice President Mike Pence came to campaign and raise cash for Smucker, who began airing attack ads that King says are full of lies about her.\n\n_____\n\n16th District\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Kelly is seeking a fifth term in a northwestern Pennsylvania district that slightly improved for Democrats when the state Supreme Court redrew it, and he\u2019s got his toughest re-election challenge to date from Democrat Ron DiNicola, a lawyer and former Marine.\n\nDemocrat and Republican registration is practically even, although the odds seem to be in Kelly\u2019s favor: Trump won the district by 20 percentage points and held a rally there with Kelly last month. Still, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has poured more than $600,000 into the race to help DiNicola.\n\n_____\n\n17th District\n\nNewly minted Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb is aiming to knock off three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in Pittsburgh\u2019s suburbs in the nation\u2019s only House race pitting two incumbents against each other.\n\nDemocrats enjoy a 71,000-voter registration edge in the district, and Lamb has comfortably led polls over Rothfus, who has one of Pennsylvania\u2019s most conservative voting records in Congress.

(AP) \u2014 \u201cThis is a blessing. This is a huge blessing,\u201d said volunteer Patti Mills after her first look at the new location for the severe weather shelter at an open house Tuesday night at the Southwest Washington Fairgrounds.\n\nIt was a sentiment that was echoed over and over by the members of Bethel Church, who look at the bigger, safer space with room to grow as an answer to their prayers. The shelter, which opens any night when the temperatures dip to 38 degrees or below starting Nov. 1, will be housed in the first building inside the fairgrounds\u2019 main gate \u2014 what is typically the 4-H building during the Southwest Washington Fair.\n\nLast year, the shelter was housed in two 14-foot by 66-foot rented portable units, which were just large enough for a total of 35 beds and had no running water.\n\n\u201cLast year they sat on their beds, they had to eat on their beds, they had to dress there and there was no common area where they could sit and visit,\u201d said Laura Hasbrook, volunteer coordinator for the shelter.\n\nNevertheless, the shelter provided a total of 1,965 stays over 86 of the year\u2019s coldest nights. This year, representatives from Bethel Church, which pays for the facility\u2019s use fees, asked if it would be possible to use one of the permanent buildings on the fairgrounds instead of the portables. The new building boasts room for 40 beds and space for more in the future as well as two kitchens, storage areas for donated items and bathrooms close by with multiple toilets and showers. Bethel Associate Pastor Josh Gering explained that the new building\u2019s rental will cost the church about the same as the portables did last year, but will be a cost savings over the alternative of adding plumbing and more square footage to the rented portable units that he was considering for this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to a better customer experience this year,\u201d Gering said of the new space. \u201cWe have a place to hang out, become a family, build relationships . I believe any change in someone\u2019s life comes from relationships.\u201d\n\nPrior to the severe weather shelter being sited at the fairgrounds, there were concerns raised about safety, potential impact on fairground events as well as the fairgrounds themselves. Southwest Washington Fair Manager Tamara Hayes said in the end, the experience was overall a very positive one.\n\n\u201cI think there were fears there would be a lot of stuff left behind but they really did a great job and the fairgrounds were left like they found them,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nHasbrook was quick to note she felt the shelter\u2019s move was successful because of the many individuals, agencies and entities involved in it. She noted that small things like the Chehalis Police Department dropping in every night and local housing agencies working to get some of the guests into more permanent living situations made a huge difference.\n\n\u201cThe cities are involved, the county is involved, law enforcement, it\u2019s just such a joint effort and it\u2019s fun to see how it all works together,\u201d Hasbrook said.\n\nBut there\u2019s a side to the shelter that\u2019s harder to quantify for the volunteers who make the shelter happen. For them, the space is about giving people hope and following a calling. For them, success can\u2019t be counted in numbers, but rather on the faces and in the stories of the people they help.\n\n\u201cIf we get one of them off the street it\u2019s a success,\u201d said Dan Boes, who helps with logistics for the shelter. \u201cSave one \u2014 it\u2019s worth it.\u201d", "ISTANBUL (AP) \u2014 Turkey\u2019s president says he will not permit what he called the seizing of natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nSpeaking at a naval ceremony Sunday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would never accept such attempts \u201cexcluding our country and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\u201d\n\nTurkey and the Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus_who do not have diplomatic relations\u2014 are both planning hydrocarbon research in the Mediterranean Sea for natural gas reserves.\n\nA Turkish ship began explorations for oil and natural gas this week off the coast of southern Antalya province.

(AP) \u2014 Groups are trying to boost voter turnout in Nebraska as Election Day nears, but the challenge may be greater than in some neighboring states.\n\nNebraska consistently ranks in the middle of the pack nationally and lags behind Iowa and Colorado when it comes to the percentage of eligible voters who cast ballots. It also trailed South Dakota and Missouri in three of the last five elections, according to reports compiled by Nonprofit VOTE, a group that tracks state turnout data.\n\nVoting-rights advocates say a variety of factors likely contribute to Nebraska\u2019s middling turnout, including fewer competitive statewide races due to the Republican Party\u2019s dominance, but a key factor is the state\u2019s registration deadlines, said Brian Miller, Nonprofit VOTE\u2019s executive director. Whereas Nebraska requires potential voters to register more than two weeks before an election, states that allow voters to register on Election Day usually have higher turnout.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest barriers to turnout is registration,\u201d Miller said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t paying attention until right before the election. We have a culture that waits until the last minute.\u201d\n\nStates that work to expand voting by mail and allow online registrations also see turnouts increase, said John Cartier, director of voting rights for Civic Nebraska, a nonprofit voter advocacy group.\n\nCartier pointed to Garden County, which saw a sharp uptick in ballots cast during the May 15 primary after officials there switched to a vote-by-mail system. More than 58 percent of the county\u2019s registered voters participated, up from 27 percent in the 2014 primary. The county also outpaced this year\u2019s statewide primary turnout of 24 percent.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is historic,\u201d Cartier said. \u201cIt\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d\n\nCartier said Nebraska would see a huge jump in participation if the three largest counties \u2014 Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy \u2014 adopted an all-mail system.\n\nCartier credited Secretary of State John Gale, a Republican, for working to increase voter turnout at a time when GOP election officials in other states have been accused of trying to reduce turnout among Democratic voting blocs.\n\nGale announced last week that the number of registered Nebraska voters has reached an all-time high of more than 1.2 million. Gale, who will retire in January, said 213,791 voters have requested to early vote by mail or in person, or they live in an all-mail district.\n\nBoth major political parties hope to boost turnout for an election that includes a Medicaid expansion ballot measure, a closely watched race for Omaha\u2019s 2nd Congressional District and scores of state Senate races.\n\nThe Nebraska Republican Party put a special emphasis this year on driving early voting in Douglas County, one of the few areas where the party hasn\u2019t competed effectively with Democrats, said Executive Director Kenny Zoeller.\n\nEven though Republicans still fare well in parts of Omaha and its suburbs, Democratic voters generally turn in far more early ballots. Zoeller said his party\u2019s strategy appears to be working.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve gotten beaten terribly in early voting,\u201d Zoeller said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been competitive.\u201d\n\nThe Nebraska Democratic Party sent voter guides to all registered Democrats, encouraging them to vote and showing them all of the Democratic candidates in their district, even those in nonpartisan races. They\u2019re also targeting traditional early voters with ads and text messages, and have implemented a block captain program to ensure that Democrats get registered on time and cast their ballots.\n\nDemocrats hope to build momentum by mobilizing voters who traditionally don\u2019t vote. A ballot measure to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income people and the tight House race between Democrat Kara Eastman and Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon could help, said Jane Kleeb, the party\u2019s executive director. Additionally, the party is running a large number of women candidates.\n\n___\n\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte", "Players and officials of the English Premier League club Leicester City arrive at a Buddhist temple to participate in the funeral rituals of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in Bangkok, Thailand, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

Kay Ivey and challenger Walt Maddox on Monday spent the final full day of campaigning hammering home their messages. Ivey touted her record after taking over from a scandal-battered predecessor. Maddox said Alabama needs to break from the \u201cshadows of the past.\u201d\n\nThe race pits the 45-year-old Tuscaloosa mayor - running on a platform of Medicaid expansion and establishing a state lottery - in his first statewide race against a 74-year-old Republican incumbent who has held three statewide offices.\n\nBoth candidates crisscrossed the state Monday rallying supporters in a last-minute series of rallies and press appearances.\n\nMaddox said a lottery would fund college scholarships and free prekindergarten to Alabama students while Medicaid expansion will help keep rural hospitals open and provided needed care to working Alabamians.\n\n\u201cThis is election is about the future.

(AP) \u2014 Floridians will choose between one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters and an unabashed liberal when they elect a new governor Tuesday.\n\nThe contrast couldn\u2019t be greater between Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who would be Florida\u2019s first black governor and the first Democrat elected to the office since 1994.\n\nThe two are opposites on issues, background, campaign style and message in a politically divisive year. The contest is essentially a referendum on Trump and votes may be cast as much, if not more, on emotion than issues. About the only thing they have in common is they both have preschool children and they were born a year apart.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s for Trump,\u201d Marc Grizzard, 51-year-old church pastor from Live Oak, said when asked the most important reason he is supporting DeSantis. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no need to get somebody in there, even if they are Republican, if they aren\u2019t going to support the president.\u201d\n\nToni Pentecouteau, a 72-year-old retiree from Destin, is supporting Gillum and cites, in part, DeSantis\u2019 close relationship with Trump.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t vote for someone who has to ask Trump first if it\u2019s OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a president who violated federal and state housing laws, who has bankrupted many times, who has been sued, who doesn\u2019t pay his creditors.\u201d\n\nWhen the year began, few would have predicted a showdown between DeSantis and Gillum.\n\nDeSantis was the underdog in the Republican primary until Trump endorsed him and Gillum shocked political observers when he won a crowded primary despite spending far less money, largely on grassroots support of Democrats who call themselves progressives.\n\nDeSantis, 40, was educated at Yale and Harvard universities before becoming a Navy officer. He won his House seat in 2012 running as a political outsider, but he clearly had larger ambitions. He ran for U.S. Senate in 2016, dropping out when Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio decided to seek re-election.\n\nGillum, 39, was a 23-year-old Florida A&M University student when he became the youngest person elected to Tallahassee\u2019s city council. He was elected the city\u2019s mayor in 2014. He tells a story about a poor upbringing in Miami, and the lessons he learned about getting a good education from his mother and grandmother.\n\nAt campaign events, DeSantis has unleashed a largely negative message about Gillum and sometimes comes across as angry, while Gillum barely mentions DeSantis and has an upbeat, positive style.\n\nDuring a rally in Destin, Gillum mentioned pipe bombs that were mailed to Democratic leaders, allegedly by a Trump supporter, in talking about political division.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is, I believe there are more of us than there are of them. There are more of us who believe in decency,\u201d Gillum said to loud applause. \u201cWe can win these races not by dividing people, but by bringing folks together to give them something to vote for, and not just against.\u201d\n\nThe event ended with the crowd chanting Gillum\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cBring it home!\u201d\n\nThat same night, DeSantis was giving thousands gathered at a rally with Trump several reasons to vote against Gillum, citing an FBI investigation into corruption at Tallahassee City Hall among other issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to say that of the candidates running for governor, I\u2019m the only one that has worn the uniform and served in our military, I\u2019m the only candidate that ain\u2019t going to raise your taxes here in Florida and I\u2019m the only guy who can credibly say that I\u2019m not under investigation for corruption by the FBI,\u201d DeSantis said to cheers.\n\nDeSantis used more than half of his speech to attack Gillum. At one point the crowd began chanting, \u201cLock him up!\u201d\n\nGillum has said he\u2019s not a target of the investigation.\n\nRacial division has also been an issue in the campaign. The day after the primary, DeSantis said on Fox News that Florida voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. DeSantis spent weeks explaining the remark, saying it had nothing to do with race, but rather his belief that Gillum will hurt Florida\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Gillum campaign, in the final week, cut ties with a campaign volunteer caught on video calling Florida a \u201ccracker\u201d state and saying the campaign was taking advantage of \u201cwhite guilt.\u201d\n\nGillum is taking a nontraditional route in the general election. He\u2019s seeking out young voters and minorities who tend to have lower turnout in a midterm election.\n\nHe\u2019s also going to areas Democrats have traditionally ignored, like Okaloosa County in the western Panhandle, which Republican Gov. Rick Scott carried in 2014 with more than 75 percent of the vote in a year he didn\u2019t receive 50 percent of the statewide vote. Trump carried the county with 71 percent of the vote in 2016.\n\n\u201cThey told me this was a red county!\u201d Gillum said after being greeted with thunderous applause from an overflow Okaloosa crowd. \u201cI see a sea of blue. In fact, I see a tsunami of blue about to slip over this area.\u201d\n\nDeSantis largely focused his campaign on the Interstate 4 corridor that runs from Daytona Beach to through Orlando to Tampa Bay and the large urban areas south of the highway.\n\nIf DeSantis wins, he can give Trump credit for exciting the party\u2019s base. When DeSantis wrapped up his speech at Wednesday\u2019s Trump rally, he turned to the president and shook his hand.\n\n\u201cI appreciate it. Thanks,\u201d DeSantis told Trump. He then laughed and added, \u201cThis is crazy. This is awesome.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "ALBANY, N.Y.

It did not say when the shootout took place or explain how it had determined that the perpetrators of Friday\u2019s attack were among the 19 killed.\n\nThe ministry published photographs purporting to show the bodies of the slain militants, as well as rifles, shotguns and pistols.

(AP) \u2014 In his quest to memorialize French-American history, Annapolis is a key part of Frenchman Julien Icher\u2019s \u201cboots on the ground\u201d mission.\n\nIn 1777, the Marquis de Lafayette made his first trip to America accompanied by Annapolitan Edmund Brice. In 2018, it\u2019s only fitting that as Icher is following Lafayette\u2019s final footsteps through the United States near the end of his life. Monday, he had help from Annapolis historian Glenn Campbell.\n\nIcher, 25, is the founder of The Lafayette Trail project, a Franco-American endeavor mapping Lafayette\u2019s farewell tour across 24 states from 1824 to 1825. So far, he\u2019s put about 9,000 miles on his car in the last four months following Lafayette.\n\n\u201cMy primary point is to accurately see these places Lafayette went. It will be my mission to track them down,\u201d Icher said. \u201cThis is a token of friendship between France and America.\u201d\n\nIn April, he accompanied President Emmanuel Macron to Washington D.C. where he saw the White House, the Capitol and George Washington University where Lafayette attended the first commencement on Dec. 15, 1824.\n\nIcher continued tracing Lafayette\u2019s footsteps through 13 states until he arrived in Annapolis.\n\nAs the last surviving Revolutionary War general, Lafayette\u2019s tour through all the existing states was about as popular as the Grateful Dead tour in the \u201970s.\n\n\u201cHe was seen as a rock star. He was a celebrity of his day,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHe reminded people of the ideals of the revolution. It was very emotional for Lafayette and all these locals who came out to see him.\u201d\n\nThe Historic Annapolis senior historian took Icher to the same places they tracked Lafayette from Dec. 17 to 21, 1824.\n\nThey started at the State House, where Lafayette was received by government officials and taken into the old Senate chambers to see where Washington resigned his commission.\n\nThere, it\u2019s reported that Lafayette saw an old comrade from the war and the two \u201crushed into each other\u2019s arms and wept like children.\u201d\n\nAt St. John\u2019s College, Icher and Campbell walked along the green where Lafayette judged a marksmanship competition and saw McDowell Hall, where he later attended a ball and dinner.\n\nBetween North Street and State Circle, they saw where attended Sunday services at what used to be the Methodist Church. At Fort Severn, now Naval Academy grounds, they stood where the old governor\u2019s mansion was, where Lafayette spent the night. At the Maryland Inn, they recalled the spot as the Williamson Hotel, where Lafayette\u2019s entertainment was organized.\n\nIcher also stopped by the state park that was once Northhampton Plantation in Bowie, where Lafayette spent the night visiting then Gov. Samuel Sprigg the night before his Annapolis visit.\n\n\u201cJust like Lafayette, I\u2019ve met a lot of government officials, but also a lot of average citizens,\u201d Icher said. \u201cI want to preserve their part of our history too.\u201d\n\nHe was to continue his journey in Baltimore visiting places such Fort McHenry, the Belevedere Hotel and the Exchange House, among others.\n\nYou can follow his journey online at thelafayettetrail.com.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "In this Monday Oct. 29, 2018 photo Alex Shiflet, right, is greeted by former West Virginia University running back Quincy Wilson at his Make-A-Wish foundation for a Mountaineer Experience in Mt.

Just help people.\u201d\n\nAt 16, she is getting her wish after joining the department earlier this year as its only current female member and one of just a few current high school-age volunteers. Undergoing training classes, observing life-saving techniques and interacting with fellow volunteers with years of experience, she said she is excited about the prospect of fighting fires one day and responding to emergencies.\n\n\u201cI really just want to give back to my community,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved helping others and I wanted to do so in a way where I would challenge myself. I thought I\u2019d give it a shot and I love it. Best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d\n\nThough still undergoing necessary training before being authorized into certain situations such as active structure fires, Mackenzie said she has been on some calls and observed how the department operates.\n\nShe has taken part in an emergency medical technician class and other training exercises. Her goal is to become a paramedic or serve in the military as a firefighter, she said. The fire station is like a second home, she said. \u201cThe guys here, they\u2019re like my brothers already,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know they would have my back no matter what, and they\u2019ve taught me so much. It\u2019s like a family up here.\u201d\n\nShe said she gets excited and nervous when she\u2019s taken part in answering calls, describing the feeling as adrenaline pumping. On the department\u2019s community front during events and gatherings, she\u2019s just as thrilled interacting with residents, especially young girls she encourages to follow in her footsteps if they choose.\n\nAt the National Night Out on Aug. 7 in Madison Heights, an annual event that brings the public and law enforcement and public safety agencies together in a community setting, Reynolds greeted children as they briefly walked through the department\u2019s fire engine. Smiling while speaking with girls and helping toddlers maneuver out of the apparatus in wonder, she said it\u2019s neat telling girls they can become firefighters.\n\nShe knew Chief Tom Martin from church and said the idea to volunteer hit her like a truck one day and she applied.\n\nMartin said the department has many members who got their start volunteering in high school and stayed active. His son grew up around volunteer firefighting and was 16 when he started his involvement, Martin added.\n\n\u201cWe have been successful in recruiting from the high school,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt helps them build careers.\u201d\n\nHe said while Mackenzie is the current sole female member on the active roster, the department has had female volunteers in the past. Mackenzie is taking part in the department\u2019s fire academy, he said.\n\n\u201cShe really brings a good balance to the department,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a great joy having her around.\u201d\n\nMackenzie said she feels serving the public is important and a fulfilling activity for her generation at a time when so many are constantly bombarded by social media, videos and iPhones.\n\n\u201cPersonally for me, helping or inspiring another person is like the best feeling in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI just love it.\u201d\n\nThose feelings were reinforced when disaster struck Amherst County April 15 in the form of a massive tornado that devastated many homes in the Elon community, including that of one of her best friends alongside whom she\u2019s played volleyball.\n\nShe said she wouldn\u2019t hesitate as a firefighter if a similar disaster comes again.\n\n\u201cThat really impacted me,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cI have a lot of friends who live on Nottaway Drive,\u201d which saw heavy storm damage.\n\nThe tornado hit on a Sunday evening and school was canceled for three days, during which time Mackenzie found herself joining hundreds of other students helping with relief efforts.

(Jonathon Gruenke/The Daily Press via AP)\n\nYORKTOWN, Va. (AP) \u2014 Divers from four local emergency response units probed the waters of the York River recently in a two-day exercise that transformed the elusive wrecks of three British ships sunken during the Revolution into a joint training mission.\n\nWorking under the guidance of underwater archaeologist John Broadwater \u2014 who led an extensive 1980s excavation here as well as the recovery of the USS Monitor turret off Cape Hatteras, N.C., in 2002 \u2014 the teams made repeated dives near the old cofferdam pier in an attempt to find and map wrecks that haven\u2019t been surveyed for nearly three decades.\n\nUsing side-scan sonar and a remotely controlled mobile underwater camera, they located two possible targets, as well as what may be one of the York\u2019s most difficult-to-find Revolutionary War wrecks by about noon on the second day.\n\nTwo rounds of follow-up dives using metal probes confirmed the presence of one shipwreck in about 12 feet of water. They were zeroing in on a second about 200 feet from shore as the exercise came to end.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many ships were sunk during the siege. We don\u2019t know how many were raised after the battle,\u201d Broadwater said, describing a puzzle that has challenged historians and underwater archaeologists since the first dives took place here under the supervision of The Mariners\u2019 Museum in the early 1900s.\n\n\u201cBut we do know that 26 ships were unaccounted for \u2014 and that we\u2019ve only found 10 of those, with an 11th wreck that\u2019s a strong maybe. Presumably, they\u2019re all still down there hidden on the bottom of the river.\u201d\n\nAdvised by Broadwater and organized by Newport News Fire Department Capt. Frank White, the exercise was hosted by the York County Department of Fire and Life Safety and included dive teams, boats and equipment from Newport News, Hampton and James City County.\n\nMore than 30 personnel took part in the two-day operation, which provided training in a wide range of areas \u2014 including logistics, boat handling, communications and equipment preparation, and search and rescue techniques.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of people for them to put one diver in the water,\u201d Broadwater said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because this is a business where you can easily lose a life trying to save one.\u201d\n\nThe exercise also provided important lessons in communication and cooperation among the array of relatively small local dive units that have learned from hard experience that some larger life-saving and rescue calls can only be met with a coordinated response.\n\n\u201cNo one jurisdiction has the resources to do extended high-risk, low-frequency operations. But together we do,\u201d said White, who is the marine incident coordinator for Newport News.\n\n\u201cSo we need to train together in order to avoid running into any problems with each other\u2019s personnel, equipment and capabilities when we have to go out together at 3 a.m. on an emergency operational call.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want any real-life incident to be the first time you\u2019ve worked together,\u201d White said.\n\nThe exercise began with its easiest assignment \u2014 mapping the underwater remains of the steel cofferdam where Broadwater and other archaeologists excavated the wreck of the British supply ship Betsy in the 1980s.\n\nTuesday\u2019s targets were far more elusive \u2014 as seen in the repeated passes of York County\u2019s Marine 1 fire and rescue boat over the water as it searched for wreck YO94 with a Hampton Police Department team and its Marine Sonic Technology side-scan sonar.\n\n\u201cThis is all about locating them first \u2014 and then mapping them if we can find them. But it\u2019s not as easy as everyone thinks,\u201d Broadwater said.\n\n\u201cI have people ask me all the time if we didn\u2019t survey them back in the 1980s. And the answer is that we did. But every time we\u2019ve come back to look for them since then we haven\u2019t been able to get good GPS positions on these wrecks. They\u2019ve been buried in the sand and silt where we can\u2019t find them.\u201d\n\nA shifting bottom churned up by this summer\u2019s storms has only added to that continuing problem, said White, who dove on the wrecks here during the 1980s.\n\nAnother longer-term factor is the impact of the rip-rap breakwaters built to preserve the restored beachfront here in the early 2000s.\n\nThose forces have combined to change the bottom significantly by adding to the layers of sand built up over the wrecks.\n\n\u201cThe most common term for what we\u2019re doing now is, \u2018Mowing the lawn,\u2019 \u201d Broadwater said, nodding to Marine 1 as it passed back and forth over a target site.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very boring. Just back and forth, back and forth until you find something.\u201d\n\nStill, the next day\u2019s sonar search ended more quickly than expected, turning up not only the probable site of YO94 but also the location of one of the York\u2019s least-seen wrecks.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty definitive about it,\u201d White said, as he and Broadwater watched the operation from the cofferdam pier.\n\n\u201cThat would be an exciting find,\u201d the archaeologist answered. \u201cWe know there are more out there.\u201d\n\nOnce in the water, the dive teams began to report good news, too, as they searched for signs of another wreck originally thought to be the least promising target.\n\nProbing the sandy bottom under about 12 feet of water, the James City County Fire Department team detected a series of substantial, rough-hewn timbers arrayed in a curving line.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great news,\u201d Broadwater said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one we thought would be hardest to find.\u201d\n\nNewly staked and located, the wrecks and their locations will be bundled into an upcoming nomination aimed at making the Yorktown shipwrecks a national marine sanctuary.\n\n\u201cWe want to get it done in the next few weeks,\u201d Broadwater said. \u201cSo any new additional information we can get is important.\u201d\n\nThat could happen sometime next year if the dive teams return on a follow-up training mission, White said.\n\nBut as the divers left the water late Tuesday they focused instead on the remaining job of breaking down all their equipment and packing.\n\n\u201cPeople always ask us, \u2018Why do you have all these resources out here?\u2019 \u2014 and the answer is because every one of them is needed,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cThis can be a very dangerous thing to do \u2014 and it\u2019s very labor-intensive process if you want to do it safely.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Press, http://www.dailypress.com/", "This Sunday Feb. 21, 2016 photo shows Jess Hurst also known as \"DJ Feminasty\" mixes music during the second Huntington Culture Storm at Black Sheep Burrito and Brews in Huntington, W.Va. Hurst said the name Feminasty is a dig at one of Rush Limbaugh's rants about feminists, when he calls them \"feminazis.\" (Anthony Davis/The Herald-Dispatch via AP)\n\nHUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Jess Hurst\u2019s alter-ego DJ Feminasty was born in 2012 when DJ Diabeetus decided he was tired of watching everyone have fun while he was stuck behind the DJ booth at the now defunct DIY venue and community house Funkytowne. He suggested Hurst learn how to DJ so he didn\u2019t have to do it anymore.\n\nIt was then that Hurst, a 28-year-old Boyd County, Kentucky, native and nine-year Huntington transplant, started down the path to figure out what kind of DJ she wanted to be. She said 90 percent of this journey has been deciding what she does or does not like and whether she would be a single-genre DJ.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still sort of a kitchen sink DJ,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cI like lots of different stuff. I\u2019ll play rap, R&B, soul - basically anything that I think fits the mood and that I feel proud presenting to other people.\u201d\n\nHurst said the name Feminasty is a dig at one of Rush Limbaugh\u2019s rants about feminists, when he calls them \u201cfeminazis.\u201d\n\nShe explained to be creative in a day and age where the technology can be a photographer, podcaster and a DJ is cheaper and more widely available. Having all these mediums isn\u2019t as bad as some in the arts communities say it is.\n\n\u201cI think democratizing access to art and creative outlets is a wonderful thing,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cAt the end of the day, what\u2019s going to set you apart still is your taste level. And that, no one can teach you. You have to teach yourself, you have to develop it on your own. No one can hand it to you.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her taste, what sets DJ Feminasty apart in Huntington currently is the fact that she may very well be the only woman DJ in the area, and she hopes that because the technology is more widely available, more women will get into it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually think about it until I talk to a local bar owner and I\u2019m like, \u2018hey what if I did a night here?\u2019 and their response is \u2018A girl DJ, huh? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a girl DJ before.\u2019 That is a real response. I will not reveal the bar, but that was a real thing that was said to me. If it\u2019s still that big of a deal then it\u2019s definitely something I would like to see younger women doing.\u201d\n\nSome of her biggest influences are people who aren\u2019t necessarily professional DJs, but they use DJ-ing to share their perspectives.\n\nOne example she named is Giorgio Morodor, who did his first DJ set of his life as a 72-year-old after being a powerhouse producer in the music industry, with his name on some of Donna Summer\u2019s and Daft Punk\u2019s works, to name a couple. Hurst also named local DJ and good friend Charlie Brown Superstar, who helped kick off her DJ career.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually been a really good influence on each other,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me with a lot of the stuff that I had missed and I think it\u2019s fair to say that I definitely sort of lit a fire under him because he felt like he wanted to keep up with me a little bit. We\u2019ve never been competitive or anything but we do inspire each other to do things a little bit differently and out of the box.\u201d\n\nHurst describes DJ-ing as a creative outlet centered on controlling the mood or vibe of a place.\n\nShe often adds visual elements to her sets to help create the mood, beyond song selection. Though she has branched out from her roots as a DIY house-show DJ, the same thought goes into creating the vibe at a club or established venue.\n\n\u201cI like to think, \u2018OK, what can I do to transform this completely normal living room into somewhere else, into something else, where you feel like you\u2019re not here and you feel transported,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nA lot of Hurst\u2019s interest in dance music comes from her mother, who would sing the hooks from various songs she would hear while out dancing in clubs in the early 1990s.\n\nThe early \u201990s were a much different time for dance music and culture, and Hurst said she hopes to resurrect some of that energy when she\u2019s in charge of the dance floor.\n\nHowever, she and other local dance enthusiasts have been met with a challenge when it comes to attempting to build the audience for such a culture.\n\n\u201cTrouble is, in a small town, you have a lot of trouble getting a large number of people out for anything, except for eating out at a new restaurant,\u201d Hurst said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main challenge. If people do show up, they like it. It\u2019s just getting people to show up and leave their house. People in our age group are comfortable at home: they want to watch Netflix or Hulu and order food in and they don\u2019t want to go out. And I can\u2019t blame them; the whole life of the night and the culture of going out is something we don\u2019t really have here. Around here, we just want to drink, and that\u2019s a different thing than nightlife.\u201d\n\nHurst said she wants to create a culture in Huntington where people can rediscover the music of the past and learn to love the classics while delving into new music and developing their taste.\n\nMore specifically, she wants Huntington to become a go-to place for people to come if they want to hear good music, and facilitate the distribution of the good tunes.\n\nPart of this, Hurst said, is developing a relationship with listeners.\n\n\u201cHaving an audience that\u2019s engaged with you and trusts you and will follow you feels so good,\u201d Hurst said.\n\n\u201cIt feels better than anything else. So when I\u2019m able to get that people trust me and they\u2019re digging what I\u2019m putting down, that\u2019s what I need. Hopefully the future has more of that.\u201d\n\nWhat Hurst hopes to accomplish ultimately, and what she says dance culture in general is all about, is just an escape from whatever is bringing a person down in the world.\n\n\u201cSpeaking frankly, I\u2019m in the dark night of the soul right now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds very traumatic, but I say most days I feel kind of lost and I don\u2019t know exactly what I want to do. Music is kind of the one constant for me, and no matter how depressed or anxious or hopeless I feel, I always still love music and I hope that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to communicate to other people, is that no matter what point you\u2019re at in your life, maybe I can do something for you for a few hours if we\u2019re sharing this music together.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Herald-Dispatch, http://www.herald-dispatch.com", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Cynthia Brown-Thomas\u2019s job requires her to rise before the sun. It pays a meager stipend of $2.65 an hour. An exhausting display of patience is a must.\n\nShe credits the job with saving her life.\n\nThe 64-year-old retiree, who has survived two heart surgeries, is one of more than 200 D.C. seniors from low-income households working as classroom grandparents in the city\u2019s schools.\n\nThe job is an unexpected turn in her empty-nester life. Brown-Thomas assumed she was too old to work and only learned of the opportunity when she bumped into two women in her subsidized senior apartment building along the H Street NE corridor.\n\n\u201cThey said they were going to work, and I said, \u2018Nah, you\u2019re too old to go to work,\u2019 \u201d Brown-Thomas recalled. \u201cThen I thought, this is something that I could do that could keep me alive.\u201d\n\nFour years after Brown-Thomas became a foster grandparent, the refrigerator in her one-bedroom apartment is adorned with a drawing from a boy in one of her classes \u2014 her favorite memento from her time in the classroom. She is pursuing credentials to work in early-childhood education and has learned education techniques that she can pass to her own grandchildren.\n\nBrown-Thomas, who retired from local government, works with first- and second-graders at Wheatley Education Campus \u2014 an elementary and middle school in the same Northeast Washington neighborhood where she has lived her entire life.\n\nShe arrives at school about 8 a.m. wearing her blue Foster Grandparent apron. She sharpens pencils and arranges classroom materials, waiting for the children to arrive. Some of the children hug her, others whisper secrets in her ear. Throughout it all, her theatrical facial expressions and warm laughter fill the classroom, with Brown-Thomas treating the children more like her grandchildren than her students.\n\n\u201cHow are you doing today, Grandma?\u201d the children ask during a morning greeting activity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 10,\u201d Brown-Thomas said. \u201cBecause I get to be here with all you children.\u201d\n\nShenora Plenty, principal at Wheatley Education Campus, said the five grandparents at her school are critical to its success. Her only wish: that there were more of them.\n\nWheatley posted gains in the latest batch of standardized tests that students take, and Plenty said the grandparents played a role. When the students do individual work, the grandparents wander the classroom, helping students write their names and draw shapes.\n\n\u201cThey literally are grandparents, so they assume that role when they walk into the classroom,\u201d Plenty said. \u201cIt really reminds the children of their grandparents.\u201d\n\nThe grandparents know to go to distracted children and provide them with attention, hoping to keep the entire class on track.\n\nMany students at Wheatley Education Campus have young parents and grandparents at home, according to the principal, and benefit from having older role models.\n\n\u201cShe gives you jelly beans,\u201d said Zariah Brunson, a second-grader who has Brown-Thomas as a foster grandparent.\n\n\u201cShe helps us with our homework,\u201d said Courtney Richardson, another second-grader.\n\nBorn out of the 1964 federal War on Poverty legislation, the Foster Grandparent Program aims to give seniors across the country a purpose in retirement by providing some of the neediest children with mentors and giving teachers help in the classroom. The grandparents choose their hours, most working 15 to 30 a week.\n\nThe United Planning Organization, a community agency founded in 1962 to bring programs to the District\u2019s low-income residents, operates the $1.2 million Foster Grandparent Program, which receives federal funding.\n\nCheryl Christmas, director of the United Planning Organization\u2019s grandparent program, said it is intended to keep residents older than 55 connected to their communities.\n\nGrandparents, who range from 55 to 93 years old, are assigned to schools or day-care centers \u2014 and a few to children\u2019s hospitals \u2014 in their communities so that they have the potential to run into their students at the corner store. If grandparents perceive that a child isn\u2019t reading at home, they are trained to pick a street that they are both familiar with and to ask the child report back about what a sign says, or with how many times the student encountered a letter.\n\nWhile the program reimburses travel expenses, the hope is to encourage seniors who can to walk to school in the mornings and afternoons.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wrapping our arms around them,\u201d Christmas said. \u201cIt\u2019s an outgrowth of how we used to treat teachers \u2014 like preachers.\u201d\n\nBefore first entering the classroom, the grandparents attend a training session to prepare them to work with children and to recognize signs that a child may be upset or stressed.\n\nChristmas said the small stipend given to foster grandparents provides extra spending money but isn\u2019t enough to threaten their ability to qualify for many of the government benefits they rely on. Brown-Thomas said her stipend allows her to travel to Houston to visit her daughter and young grandson.\n\nThe program requires participants to have a physical each year, and Christmas said the initiative will cover costs for those who can\u2019t afford it. Christmas said the physicals have discovered ailments that would have otherwise gone undetected.\n\nCassandra Reid, a foster grandparent who works part time at another job, said working with the children has reinvigorated her. She loves running around on the playground with the preschoolers she\u2019s assigned to.\n\nIn the classroom, she can be found sitting on the floor with students or helping them at their desks with work sheets.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t cry, baby,\u201d Reid tells one preschooler who is upset because her teacher didn\u2019t call on her.\n\n\u201cGrandma, can you help me?\u201d another student struggling with writing her name asks Reid.\n\nBut her favorite part of the day happens before she even enters the classroom.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk through the hall and the kids run up to me and call me grandma,\u201d said Reid, \u201cit\u2019s a big balloon of joy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "This photo released by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, shows a convoy of vehicles of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent driving in the Syrian desert heading to Rukban camp between the Jordan and Syria borders, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

(Syrian Arab Red Crescent via AP)\n\nDAMASCUS, Syria (AP) \u2014 U.N. officials and volunteers from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent offered children vaccinations and distributed desperately needed aid on Sunday, the first such assistance since January to reach thousands in a remote camp for the displaced on Syria\u2019s border with Jordan.\n\nResidents said that teams from international organizations entered their desolate camp for the first time since it was set up over three years ago, where nearly 50,000 have been stranded in limbo.\n\nFadwa Baroud of the United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator said it was the first time a U.N. aid convoy had accessed Rukban camp from inside Syria. She said aid workers were in the Rukban area.\n\nBefore January, aid only reached the camp from Jordan and aid workers were barred from accessing the camp because of security concerns.\n\nThe Arab Syrian Red Crescent and the United Nations posted pictures of staff unloading trucks of life-saving assistance and administering vaccines to children.\n\nResidents posed with the aid trucks driving through the desolate camp, where 10,000 children are expected to be vaccinated.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State militants said its local allies, a Syrian armed group known as Maghawir al-Thawra, provided security for the aid convoys.\n\nResident Abdul-Fatah al-Khaled, who also runs a camp school, said aid workers, including U.N. staff, were on the ground at the camp for the first time.\n\n\u201cBefore (January) the aid used to be distributed from the Jordanian side over the sand berms\u201d or by rebel groups who resided in the camp, al-Khaled said.\n\nAl-Khaled said distribution of food and winter clothes began late Saturday.\n\nPeople started gathering in Rukban three years ago, fleeing IS militants and airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, Russia and Syria. Jordan sealed its border and stopped regular aid deliveries in 2016 after a cross-border IS attack that killed seven Jordanian soldiers. The attack, and other violence, fueled accusations that militants were hiding among camp residents and raised concern that deteriorating humanitarian conditions amounted to collective punishment.\n\nThe last aid delivery from Jordan was in January, leaving the camp\u2019s residents dependent on goods largely smuggled from government-held areas. The situation sharply deteriorated after the Syrian government blocked supply routes last month following a botched reconciliation deal with rebel groups in the area.\n\nRussia, a close ally of the Syrian government, has blamed the U.S. for the deterioration of the situation in Rukban, which is within a 55-square kilometer (20 sq. mile) \u201cdeconfliction zone\u201d set up by U.S. forces stationed in the nearby Tanf military base.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has denied such allegations and blamed Russia and the Syrian government instead.\n\n\u201cWe continue to stand ready to enable future delivery of U.N. humanitarian relief to the people of Rukban until they are able to return home as we pursue our mission of an enduring defeat of (IS),\u201d said Maj. Gen. (UK) Christopher Ghika, a deputy commander for the U.S.-led Coalition.\n\nThe U.N. said aid deliveries would continue for up to four days, describing the condition in the camp as \u201ccritical\u201d with reported shortages of basic commodities, protection concerns and increasing violence.\n\nAt least four people have died in the past month due to malnutrition and lack of medical care as regional powers traded blame.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the U.S.-led coalition conducted joint patrols with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces along the borders with Turkey, the second this week following increased tension after Turkish artillery shelled Kurdish positions in northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cSunday\u2019s joint patrol with the SDF is the second of the week, after the first one was conducted by US forces on Friday,\u201d Col. Sean Ryan, the coalition spokesman, told The Associated Press in an email. \u201cThe US forces\u2019 assurance patrols enables us to maintain safety and security in the region, but are not carried out on a routine basis.\u201d\n\nSenior Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said the patrols were conducted along the borders with Turkey in Ras al-Ayn, Tal Abiyad and Manbij.\n\nIn recent tension, Turkey said its military shelled Kurdish positions across the border in Syria, east of the Euphrates River, at least twice last week, in an area where U.S.-led coalition are based.\n\nTurkey considers the Kurdish militia that forms the backbone of SDF a terror threat and an extension of Kurdish rebels waging an insurgency within Turkey. U.S. support for the Kurdish-led forces has resulted in increased tension between Washington and Ankara.\n\nSeparately on Sunday, the Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad told the pro-government daily Al-Watan that Syria would cooperate with the new U.N. envoy Geir Pederson if he avoids the \u201cmethods\u201d of his predecessor, commits to the country\u2019s territorial integrity and stops supporting \u201cterrorists, as his predecessor did.\u201d\n\nPedersen succeeds Staffan de Mistura, who steps down this month after four years of unsuccessful peace efforts.\n\n___\n\nEl Deeb reported from Beirut.", "French President Macron: A majority of voters in New Caledonia have chosen to remain part of France"]
