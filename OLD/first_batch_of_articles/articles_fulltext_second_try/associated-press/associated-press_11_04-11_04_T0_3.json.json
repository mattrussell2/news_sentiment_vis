Britain's National Crime Agency is investigating a main financial backer of the campaign to get Britain out of the European Union over suspected illegal funding during the country's EU membership referendum, authorities said Thursday. (Victoria Jones/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s office on Sunday dismissed as speculation reports that Britain and the European Union were close to striking a divorce deal after reaching a compromise on the intractable issue of the Irish border.\n\nDowning Street said \u201cnegotiations are ongoing\u201d and that a Sunday Times report claiming a proposed agreement had been reached on future customs arrangements at the Ireland-Northern Ireland border was \u201cspeculation.\u201d\n\nHowever, U.K. and EU officials have said in recent days that a deal is getting closer and could be sealed this month.\n\nMay\u2019s deputy, David Lidington, said Friday that negotiators were \u201cvery close\u201d to an agreement. Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said \u201cI think it is possible to get a deal in November.\u201d\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but London and Brussels have not reached an agreement on their divorce terms and a smooth transition to a new relationship. The stalemate has heightened fears that the U.K. might leave without a deal in place, leading to chaos at ports and economic turmoil.\n\nAn October EU summit that had been billed as the deadline for a breakthrough ended with the talks still deadlocked.\n\nThe key obstacle is the Irish border, which will be the U.K.\u2019s only land frontier with the EU after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree there must be no customs posts or other barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side or undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nBut the two sides have not agreed on how to do that. Britain rejected the EU\u2019s proposal \u2014 to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the bloc \u2014 because it would impose new customs and regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, a proposed solution would keep all the U.K. in a customs union \u2014 but with an exit clause to mollify pro-Brexit British lawmakers who worry the U.K. will be bound to the EU forever.\n\nMay faces a battle to get a deal approved by her Cabinet \u2014 which is split between supporters of a clean break with the EU and those who want to keep close economic ties to the bloc \u2014 and past an equally divided Parliament.\n\nMay has already lost two top ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, over her Brexit blueprint. Others could follow in a bid to make her change course. And pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers have openly mulled attempting to oust May with a no-confidence vote and a party leadership contest.\n\nSo far, the prime minister has stood her ground and her opponents have blinked.\n\nWith the clock ticking, opponents of Brexit are stepping up efforts to secure a new referendum on whether to accept any deal agreed between Britain and the bloc.\n\nBritain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, but some argue the public should get a second chance to decide once the shape of the U.K.\u2019s future relations with the bloc is clear.\n\nMore than 70 British business leaders signed a letter published Sunday urging a second vote, arguing that the conditions proposed by the government for associating with the EU after Brexit are \u201cnot nearly as good as the current deal we have inside the EU.\u201d\n\nSignatories included James Daunt, chief executive of the Waterstones book store chain, former Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket CEO Justin King and Martha Lane-Fox, founder of Lastminute.com.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the main funders of the successful pro-Brexit side in the 2016 referendum is facing a criminal investigation.\n\nThe National Crime Agency is investigating insurance tycoon Arron Banks after electoral officials alleged that 8 million pounds ($10.4 million) he funneled to a pro-Brexit group might have come from outside the U.K., in violation of election laws.\n\nA British parliamentary committee is also investigating Banks\u2019 role in the referendum and his meetings with Russian officials.\n\nBanks denied wrongdoing Sunday, accusing anti-Brexit politicians and journalists of pursuing a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cThe money came from a U.K.-registered company ... generated from businesses in the U.K.,\u201d Banks told the BBC.\n\n\u201cThere was no Russian money and no interference of any type,\u201d he said.", "No. 7 Mountaineers like the view from on top of the Big 12\n\nWest Virginia players, from left-right, Trevon Wesco, Reese Donahue and Michael Brown celebrate with fans after defeating Texas during an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Austin, Texas.

The coach had actually decided to go for the win before the Mountaineers started their final drive.\n\nAnd penalty or not, there was no stopping Grier from an emphatic gesture to cap off a victory that kept the Mountaineers in the hunt for their first Big 12 title since joining the league in 2012. There were plenty of \u201chorns down\u201d signs flashing after the game when the officials couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\n\n\u201cI would imagine it would give our team some confidence,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe wanted to win this one pretty bad ... That will give us some momentum going forward.\u201d\n\nNo. 7 West Virginia (7-1, 5-1 Big 12, No. 13 CFP) and No. 6 Oklahoma (7-1, 5-1, No. 7 CFP) are tied for first after the Sooners survived a wild 51-46 win at Texas Tech. The two teams will play a Nov. 23 matchup in Morgantown \u2014 though there also could be a rematch in the conference championship game a week later.\n\nHolgorsen may finally have the team to deliver some late-season wins his previous teams couldn\u2019t. With Grier making the throws he\u2019s been making, anything would seem possible.\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s remaining schedule includes a home game against TCU (4-5, 2-5) and a road game at Oklahoma State (5-4, 2-4) before the Sooners come to town. Oklahoma still has to play Oklahoma State in their annual Bedlam game and Kansas (3-6, 1-5) before facing the Mountaineers.\n\nThe Sooners are Big 12 championship regulars, having won the league 11 times, including the last three years. The Mountaineers\u2019 best finish was a tie for second in 2016.\n\nThe league appears to have settled into its old habit of all offense, little defense. The Mountaineers and Longhorns combined for nearly 1,100 yards of offense. The Sooners rolled up 683 yards against Texas Tech. The Mountaineers gave up 520 yards to the Longhorns but managed to force Texas to kick a pair of second-half field goals that kept them within striking distance for Grier in the fourth quarter.\n\nHolgorsen doesn\u2019t seem to worry so long as he\u2019s got Grier, who drove the Mountaineers to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns against the Longhorns. After getting thumped on the road at Iowa State, the Mountaineers have averaged 50 points the last two games.\n\n\u201cI had confidence in Will to go out there and move us down the field\u201d for the game-winning score against Texas, Holgorsen said.\n\nTexas was driving the conference just a few week ago after beating Oklahoma and Baylor to sit in first place all by itself. But consecutive losses have knocked the Longhorns down a notch and needing help if they hope to get to the championship game.\n\nTexas hasn\u2019t played meaningful football in November for years, and now it needs to avoid a late-season swoon that would spoil what looked like a turnaround second season under coach Tom Herman. The Longhorns play at Texas Tech and host Iowa State before closing the season at Kansas.\n\nTexas\u2019 five-game winning streak had been its longest since 2013. Texas is now tied for second with the surging Cyclones, trying to avoid Herman\u2019s first three-game skid.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is that we play in the Big 12, and everybody plays everybody. We\u2019re not out of any race yet,\u201d Herman said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t control our own destiny.

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said \u201cI think it is possible to get a deal in November.\u201d\n\nBritain is due to leave the EU on March 29, but London and Brussels have not reached an agreement on their divorce terms and a smooth transition to a new relationship. The stalemate has heightened fears that the U.K. might leave without a deal in place, leading to chaos at ports and economic turmoil.\n\nAn October EU summit that had been billed as the deadline for a breakthrough ended with the talks still deadlocked.\n\nThe key obstacle is the Irish border, which will be the U.K.\u2019s only land frontier with the EU after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree there must be no customs posts or other barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side or undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process.\n\nBut the two sides have not agreed on how to do that. Britain rejected the EU\u2019s proposal \u2014 to keep Northern Ireland in a customs union with the bloc \u2014 because it would impose new customs and regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, a proposed solution would keep all the U.K. in a customs union \u2014 but with an exit clause to mollify pro-Brexit British lawmakers who worry the U.K. will be bound to the EU forever.\n\nMay faces a battle to get a deal approved by her Cabinet \u2014 which is split between supporters of a clean break with the EU and those who want to keep close economic ties to the bloc \u2014 and past an equally divided Parliament.\n\nMay has already lost two top ministers, Boris Johnson and David Davis, over her Brexit blueprint. Others could follow in a bid to make her change course. And pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers have openly mulled attempting to oust May with a no-confidence vote and a party leadership contest.\n\nSo far, the prime minister has stood her ground and her opponents have blinked.\n\nWith the clock ticking, opponents of Brexit are stepping up efforts to secure a new referendum on whether to accept any deal agreed between Britain and the bloc.\n\nBritain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, but some argue the public should get a second chance to decide once the shape of the U.K.\u2019s future relations with the bloc is clear.\n\nMore than 70 British business leaders signed a letter published Sunday urging a second vote, arguing that the conditions proposed by the government for associating with the EU after Brexit are \u201cnot nearly as good as the current deal we have inside the EU.\u201d\n\nSignatories included James Daunt, chief executive of the Waterstones book store chain, former Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket CEO Justin King and Martha Lane-Fox, founder of Lastminute.com.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the main funders of the successful pro-Brexit side in the 2016 referendum is facing a criminal investigation.\n\nThe National Crime Agency is investigating insurance tycoon Arron Banks after electoral officials alleged that 8 million pounds ($10.4 million) he funneled to a pro-Brexit group might have come from outside the U.K., in violation of election laws.\n\nA British parliamentary committee is also investigating Banks\u2019 role in the referendum and his meetings with Russian officials.\n\nBanks denied wrongdoing Sunday, accusing anti-Brexit politicians and journalists of pursuing a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d against him.\n\n\u201cThe money came from a U.K.-registered company ... generated from businesses in the U.K.,\u201d Banks told the BBC.\n\n\u201cThere was no Russian money and no interference of any type,\u201d he said.", "A police officer stands near an inflatable slide at a fireworks funfair in Woking Park, south England, Saturday Nov. 3, 2018.

As Americans prepare for another election, Russian troublemakers appear to laboring afresh to divide U.S. voters and discredit democracy, and perhaps even sway the outcome. (Svetlana Kholyavchuk/Interpress Photo Agency via AP)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Sweeping accusations that the Kremlin tried to sway the 2016 U.S. election haven\u2019t chastened Russian trolls, hackers and spies \u2014 and might even have emboldened them.\n\nU.S. officials and tech companies say Russians have continued online activity targeted at American voters during the campaign for Tuesday\u2019s election, masquerading as U.S. institutions and creating faux-American social media posts to aggravate tensions around issues like migration and gun control.\n\nRussia denies any interference. So far U.S. authorities haven\u2019t announced any huge hacks or the kind of multipronged campaign suspected in the 2016 election, and it\u2019s hard to judge whether the more recent Russian actions have any link to the Kremlin or will have any electoral impact.\n\nBut why do they appear to be at it again? Dozens of Russians suspected of meddling in 2016 have been hit with U.S. charges or sanctions, including well-placed magnates. Moscow\u2019s ties with the West have deteriorated badly amid ever-more-shocking allegations of Russian interference abroad.\n\nAnd some argue that Russian meddlers don\u2019t need to mess with the U.S. midterms this year because they got what they wanted in 2016: Donald Trump in the White House and mass disillusionment with the democratic process.\n\nThe Kremlin likes Trump because he\u2019s one of the rare Western leaders to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, but its hoped-for Russian-American rapprochement hasn\u2019t really materialized. A Democratic House or Senate after Tuesday\u2019s U.S. election would make that an even more distant prospect.\n\n\u201cRussians have a preference and they will do what they can to swing (the result) in their favor, especially if margins are tight,\u201d said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\nHe cautions, however, that \u201cRussia is not responsible for all of America\u2019s problems. America has splits and fissures like all of us, and Russia puts in a lever and pries them open.\u201d\n\nSome Russians, meanwhile, wear the U.S. accusations as a badge of honor, a sign that their country is a fearsome world power again.\n\nThe first person charged with foreign interference in the 2018 midterms, Elena Khusyaynova, said \u201cmy heart filled with pride\u201d at the news. Speaking last week on Russian TV after being accused in the United States of a covert social media campaign for both the 2016 and 2018 votes, she added, \u201cIt turns out that a simple Russian woman could help citizens of a superpower elect their president.\u201d\n\nPavel Koshkin of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies called accusations of meddling \u201ca gift to Russian propaganda and Russian politicians,\u201d who can use U.S. anti-Russian sentiment \u201cas a tool in stirring anti-Americanism and increasing their approval ratings.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 U.S. election thrust Russian foreign interference into the spotlight, but it wasn\u2019t an isolated project. It fit into a yearslong effort by Putin\u2019s Kremlin to take revenge over what\u2019s seen as the U.S.-led humiliation of post-Soviet Russia, through crippling loan programs and NATO\u2019s post-Cold War expansion.\n\nThe Kremlin also resents what it considers U.S. interference in the politics of countries once under Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence, from Ukraine to the Caucasus. To many Russians, what\u2019s happening now in the U.S. is just payback.\n\nThe resulting U.S. sanctions have damaged the Russian economy, but if the goal was changing Russian foreign policy, \u201cthis goal certainly hasn\u2019t been achieved,\u201d said analyst Masha Lipman. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is true. The more pressure (on Russia), the lower the desire or willingness to concede.\u201d\n\nAs special counsel Robert Mueller has investigated possible Russian collusion with Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Moscow has increased efforts to make its mark elsewhere \u2014 in Syria, Libya, and in political debates across Europe.\n\nSo far in 2018, Russian agents have been accused of a nerve agent attack in Britain, trying to hack the world\u2019s chemical weapons watchdog in the Netherlands, and seeking to derail a referendum in Macedonia to stop the country from joining NATO and the European Union.\n\nEven after Mueller\u2019s team in February indicted a dozen Russians linked to the Internet Research Agency, the so-called troll farm in St. Petersburg, its sponsors openly continued to target U.S. audiences.\n\nOne of its projects, a news site called USAReally, covers tight U.S. congressional races and is closely following the migrant caravan heading north from Latin America.\n\n\u201cYes, we are a Russian site. We talk to Americans about America. But is that forbidden?\u201d its chief editor Alexander Malkevich, an avowed Trump fan, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cInfluence readers? Every media wants to do that. ... and so what?\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that Russian-American relations are unlikely to improve quickly no matter the outcome Tuesday \u2014 and expressed interest in the 2020 U.S. presidential race.\n\nMalkevich also assails what he calls the myth of American democracy. That\u2019s one more way that alleged Russian manipulation of U.S. social media serves the Kremlin\u2019s interests: By discrediting Western democracy, that strengthens Putin\u2019s argument to his own voters that his authoritarian model of governance is best.\n\n\u201cThe growing confrontation with the West and a focus on it on national television channels probably helped consolidate this effect of a fortress under siege,\u201d one of Putin\u2019s metaphors for modern Russia, Lipman said. \u201cAnd pledging allegiance to the leader is a matter not only of loyalty but even of national security and national identity. \u201d\n\nMany of the Russians accused of interference in the 2016 U.S. campaign have moved underground or moved on. Some shut down their social media presence. Some have changed jobs.\n\nOne of the indicted troll factory workers, Sergei Polozov, announced on the Russian social network VKontakte that he was \u201cusing his notoriety for a good cause\u201d and had persuaded Russian censors to block four Ukrainian news sites.

A Sicilian prosecutor opened an investigation to determine if neglect, such as possible inadequate drainage of the river, played a role in the deaths or if the home was built illegally close to the river.\n\nThe latter might be the case. Pino Virga, the mayor of the neighboring town of Altavilla Milicia, told SkyTG24 TV that other local authorities told him the house was slated for demolition because it stood too near the river.\n\nSeparately, Di Giacinto told reporters the homeowner had blocked the demolition by challenging it in a local tribunal.\n\nA nursing home up the road was spared any damage, ANSA reported.\n\nOnly days earlier, other storms battered much of northern Italy, killing at least 15 people, uprooting millions of trees near Alpine valleys and leaving several Italian villages without electricity or road access for days.\n\nConte said a special Cabinet meeting could be in the coming days to deliberate aid for storm-ravaged communities, as well as to approve 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion) to ensure safe hydrogeological conditions in Italy, including proper cleaning of riverbeds.\n\nThe other known casualty in Sicily was a man whose body was also found on a guardrail along a Palermo-area road after floodwaters swept away his car, Italian news reports said.\n\nAcross the island, in the town of Cammarata, near Agrigento, the fire department said its divers worked to recover the bodies of the couple whose car was caught up in the flooding waters of the Saraceno River.\n\nAlso in Agrigento province, firefighters rescued 14 people from a hotel in the town of Montevago, which was threatened by floodwaters from the Belice River.\n\nElsewhere in Sicily, at least two other people were missing Sunday after floodwaters swept away their cars, including a doctor heading to the hospital in the hill town of Corleone.\n\nIn Casteldaccia, Maria Concetta Alfano said she, her husband and their adult disabled daughter fled after barking dogs drew their attention to the rising waters in the Milicia River.

New Caledonia, an archipelago east of Australia, has a nickel mining industry as well as sun-kissed lagoons.\n\nThe high commissioner\u2019s office reported limited outbreaks of unrest in Noumea as votes were counted, with seven cars set ablaze, some roads closed and two instances of stone-throwing.

Law and Justice also has clashed with the European Union over moves to assert more control over the courts.\n\nResults from the first round of voting two weeks ago and projections from Sunday\u2019s runoffs indicated the party\u2019s populist approach to governance was rejected by voters in Poland\u2019s larger cities, which have seen mass anti-government protests in the three years since Law and Justice came to power. At the same time, the ruling party has been solidifying its support in rural areas.\n\nRunoff elections for the mayor\u2019s office in 649 cities, towns and municipalities took place between the top two vote-getters from the first round of voting conducted two weeks ago.\n\nDuring the Oct. 21 first round voting, Law and Justice strengthened its position in regional assemblies but lost mayoral races outright in Warsaw, Poznan and Lodz to a centrist pro-European Union coalition led by the Civic Platform party.\n\nWith Sunday\u2019s runoffs, the opposition took at least three more of Poland\u2019s most biggest cities.\n\nIn the Baltic port city of Gdansk, incumbent Pawel Adamowicz with Civic Platform won re-election to a sixth term. The Ipsos polling agency projected support for Adamowicz at nearly 65 percent and support for the Law and Justice candidate, Kacper Plazynski, at just over 35 percent.\n\nIn Krakow, another long-serving mayor, Jacek Majchrowski, held off a challenge from Law and Justice challenger Malgorzata Wassermann.

One of the primary jobs of the assemblies is choosing how to spend EU subsidies.\n\nIf the ruling party maintains the level of support it received two weeks ago, it would appear to be well-poised to remain in power after the 2019 national elections, but without the parliamentary supermajority it is seeking to pursue constitutional amendments.", "Utah State quarterback Henry Colombi (3) escapes the grasp of Hawaii defensive back Donovan Dalton (29) in the second half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Honolulu.

I mean, we\u2019re going to have to take each week one at a time \u2014 and I understand that\u2019s coaches\u2019 talk \u2014 but to come over here and win in Hawaii against a good Hawaii team, it\u2019s a hard win,\u201d Wells said.\n\nThe Aggies have won their last five meetings against Hawaii and lead the all-time series 10-6, including a 5-4 record in Honolulu.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUtah State: Despite the lopsided score, the Aggies were dealt a blow when Love, a sophomore quarterback, sustained an undisclosed injury in the second quarter. Love kept the ball on a run play and was upended at the Hawaii 6-yard line after a short gain. Although he landed firmly on his back, Love finished the series, but was replaced by freshman Henry Colombi on Utah State\u2019s next series. Love, who has thrown for 2,185 yards and 19 touchdowns on the season, did not return to the game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.

It was their 10th consecutive loss against a nationally ranked opponent. They are now 10-43 all-time against ranked opponents, including 9-26 at home.\n\nHawaii averaged 42 points and 495.8 yards per contest through its first seven games this season, but is managing just 20.5 points and 361.5 yards of total offense during its current losing streak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing like a very good football team right now,\u201d Rolovich said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any side of the ball should feel good about themselves, I don\u2019t think any coach should feel good about themselves, starting with myself.

Fortenberry, a senior cornerback, was penalized for targeting on a Hawaii pass play and was disqualified for the rest of the contest.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUtah State: Home against San Jose State on Saturday, and then close the regular season with road games at Colorado State and at Boise State.\n\nHawaii: After 11 games in as many weeks, the Rainbow Warriors have their bye next week.

(AP) \u2014 Last-ditch efforts are in motion to spur people to the polls on Tuesday. This election, Michigan voters may not need prodding.\n\nThe number of absentee ballots issued and returned statewide is up by more than 50 percent from the same point in 2014 \u2014 a signal that voter enthusiasm is high. Midterm turnout typically is in the neighborhood of 3.2 million. The state\u2019s former longtime elections director estimated 4 million will vote, which would be the highest midterm turnout on a percentage basis in nearly 50 years.\n\nClerks are ordering more ballots, hiring more precinct workers and amassing more voting booths to accommodate extra voters, including many who will take longer without the ability to check a single box to automatically vote for all candidates of one party.\n\nVoting expert Mark Grebner said while absentee voting has been on the rise due to an aging population, only a small portion of the spike in absentee ballot requests is from people who otherwise would have voted on Election Day. He predicted as many as 1 million sporadic voters who sat out the 2014 and 2010 elections may vote, bringing turnout to 4.2 million for the first midterm of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s kind of wound up about this election,\u201d said Grebner, who summed up the reason: \u201cTrump. Trump. Trump.\u201d\n\nAbsentee ballot requests are approaching, even surpassing levels seen in higher-turnout presidential years. They are up everywhere \u2014 in conservative, liberal and middle-road areas.\n\nAs of Saturday, Ingham County \u2014 the home of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Gretchen Whitmer \u2014 had issued 35,200 absentee ballots and had received 29,200 back, roughly 70 percent more than in 2014. The number of absentee ballots cast in Ingham is on pace to top 2016. County Clerk Barb Byrum said it is a \u201cstrong indicator of what voter engagement and voter turnout are going to look like on Election Night.\u201d\n\nHigher turnout is crucial for Democrats because younger voters and voters of color tend to stay home in non-presidential elections, making the midterm electorate older, whiter and more Republican-tilting.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are pretty consistent on turnout. They don\u2019t vary widely. Frankly, one of the reasons Republicans do so well in a non-presidential year is Democrats don\u2019t show up to vote,\u201d said GOP strategist Tom Shields.\n\nThat changed in the August primary, when more than 1.1 million people voted in the Democratic gubernatorial contest, double the number in the 2010 race.\n\nChris Thomas, who was the state elections director for 36 years, said he usually does not put much credence in primary turnout but was struck by how the number of first-time voters was \u201cmuch higher\u201d than in any previous primary. He pointed to millennial-heavy places like suburban Detroit\u2019s Ferndale and Royal Oak, where so many voters showed that precincts ran short on ballots.\n\n\u201cI did view that that was reflective of sort of a climate out there, and that people have been waiting impatiently to make a vote,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nTaking no chances, candidates are crisscrossing the state to mobilize voters. Top-of-the-ticket contenders such as Whitmer, GOP rival Bill Schuette, Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Republican challenger John James planned to spend much of Sunday in vote-rich metro Detroit.\n\nDemocrats and outside liberal groups say they are in the midst of unparalleled attempts to galvanize people from the sidelines after Republicans\u2019 eight-year run controlling state government and Trump\u2019s razor-thin victory here. Michigan is among 11 targeted states for NextGen America, an advocacy group supported by billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer. It is spending $3.5 million to register and mobilize young voters to help elect Whitmer, re-elect Stabenow and flip three GOP-held House seats.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, is focused on turning out LGBTQ voters and their allies in Michigan and five other states. The predominantly labor-financed For Our Future group has 200 paid staff on the ground, some who have knocked doors since May.\n\nSpokesman Josh Pugh said the scale of the operation \u2014 combined with the level of sustained involvement \u2014 are \u201cunprecedented\u201d for independent organizing outside the traditional party and union operations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that someone like Donald Trump could capture a majority of the state\u2019s voters, especially when he did not capture a majority of the country\u2019s voters, has really been a wakeup call for a lot of the Democratic grassroots to get activated, to get involved,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans say their own permanent, data-driven ground game helped Trump carry the state, eclipses Democrats\u2019 efforts and is built around a team of more than 1,000 trained volunteer neighborhood leaders \u2014 a model intended to limit having people parachute in late from other places. GOP officials know the president\u2019s party typically faces rough sledding in his first midterm and Democrats are especially energized, but they say they have doubled their doors knocked and phone calls since 2016.\n\n\u201cThe mantra is defy history and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said Steven Ostrow, a regional political director for the Republican National Committee.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

The lower cost and convenience of dispensaries is seen as a big reason why the number of patients and growers registered with the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program has plummeted. They find it easier and cheaper to use retail outlets. (Timothy Bullard/The Daily Courier via AP)\n\nGRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Medical marijuana patients and growers in Josephine County and across the state are abandoning the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program.\n\nLong considered a source of Oregon\u2019s black market, medical marijuana is fast falling victim to a combination of red tape and a different kind of market force: the convenience of recreational retail sales.\n\n\u201cMedical could officially have a gravestone,\u201d said Kit Doyle, who formerly sold medical marijuana but switched to hemp products through his business, the Murphy Hemp Company.\n\nThe number of patients registered with the OMMP is half of what it was a year ago. Statewide it dropped 41 percent, from 59,137 to 34,892. In the county it was almost 50 percent \u2014 from 7,027 to 3,540.\n\nThe number of registered growers also dropped precipitously. Statewide it went from 23,175 to 13,959 \u2014 40 percent. In the county, it went from 2,957 to 1,668 \u2014 a 44 percent drop.\n\nDoyle and several industry watchers think the numbers will continue to go down, according to The Daily Courier.\n\nMedical marijuana has been legal in Oregon since 1998, when voters created a system that allowed registered persons to grow their own marijuana \u2014 or obtain it from someone who grew it for them.\n\nBut even as the state Legislature took steps to allow dispensaries for medical marijuana, a sea change occurred in 2014, when voters legalized recreational marijuana, allowing retail sales to anyone over 21 and setting up commercial production.\n\nIt also allows people to grow up to four recreational plants with no registration requirements, except where prohibited by local statute, such as within the city limits of Grants Pass.\n\nTo feed those outlets, the state issued licenses to approved growers and operators.\n\nAs of this week, there have been 475 applications to grow, process, sell or test marijuana in Josephine County for the retail market. Reflecting the region\u2019s conducive-to-cannabis climate, the vast majority, 399, were for recreational farms.\n\nMedical marijuana patients who buy at retail dispensaries are able to avoid sale taxes that can reach 20 percent, although they must pay an annual $200 application fee to be an OMMP-registered patient.\n\nThe hassle of having to pony up $200 for the annual application fee \u2014 and the proliferation of dispensaries selling recreational pot \u2014 appears to be a factor in the decline.\n\n\u201cI repeatedly hear from customers,\u201d said Diana Calvert of River City Retail marijuana dispensary in Merlin. \u201cThey say, \u2018I let my medical card expire. It\u2019s too expensive to renew. I\u2019ll just pay the taxes.\u2019\u201d\n\nOr, as Rob Bovett, who helped write the new rules as legal counsel for the Association of Oregon Counties, put it:\n\n\u201cThose that were getting an OMMP card as a ruse to get marijuana for recreational purposes ... no longer need to continue the ruse after we legalized recreational marijuana.\u201d\n\nThose who remain OMMP patients include heavy users and those who live in an apartment or other location where they can\u2019t grow their own. For those patients who rely on a grower, finding one can be difficult because their numbers are diminishing, patient advocates say.\n\n\u201cThe regulations around providing for other patients are quite onerous,\u201d said Cedar Grey, a Williams-area grower who sits on the Oregon Cannabis Commission, a state advisory body. \u201cI actually think that\u2019s the biggest factor.\n\n\u201cMany patients are just unable to find a grower to supply them. Previously I think it was relatively easy for a patient who didn\u2019t know anyone, in relatively short order, to find a grower to provide free or low-cost cannabis.\n\n\u201cWith the changes they\u2019ve made (to the OMMP program), it\u2019s much more difficult to care for other patients. Therefore, the number of growers willing to do that has dropped significantly.\u201d\n\nAs of this year, medical marijuana growers who are supplying patients with marijuana must use an online state reporting system that tracks movement of product. Some say the tracking system, known as METRC, is difficult to learn and use. The state provides training, but growers don\u2019t like it, and some might drop out because of it.\n\n\u201cThe new reporting system is something people aren\u2019t going to be able to adapt to,\u201d said Pete Gendron, president of the Oregon SunGrowers Guild, a locally based association of growers. \u201cThe training is inadequate. The tech support is also woefully inadequate.\n\n\u201cIt takes a minimum of 10-12 hours to access basic functionality of the system,\u201d Gendron continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know a single person who is completely proficient. It\u2019s not an easy system to use. You can\u2019t really expect a 70-year-old to navigate it.\u201d\n\nGendron expects the number of registered medical marijuana growers to continue to drop. He himself has stopped growing for others, saying he doesn\u2019t have the time. He previously supplied eight patients, allowing him to grow 48 plants, or six mature plants per client.\n\nGendron said the situation for patients is made all the more difficult if they are low income \u2014 as are more than half of OMMP patients.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the money to go to the corner dispensary,\u201d he said.\n\nThat might lead some to return to pills to treat their conditions, he said.\n\nGendron also blamed the drop in the number of growers on the county\u2019s ongoing attempts to restrict commercial marijuana operations in rural residential zones, although he mostly blamed new state regulations.\n\n\u201cThe county shares a minority of the blame,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really the state Legislature which has done the absolute most damage. When they changed reporting rules for the OMMP, they put into place barriers that destroyed patient-grower relationships.\u201d\n\nSheriff Dave Daniel guessed that the number of growers has dropped because of price drops associated with oversupply of marijuana. The state never set limit on licenses or production.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s economics,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cYou saw a green rush. It took a year to hit home. Everybody came in and started growing. I think they found it difficult to get rid of the product, especially legally.\n\n\u201cI think there was an overabundance of marijuana and the market was full. That\u2019s my guess.\u201d\n\nCalvert, of River City, said dispensaries are paying about $1,600 per pound for the best product, and as little as $200 per pound for lesser quality product. Just a couple years ago, pot prices below $1,000 per pound were unheard of.\n\nDoyle, who now sells hemp products, said enforcement actions have caused some medical marijuana growers to leave the OMMP program.\n\n\u201cThe medical industry thrived on the black market,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cThey\u2019re shutting that down.\u201d\n\nHe also said that people are able to buy marijuana online or through social media connections, which may be more convenient and doesn\u2019t require OMMP cards.\n\nLike Gendron, Doyle worries that some patients, having lost their grower, might be returning to \u201ctheir other medication,\u201d including prescription pills. Some patients also might be buying marijuana informally from someone in the neighborhood who is selling excess product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy,\u201d Doyle said. \u201cWhat it\u2019s doing is pushing the medical back underground.\u201d\n\nAnd some growers are moving, he added.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are going to other states that are just building a medical program,\u201d he said.\n\nSome medical marijuana growers have left the OMMP and converted to supplying the retail market, which is regulated by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, he said.\n\nState Rep. Carl Wilson, a Grants Pass Republican who helped write the new rules, agreed that former medical marijuana patients are leaving the OMMP and are instead buying from retail outlets.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people say, \u2018Let\u2019s cut my overhead and go to the rec side,\u2019\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson, who has been deeply involved in state marijuana issues, also said that some growers have switched from medical to recreational because they want a better financial return.\n\n\u201cThey think they can do better,\u201d he said.\n\nOregon Health Authority spokesman Jonathan Modie said the advent of retail outlets coupled with complex new regulations may have led people out of the OMMP. He said a survey was going out toward the end of the year to former patients asking them why they left and current patients why they stayed.\n\n\u201cMarijuana is legal in Oregon,\u201d Modie said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a medical card.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not surprised we\u2019ve seen a drop.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Courier, http://www.thedailycourier.com", "", "", "", "A field of graves belonging to WWI soldiers in the main cemetery in Frankfurt, Germany, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 German Chancellor Angela Merkel will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on French soil, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in London for a ceremony in Westminster Abbey with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut while Germany\u2019s leaders visit the capitals of its wartime enemies, at home there are no national commemorations planned for the centenary of the Nov. 11 armistice that ended the four-year war that left 17 million dead, including more than 2 million German troops.\n\nNext week, the German parliament is holding a combined commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the first German republic, the 80th anniversary of the brutal Nazi-era pogrom against Jews known as Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Almost as an afterthought, parliament notes there\u2019s also art exhibition in the lobby called \u201c1914/1918 - Not Then, Not Now, Not Ever.\u201d\n\nMore than just being on the losing side of World War I, it\u2019s what came next that is really behind Germany\u2019s lack of commemorative events.\n\nFor Germany, the Nov. 11 armistice did not mean peace like it did in France and Britain. The war\u2019s end gave rise to revolution and street fighting between far-left and far-right factions. It also brought an end to the monarchy, years of hyperinflation, widespread poverty and hunger, and helped create the conditions that brought the Nazis to power in 1933.\n\nThe horrific legacy of the Holocaust and the mass destruction of World War II simply overshadows everything else in Germany, said Daniel Schoenpflug, a historian at Berlin\u2019s Free University\u2019s Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute. His new book, \u201cA World on Edge,\u201d explores the immediate aftermath of the war through individual perspectives.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t reduce it to the simple fact that one country won the war and the other lost,\u201d Schoenpflug said. \u201cGermany is a country that draws practically its entire national narrative out of the defeat of 1945\u2033 \u2014 and not the defeat of 1918.\n\nBy contrast in Turkey, which was also on the losing side in World War I, the war\u2019s end produced a similar collapse of the Ottoman empire and a war of independence, but also gave rise to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic.\n\nIn Germany, even though the end of World War I is now viewed through the prism of Hitler and the Holocaust, in the immediate postwar period there actually was a time of utopianism, with movements promoting idealistic visions of peace and democracy, Schoenpflug said.\n\nYet on the other side of the political spectrum, utopianism on the right also gave birth to fascism, he said.\n\nAnd as initial euphoria over the end of World War I faded, hopes for the future quickly gave way to feelings of resentment at the reparations and conditions imposed on Germany by the victorious powers. The Nazis and right-wing nationalists were able to garner support by pushing the \u201cstab-in-the-back\u201d myth, which held that Germany\u2019s civilian leaders sold out the army by agreeing to the Nov. 11 surrender.\n\n\u201cThere was a war of dreams, a clash of utopias\u201d between the right and the left, Schoenpflug said.\n\nAlthough there aren\u2019t any national commemorations in Germany marking the war\u2019s end, individual events are planned, including an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. A special World War I religious service is also being organized by the German Bishops Conference at the Berliner Dom cathedral.\n\nAnd in addition to German officials taking part in events in London and Paris, the Foreign Ministry said they and their British counterparts have worked together to coordinate the ringing of church and secular bells around the world on Nov. 11 to mark the war\u2019s centenary.\n\n\u201cThe bells will ring at midday to commemorate the more than 17 million victims of World War I and as a call for understanding and reconciliation across borders,\u201d the ministry said.\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects the spelling of Westminster Abbey.", "", "Honda rider Marc Marquez of Spain powers his bike during the Malaysia MotoGP at the Sepang International Circuit in Sepang, Malaysia, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Iranians rallied Sunday in commemoration of the 39th anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, just hours before the re-imposition of all American sanctions lifted by the nuclear deal.\n\nThe 444-day crisis after the fall of the U.S.-allied shah transfixed America, as nightly images of blindfolded hostages played on television sets across the nation. Ultimately, it would be President Jimmy Carter leaving office that saw all 52 captive American diplomats freed.\n\nSunday, hard-liners vented their rage at a new American president, Donald Trump, who pulled America out of the nuclear deal struck by his predecessor that the United Nations says Tehran still honors. With crippling sanctions on Iran\u2019s vital oil industry set to take effect Monday, Iran\u2019s already-anemic economy likely will suffer more, though politicians and protesters struck a defiant tone.\n\n\u201cToday the Iranian nation will show that Mr. Trump is too small to be able to bring Iran to its knees,\u201d said Ali Larijani, Iran\u2019s parliament speaker.\n\nThe annual commemoration marks when student demonstrators climbed over the fence at the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, angered about Carter allowing the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to receive cancer treatment in the United States. The students soon took over the entire, leafy compound. A few staffers fled and hid in the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran before escaping the country with the help of the CIA, a story recounted in the 2012 film \u201cArgo.\u201d\n\nWhile the commemoration annually sees American flags burned and cries of \u201cDeath to America\u201d rise up, it also has a carnival-like atmosphere for the students and others taking part. Some waved massive inflatable ballistic missiles. Others held signs lampooning Trump, including images of him contorted into a Nazi swastika or as a missile chasing after a dove. Some even showed a smiling silhouette logo of Kentucky Fried Chicken\u2019s founder Col. Harland David Sanders crossed-out, equating the chain once in Iran before the Islamic Revolution to decadent Americanism.\n\nGen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander-in-chief of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, gave a speech vowing that Iran \u201ccan overcome this economic war and failure of the sanctions project is imminent.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Trump! Never threaten Iran because moans of the frightened U.S. forces in Tabas can still be heard,\u201d Jafari said, referring to the failed American mission to rescue the hostages known as Operation Eagle Claw.\n\nHe added: \u201cStill the moans of your terrified sailors and your British friends in Persian Gulf can be heard,\u201d referring to times the Guard have held sailors captive there.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran\u2019s shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its rial currency now trades at 145,000 to one U.S. dollar, down from when it traded 40,500 to $1 a year ago. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nThe United States says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles. However, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, both have made public statements supporting overthrowing Iran\u2019s theocratic government.\n\nThe symbolism of the looming sanctions coming wasn\u2019t lost on protesters Sunday.\n\n\u201cSanctions have always existed and we are used to them,\u201d said one woman protester who only gave her name as Torabi. \u201cThe tougher they take it out on us, the more resistant we become.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has embraced the sanctions as he faces a tough mid-term election in the U.S. that could change the balance of power in Congress. He tweeted out an image of him with the caption: \u201cSanctions Are Coming,\u201d a play on the HBO television series \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Hard-liners in Iran responded with a similar image of Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Guard\u2019s expeditionary Quds Force reading: \u201cI Will Stand Against You.\u201d\n\nAnother demonstrator Sunday, Jamshid Zarei, waved a banner in English quoting Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying: \u201cAmerica can\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people are feeling the economic pressure at their dinner tables and we complain about this, but it will not make Iranian people give up Islam, their values and the (Islamic) Revolution because of rising prices,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks that way is really a fool.\u201d\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Associated Press television producer Mohammed Nasiri in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.", "BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The slashing of a machete through underbrush \u2014 a distinct metallic ting as regular as a metronome \u2014 marked the battleground in South Florida\u2019s fight against a tireless enemy whose only needs are sunshine and soil.\n\nDeep in the last remaining intact portion of the northern Everglades workers hired under a new land management agreement hacked at an invasive fern that kills native swamp bay, wax myrtle and dahoon holly trees with a smothering blanket of lime green leaves.\n\nIn what is called a \u201cpoodle cut\u201d, the stalks of the lygodium plant \u2014 also known as Old World climbing fern \u2014 are sliced about two feet off the ground and then sprayed with a low toxicity-herbicide. The remaining growth over the rounded tree tops is left to die, leaving the tree trunks exposed and resembling the grooming style of a pampered poodle.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the frontline,\u201d said Rory Feeney, land resources bureau chief for the South Florida Water Management District during a tour of efforts to control invasive vegetation in the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe district has sole responsibility for exotic plant management in the 144,000-acre refuge west of Palm Beach County after it settled a dispute last year with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The two agencies were at odds over a 65-year relationship that required the federal government to control invasive species in Florida\u2019s largest national wildlife refuge while leasing the land from the district.\n\nA new 20-year lease puts the onus for invasive cleanup on the district, but the wildlife service agreed to pay at least $1.25 million annually to the district for the effort. If only $1.25 million is paid, the 20-year lease is reduced by one year. If $2 million or more is paid, the lease is increased by a year.\n\nFeeney said the federal agency paid $2 million last year and dedicated another $2 million for the current budget year. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission chipped in $1 million, and the district has earmarked $2 million for lygodium removal.\n\nThe annual goal is $5 million per year for five years to beat down the refuge interloper.\n\n\u201cIt was a matter of inconsistent funding for many years,\u201d said Feeney, about how the lygodium got such a deep foothold in the refuge. \u201cAfter five to six years it will be about maintenance.\u201d\n\nThe district was recently able to muster its full force to fight lygodium and the papery-barked invasive melaleuca tree, whose tightly-packed stands attack marshland by blocking out the sun.\n\nWhile lygodium collapses tree islands under its weighty canopy, the melaleuca kills the native flora that acts as the base for a food chain that supports dozens of threatened and endangered species including wood storks and snail kites. Graying tree trunks like whiskers on the mottled green and gold landscape mark areas where melaleuca treatment has been successful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit clich\u00e9, but there really is only one Everglades. There is nothing else like it in the world,\u201d said LeRoy Rodgers, the district\u2019s lead invasive species biologist. \u201cAnd what we are seeing with invasives is they don\u2019t just replace a couple native species, they actually transform the ecosystem into something that is not the Everglades.\u201d\n\nWater managers estimate the refuge has experienced a 600 percent increase in lygodium in the past 20 years.\n\nThe flowerless fern was first detected in Martin County in 1965, going mostly unnoticed until something triggered a growth spurt in the 1990s. Once established, the native of Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa sends out underground shoots that can regrow an entire plant if not fully removed. It\u2019s also a notorious breeder, unleashing spores into the air where they have spread the fern to Central Florida.\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 50 people in suspender-style waders and 20 pounds of herbicide in tanks on their backs crunched through toothy sawgrass and thorny greenbrier vines to chop with machetes at the lygodium. They are brought in by airboat, gliding over well-worn trails where churned-up sediment turns the water the color of Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate river. When water levels get to low for airboats in the northern part of the refuge, the operation makes a systematic march south.\n\nBut manpower isn\u2019t the only tool the district is using to fight the fern.\n\nAbout $750,000 was also approved this year to continue projects that raise colonies of insects to attack the fern, which is particularly dense in Everglades National Park, the refuge and the Kissimmee River region.\n\n\u201cThis is the quintessential river of grass,\u201d Rodgers said Tuesday, gesturing to yawning fields of wheat-colored sawgrass in the refuge. \u201cIf we just walked away, 75 percent of this would be melaleuca and Old World climbing fern.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post, http://www.pbpost.com", "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 When David Winker got to Shenandoah Pool at 12:40 a.m. Monday to sign up his daughter for swim lessons, he wasn\u2019t even first in line. That title belonged to the man asleep in a silver four-door parked right in front of the pool gates, straddling Southwest 22nd Avenue and the curb.\n\nBy 2 a.m., nine parents had lined up, equipped with fold-up chairs, portable phone chargers, snacks and water. They had a long wait ahead of them: Registration wouldn\u2019t open until 6 a.m.\n\n\u201cI love seeing these parents out here fighting for their kids,\u201d Winker, 48, said. \u201cWho wakes up at one in the morning? You have to really want to do this for your kids.\u201d\n\nThis Oct. 22 registration isn\u2019t a one-off. The city of Miami\u2019s pools offer five levels of swim lessons in month-long bundles \u2014 $45 for eight, twice-a-week classes. But with only 78 spots each month, they fill up quickly: Show up at the hour when registration officially opens, and there may be none left. It\u2019s a risk some parents don\u2019t want to take.\n\n\u201cI was surprised and upset,\u201d said City Commissioner Manolo Reyes, describing his reaction to learning about the registration lines. \u201cI feel bad that we haven\u2019t provided the facilities for these people to not be in line for five hours.\u201d\n\nReyes, whose district includes Shenandoah Park, said he only learned about the lines when the Herald requested comment. \u201cWe need more pools,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Shenandoah is particularly popular because it\u2019s close to the surrounding residential community and its swim classes have a high pass rate, it isn\u2019t an outlier.\n\n\u201cWe experience a high demand for all pool locations,\u201d Stephanie Severino, city parks department spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cClasses are made available based on pool capacity and there have been no reductions in available slots at our year-round locations.\u201d\n\nThe city of Miami has 12 aquatics sites, and all but one offer learn-to-swim lessons. Right now, only five are offering classes because some pools are only open during the summer and others are closed for repairs. And in September, the city announced it would cut the hours of operation at one of them, Grapeland Water Park, to save money.\n\nThe price is another draw. At $45 per month for Miami residents, the lessons are significantly cheaper than those at private pools. The University of Miami\u2019s Hurricane Aquatics classes cost $290 for five semi-private lessons.\n\nAll of this tightens the competition for learn-to-swim classes at the city\u2019s public pools.\n\n\u201cUs parents are fighting like crazy for programs for our kids,\u201d Winker said.\n\nThe overnight campouts may soon be a thing of the past. The parks department is finding a way to reserve some class spots for parents re-registering kids, Severino said, and working on an app for online registration and payment.\n\nAnd the city\u2019s capital budget devotes $5 million to a new, larger swimming pool for Shenandoah, scheduled for completion in August 2020. It also dedicates about $1 million to citywide pool improvements by the end of 2019.\n\nEach month, Winker spends up to five hours in line at Shenandoah to sign up his 5-year-old daughter, Cristina, for swim lessons. She started swimming at Shenandoah two years ago, first in the pool\u2019s parent-and-toddler classes, then in the \u201cpreschool aquatics\u201d class.\n\nNow, Winker is enrolling her in level-one classes, the next step up; the swim lessons go up to level three. He praised the swim coaches at Shenandoah, which, conveniently, is across the street from Winker\u2019s home. And the Miami Tarpons swim team practices there, giving Cristina an aquatic role model. She\u2019s now learning the crawl.\n\n\u201cI want to give her the opportunity to do what she wants,\u201d Winker said. \u201cIt\u2019s an uplifting environment. She sees the older kids swimming their laps, getting awards.\u201d\n\nEvelyn, 46, was third in line at Shenandoah on Monday morning to register her 9-year-old son in the level-one class. He has ADHD, she said, and swimming helps him focus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport that is helping him a lot,\u201d said Evelyn, who declined to give her last name. \u201cThe coaches are very good at motivating the kids.\u201d\n\nWith a cafecito in tow, Evelyn planned to spend the wait chatting with three other women in line. This is how they met and bonded \u2014 sitting by the gates of Shenandoah Pool each month until the sun rises and the learn-to-swim registration opens.\n\n\u201cThe hours go quickly,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Miami Herald, http://www.herald.com", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "PORTLAND, Ore.

The Cougars have a 12-game home winning streak, fourth-longest in the nation.\n\nMinshew, a graduate transfer, has thrown for at least 300 yards in every game this season.\n\n\u201cWhen we get down there, we expect to score,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to kick a field goal.\u201d\n\nChase Garbers threw for 127 yards and ran for 67 for Cal (5-4, 2-4).\n\nThis is Washington State\u2019s first 8-1 start since 2002.\n\nCalifornia kept possession for much of the second half, but managed to score only one field goal in that time.\n\n\u201cLosing is awful and we had chances,\u201d Cal coach Justin Wilcox said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to take advantage of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a few more plays in the game in order to win it,\u201d Wilcox said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we were short, and they made them, so you got to give them credit.\u201d\n\nBlake Mazza\u2019s 29-yard field goal put WSU up 3-0 early in the game.\n\nAfter Evan Weaver intercepted a Minshew pass at the Washington State 39, Garbers threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Malik McMorris to give the Bears a 7-3 lead.\n\nMax Borghi replied with a 5-yard touchdown run, capping a 75-yard drive, to put the Cougars ahead 10-7.\n\nGreg Thomas hit a 42-yard field goal late in the first half to tie the score at 10-10. Washington State linebacker Dominick Silvels was ejected from the game during the drive for targeting on tight end Ian Bunting.\n\nMazza kicked a 36-yard field goal with one second left in the first half to give Washington State a 13-10 lead.\n\nThomas kicked a 46-yard field goal late in the third to tie the score at 13-13.\n\nCal was driving for a go-ahead touchdown when quarterback Brandon McIlwain was intercepted in the end zone by Skyler Thomas midway through the fourth. The Cougars drove to the California 13, where Mazza missed a 30-yard field goal with 3:31 left in the game.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t throw it to the other team,\u201d Wilcox said of the interception in the end zone.\n\nAfter Cal went three and out, Minshew drove the Cougars 69 yards, ending with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Winston for a 19-13 lead.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting better and better,\u201d Leach said of Winston. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our most improved players without question.\u201d\n\nWinston caught seven passes for 92 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nCal: The game was a classic showdown between Washington State\u2019s Air Raid offense, which is averaging 40.8 points, and a California defense that is the best in the Pac-12 against the pass. Cal managed to play the game on its terms until the very end.\n\nWashington State: The Cougars are the only remaining Pac-12 team with a single loss, and the Cougars almost certainly need to win out for a chance at their first playoff bid.\n\nRUNNING BEAR\n\nPatrick Laird rushed 18 times but netted only 40 yards for California. He also caught four passes for 38 yards.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nWashington State should expect to move up a spot or two in the Top 25.\n\nPOINTS PLEASE\n\nThis is the fewest points Washington State has scored in a game all season.\n\nPEYTON\u2019S PLACE\n\nWashington State linebacker Peyton Pelluer had 10 tackles, including 1.5 tackles for loss. \u201cWhat he does best is he leads and generates energy,\u201d Leach said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCal plays at Southern California next Saturday.\n\nWashington State plays its final road game at Colorado next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "", "Boise State wide receiver A.J.

The Broncos registered seven sacks and nine tackles for loss.\n\nDespite notching the victory, Boise State was sloppy on both sides of the ball. But Rypien didn\u2019t seem to mind.\n\n\u201cTo me, a win is a win no matter how you scratch it up,\u201d Rypien said. \u201cWinning these close games builds more team chemistry and camaraderie more so than when we\u2019re blowing people out.

After piling up 474 yards and 45 points against the porous Hawaii defense, Wilson has struggled in back-to-back games against a pair of FBS teams in the top 50 in total defense. However, he continued to show his running prowess, breaking off a run of 20-plus yards for the third time in his last four games.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos continue to struggle to put away opponents, which is an area of concern heading into the final stretch of the season. If Boise State hopes to defend its Mountain West title, the Broncos will need to be more effective running the ball late in the fourth quarter to put away stronger opponents like Fresno State and Utah State.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBYU: The Cougars travel to UMass next Saturday.\n\nBoise State: The Broncos will host Fresno State on Friday in a game that will have major implications on the Mountain West Conference championship.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "1 of 3 Japan's Nasa Hataoka celebrates after sinking a birdie putt on the 18th hole at the Japan Classic golf tournament in Shiga, Japan Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

(Ichiro Sakano/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nSHIGA, Japan (AP) \u2014 Local favorite Nasa Hataoka shot a 5-under 67 on Sunday to win the Japan Classic for her second LPGA title of the season.\n\nHataoka offset a pair of bogeys with seven birdies at the Seta Golf Club to finish at 14-under 202, two strokes ahead of compatriots Momoka Ueda, Saki Nagamine and Spain\u2019s Carlota Ciganda, who all shot 68.\n\nHataoka, who also won the Arkansas Championship in June, started the final round four strokes behind second-round leader Minjee Lee. Lee quickly faded, playing the opening nine at 7-over 43 and opening the door for Hataoka, who played the same stretch at 4-under 36. Hataoka had a setback after the turn, carding consecutive bogeys at the 11th and 12th and allowing Ciganda to briefly pull into a tie for the lead. But Hataoka regained her confidence with a clutch par save at No. 13, and her birdie at No. 14 reclaimed the lead.\n\n\u201cI realize something has to come to me and I had to get through it, and I knew it was at the 13th hole,\u201d said Hataoka of the putt that saved her round. \u201cI was not totally comfortable with the shot, but I was calm enough to play well on that hole.\u201d\n\nCiganda had a chance to tie Hataoka at No. 18 but left her birdie putt from above the hole too short.

(AP) \u2014 If there\u2019s one constant about San Diego State this season, it\u2019s going to be a close game. And coach Rocky Long is ok with that.\n\nThe Aztecs committed three big turnovers, had nine costly penalties and had to come back from a nine-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat New Mexico 31-23 on Saturday.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is we keep hanging in there, we keep fighting and we keep playing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all but twice we\u2019ve won. I think we\u2019re 7-2 right now and that\u2019s as good as a whole bunch of teams and better than a whole bunch of teams in the country. So that\u2019s who we are and we\u2019re going to live with it.\u201d\n\nSan Diego State (7-2, 4-1 Mountain West) had played six straight games that were decided by seven points or less, and this one was close as well until Juwan Washington broke off a 50-yard touchdown run with 55 seconds left.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who we are,\u201d Long said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it so many times now. We\u2019re not going to change out personality. You can\u2019t change a team\u2019s personality. We don\u2019t want to get penalties. We don\u2019t want to turn the ball over. I\u2019ve got to live with it and it will probably cost us another game. Maybe not. Maybe not. I\u2019m resolved to the fact so I\u2019m not fighting it anymore.\u201d\n\nDespite the late hole, Long said he wasn\u2019t really concerned.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable, but I didn\u2019t think we were going to lose if that\u2019s your question,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like we were going to win. I felt like we were going to win the whole time. I was just waiting for the play to make it happen. \u201d\n\nThere was no one play, but the Aztecs scored the game\u2019s final 17 points to take the victory.\n\n\u201cObviously when we you don\u2019t play very well and you win the game, you feel very fortunate,\u201d Long said. \u201cBut, guess what that\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re not going to change it. That\u2019s the way our whole season has been and that\u2019s who we are. So we\u2019ll just have to keep playing that way and see if we can pull it out at the end.\u2032\n\nWashington had 95 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 11 carries and quarterback Christian Chapman rallied the Aztecs late in the victory, while a John Baron II field goal put San Diego State ahead for good at 24-23 with 2:56 to play.\n\nThe trailed 23-14 after the Lobos (3-6, 1-4) only sustained touchdown drive of the game with 10 minutes remaining.\n\nBut Chapman rallied his squad with a 75-yard scoring drive.\n\n\u201cIn those situations, you don\u2019t want to get flustered,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cAs a quarterback you don\u2019t want to make stupid decisions.\u201d\n\nAfter the San Diego State defense held New Mexico on the next possession, Garrett Binkley returned the punt 35 yards to the Lobos 41.\n\nNew Mexico was then called for its first penalty, roughing the passer, with 5:25 left, pushing the Aztecs to the Lobos 30. Three plays later, Baron hit the go-ahead 32-yard field goal.\n\nFollowing a San Diego State interception, Washington went 50 yards for a touchdown to seal it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been doing it all season,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fight. Every game has been a fight. They\u2019re always close. That\u2019s the theme for this team this year. We\u2019re fighters and we\u2019re going to grind to the end. That\u2019s how are games are going to be this season.\u201d\n\nThe Lobos finished the first half with two complete passes, both of which went for negative yards. They didn\u2019t get into the positive yardage column until late in the third quarter and finished with 41 yards passing.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s 10 first-half points, however, were the direct result of two fumble recoveries by Adebayo Soremekun, including one that he returned 44 yards for a touchdown. The Lobos also had a short field in the third quarter thanks to a third fumble recovery, leading to another touchdown.\n\n\u201cI thought our defense, as beat up as we are, played pretty physical,\u201d New Mexico coach Bob Davie said.\n\nGIVETH & TAKETH\n\nThat the Aztecs lost the turnover edge is not really news - at least this season. San Diego State entered the game with 11 turnovers and eight takeaways, quite a contrast from the previous three seasons when the Aztecs averaged 27 takeaways versus 13 turnovers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge concern because anytime we turn the ball over, it gives the other team momentum,\u201d Long said. \u201cAnd in this case they even scored off a turnover and had a real short field off of turnovers.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s three fumble recoveries give them six in the past two games after three in the first seven games.\n\nWELCOME BACK\n\nChapman, who missed six games with a knee sprain, entered the game in the second quarter and went the rest of the way, finishing 13-for-19 for 182 yards and one touchdown. Washington also was an injured returnee, coming back from a fractured clavicle that cost him four games.\n\nWHAT A DIFFERENCE\n\nNew Mexico was outscored 99-26 in its previous two games to Fresno State and Utah State.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nThe win keeps alive San Diego State\u2019s drive to reach win 10 wins for a fourth straight season, which would be a program record. Only six other schools have accomplished that feat, all from the Power 5 conferences.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s loss means it needs to sweep its final three games to become bowl eligible for the third time in four seasons.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSan Diego State is at home Nov. 10 to meet UNLV, which is in last place in the conference\u2019s West Division.\n\nNew Mexico plays at Air Force on Nov. 10.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Kings accomplished something they haven\u2019t done much during the first month of the season \u2014 play a complete game.\n\nThe Kings got just their second win in the last nine games as they defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-1 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cLike the way we came out and played,\u201d Los Angeles coach John Stevens said. \u201cWe played faster with the puck. We also checked faster and had support of the puck when we regained possession.\u201d\n\nDustin Brown, who had a goal and two assists, thought that playing with the lead \u2014 which the Kings have done rarely this season \u2014 also did wonders.\n\n\u201cWe did exactly what we are known for. They had a lot of puck movement but we kind of bent but didn\u2019t break and that was a big part of our success,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of traffic in front of the net and pucks there. You are going to get a lot of goals when you get guys there.\u201d\n\nAlex Iafallo\u2019s goal at 12:03 of the first period marked the first time in nine games (Oct. 11 at Montreal) that Los Angeles scored the first goal. It also was the first contest since Oct. 18 against the Islanders (six games) that the Kings scored in the first 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cIt definitely gives you a spark. We played the right way defensively and that led to a really strong offense,\u201d said goaltender Jack Campbell, who made 26 saves. \u201cWe won a lot of puck battles which eliminated their offensive zone time and shots on goal.\u201d\n\nAnze Kopitar and Jeff Carter also scored for the Kings, who are 4-0 when scoring three or more goals.\n\nZach Werenski had the Blue Jackets\u2019 lone goal and Sergei Bobrovsky made 25 saves.\n\nThe Kings led 2-1 in the third period when they put the game away with a pair of short-handed goals 57 seconds apart. Kopitar got his own rebound and went top shelf on Sergei Bobrovsky at 7:46 for the right wing\u2019s fourth goal of the season. Brown put it away less than a minute later on a penalty shot, for his second. The penalty shot, which was Los Angeles\u2019 first, was the result of Ryan Murray hooking Brown on the breakaway attempt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been inconsistent, quite honestly,\u201d Columbus coach John Tortorella said. \u201cYou get the game straightened out and find a way to crawl back into it and we just didn\u2019t pull up on our power play.\u201d\n\nIafallo put Los Angeles on the board first with his third. The left wing\u2019s shot from the left faceoff circle trickled underneath Bobrovsky\u2019s pads. It is the first time in six games (Oct. 18 against the Islanders) the Kings scored in the first period.\n\nThe Kings went up by two on a power-play goal in the second period when Carter took a cross-ice pass from Ilya Kovalchuk and fired a wrist shot for his fourth.\n\nWerenski scored for Columbus 29 seconds into the third when he beat Campbell after getting a centering pass from Boone Jenner.\n\nNOTES: Kovalchuk has two goals and four assists over the past three games. ... Kopitar also extended his point streak to three straight and has a goal and two assists in that span. ... Los Angeles\u2019 Matt Luff made his NHL debut.

Corey Crawford stopped 36 shots, including 18 of the 20 he faced in the third period.\n\n\u201cThey just put so much pressure,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThey kept coming. A lot of speed.

Monahan extended his point streak to six games (four goals, six assists).\n\nFrolik put Calgary ahead for good with 4:55 left as his centering pass from below the goal line deflected off a player and got past Crawford. It was the seventh goal for Frolik, who scored only 10 times last year.\n\n\u201cHe passed it out front and I put my stick out and one of our guys put out his stick and I didn\u2019t see where it went after that,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nBacklund capped the scoring with an empty-netter with 59 seconds left.\n\nCalgary\u2019s top unit of Monahan, Gaudreau and Elias Lindholm were the best line all night.\n\n\u201cThey were real good,\u201d Flames coach Bill Peters saod. \u201cJohnny had the pucks lots, (Lindholm) had unbelievable looks, (Monahan) ended up with a pair, and at the end of the day, they were playing against real good players.\u201d\n\nThe Flames outshot Chicago 41-15, including 20-4 in the third period.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give up that many chances in the third and expect to come out with a win,\u201d Saad said. \u201cYeah, they got a lucky bounce on that fourth goal there, but they created their own luck.

So, I wasn\u2019t going to let it stop me.\u201d\n\nJohnny did most of the woodwork to rebuild the business with help from Angel\u2019s brother. In the meantime, Angel shopped a lot, storing new inventory in two storage units. By the time construction was finished, she had her inventory ready.\n\nGypsy Doll reopened on Oct. 5, two years and a day after the fire.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to feel like not just an antique shop \u2014 because most antique shops are just packed and they have no rhyme or reason,\u201d Angel said.\n\nShe wanted her customers to experience items as they could appear in their homes \u2014 or simply find inspiration for something they could do in their own home. Being a frugal person, Angel likes to repurpose items, which is why she incorporated those items into the store.\n\n\u201cI hate seeing things by the road that can be redone and put a new life into,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing because people throw away stuff that\u2019s so reusable.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Dothan Eagle, http://www.dothaneagle.com", "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A historic military base that played key roles in the advancement of black and female soldiers has been renovated into apartments, bringing much-needed affordable housing to the metro.\n\nThe $40 million Fort Des Moines Living is the outcome of years of behind-the-scenes work to revitalize the Fort Des Moines property on the city\u2019s south side.\n\nDes Moines-based Blackbird Investments converted four-century-old Army barracks and two horse stables into 142 apartments for low-income renters.\n\nIt took four years and $25.9 million in federal, state and local tax credits to bring the project to fruition.\n\nArchitects spent significant time figuring out how each building would be updated without damaging its historical integrity and significance, Blackbird spokeswoman Rachel Wegmann told the Des Moines Register .\n\nFort Des Moines is a National Historic Landmark, which gives developers strict rules to follow for preservation.\n\nAs a result, Fort Des Moines Living \u2014 a mix of 1- and 2-bedroom units \u2014 includes many of the barracks\u2019 original columns, brick walls, hardwood floors and cove plaster ceilings. In the stables, original exposed heavy timber beams and tall ceilings with clerestory windows make it easy to imagine the horses once housed there.\n\nThe building\u2019s original red brick exteriors remain intact.\n\nFort Des Moines was established in 1901 as a U.S. Army cavalry base on 640 acres south of Des Moines. Barracks, stables, officers\u2019 quarters and other buildings were added starting in 1903.\n\nIt\u2019s the site of two landmark moments in U.S. military history. During World War I, it became the first training site for African-American officer candidates. It also served as a training camp for black medical personnel. During World War II, it was home to the first Women\u2019s Army Auxiliary Corps. More than 72,000 women completed training in Des Moines to assist the military mission.\n\nAfter WWII, the fort housed returning veterans, and in 1949, a U.S. Army Reserve training center was established there.\n\nThe training center is north of Fort Des Moines Living and remains in use. Cadets still run the three city blocks where the apartments sit.\n\nBlackbird chose the project based on its historical significance, Wegmann said. But the company is also committed to providing quality \u201chousing for all,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe always like to do an adaptive reuse if possible,\u201d Wegmann said. \u201cThis was such an opportunity and we saw this as a huge need, especially on this side of town.\u201d\n\nThe Des Moines metro is in serious need of affordable housing for its low-income workforce, said Eric Burmeister, executive director of the Polk County Housing Trust Fund. The county is short 8,000 affordable housing units, he said.\n\n\u201cHopefully, (Fort Des Moines) will spark additional acceptance of these projects across the region,\u201d he said.\n\nOne-bedroom units rent for $750 a month. Two-bedroom units are $895. All utilities, including one year of internet access, are included. The units have a washer and dryer, microwave and dishwasher.\n\nSome units are two stories with a bedroom and bathroom on the second level.\n\nAll units are income restricted. Renters must earn 60 percent or less of the area\u2019s median income to qualify \u2014 that\u2019s $33,480 for a single person or $38,220 for a couple.\n\nNearly 60 percent of the units have been filled in the month since Fort Des Moines Living officially opened.\n\nFort Des Moines is part of the reinvestment zone established by the city in 2010. It runs from Southeast 14th to Southwest Ninth streets between Army Post and County Line roads.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great investment into that superblock area. To be able to restore some of those older buildings to housing is incredible,\u201d Councilman Joe Gatto said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s housing that we really need.\u201d\n\nFort Des Moines Living touched only a portion of the fort\u2019s remaining acres. Other sections of the property are owned by Iowa Workforce Development, Blank Park Zoo, the city and private owners.\n\nDes Moines planned to tear down three deteriorating buildings last year, including a granary and two mess halls, because of the high price to save them. Those plans are on hold while the city works with Blackbird, Blank Park Zoo and the state Historic Preservation Office to possibly redevelop what\u2019s left of the fort\u2019s grounds, Gatto said.\n\nBlackbird has said it plans to build more housing and commercial properties on the fort\u2019s former parade ground, about 20 acres north of the barracks.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com", "SAGINAW, Mich.

(AP) \u2014 There is nothing more ghoulishly satisfying than a good ghost tale.\n\nThe story begins with Gen. David Bradford, aka, \u201cWhiskey Dave,\u201d a leader of the Whiskey Rebellion who fled the 13 colonies to escape imprisonment. Bradford built \u201cLaurel Grove\u201d in 1796, moving his family along with him. Bradford sold the home to his daughter, Sara Mathilda Bradford, and her husband, Clarke Woodruff, in the 1820s.\n\nIn 1830, Sara and two of her three children died unexpectedly. Some say they died of yellow fever, others believe they were poisoned by the famous Chloe, a \u201cghost\u201d who was reportedly once a slave owned by Clarke and Sara.\n\nIn 1831, Clarke sold the plantation to Ruffin Gray Stirling and his wife Mary Catherine Cobb. The couple would change the name to \u201cThe Myrtles Plantation,\u201d expand the home and fill it with furnishings from Europe. The mansion would undergo many different owners from the 1840s to the early 1900s who endured robberies, deaths and murders \u2014 ultimately filling with residents who would never leave.\n\nIn the 1950s, the first ghost sighting was reported by owner Marjorie Munson, who reported seeing a \u201cghost in a green turban.\u201d In the 1970s, the home was bought by James and Frances Kermeen Myers who began to operate the lot as a bed and breakfast.\n\nIn 1984, a journalist with Life magazine visited to write on the architecture of the 222-year-old mansion that is encased in ornamental ironwork and shows some of the finest examples of frieze-work molding. Little did he know he would bring something more to the table: ghosts.\n\nThe journalist reported having been in the presence of two children who would \u201ccall him by name then disappear.\u201d Frances confirmed the journalist\u2019s suspicions in her 2005 novel, \u201cThe Myrtles Plantation: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Haunted House,\u201d and so the haunting began.\n\nTeeta Moss is an Opelousas native who currently owns The Myrtles Plantation along with her husband, John Moss. The couple purchased the home from Frances and James.\n\n\u201cWe had known The Myrtles was haunted,\u201d said Teeta. \u201cThough, I truly believed it was just a marketing scheme.\u201d\n\nFor the first seven years, the couple and their two sons lived on the top floor of the mansion while the bottom continued as a bed and breakfast for traveling guests. Teeta said that it was less than two weeks into their new life that she experienced her first taste of the supernatural when a ghost called out her name in her husband\u2019s voice.\n\nHer husband was not on the property at the time.\n\nTeeta called her friend and supernatural expert, Mary Joe McKay, who explained that the spirits were welcoming her using a voice she was comfortable hearing. The next week, the same thing occurred, but in the voice of a dear childhood friend.\n\nThis would be the first of many occurrences the family encountered. Teeta mentioned that her sons often saw apparitions of children around the home. She began to question their decision to move to The Myrtles until one moment that would change her life forever.\n\n\u201cIt was 1993. My youngest son Morgan was 10-and-a-half months old and in the care of his nanny, sleeping in an antique bed with iron railings. I was in my office typing the menu for the day for our restaurant,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this Lauren Bacall, raspy voice, I heard, \u2018Check your baby.\u2019 I disregarded it, thinking that my mind was playing tricks on me out of pure exhaustion, so I continued typing.\n\n\u2033\u2018Check on your baby,\u2019 the raspy voice said again. Then, I knew I couldn\u2019t ignore it, so I went to Morgan\u2019s room and sure enough, he wasn\u2019t there. I ran around the house yelling his name and finally, heading out of the front door to the brick courtyard, there he was, toddling toward the edge of the pond. I screamed \u2018Morgan!\u2019 and swooped him up.\n\n\u201cWhen I held him, a warm blanket enveloped the two of us \u2014 so real that I could feel the fabric and warmth. Then that same voice said to me, \u2018You need not worry, your family will never be harmed here.\u2019 That was a transformation for me, and I truly believe the spirits here are angels here to protect us. Anytime I ever encounter them it is for a greater purpose.\u201d\n\nHester Eby, director of tourism for The Myrtles Plantation for more than 30 years, also believes the ghosts are friendly.\n\nOne of her most memorable moments was the first time she met a ghost child.\n\n\u201cI saw a little girl coming up the walkway with her mother and father,\u201d said Hester. \u201cThe man asked for tickets for him and his wife and I asked, \u2018what about your daughter?\u2019 He quickly changed a smile to a frown to let me know they may never have children, but coming up the walkway behind them was a little girl, I thought.\n\n\u201cI was going to tell the little girl how pretty she was, she had long blonde hair and was dressed in an antique white dress skipping behind her mother. The father was very serious when I asked, and when the lady came up, of course, I didn\u2019t mention the child who disappeared.\n\n\u201cWhen they got in the house with the tour guide, I went outside to look for the baby. I walked up the porchway to enter the front and when I put my hands on the door to go in, she giggled from the north end of the porchway and said \u2018hello there,\u2019 then she disappeared again. She was playing tricks with me.\u201d\n\nThese stories are few of the countless tales that have surrounded The Myrtles, which currently has 12 unique accommodations and daily tours for anyone looking to get spooked and see a unique piece of Louisiana history.\n\nYou might even catch a spirit in a photograph!\n\nLearn more about The Myrtles Plantation by visiting www.myrtlesplantation.com.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Advertiser, http://www.theadvertiser.com", "LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Debbie Stephens remembers raising her hand in her East Lansing Junior High School class to correct a teacher who told the students that Henry Ford invented the auto assembly line.\n\n\u201cMy great-grandfather did that before he did,\u201d Stephens recalls saying.\n\nFord\u2019s claim to fame was the mechanized assembly line, but it was Stephens\u2019 ancestor Ransom Eli Olds who came up with the idea for mass production. Workers in his factory would roll chassis on carts to allow parts to be added to them.\n\nMore than a half-century later, Stephens, who is now 66 and lives in Dublin, Ohio, is still fighting to preserve her great-grandfather\u2019s legacy, which is deeply rooted in Lansing.\n\nDebbie Stephens, her husband Peter Stephens, and a group of more than a dozen auto historians, companies and electric worker unions have scored a major victory in their efforts to keep that history alive in Lansing.\n\nThey spent three years raising money \u2014 they won\u2019t say how much \u2014 to buy the only known surviving 1899 Olds electric car.\n\nThe 119-year-old four-seater has been on loan to the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum, but it was in danger of going into the hands of a private collector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much a part of R.E. Olds and the history of this museum it couldn\u2019t go anywhere but here,\u201d Bill Adcock, executive director of the museum, told the Lansing State Journal .\n\nIt cements Olds\u2019 legacy as the only auto pioneer who experimented with four types of power on early cars: steam, gas, electric and diesel.\n\nWhile electric cars seem like a recent development, early auto pioneers experimented with them. Though they were considered reliable, they were also very expensive.\n\nOlds built his first vehicle in 1887, a three-wheel steam powered car with a gas boiler. By 1899, he had developed several different types of motorized vehicles. That\u2019s the year the Olds Motor Vehicle Co. and Olds Gasoline Engine Works were combined to form Olds Motor Works. Manufacturing was moved to Detroit.\n\nAround that time, he was experimenting with electric cars and offered them for sale, though it\u2019s unclear if any were ever sold. Olds electric was priced at $1,600, which is $48,000 in today\u2019s prices. Other companies sold 8,000 electric cars by 1900, according to a history supplied by the museum.\n\nA disastrous 1901 factory fire is believed have destroyed 15 Olds electric cars. The surviving electric Olds was likely off site at the time of the fire.\n\nAfter the fire, Olds moved back to Lansing and dropped the electric vehicles to concentrate on the gas-powered Curved Dash, Debbie Stephens said.\n\n\u201cThe gasoline cars were cheaper to produce. His goal was to make cars for what became the middle class,\u201d she said.\n\nBut even if Olds continued to produce electric vehicles, he likely would have \u201chit the same wall\u201d as other electric car manufacturers, said Peter Crisitello, a New Jersey auto history buff and expert on electric cars. Advancements in internal combustion engines made them the favored type of car, and gasoline power became the accepted technology over electric and steam for the rest of the 20th century.\n\nWith electric vehicles in the rear-view mirror and all but forgotten, the rare 1899 Olds electric was uncovered in a Lansing garage in 1959. Two brothers, Don and Ken McDowell, purchased the car and stored it for years. In 1996, they loaned it to the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum.\n\nThe brothers have since died. After their deaths, the descendants started getting inquiries from car collectors to purchase it.\n\nStephens and others feared that the car might be sold to collector in Europe or Asia, never to be seen in Lansing again.\n\nThe three-year fundraising effort was led by Lansing attorney Jim Neal, a volunteer at the museum.\n\nNeal and Adcock aren\u2019t spilling how much they paid.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if I paid a dollar or $100,000. It\u2019s priceless. It\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d Adcock said.\n\nDebbie Stephens said she\u2019s pleased that the car is staying. Though she left Lansing after college, her sister, Diana Tarpoff, and a cousin, Clela Gray, still live in the area.\n\nStephens and her husband also own a one-of-a-kind, crowd-pleaser pair of cars called a \u201cMama\u201d and \u201cBaby\u201d Olds, built in 1906. The Baby Olds is a miniature copy of the Mama. The cars still run. They\u2019ve been on display at the museum since 2008 after the couple purchased them in an auction.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was important to keep these in front of the public, because the automotive history is disappearing. And that\u2019s something Peter and I and many others are concerned about, especially here in Lansing,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lansing State Journal, http://www.lansingstatejournal.com", "WAYNE, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Pop quiz: How much do you know about Peru?\n\nIt\u2019s a country in South America. Correct.\n\nIts capital city is Lima. Correct.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard of Machu Picchu, the ancient Incan mountain city and popular tourist destination.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a geography expert or a world traveler, chances are you might not know much more than that about Peru.\n\nMytzy Rodriguez-Kufner hopes to give people a good taste of what her home country is about.\n\nHer business, Ekeko Blends, is scheduled to open this month at 110 Main St. on the south end of Wayne\u2019s business district. In addition to cold-pressed juices, she\u2019ll be selling Peruvian coffee and traditional coffee drinks, plus sandwiches, salads, sweets and other treats common to Peru. She also plans to display Peruvian artifacts and sell Peruvian wool sweaters and hats and, of course, Ekeko statues, the Sioux City Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to bring in a little bit of culture to Wayne, to rural Nebraska,\u201d Rodriguez-Kufner said. \u201cI want to promote the town of Wayne by having something different.\u201d\n\nIt might be different for Wayne, but it remains familiar for Rodriguez-Kufner, whose family immigrated to Chicago from Peru in 1979 when she was 5 so her mother could receive medical treatment. They remained in the Chicago area near other relatives and kept their culture alive. They spoke Spanish at home and celebrated Peruvian holidays with traditional song, dance and food.\n\n\u201cIt was very important for my family to retain that link,\u201d she said.\n\nRodriguez-Kufner eventually received a doctorate in teaching and learning and was the director of a program that helped students learn English. Five years ago, she moved to Wayne with her husband, Brian Kufner, who teaches at Wayne State College.\n\nRodriguez-Kufner spent a couple years as a lecturer at Wayne State and provides translation services for Wayne Community Schools. She runs an education consulting business and is involved with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension, Boy Scouts and the local farmer\u2019s market.\n\nBut the idea for her newest venture began more than 10 years ago. Rodriguez-Kufner for years has enjoyed cold-press juicing, which utilizes a press that wrings the juice from the pulp and separates it rather than chopping it up. In about 2007, her oldest son told her that it was so good she could sell it.\n\n\u201cI just put it in the back of my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dream job for retirement was to have a coffee shop.\u201d\n\nRodriguez-Kufner, who periodically returns to Peru to visit family, isn\u2019t at retirement age, but she decided earlier this year to follow through on that dream. She pressed and sold juice at the farmer\u2019s market this summer, and was encouraged by how many people liked it.\n\nNaming her business Ekeko Blend, Rodriguez-Kufner is calling upon Peruvian tradition for a successful endeavor. Ekeko is a pre-Incan deity and god of fertility, wealth and health. Many Peruvians keep an Ekeko statue in their home as a good luck charm.\n\nThe Ekeko name and statues are a small taste of Peruvian culture the shop will offer. Rodriguez-Kufner will sell Peruvian coffee, which she said has a natural hazelnut taste, and traditional coffee drinks, including her favorite, which has dark sugar and cheese.\n\nThere will be alfajores, cookies made of corn flour and butter that contain a filling similar to sweetened condensed milk, and other Peruvian treats. Other menu items, many of them gluten-free, will include light sandwiches and salads with a Peruvian flair.\n\nThe food and drink might be unfamiliar to many people, but Rodriguez-Kufner hopes that by trying something new, customers will enjoy it and become more willing to learn about other cultures. Rodriguez-Kufner said the business adds a niche to Wayne, giving visitors another reason to come to town, shop and eat.\n\n\u201cIt will be a place where they can come and feel welcomed and appreciated,\u201d she said.\n\nShe hopes that, in turn, those visitors will welcome and appreciate Peruvian culture.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com", "MACON, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Grocery shopping is no longer an easy errand for west Macon resident Angelica Williams.\n\nShe sometimes spends two hours on two different buses to get to the Kroger in north Macon. It used to take her 30 minutes on the bus to reach the Pio Nono Avenue location before it closed in April.\n\nNow the 28-year-old mom alternates going to different stores around town, trying to buy just enough to get her three-person family through the week, so she doesn\u2019t have to carry too many bags on the bus.\n\nIf Williams wants to go to get everything she needs at one store, she has to make a full day of it.\n\n\u201cIf you have anything else to do, you might want to just cancel it,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe area surrounding the vacant Kroger is now considered a food desert, devoid of fresh and nutritious foods within a one-mile radius. Instead, residents are limited to convenience stores and discount shops, where options are minimal and prices often steep.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to maintain a healthy diet on corner store shopping, said Cheryl Gaddis, program director for the master\u2019s of public health program at Mercer University. She studies food access in Bibb and Houston counties.\n\nAt a gas station, shoppers are more likely to find potato chips than Yukon golds.\n\n\u201cMany offer things like hot dogs, pizza. Even some offer fried chicken now,\u201d Gaddis said. \u201cBut those are not the healthy items that we want people to intake, and so, when they\u2019re having to purchase things from the convenience stores, they\u2019re not getting healthy items.\u201d\n\nSome corner stores offer more nutritious options, like prepackaged salads and sandwiches, Gaddis said, but they cost more than a hamburger at a fast food restaurant.\n\n\u201cCost is going to increase as the availability of healthy items is going to decrease,\u201d she said.\n\nIn food deserts, shoppers are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases like obesity and heart disease, Gaddis said. Children feel the effects, too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see more children who are not succeeding in school,\u201d Gaddis said, \u201cbecause they\u2019re more focused on, you know, trying to make sure they have something to eat as opposed to being able to focus on their school work.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the food?\n\nGrocery options are few and far between on the stretch of Pio Nono Avenue where the Kroger once stood.\n\nIn a quest to find pantry staples within walking distance, The Telegraph and GPB Macon assembled a shopping list of basic grocery items and set out on foot to find them. The list: milk, bread, eggs, chicken, bananas, apples, carrots, lettuce, beans, cereal, peanut butter and jelly.\n\nAt a Gulf gas station about a quarter-mile away, we found only two items on its list: beans and chicken \u2014 and the only chicken available was canned. The food aisles were stocked mostly with chips, candy and sugary drinks.\n\nAbout a quarter-mile farther down the road, a Family Dollar store sold a version of each item on the list but mostly in frozen, packaged or preserved form.\n\nThe next-closest option was a mile-and-a-half\u2019s walk from the shuttered Kroger. My Store, near the intersection of Anthony Road and Pio Nono Avenue, was the only nearby market that offered both fresh produce and meat, as well as non-essentials, like spices and sauces.\n\nBut our shopping list cost over $6 more at My Store than at Kroger. And while both My Store and Family Dollar accepted food stamps, the Gulf gas station on Pio Nono did not.\n\nWith no supermarkets nearby, shoppers have to take extra factors into account before making a trip to the store. Those without cars face extra obstacles, Gaddis said. The mile-and-a-half walk to My Store would make the store inaccessible for some.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to take buses or find some other means of transportation to try to get to a grocery store,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, that means paying to get there and then paying to get back home, and then also making sure that they\u2019re able to carry all of the groceries that they\u2019re purchasing back with them, using whatever transportation means that they have.\u201d\n\nIn a sprawling metropolitan area like Macon, access to a vehicle can make all the difference. There\u2019s no shortage of supermarkets in the suburbs.\n\nThe key is finding a way to get there.\n\n\u2018It hurts a lot of people\u2019\n\nChiquita Johnson drives dozens of friends and relatives to grocery stores around town, sometimes six or seven in a day. Johnson has offered free rides to friends without cars for years, and she said her trips to the market have increased about 75 percent since the Kroger closed last spring.\n\n\u201cIt hurts a lot of people,\u201d particularly those who live in the areas near the now-vacant store, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cKroger was the best healthy and affordable food that was in this part of south and west Macon,\u201d she said.\n\nWithout the Pio Nono Kroger, neighborhood residents still can access nutritious, low-cost groceries. They just have to do a bit more searching to find them.\n\nThe Mulberry Market in Tattnall Square Park accepts food stamps and offers a range of local produce, meat, dairy and baked goods each Wednesday afternoon. The Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program, known as WIC, also hosts an annual farmers market outside the Macon-Bibb County Health Department.\n\nLocal nonprofit organizations pitch in as well. Volunteers at Mulberry United Methodist Church tend a community garden and donate the produce to the church\u2019s food pantry. Some organizations also send traveling produce trucks to underserved areas, Gaddis said.\n\nBut Macon\u2019s food deserts have grown in the past year. Since last fall, Kroger, Target and Harveys have all closed locations in neighborhoods where grocery options already were scarce.\n\n\u201cClosing down grocery stores is going to increase the number of people who are going to be considered food insecure,\u201d Gaddis said.\n\nThe most obvious way to curb that food insecurity, Gaddis said, is to open more supermarkets with healthy, affordable options.\n\nUntil that happens, local residents will have to settle for the few options they\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get to other places,\u201d said Williams, the mom who sometimes spends two hours on a bus to grocery shop. \u201cSo, with us having that Kroger down there, it was easier. And we don\u2019t have to go all the way across town to go here to another Kroger or to go two miles or something to go to another place.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Telegraph, http://www.macontelegraph.com", "DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) \u2014 One Dubuque used bookstore helps a nonprofit organization provide a volume of services to residents.\n\nProceeds from the on-site used bookstore help fund the Tri-State Independent Blind Society.\n\n\u201cBingo is our main No. 1 (fundraiser) and then the bookstore income comes in,\u201d Debra Gagne, the organization\u2019s president, tells the Telegraph Herald . \u201cThese are our main things. Without these, we would be gone. We\u2019d have to close up.\u201d\n\nThe Tri-State Independent Blind Society was founded in 1972 to support local residents experiencing vision loss. The organization recently moved to a facility that houses the large hall for the society\u2019s fundraising bingo nights, a low-vision center and the bookstore. Bookshelves about 5-feet tall line the walls and fill the aisle of the small shop.\n\nOne recent morning, bookstore staff members Holly Gabel and Mary Vargas were busy sorting through boxes of donated books. The donations stock the store, which is open 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\n\u201cEverything is organized in here,\u201d Gabel said while sorting books. \u201cWe have them in categories and alphabetical order.\u201d\n\nThe store features hardcover and paperback, large-print and audio books for sale, as well as items such as photo puzzles.\n\nGabel said bookstore staff are selective when receiving the donated books.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t accept things that were stored in garages or basements,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want books smelling of cigarette smoke or things like that.\u201d\n\nBooks cost $1 apiece if their copyright date is 2011 or older. Books with more recent copyright dates cost $3 apiece.\n\n\u201cWe get teachers who come in here who are amazed at the cost of the children\u2019s books,\u201d Gabel said.\n\nProceeds from the bookstore fund the organization\u2019s activities.\n\n\u201cWe train people for Braille and cooking and computers and different kinds of things that they need,\u201d Gagne said. \u201cWe go to their home and help them out with marking stuff so they can stay in their individual homes.\u201d\n\nThe organization helps a few thousand people annually, but Gagne said the nonprofit remains a secret to some residents.\n\n\u201cA lot of people still don\u2019t know about Tri-State Blind,\u201d she said.\n\nVargas said the same attitude often applies to the bookstore.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of people saying, \u2018We didn\u2019t know where you were at,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegraph Herald, http://www.thonline.com", "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 The new Walk-On\u2019s Bistreaux & Bar corporate office is causing some confusion. Customers regularly walk into the building and ask to be seated for a meal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised how many people walk in thinking this is a restaurant,\u201d said Jeanne Hunt, who handles franchise compliance for Walk-On\u2019s and is the corporate human resources manager, along with serving as office manager. \u201cPeople come in all the time and ask for a table.\u201d\n\nThe confusion is understandable. The 27,000-square-foot office is at the other end of the Southgate Village Shopping Center from the still-operating original Walk-On\u2019s in Baton Rouge. And visible from the headquarters\u2019 entrance is a full-sized bar, complete with dozens of beer taps, bottles of top-shelf liquor and tables with self-service taps.\n\nHunt said Walk-On\u2019s officials wanted the corporate office to have the same feel as one of the chain\u2019s restaurants. That\u2019s why a shelf of restaurant-branded shirts, cups and basketballs is in the entrance, just like you would find at the hostess stand. And the sunken cypress wood that is part of the Walk-On\u2019s d\u00e9cor is found all over the office.\n\n\u201cWe built this as a showroom for the franchisees and the franchise prospects to show the different types of equipment that go into a Walk-On\u2019s,\u201d she said.\n\nAlong with serving as a model for what Walk-On\u2019s can look like, the offices are used to train corporate managers. That\u2019s why it makes sense to have a version of a restaurant bar inside the office.\n\nBut some of the other features of the office are more about making Walk-On\u2019s an enjoyable place to work. There\u2019s a half-sized basketball court and bleachers. There\u2019s a pool table. A couple of Pop-A-Shot arcade games sit in one part of the office, and there\u2019s a claw machine.\n\nHunt said those touches were a way of filling up all the space in the old Co-op Bookstore building that Walk-On\u2019s purchased in October 2017. The company had been taking up a 7,800-square-foot office on Third Street.\n\nThe move made sense. The Co-Op Bookstore space was just across a parking lot from the first Walk-On\u2019s and sits in the shadow of Tiger Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe want to make it cool and fun. We sell burgers and beer for a living,\u201d Walk-On\u2019s co-founder Brandon Landry told The Advocate at the time of the purchase. \u201cWe wanted to give the team an opportunity for a fun place to work.\u201d\n\nOther amenities have benefits for workers beyond productivity. The office features a workout room, complete with weights, cardiovascular machines and a punching bag. Twice a week, a trainer comes in and does free workout sessions for the workers.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always eat the healthiest of food,\u201d Hunt said. After all, the Walk-On\u2019s menu features dishes such as fried boudin balls, spinach and artichoke dip and burgers stuffed with bacon and cheese.\n\nSince the Walk-On\u2019s employees moved into the new office in March, Hunt said productivity has remained constant, even with all of the distractions for workers. She said the productivity may even be better because employees can take a little break and shoot baskets or play pool, then get back to work.\n\nKeeping productivity up is crucial for Walk-On\u2019s. The chain has doubled in size since summer 2017 and now has 24 locations in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. Plans are to open 30 restaurants in 2019.\n\nA monitor on display at the office lists tentative restaurant openings well into 2020, with plans in some cases to open several restaurants in a month. This will bring Walk-On\u2019s into new markets such as Orlando and Tampa, Florida; Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee; and Oklahoma City.\n\nSince the start of the year, Walk-On\u2019s has hired 10 additional employees to work in the offices, bringing the total staff up to 39. Hunt said plans are to hire four to six more workers before the end of the year.\n\nAll of the additional workers and the short time frame the office has been open make it difficult to compare how much productivity has gone up and employee absences have gone down.\n\n\u201cThere are no hard statistics, but everybody really enjoys the space,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cPeople are here more. I see that they are here more.\u201d\n\nMeagan Johnson, who advises companies on how to motivate different generations in the workforce, said offering amenities such as office fitness centers, pool tables and basketball courts are a trend for businesses.\n\n\u201cCompeting on pay is draining,\u201d she said. Businesses also see these things as a way of showing that their corporate culture is loose and fun.\n\nWhen potential employees come in and see that a business has a fun corporate culture with nice benefits, it helps the hiring process, Johnson said.\n\nBut Johnson said these perks are merely a side dish to the entree that is corporate culture. \u201cIf the culture in an organization stinks, and there\u2019s nothing there for that younger person to latch onto, it\u2019s not going to work,\u201d she said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s father, Larry, a corporate culture expert, said the best businesses offer tangible benefits, like fun perks and work and good pay, along with nontangible things, like feeling like you\u2019re part of a team and recognition.\n\n\u201cTangible things keep people working at a business, but nontangible things are powerful motivators,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com", "TUPELO, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Breast cancer survivors need to look to the future.\n\nWomen who are diagnosed with early-stage disease are expected to live full lives after treatment.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer screening has essentially transformed breast cancer care,\u201d said Tupelo radiation oncologist Dr. Benjamin Hinton. \u201cThe vast majority are diagnosed at early stage and have excellent prognoses. People are living longer than ever.\u201d\n\nGloria Cartwright, 68, of Corinth has logged 12 years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be able to say 12 years,\u201d said Cartwright, who credits a stubbornly positive attitude, prayer and good medical care.\n\nMarsha LeBlanc, 68, of Amory has 17 years as a breast cancer survivor and seven years as an ovarian cancer survivor.\n\n\u201cI feel so blessed every day to still be here with my family,\u201d LeBlanc said.\n\nPlanning for future\n\nSurvivorship care plans are getting more focus as part of breast cancer care. For its recently completed National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers, North Mississippi Medical Center Cancer Care and breast cancer physicians refined survivorship planning, said Tupelo surgeon Dr. Danny Sanders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had follow up, but it\u2019s much more standardized now,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen breast cancer patients complete treatment, they receive a packet detailing their treatment and laying out the recommended follow-up schedule.\n\n\u201cWe tailor that to the individual,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nMost recurrences will happen in three to five years, but they can occur further out, said Tupelo oncologist Dr. Pascal Wilson.\n\n\u201cWhen they clear the five-year hurdle, we think they\u2019re likely to stay clear,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nJust as doctors stress screening to catch breast cancer is early stages, it is also important to catch recurrences at early stages, said NMMC Cancer Care oncology nurse navigator Abigail Farris. There have been tremendous advances in managing metastatic disease.\n\n\u201cIf breast cancer recurs, it is treatable,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBreast cancer patients also have other health issues and risks that need to be monitored long term, Wilson said. A history of breast cancer increases the risk for some kinds of cancer. Some chemotherapy agents can have long-term impact on cardiac risk and bone marrow health. Hormone blockers can reduce the risk of recurrence, but they can increase the risk of blood clots or cause bone loss.\n\nWomen who had radiation treatment for breast cancer, especially before new techniques became widely used, need to be evaluated for ischemic heart disease, Hinton said. These side effects can take decades to develop, and affect a very small group.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons to have cardiac evaluation,\u201d Hinton said. \u201cThis is just one.\u201d\n\nAs survivors go well beyond the five-year mark, sometimes surgeons and medical oncologists will hand off the check-ups to a primary care physician, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t important.\n\n\u201cYou need to follow up with somebody,\u201d Farris said.\n\nDifficult journey\n\nWhen LeBlanc was diagnosed in 2002 with breast cancer, she knew she was in the fight of her life. Her mother died of breast cancer in 1982 at the age of 58.\n\n\u201cShe had such a hard time with treatment,\u201d LeBlanc said.\n\nLeBlanc had one of the most difficult, often aggressive, forms of breast cancer triple negative and doctors couldn\u2019t tailor her treatment to a specific receptor. As LeBlanc went through surgery and chemotherapy, she was carrying additional loads.\n\nHer oldest son, then 23, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2001. The family weathered a business-related crisis while she was going through treatment.\n\n\u201cIt added to the stress,\u201d LeBlanc said.\n\nIn November 2010, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer that was at least stage 3.\n\n\u201cIt was everywhere (in her abdomen) but my appendix,\u201d she said.\n\nStaying focused on her family \u2014 husband Ron, their three children and later three grandchildren \u2014 gave her strength to face both of her cancer diagnoses.\n\n\u201cThey really played a big part in keeping me mentally positive,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cThey still do.\u201d\n\nLeBlanc has check-ups every six months with scans every year. She\u2019s had good reports since completing treatment for ovarian cancer. Her son also remains healthy.\n\nPrayer has been a lifeline for LeBlanc. It helps her shed the fear and focus on what she can control.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t dwell on it,\u201d LeBlanc said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my part and trust my doctor. The rest of it, I\u2019ve given to God to take care of it.\u201d\n\nLessons in survival\n\nCartwright was diagnosed with stage 2, HER-2 positive breast cancer in 2006. She went through surgery and two rounds of IV-based chemotherapy and five years of an oral preventive.\n\nA veteran high school social studies teacher, she continued to teach through her treatment. Her students and co-workers helped her by washing hands and adjusting around the treatment schedule.\n\n\u201cYou can only do what your body lets you do, but do as much as you can,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cI knew (teaching) was better than sitting and having a pity party.\u201d\n\nNot everyone going through breast cancer is comfortable sharing their journey, but for Cartwright, it was uplifting to be on prayer lists throughout the community. She and husband Terry leaned on their pastor at First Baptist Church in Corinth. A student gave her a special verse.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to be known and have the prayers,\u201d Cartwright said.\n\nBecause of her treatment, she waited three years for reconstruction surgery, Cartwright said. It was a really important step in regaining her sense of self as a woman.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t look at myself without crying,\u201d before reconstruction surgery, she said. \u201cSince then, it\u2019s been much better.\u201d\n\nShe retired from teaching in 2012 after 33 years in the classroom, but she continues to serve as a volunteer tutor, church dessert chef and grandmother of six.\n\n\u201cService is my gift,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cThat\u2019s what God blessed me with.\u201d\n\nShe tends her garden and raises chickens. She focuses on eating healthy foods, including vegetables she grows in her garden. The sweets she bakes usually go to church or grandchildren. Even 12 years out, Cartwright is careful to continue her follow-up with her surgeon, her oncologist and gynecologist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more active since I retired,\u201d Cartwright said. \u201cWe don\u2019t sit.\u201d\n\nTaking care\n\nBreast cancer survivors need to move toward a healthy lifestyle to reduce their long-term risks.\n\nNot smoking, limiting alcohol intake, increasing physical activity and focusing on healthy nutrition can make a difference.\n\n\u201cThere are no absolutes, but you want to look back in 10 years, knowing you did everything to live the best possible life,\u201d Farris said. \u201cThe rest is in God\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nObesity influences cancer risk, Farris said. The cells in fat tissues can secrete hormones, which is an added risk for those who were diagnosed with hormone-positive breast cancer.\n\nIn general, NMMC Cancer Care dietitian Leanne Davis steers breast cancer survivors toward a healthy diet with more vegetables, fruits, lean protein and whole grains. They need less red meat and pork, processed foods and sugar.\n\nMyplate.gov is very helpful. There are apps and habits that can help guide good choices and help record food choices and exercise. Dietitians can help individualize plans.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to get to a healthier weight and find balance in your diet,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about eating perfectly, it\u2019s about being persistent.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com", "GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Andy Schneider had a vision.\n\nAs a band education major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, he wanted to marry his girlfriend of two or three years, Amy Rischling. In spring 2011, when she was student teaching under John Schultz at Walnut Middle School, Schneider decided to pop the question. Specifically, he wanted to propose to Rischling in the Walnut band room.\n\nSo Schneider called Schultz to inquire about the idea. Schultz liked it and together, the two wrote a quick arrangement of \u201cHere Comes the Bride\u201d to perform while Schneider proposed to Rischling.\n\n\u201cWe told Amy to run to Ron\u2019s Music to pick up some books. She did that and it bought us time to teach the sixth graders quick,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cWe told them it had to be a secret. The whole idea was that she was going to take out whatever song they were working on. When she said to do that, they got out \u2018Here Comes the Bride,\u2019 but she wasn\u2019t supposed to see it. She counted off this song and instead of playing the song, they played \u2018Here Comes the Bride.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchneider said the proposal \u201cworked out really well\u201d because Rischling said yes. The couple married in June 2012 and went on to pursue their lives together. However, they would later return to the Walnut band room where their journey began to pursue their careers together.\n\nJust this year, Andy Schneider started his role as band director at Barr Middle School after previously teaching at Doniphan-Trumbull Public Schools and Sandy Creek Public Schools. His wife, Amy, has been the band director at Westridge Middle School since May 2017 when she transitioned there from Grand Island Senior High.\n\nWith all three middle school band teachers collaborating to teach at all three Grand Island Public Schools middle schools, this means the Schneiders are teaching alongside each other, The Grand Island Independent reported.\n\n\u201cA lot of people question us on whether we can work with each other or if we are sure we want to do this,\u201d Amy Schneider said. \u201cFor me and him, it just came down to us making our marriage work. It is a choice you make when you get married and take the job you want. No matter what happens along the way, we are going to make it work without a problem. That is just a commitment we have.\u201d\n\nAndy Schneider said that when he got the job, he was \u201cpretty excited about it.\u201d He added it has been great so far.\n\n\u201cYou would think it would be a hassle going home and talking about the day when we\u2019ve been with each other all day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is actually kind of nice because we can go home and vent to each other about stuff that happened during the day. We talk about certain instances that happened throughout the day at school. It doesn\u2019t have a negative effect on us.\u201d\n\nDid the Schneiders ever think they would work together as husband and wife? Amy Schneider laughed and said, \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen we met and we were both pursuing music education, we knew that if we ended up getting married, we had to look for a place where there were two band or music jobs available. But we favor teaching band. It is not often that you get an opportunity to find two band jobs that we both really wanted in the same town, let alone the same building.\u201d\n\nAndy Schneider said he enjoys teaching middle school band alongside Amy and Schultz. He said he appreciates being able to learn from them, see them teach, and take mental notes of what did and did not work.\n\nAmy Schneider said she enjoys learning from Andy and watching him making connections with students.\n\n\u201cI just like his genuine passion for every kid in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just really tries to reach out to every kid in any way that he can. He tries to make connections with each kid. He has a great sense of humor and a great way of working with kids \u2014 especially middle-schoolers. He has a great personality for that.\u201d\n\nAndy said he and Amy have an \u201cold school approach\u201d to teaching and that their styles are similar. He added her dad was a band director, and former Barr band director Lew Cole was a mentor to him as his former teacher. As a result, Andy said, he and Amy try to channel both their teaching styles.\n\n\u201cWe think classroom management is a big point to get across to students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both think students don\u2019t really care how much you know until they know how much you care. We really try to make sure that the learning environment is structured and that there is discipline and expectations set before any learning happens.\u201d\n\nIn her classroom, Amy Schneider said, she wants her students to leave not only with the knowledge of how to play an instrument, but with the work ethic and leadership skills necessary to succeed in life.\n\nSchultz said the Schneiders are \u201cfantastic\u201d teachers who work well with students.\n\n\u201cThey work together and, although they don\u2019t do everything the same, they work together very well. They get along great and are just both great for kids,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoy getting to spend time with them daily, watching them teach, taking things from how they teach and adapting it for my classroom. They are just fun people to be around. We laugh a lot and have a great time teaching.\u201d\n\nAmy Schneider said she and Andy try to help each other grow as educators.\n\n\u201cWe will have conversations about what it is like and what we should do with a particular situation. We help each other through that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can go home and \u2018talk shop\u2019 just as easily as we can at school. Andy is just someone that is easy to talk to and make choices with.\u201d\n\nShe added it is her desire to continue learning and bettering herself that makes her an extraordinary teacher.\n\n\u201cI know it is something I will just continue to do. I don\u2019t think I will ever master it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where if you think you\u2019ve mastered it, you\u2019re not doing it right. You just got to keep trying to make yourself better. I hope that throughout my teaching career, I will continue to grow and find new ways to be a better teacher.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Grand Island Independent, http://www.theindependent.com", "STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 For the past five years, the Homestead Education Center in Starkville has raised money for community initiatives through its Holiday Helping Hands Project \u2014 everything from helping a child with cancer to saving a family\u2019s home to putting a roof on a community center.\n\nBut this year\u2019s project is, quite literally, the most creative project yet for Homestead director Alison Buehler.\n\nBeginning on Nov. 6, the Holiday Helping Hands drive hopes to raise $20,000 to print and distribute a series of chapter books geared specifically toward African-American children in grades 2-4, an idea that has been germinating in Buehler\u2019s mind for about five years.\n\nBuehler, who has written five books \u2014 including two children\u2019s books \u2014 is a former elementary school teacher and has long recognized the achievement gap in reading between black and white children. From grades 3-6, black children\u2019s performance in reading range anywhere from 22.1 percent to 27 percent lower than their white peers, she said.\n\nBuehler believes she has stumbled by accident onto an effective tool for closing that gap. When her daughter was in second grade, Buehler was shopping for a book to give as a birthday present to her daughter\u2019s friend, who is black.\n\nShe shopped for a book the child might relate to, perhaps a chapter book. Specifically, maybe a book that is part of a series designed for intermediate readers, usually ages 7 to 10, that follows a recurring main character or group of characters in a playful way with lots of illustrations. Chapter books serve a critical role as children progress from beginning to advanced readers.\n\nBut as she shopped, Buehler could not find any chapter books that featured black characters.\n\nThat experience stuck with Buehler. Three years ago, on a hiking trip to Colorado, she raised the topic with her longtime friend and college roommate, Lenora Witt, an African American.\n\n\u201cI asked her what her boys were reading,\u201d Buehler recalled. \u201cShe named all the books. There weren\u2019t any black characters in any of them, either.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the hiking trip, Buehler and Witt had devised a plan to write their own chapter books.\n\n\u201cChapter books are so important,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you become fluent, reading those chapter books. But there are no chapter books with black characters. When you don\u2019t have those, it impacts a child\u2019s motivation for reading, comprehension, vocabulary. I thought, \u2018We could really move the needle here.\u2019\u201d\n\nAn authentic voice\n\nBuehler immediately knew the book needed not only relatable black characters, but they need to have an authentic black voices and experiences.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just want the books to have a white voice speaking through black characters,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s where Witt came in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got some writing experience, but it\u2019s all in technical writing,\u201d Witt said. \u201cAlison has experience in creative writing, so the way it works out, she planned out the stories and I gave the characters their words, their personalities.\u201d\n\nTogether, the women wrote three chapter books revolving around a fifth-grade boy who lives in Memphis named Merlin Montgomery.\n\nMerlin doesn\u2019t like his name, so he comes up with a nickname he likes \u2014 \u201cBig Monty\u201d \u2014 and tries unsuccessfully to persuade his friends to call him by that name, which is a recurring subplot in the stories.\n\nIn addition to a name he doesn\u2019t like, Merlin also struggles to bridge the gap between the \u201cscience nerd\u201d he is and the cool kids, especially a boy name A\u2019lo.\n\nOther recurring characters are his fellow science enthusiast, Global, and Merlin\u2019s clever little sister, Josephine.\n\nThe decision to make the lead character a boy, Buehler said, was calculated.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is that girls will read books where the boys are the main characters, but boys won\u2019t read books about girls,\u201d she said.\n\nKeeping the stories funny\n\nAnother conscious decision was the types of stories featured in the books.\n\n\u201cThey need to be funny and about the kind of goofy things that kids that age love,\u201d Buehler said, noting the popularity of such off-the-wall books as \u201cCaptain Underpants\u201d and \u201cStink\u201d series.\n\nBuehler said after initially pitching the idea to a major children\u2019s book publisher, her team of teachers, parents and community members (dubbed Matt Maxx) chose to self-publish.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of reasons,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cFirst, they wanted to change the concept to make them more serious books. But we really wanted to stay with the idea of making them funny. Then, we wanted to make sure that these books weren\u2019t just about sales. We wanted them to stay true to the idea of encouraging kids to read. We felt it was important to make sure profits weren\u2019t the driving part of the equation.\u201d\n\nFor Witt, the project is deeply personal.\n\n\u201cI grew up in the Delta,\u201d said Witt, who now lives in Illinois. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anybody who looked like me in any of the books I read as a child.\u201d\n\nThe absence of black characters, Witt believes, is something that has impacted black children\u2019s lives in areas far beyond reading.\n\n\u201cWhen black children read stories with black characters, it can change the way they think about themselves,\u201d Witt said. \u201cI think (black children) are afraid of who we are because we\u2019ve been told we aren\u2019t great people. We feel defeated because we feel ignored.\n\n\u201cSo when you can catch black kids at a very early age and give them stories of people just like them, it builds confidence in those children,\u201d she added.\n\nFundraising and marketing\n\nWith Buehler and Witt collaborating on the stories, the two turned to Nashville-based illustrator Chris Miller to provide the artwork.\n\n\u201cHe just seemed to fit,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cWe liked his work, the wholesomeness of it. His characters looked natural, authentic. And he\u2019s Southern, which I think was important to because we really focused on these books having a regional feel.\u201d\n\nWith the stories and artwork for three books completed, the big hurdle will be funding.\n\nBased on her previous experience, Buehler estimates it will cost $20,000 to market, publish and distribute 1,000 copies of the \u201cBig Monty\u201d series to every elementary school library and Boys and Girls Club in the state before the end of the school year in May.\n\n\u201cWe have three books right now, but we\u2019d love to extend the series for a lot more if we can get the funding,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cWe really hope everybody will see how important this is and be a part of it. It\u2019s really a fun project.\u201d\n\nThe Holiday Helping Hands project will begin its Kickstarter fundraising campaign on Nov. 6.

(AP) \u2014 Before 5 a.m. on a Monday, Cedric Sanders started pushing his lawn mower through several lots full of long grass near the corner of South Holt and Mill streets. One lot contained a building he is leasing, the other two he started maintaining about nine months ago, simply, he said, because no one else was.\n\nHe put up a makeshift sign with a message, in an effort to demand more of the community.\n\nChanging it about once a month, the last spray-painted message Sanders chose asked those passing by: \u201cSo you\u2019re really just going to sit there and not save your historical community huh?\u201d\n\nThe sign sits about a block down from the Holt Street Baptist Church, where a little more than 60 years ago 5,000 people gathered for the first mass community meeting connected to the Montgomery Bus Boycott.\n\nTen years later, that same street would fill with marchers nearing the end of a 54-mile journey from Selma, fighting for their constitutional right to vote. A few blocks over is Loveless School, which housed the city\u2019s first junior and senior high schools for African-Americans. In another direction is the Cleveland Avenue YMCA, which was one of the few places black children could swim before and after desegregation.\n\nIn another message, sprawled across a large board nailed over what should be one window of a vacant house across the street, he painted: \u201cBlack people you are so important.\u201d\n\nA native of Montgomery, Sanders grew up in the Mobile/Capitol Heights area before leaving for the Army after high school. He remembers the neighborhood he\u2019s trying to help as once-thriving, having walked its streets many times on his way to his wife\u2019s childhood home on Jeff Davis Avenue. The couple started dating nearly 20 years ago while attending McIntyre Middle School.\n\nAfter tours across the world, stationed in places such as Korea and Hawaii, Sanders said he felt a calling to the west Montgomery neighborhood where he believes motivation and positivity has been lost. He plans to take the next three years off from active duty to dedicate himself to changing that.\n\nIt is an area where those who live there often feel their side of town has been forgotten, but Sanders views its future being ultimately destroyed by gentrification if the community doesn\u2019t start making changes now.\n\nIts historic importance will be capitalized on, he said, and people \u201cwill go around blaming the white man. When, in actuality, you haven\u2019t been taking care of your stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see a lot of people talking about doing stuff but at the same time nothing ever really happens,\u201d he added.\n\nLeading by example, he hopes those same people start to realize they need to \u201cget up and do something because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to be left behind.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his messages and his efforts to keep the three lots clean-cut and litter-free, he wants to open a pizza caf\u00e9 diagonally across from the large lot where his sign is.\n\n\u201cCan a Brotha Get a Slice\u201d won\u2019t just be a business, he said, but rather a hub for community members to come to for help and gather for hope.\n\nHe wants to bring in motivational speakers to discuss issues impacting African-Americans. He wants to offer help to the elderly residents with home repairs and rides to the grocery store. He wants to push the drugs and the gangs out of the area.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not for the community then we\u2019re going to push hard to push you out,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHe\u2019s hoping his actions will spark a chain reaction, but others in the community aren\u2019t so optimistic.\n\nFred Hunter lives a block down from the sign on the Mill Street house. Having been there since 1989, he said it\u2019s going to take a lot more than a caf\u00e9 and some words of positivity to clean his neighborhood up. Pointing to the scores of vacant homes, such as the one across the street with a collapsed roof, Hunter said what the area really needs is someone to come in and fix up or get rid of those.\n\nWhen it comes to businesses, he\u2019s seen many disappear, just like the neighborhood\u2019s residents. Across the street from the future caf\u00e9 is a grocery store that shuttered. Three lots down, Lamar\u2019s Laundromat did the same.\n\nVelma Powell, a member of the Holt Street Church of Christ for the past 60 years, hopes Sanders plans are obtainable, even if she isn\u2019t extremely optimistic.\n\nPowell said the caf\u00e9\u2019s location has been home to several businesses over the years, most recently a restaurant with home cooked meals, she recalled. They\u2019ve failed, she said, because the area is depressed and people in the community just don\u2019t have the money.\n\nHer church has witnessed the neighborhood shrink, with a congregation formerly twice the size as it is now.\n\n\u201cWe welcome anyone to come in and bring it back alive again. This street was beautiful years ago,\u201d she said, explaining that residents took a lot of pride in their property, regardless of size, and neighbors helped maintain properties when the owners could not.\n\nShe grew up about four blocks over, on Underwood Street. As time has gone on, she saw people leave the area looking for more sustainable opportunities.\n\n\u201cNobody really cared about the west side of town,\u201d she said. The city did pave Holt Street and put up some signs related to the Selma-to-Montgomery March route, she said, but, \u201cit didn\u2019t really help the community.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment is shared by many in west Montgomery, which was highlighted in the recent District 4 City Council election. Voters at the time expressed that they feel politicians tend to visit only during election season and don\u2019t do enough to engage the community during the rest of their time in office.\n\nHowever, the city cites several developments and investments in the area that add up to more than $153 million worth of work \u2014 including the construction of Carver High and Bellingrath Middle, new apartment complexes and housing improvements, along with major roadway updates.\n\nComing back to Sander\u2019s plans, Powell said, \u201cI want to see my community saved . I\u2019d love to see it come again before I close my eyes.\u201d\n\nSanders, despite the naysayers, has no reservations regarding the task he has assigned himself, though.\n\nHe recalls growing up and feeling that going against the grain was frowned upon.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you start doing the unthinkable, they want to stop you in your tracks,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, in the military, \u201cthey tell you if you want something, push harder for it.\u201d\n\nThe work maintaining the lots and changing the sign\u2019s message, might have been the easy part in his plan \u2014 despite also being in the reserves, attending school and raising three children. The major struggle has been the setbacks in opening the caf\u00e9 because of the numerous break-ins and burglaries the location has endured.\n\nThe wiring has been replaced, not once, but twice because it was stolen. The plumbing had to be replaced after the pipes were stolen. After he bought the materials to lay hardwood flooring, it was stolen, he said. Even the burglar bars on the windows were stolen, he said. And most recently, the toilet.\n\nThe next hurdle he\u2019ll face is making sure the cafe is a legal venture. To start out with, he\u2019d like to offer the pizza on a donation basis, to show residents he is there to give, not take, with any donations going back into his goal of helping residents, he said. However, city officials say this approach could still require some type of licensing, and at least further examination.\n\nRegardless, Sanders said, while pointing to his achievements thus far in life, people \u201cshould know by now that if I say I\u2019m going to do something, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t help the whole community, at least I can help some people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe neighborhood, he said, is, \u201cto the point where it\u2019s not sickening, it\u2019s just saddening. There\u2019s so much potential here, but it\u2019s like people don\u2019t want to do anything anymore. It\u2019s like they gave up hope.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Montgomery Advertiser, http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com", "Today in History\n\nToday is Sunday, Nov. 4, the 308th day of 2018.

You\u2019re going to see a lot of volatility. It is highly policy dependent. This is still absolutely a growing segment,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nJob creation is central to the argument for the clean energy transition. A more sustainable grid is not only good for the environment and for public health, but a smart grid can drive the economy \u2014 especially in the Midwest, where declining industrial communities are hoping to benefit from new investment and innovation.\n\nHere are the key numbers from U.S. Energy and Employment Report: Illinois shed 247 jobs but remained the regional leader in advanced grid jobs with 5,736 people employed.\n\nThe largest job losses were in Michigan, which lost 1,299 jobs or 21.9 percent of the state\u2019s smart grid jobs.\n\nIndiana lost 357 jobs (8.5 percent), and Nebraska lost 254 jobs (32.7 percent). States gaining jobs include Kansas (140 jobs or 13.7 percent), Minnesota (233 jobs or 7.2 percent), Ohio (254 jobs or 8.2 percent), Wisconsin (191 jobs or 8.2 percent), and South Dakota (62 jobs or 13.3 percent).\n\nJordan said there was no single reason for the declining job numbers. The volatility is likely related to smart meter deployment, which are variable and highly dependent on government policy.\n\n\u201cYou can have a public utility commission say: \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to put in smart meters on every house in a utility service area.\u2019 That\u2019ll create a lot of smart meter jobs,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nAnother issue relates to manufacturing. States like Ohio and Michigan, where advanced grid products are manufactured, are very sensitive to short-term changes in demand. Michigan shed 1,299 of its 5928 advanced grid jobs between 2016 and 2017.\n\nBusinesses in several states reported uncertainty around state policy as a reason for job declines. While researchers didn\u2019t detail any specific utility regulation or state law, Jordan said its likely local and not federal.\n\n\u201cThis stuff is still largely driven by utilities,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nOne factor hidden in these numbers is job intensity. When utilities install smart meters, they benefit from streamlining maintenance through automation. It saves them a lot of time and money that they would have spent servicing analogue meters. A utility worker who services smart meters is much more productive than a colleague who only works on analogue devices.\n\n\u201cYou still only have that one job, but the intensity of that job increases. And so that\u2019s happened in Illinois pretty dramatically in a bunch of different sectors where we\u2019ve seen an uptick. Energy efficiency is another example of that,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nIndustry experts believe that advanced grid jobs will rise sharply in the future, especially as more communities invest in energy storage.\n\n\u201cOur main focus has been on trying to get experience with demonstration of the technology,\u201d said Peter Tyschenko, manager of capacity planning at ComEd, Illinois\u2019 largest electric utility. \u201cThe jobs will grow as technology matures and the cost for these non-wired alternatives become more competitive with traditional grid type upgrades.\n\n\u201cBut our focus has been more about trying to get the operational learnings. How will they integrate with our various systems \u2014 communications systems, outage response, or process notifications.\u201d", "FORT SMITH, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Whether they\u2019re home grown or from the other side of the world, the muralists in The Unexpected this year are excited to bring their art to the streets of Fort Smith.\n\nAcclaimed muralists from all over the world each year travel to Fort Smith during The Unexpected to beautify the outsides of buildings in the downtown area. Though they greatly differ from each other in style, this year\u2019s muralists are enjoying changing the appearance of the town.\n\n\u201cThe murals are helping to bring parts of this place back to life and to bring something good to the town,\u201d said muralist Alex \u201cPref\u201d Geoffrey of London, England.\n\nGeoffrey, one of two Unexpected muralists from Europe, is painting his mural on the north side of a building in the southwest corner of Towson Avenue and North C Street. Geoffrey said his decision to accept the invitation to The Unexpected was \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had seen some of the murals that had happened in previous years,\u201d he said. \u201cWith some of them, I didn\u2019t even know they were at this event until I got here.\u201d\n\nWhen finished, Geoffrey\u2019s mural will depict three-dimensional block letters that spell out \u201cthe very best is yet to come\u201d in a flowing banner. Geoffrey said he got the idea for the mural because of the mission of The Unexpected to revive Fort Smith, the Southwest Times Record reported.\n\nGeoffrey is also using the color blue and the flowing pattern in his mural to pay homage to the Arkansas River, he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of towns settle along rivers and along coastlines, because historically, that\u2019s where goods and things are transported to and from. It\u2019s the connection to the outside world. In the past, the river has brought wealth and projects,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like the Arkansas River has brought this place prosperity in the past, this river is going to bring prosperity in the future.\u201d\n\nDiogo \u201cAdd Fuel\u201d Machado \u2014 the other muralist from Europe in the festival lineup \u2014 is painting an interpretation of Native American art on several consecutive storefronts in the 200 block of Towson Avenue, just a short walk from Geoffrey. Though he mostly paints in Europe, Machado said he had heard of The Unexpected before he was invited.\n\n\u201cI follow what\u2019s going on in the street art world, and it\u2019s such an interesting festival,\u201d Machado said.\n\nMachado decided to paint an adaptation of Native American art, he said, because it pays homage to the area he\u2019s working in. He is incorporating three Native American patterns into his mural.\n\nThe finished mural will also have \u201crips\u201d depicted in it, giving the appearance of torn layers of paper, Machado said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping, somehow, people can connect to it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other side of Towson, a local artist \u2014 Nate \u201cBuffalo\u201d Meyers of Fort Smith \u2014 is painting a mural on the north wall of the Habitat For Humanity ReStore building. Meyers, who has painted murals in Denver and Memphis, said he has worked in The Unexpected in different capacities since 2016 but got his own wall this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird how this stuff kind of snowballs,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cYou do one, and then people hit you up and want you to do more.\u201d\n\nMeyers\u2019 mural largely relies on squares to drive its design. He said his geometric approach was inspired by artist Frank Stella.\n\nMeyers also said the theme of the mural ties into the mission of Habitat for Humanity, if one considers its ancient origins.\n\n\u201cFor the Sumerians, the grid is the basis of everything being built off of. This work is mostly constructionist versus a composition,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess there\u2019s a relationship there with house building.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the muralists hope their work brings life to Fort Smith.\n\n\u201cThe artists are also sort of like architects,\u201d Machado said. \u201cThey change the scenery of the public space.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Southwest Times Record, http://www.swtimes.com/", "MUSKOGEE, Okla.

(AP Photo/Craig Mitchelldyer)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 It took LeBron James to help the Los Angeles Lakers snap a lengthy losing streak against Portland.\n\nJames had 28 points and seven assists and the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers 114-110 Saturday night.\n\nThe Lakers snapped the franchise\u2019s 16-game losing streak against the Blazers. In addition to the streak, Saturday was the Lakers\u2019 first road win this season against a team with a winning record.\n\n\u201cGreat to snap that,\u201d James said of the Lakers\u2019 streak of futility against Portland. \u201cThey\u2019re a very good team, obviously. To beat Portland, you can\u2019t just come in and win without playing really hard and really well.\u201d\n\nRajon Rondo gave the Lakers a huge lift off the bench, finishing with 17 points and 10 assists in 25 minutes.\n\nDamian Lillard and CJ McCollum each scored 30 points for Portland.\n\nThe Lakers used a 16-0 run in the third quarter to take a 17-point lead. Josh Hart hit a 3-pointer with 9:44 left that gave the Lakers their biggest lead at 95-75, forcing a Portland timeout.\n\nAnd the timeout might have been just what Portland needed to get back into the game.\n\nThe Blazers went on a 22-8 run, cutting the Lakers\u2019 lead to six points with 3:34 left after a layup by Jusuf Nurkic.\n\nSloppy play once again came back to hurt the Lakers in the fourth quarter, but the Blazers couldn\u2019t get much closer as James and JaVale McGee made crucial baskets in the final two minutes.\n\n\u201cLeBron closed them out over the final three minutes,\u201d Lakers head coach Luke Walton said of James.\n\nMcGee, who James said is a candidate for Defensive Player of the Year, also had six blocks to add to his league-leading total.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing a little bit of everything,\u201d James said of McGee. \u201cHe\u2019s leading the league in blocks. And tonight he saved us and covered our defensive mistakes with blocks at the rim.\u201d\n\nPortland shot a 6 for 35 (17 percent) from beyond the arc and shot just 42 percent from the field overall.\n\n\u201cOur defense won us the game tonight,\u201d Walton said. \u201cThey missed some 3s, but we were contesting, chasing over the top and defending.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 overall, but they survived their mistakes.\n\nThe Lakers sped to a good start, but the Blazers quickly regained control. Turnovers and second chances fueled a 17-2 run by Portland in the first quarter.\n\nThe Lakers bench helped get Los Angeles back into the game in the first half and outscored the Blazers subs 51-26.\n\n\u201cOur second unit was outstanding tonight,\u201d Walton said. \u201cRondo led it and then the lift that (Ivica) Zubac gave us off the bench was incredible.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: Blazers head coach Terry Stotts says it\u2019s hard to get a handle for where his team really is on the defensive end due to the league\u2019s uptick in pace and scoring so far this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a handle around the league where defense is,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cThe numbers say we\u2019re 11th but it doesn\u2019t feel like it, but we are. I think this season has to settle in to see where we are with it. Unless you hold a team to 80 or 90 you\u2019ll always find things you have to get better at.\u201d\n\nLakers: Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler will join the Lakers once he clears waivers after agreeing to a contract buyout. A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the buyout plan to The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Suns had not yet revealed it publicly.\n\nWhile Lakers head coach Luke Walton dodged direct questions about the move, Stotts likes what Chandler brings to the table for the Lakers. Stotts coached Chandler in Dallas in 2011.\n\n\u201cI like Tyson Chandler,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cGreat teammate, obviously that was a few years ago but he impacts the game at the defensive end. He\u2019s a great locker room guy, great teammate. He\u2019s all about winning.

Kyrsten Sinema, wore a canary-yellow dress and 4-inch platform shoes with cactus applique as she presided over the coin toss.\n\nBut the crowd of 46,000 greeted both U.S. Senate candidates the same way: with a mix of cheers and boos.\n\nIt was a fitting kickoff to the final weekend before the 2018 midterms , a campaign that seemingly launched the day after Donald Trump was elected president two years ago that is climaxing in the shadow of a bomb plot targeting Democratic leaders and the worst anti-Semitic shooting in U.S. history. Each side is doing everything it can to mobilize voters, warning of the dire consequences of failure.\n\nDemocrats are counting on wresting control of the House from Republicans and hoping for a longshot series of wins to take back the Senate as well. But Republicans are optimistic they can gain seats in a Senate map heavy on red states and haven\u2019t given up on holding the House.\n\nNeither side wanted to leave anything on the field in the final weekend.

Gaskin sat out a win over Colorado and loss to California, and his absence only highlighted his importance to Washington\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best at hiding behind his guys, letting things develop and getting to the right spot,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nGaskin and Browning were the foundation of the Huskies (7-3, 5-2 Pac-12) building a 21-0 lead, scoring on their first three possessions. Browning ran for a 2-yard touchdown , threw an 11-yard TD pass to Drew Sample, and Gaskin\u2019s 6-yard run early in the second quarter capped the scoring blitz.\n\nBut the Huskies offense became conservative and was unable to find the end zone the rest of the way, making for a nervy second half after Stanford\u2019s K.J.

Riccitelli missed the extra point and the Huskies lead was 27-23.\n\nThe missed extra point ended up being a big moment.\n\nWashington was only able to run 79 seconds off the clock before punting and Stanford took possession at its 15 with 2:05 left. Instead of a field goal being enough, the Cardinal needed a touchdown because of the missed extra point.\n\nCostello hit five passes to get to the Washington 34 with 10 seconds left.

The Huskies scored touchdowns on their first three drives. They picked off Costello twice, including a diving interception by 320-pound defensive tackle Greg Gaines off a pass deflected by Ben Burr-Kirven. Stanford failed to get a first down in the first quarter and had just 96 yards of offense until the final drive of the half.\n\nINJURIES\n\nStanford played the final 2 \u00bd quarters without leading receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside after he left midway through the second quarter with a right ankle/foot injury. Arcega-Whiteside was held without a catch until grabbing a pass from Costello with 5:24 left in the first half.

Meanwhile, bleary eyed migrants who had charged ahead to Mexico City expressed gratitude for the support of their fellow travelers, saying they would not have had the strength or courage to get so far on their own.\n\nA few arrived at a large outdoor stadium in the capital, where they lounged on bleachers and watched Mexicans play soccer. City employees piled hot food onto Styrofoam plates for the migrants, some of whom had hopped freight trucks to speed their arrival to the capital. Others rested inside a church in the city of Puebla.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border the caravan will aim for eventually, or how many may splinter off on their own.\n\nMost of the migrants said they remain convinced that traveling as a large mass is their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cWe think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,\u201d said Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, traveling with his wife, Jessica Fugon. \u201cOthers went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.\u201d\n\nMynor Chavez, a 19-year-old from Copan, Honduras, was also determined to continue.\n\n\u201cI have no prospects (in Honduras). I graduated as a computer technician and not even with a degree have I been able to find work,\u201d he said of his home country.\n\nManuel Calderon, 43, a migrant from El Salvador, lifted his shirt to show scars from two bullets he said pierced his torso in his home country. He dreams of making it back to the U.S., from which he was deported a little more than two years ago.\n\nOn the road, Calderon was received by ordinary Mexicans lending a hand. Catalina Munoz said she bought tortillas on credit to assemble tacos of beans, cheese and rice when she heard the migrant caravan would pass through her tiny town of 3,000 inhabitants. She gathered 15 others to help make the tacos, fill water bottles and carry fruit to weary travelers on the roadside.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing around 1,000 people who want to reach the U.S. border. That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 people, entered Mexico early last week. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, and largest, group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nMexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journey.\n\nMexico\u2019s Interior Ministry estimated Saturday that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry says 2,793 migrants have pursued refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nUncertainty awaits migrants who reach the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "Supporters of President Donald Trump cheer as he arrives to speak at a campaign rally, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Chattanooga, Tenn.

Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee\u2019s GOP candidate for Senate, picked up on a frequent Trump theme when she mentioned that the election would be a fresh chance to reject the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cIf you want to vote \u2018no\u2019 on Hillary Clinton and her cronies one more time, then stand with me,\u201d she said. This came during a rally where Trump urged his supporters to move forward by supporting Republicans and not go back by supporting Democrats. \u201cDemocrats want to turn back the clock,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey are stuck in the past.\u201d\n\nGUEST APPEARANCE: Trump expressed surprise at the presence of country singer Lee Greenwood, even though the appearance had been publicly announced before the rally. Greenwood\u2019s hit \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d has been a standard at Trump\u2019s events ever since he announced his campaign for president. A Trump campaign statement earlier in the day noted that the president \u201cwill be pleased\u201d to have Greenwood perform in person.

(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s rare that Florida, Florida State and Miami lose on the same day.\n\nBut all three losing on consecutive weekends?\n\nThat\u2019s never happened \u2014 until now.\n\nThe \u201cBig Three\u201d of Sunshine State football are struggling simultaneously right now, in historic fashion. Florida lost to Missouri 38-17 on Saturday, Florida State fell against North Carolina State 47-28 and Miami lost to Duke 20-12, a trio of defeats that marked only the third day in the last 40 years where all three played and lost.\n\nLosing on the same day also happened on Oct. 30, 2004 and Oct. 8, 2011 \u2014 it didn\u2019t happen last weekend because Miami lost to Boston College on Friday night, before Florida lost to Georgia on Saturday and Florida State lost 59-10 to Clemson. Take away the 2004, 2011 and 2018 debacles, and the most recent instance of Florida, Florida State and Miami losing on the same day was Oct. 14, 1978.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well, at all,\u201d Florida coach Dan Mullen said Saturday.\n\nHe was speaking of his own team, of course.\n\nBut the same would have applied to the Seminoles and Hurricanes. His counterparts \u2014 Florida State\u2019s Willie Taggart and Miami\u2019s Mark Richt \u2014 had no choice but to offer similar sentiments about their own clubs as a woeful Sunshine State Saturday dragged to a close.\n\nThe Seminoles are 4-5 and in danger of missing a bowl after their loss.\n\n\u201cOur guys know how to play football,\u201d Taggart said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to teach them how to win.\u201d\n\nMiami\u2019s reign as the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s Coastal Division champion is almost certainly over, with the Hurricanes falling to 5-4 overall and 2-3 in league play after their third consecutive loss.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of really good answers, right this minute,\u201d Richt said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you all have a bunch of questions. It\u2019s just heartbreaking to not be able to get the victory. We put a lot into it and didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d\n\nMiami\u2019s last win was against Florida State, four weeks ago.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re working hard,\u201d Miami safety Jaquan Johnson said. \u201cI think we just need to execute better. We start executing better, I think things will start going our way.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get exactly easier for the three storied Florida programs. Florida State plays Notre Dame next weekend, Miami goes to Georgia Tech and Florida meets former coach Will Muschamp and South Carolina.\n\nAnd the NFL teams aren\u2019t exactly helping the mood of disgruntled fans around the state: All three of Florida\u2019s pro clubs lost last week as well, with the Miami Dolphins losing in a Thursday night matchup on Oct. 25 and the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers falling last Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Oklahoma's Kyler Murray (1) passes the ball downfield during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Texas Tech, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Lubbock, Texas.

And then I did it again. And then it was just, I mean, you have kind of got to know me. I\u2019m cool, calm, and that\u2019s the only way to be after you do something like that.\u201d\n\nThe Red Raiders led 31-28 at halftime, but Bowman didn\u2019t return and ended up in a Lubbock hospital, just as he did Sept. 29 when he first sustained the lung injury in a loss to West Virginia.\n\nBowman, who the school said would be held overnight for observation, returned two weeks ago against Kansas. Coach Kliff Kingsbury said Bowman re-injured the lung on a run near the goal line late in the first half.\n\nThe Big 12 passing leader\u2019s absence changed the flow of a game that was looking a lot like the 65-59 touchdown fest the Sooners won in Lubbock two years ago.\n\nTexas Tech punted three straight times without getting a first down after Jett Duffey replaced Bowman again, just as he did against the Mountaineers.\n\nBut Duffey did get the Red Raiders moving again, and they pulled within two on his 4-yard scoring pass to Zach Austin on fourth down midway through the fourth quarter. But Robert Barnes intercepted the 2-point conversion pass and returned it 98 yards for two points and a 44-40 OU lead.\n\n\u201cI should have found a way to get him more comfortable at the start of the second half than I did,\u201d Kingsbury said. \u201cOnce he got in a rhythm and he was competing and doing his deal, he played really well.\u201d\n\nBoth of Murray\u2019s interceptions were by Vaughnte Dorsey, on his first throw of the game and again on OU\u2019s second possession.\n\nBowman threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Vasher after the Red Raiders got the ball on the Oklahoma 3 following Dorsey\u2019s 17-yard return on the first interception .\n\nAfter a 31-yard return on Dorsey\u2019s second pick , Duffey came on as change of pace replacement for Bowman and threw a screen that Ta\u2019Zhawn Henry took 14 yards for a 14-0 lead.\n\nMurray bounced back to lead the Sooners to 687 total yards in what figures to be his only chance to match Mayfield\u2019s run to the four-team playoff last season since the junior is expected to pursue pro baseball after one year as OU\u2019s starter.\n\n\u201cSometimes a guy can get a little gun shy when you have a start like that,\u201d said Lincoln Riley, who was on the sidelines at his alma mater for the first time since replacing Bob Stoops. \u201cAnd he wasn\u2019t. He kept flinging. He ran the ball well.\u201d\n\nLee Morris caught two of Murray\u2019s TDs, the second a 46-yarder that put the Sooners ahead for good 35-31 in the third quarter. Morris had 101 yards receiving. Texas Tech\u2019s Antoine Wesley caught 12 passes for 199 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOklahoma: The Sooners gave up more than 300 yards for the first time in three games since former Texas Tech assistant Ruffin McNeill replaced the fired Mike Stoops as defensive coordinator. It\u2019s hard to gauge the progress of the unit because of Bowman\u2019s injury. The Red Raiders finished with 473 total yards.\n\nTexas Tech: The Red Raiders will wonder what might have been if Bowman had been able to return in the second half. He was 21 of 26 for 227 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Still, Duffey showed persistence similar to first time Bowman was injured. He threw for two scores and ran for one that gave Texas Tech a shot at an onside kick with 1:05 remaining. It failed.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nOU could move up a spot because of No. 4 LSU\u2019s shutout loss to top-ranked Alabama. The rest of the teams ahead of the Sooners won impressively and the two teams behind them had closer-than-expected victories.\n\n30-YARD MARCH-OFF\n\nReceiver CeeDee Lamb stopped Oklahoma\u2019s momentum when he was called for a personal foul and unsportsmanlike conduct after catching a pass for a first down at the Texas Tech 7. The 30 yards in penalties led to a punt when the Sooners were on the verge of a second straight touchdown drive and their first double-digit lead in the third quarter.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOklahoma: Bedlam is at home against Oklahoma State next Saturday.\n\nTexas Tech: Another big home game against No. 15 Texas next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "", "", "Flows to increase through the Colorado River in Grand Canyon\n\nPAGE, Ariz.

Pam Baker\u2019s daughters Bailey, 23, and Anna, 14, often help with the cooking, and 17-year-old son Aidan helps with washing dishes.\n\nItems come in servings of three. Order forms list ingredients, calories and Weight Watcher points. Baker is not a registered dietitian, but she often chooses recipes from such sources as Cooking Light that focus on healthy recipes.\n\nMost of her recipes are low-calorie, she said. \u201cBut some of my clients are just busy people, not trying to lose weight, and they sometimes ask for something more indulgent,\u201d she said.\n\nThough the menus constantly change, she said she typically offers one or more salads and some soups, stews or chilis. \u201cOur kale salad is really popular,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd our white chicken chili is a huge favorite.\u201d\n\nRecent menu items have included chicken Marsala, roast pork tenderloin with blueberry sauce and steamed broccoli, sausage and apple-stuffed sweet potatoes, three-cheese Mediterranean lasagna, Tex-Mex shrimp salad and broccoli-cheddar quiche.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t offer separate side dishes. Everything is sold together. \u201cBut we do a lot steamed vegetables, so what you get is a full meal,\u201d Baker said.\n\nPrices for the three-serving dishes range from about $15 to $26.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to offer more variety. Now we have over 100 menu items,\u201d Baker said.\n\nAll of the items are individually packaged to encourage people to eat modest portions. Hot items can be microwaved. And many items are freezer-friendly for customers who don\u2019t plan to eat them right away.\n\nMany of Baker\u2019s customers follow Weight Watchers, and they like that she uses Weight Watchers points.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried all kinds of delivery services, and none of them had the Weight Watchers component,\u201d said Mandy Haggerson of Advance, who described herself as a busy mom with small children. \u201cI\u2019ve also gotten to know the owners and I feel like they walk the walk. They live healthy lifestyles,\u201d she said.\n\nCarla Lindstrom, a client of Baker\u2019s at the Y, said she lost about 30 pounds in eight months with exercise and diet. \u201cPart of eating unhealthy is a need for speed,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have quick meals, you choose badly. So this made it a lot easier for me to eat healthy.\u201d\n\nLindstrom particularly likes such items as the Korean brisket tacos and the turkey meatloaf. \u201cI\u2019ve basically ordered it every week. I\u2019ve never gone away hungry.\u201d\n\nMartha Davis Wilson said she loves convenience of the pre-portioned items, which helps her manage her weight. \u201cAnd most of the ones I love are easy to freeze,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe menu changes every week, but (Baker) always brings back items, and she\u2019s very open to suggestions,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBaker credited restaurateur Mary Haglund, the founder of Mary\u2019s Gourmet Diner in Winston-Salem, with encouraging her to follow her dream and with offering her advice on starting the business.\n\nIn January, Baker plans to open her commercial kitchen for lunch on Mondays. That way, people can pick up advance orders, but also get lunch while they\u2019re at it. \u201cIt will be mostly grab-and-go, but we\u2019ll also have a few tables,\u201d she said.\n\nBaker said that Healthy Made Simple isn\u2019t just appealing to people\u2019s desire to get nutritious, low-calorie meals, but also to their desire for convenience. \u201cThere\u2019s no shopping. There\u2019s no cleanup. Some people are trying to lose weight. But some people are just busy.\n\n\u201cThis is just a convenient way to take some of the chaos out of your life.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Winston-Salem Journal, http://www.journalnow.com", "EASLEY, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Amanda Kelley didn\u2019t set out to become the first female enlisted soldier to pass the incredibly rigorous Army Ranger course.\n\nFor Staff Sgt. Kelley, a native of Easley, that was just another step along the path toward her bigger goal \u2014 to become Sergeant Major of the Army.\n\nNot a Sergeant Major in the Army. The Sergeant Major of the Army. There\u2019s only one.\n\nAnd purely by the coincidence of her gender, if it happens, she would be the first female to attain that office, the highest position enlisted personnel can hold.\n\nBut let\u2019s back up a little bit.\n\nRanger School. Fort Benning, Georgia. A 62-day gauntlet-run that two out of three who try fail.\n\nYou don\u2019t just get qualified to be a Ranger on a whim. Rangers have to be ready to embark upon dangerous special ops missions at a moment\u2019s notice. These are the soldiers who go busting down doors with guns a-blazing deep in enemy territory, softening up the resistance for the regular troops.\n\nI caught up with Kelley by phone from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, after plowing through about 14 layers of bureaucracy to track her down. She\u2019s actually stationed at Fort Bliss.\n\nOne thing I learned very quickly from her: The test you have to pass to become a Ranger is the same for everybody. (That included shaving her head, just like the guys).\n\n\u201cI have a lot of people ask me how does it feel as a female going through Ranger school? I don\u2019t know, because I\u2019m not a male. I can\u2019t compare,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I can tell you what it\u2019s like as a soldier going through. And honestly, it\u2019s the same for male and female. We all go through the same thing at the same time. You look left or right and each one of you is hurting just as bad. And you just pick up your rucksack and keep going.\u201d\n\nSome of those hard things you have to do: at least 49 push-ups in two minutes; 59 sit-ups in two minutes; run 5 miles in 40 minutes or less.\n\nThat\u2019s just the introductory phase.\n\nThey go into north Georgia for the mountain phase \u2014 you can probably guess what that\u2019s like \u2014 and there\u2019s a swamp phase that involves negotiating swamps in Florida while carrying a \u201crucksack\u201d that weighs anywhere from 80 to 120 pounds. In fact, you have to carry that rucksack wherever you go through the whole thing.\n\nNot much fun!\n\nIn fact, Kelley injured her back a week and a half into the 62-day program and had to \u201crecycle\u201d for five weeks before continuing. She\u2019s not sure how it happened, but it\u2019s common for Ranger candidates. Half of her company recycled along with her.\n\nShe got the bug to become a Ranger when she was deployed in Iraq from June 2017 until March of this year. She started training with officers in her outfit who encouraged her to go for it.\n\n\u201cAfter work, at lunch, whenever we had any free time downrange, we were running, rucking, swimming, doing everything,\u201d she said.\n\nBeing woefully ignorant of military lingo, I had to ask her what rucking is. It\u2019s running around with that big, heavy rucksack on your back, of course.\n\nSo after months of training in the Iraqi desert, she started Ranger School at the end of May. She graduated Aug. 31.\n\nNone of this was about trying to be the first woman anything.\n\n\u201cI like challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when I was in (Ranger) school I wasn\u2019t worried about making history, I wasn\u2019t worried about any of that. I was just worried about getting through this training because I didn\u2019t want to fail.\u201d\n\nShe describes herself as \u201ca sore loser.\u201d\n\n\u201cFailure\u2019s not an option,\u201d she said.\n\nEarning her Ranger \u201ctab,\u201d which qualifies her to join a Ranger battalion, \u201cfelt amazing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEvery day I think I grasp a little more what it actually means to soldiers and NCO Corps and females throughout the military what I was able to accomplish,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she said it was just a matter of time being in her favor. Females weren\u2019t allowed to try to become Rangers until the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in combat five years ago.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think if this school was afforded to females a long time ago there would have been a lot more females make it through already,\u201d she said.\n\nActually, she\u2019s not the first female to have completed the program but the first enlisted woman. She was the 16th, but all the others were officers.\n\nKelley seems to take pride in her status as an enlisted soldier rather than an officer \u2014 as evidenced by her goal of being the top enlisted officer in the whole Army, rather than aiming to put some brass on her sleeve.\n\nWhy does she want that job?\n\n\u201cBecause I want to influence hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a positive way,\u201d she said.\n\nNothing in her upbringing would seem to point her in the direction of becoming an elite member of the military.\n\nShe was raised by her grandparents, the late Jimmy Edward \u201cPapa Ed\u201d Kelley, and Stacy Brewer, now remarried and living in Pickens.\n\nAfter graduating from Easley High School in 2007, Kelley, now 29, wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted to do with her life. She eventually went to ECPI, a private tech school in Greenville, where she learned some of what helped her in her current job as an electronic warfare specialist.\n\nShe joined the Army at age 22.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get out of Easley. It\u2019s so small. I wanted to be somebody,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be a part of something bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nShe spent two years at Camp Casey in South Korea before moving to Fort Bliss. At Fort Sill, she\u2019s taking a senior leader course, which she needs to complete to become a sergeant 1st class.\n\nSo, if I were the current Sergeant Major of the Army, I would be looking for another role for myself somewhere down the road, because the first enlisted woman Ranger School graduate is working her way up the chain of command. And things are likely to never be the same again.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Greenville News, http://www.greenvillenews.com", "", "", "", "", "", "SMU quarterback Ben Hicks looks for an open receiver as Houston linebacker Emeke Egbule (8) pressures during the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Dallas. (AP Photo/Brandon Wade)\n\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 SMU has won only two games against Top 25 teams in the past seven years. Ben Hicks has been a big part of both of those wins against Houston.\n\nHicks threw for 318 yards and four touchdowns as SMU beat No. 17 Houston 45-31 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI feel like it was kind of a similar game, honestly,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cJust like two years ago, I was happy to see the smiles on the seniors\u2019 faces who had been through so much and were able to kind of feel like they were part of something special. And I feel the same way now as an older guy.\u201d\n\nThe Mustangs (4-5, 3-2 American) never trailed, jumping out to a 17-0 lead after Hicks threw his second TD, a 17-yarder to Tyler Page less than a minute into the second quarter.\n\nHouston played its first game as a ranked team under second-year coach Major Applewhite.\n\n\u201cThis is really the first time we\u2019ve left a ballgame all year where we said we\u2019ve played well on defense, played well on offense and played well on special teams,\u201d SMU coach Sonny Dykes said. \u201cAnd so I think the bar\u2019s been set for our guys from a performance standpoint and I feel like we know what we\u2019re capable of and I\u2019m excited to see how they respond from here.\u201d\n\nHicks threw three TDs as a redshirt freshman in the shocker two years ago, when SMU beat the then-No. 11 Cougars 38-16, who then fell all of the way out of the poll.\n\nThe Mustangs are 0-18 against other Top 25 opponents in the past seven years, and had lost six in a row by an average margin of three touchdowns since the 2016 win over Houston.\n\nAfter the Cougars (7-2, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) got within 38-31 on quarterback D\u2019Eriq King\u2019s 3-yard touchdown run with 9:34 left, SMU went on a time-consuming 13-play drive that ended with Ke\u2019Mon Freeman\u2019s second touchdown run, an 8-yarder with 2:43 left.\n\nThat drive was interrupted for about 90 minutes because of lightning and heavy rain.\n\nFreeman ran 20 times for 107 yards. The Mustangs had 196 yards rushing \u2014 54 more than they had in their last three games combined.\n\nThe Cougars were held to 365 total yards, 205 below their national-leading 571 average coming into the game. They failed to reach 40 points for the first time this season, ending their nation\u2019s longest active streak at eight games.\n\n\u201cWell, No. 1 give credit to SMU,\u201d Applewhite said. \u201cYou never want to shortchange somebody\u2019s effort and how they prepared, and they\u2019re playing great football. ... In the first half, we didn\u2019t play well, we weren\u2019t moving the ball well enough consistently on offense.\u201d\n\nKing did have at least two passing TDs and a rushing score for the ninth straight game, the longest such streak for an FBS player in the last 20 years. But he ran 12 times for only 31 yards and was 11 of 22 passing for 175 yards a week after his 551 total yards against USF.\n\nSMU sacked King four times after the Cougars had allowed five sacks their first eight games.\n\nHicks completed 28 of 43 passes. Reggie Roberson Jr. (134 yards) and James Proche (90 yards) both had nine catches.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nHouston: While their five-game winning streak was snapped, the Cougars still control their own destiny for getting to the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\n\u201cEverything is still ahead of us,\u201d Applewhite said. \u201cWe\u2019re still the same football team we were the last five weeks when we won games, but we have to refocus.\u201d\n\nSMU: Since starting 0-3 in Dykes\u2019 first season, the Mustangs have won four of six. The losses in that span are to still-undefeated UCF and in overtime to one-loss Cincinnati. Hicks has thrown for at least 291 yards in all three games since returning to the starting role after freshman William Brown started three games.\n\nNO OLIVER\n\nHouston played its second consecutive game without standout defensive tackle Ed Oliver because of a bruised right knee. He went through pregame warmups but didn\u2019t play.\n\n\u201cHe had been cleared, but still there\u2019s a comfort level to be able to play,\u201d Applewhite said.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nA week after the Cougars went from unranked to 17th, they could conceivably be unranked again. If they stay in the new Top 25 on Sunday, it will in the bottom couple of spots.\n\nQUICK TDs\n\nAfter going down 17-0, Houston scored two touchdowns in 54 seconds. King threw a 50-yard TD to Marquez Stevenson before Gleson Sprewell scooped up an SMU fumble and returned it 24 yards.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHouston is home against Temple next Saturday.\n\nSMU hits the road to play UConn next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "", "", "New York Islanders goaltender Thomas Greiss (1) makes a save against New Jersey Devils center Brian Boyle (11) during the first period of an NHL hockey game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in New York.

He had only taken 18 shots from beyond the arc in his five-year career, including one this season. But this time, he drained one in front of his own bench during an 18-0 run.\n\n\u201cIt was the end of the shot clock and we had to get it up so I took it,\u201d Plumlee said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how it started a run. They took a timeout so I could have more time to have fun.\u201d\n\nJamal Murray scored 19 for Denver, which won its fourth straight and has won eight of nine games so far.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 great start is due, in part, to an improved defense that is allowing just 101.9 points a game, almost seven fewer than last season. It\u2019s a pace they want to continue throughout the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 8-1 and we have one of the best defenses in the NBA, so why not?\u201d coach Michael Malone said. \u201cThat\u2019s our challenge.

Mitchell, who finished with 16 points, missed Friday night\u2019s loss to Memphis with a right hamstring injury. He was helped off favoring his left leg, but returned a few minutes later.\n\n\u201cI was just being a baby,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019ve twisted an ankle before.

He finished with seven points and has scored just 11 in the last two games combined, but Denver has won both.\n\nThe Jazz led 77-71 early in the fourth quarter but went cold as Denver took control. Beasley\u2019s 3-pointer gave the Nuggets a 79-77 lead and Plumlee beat the shot clock with another 3 that increased the lead to five.\n\nUtah missed seven straight shots during a 24-3 run by Denver that turned a six-point deficit into a 95-80 lead.

Joe Donnelly waves to the crowd during a campaign rally at Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Ind., Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)\n\nGARY, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama praised Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly on Sunday for being willing to break with his party, telling a roaring crowd at a rally in the state that \u201cyou don\u2019t want just a yes man.\u201d\n\nDonnelly has sounded more like President Donald Trump while trying to persuade voters in the conservative Midwestern state to grant him a second term. He\u2019s angered some Democrats by tacking to the right in recent weeks and embracing some of Trump\u2019s pet priorities, such as building a border wall with Mexico.\n\nBut Obama told voters during the rally in Gary that Donnelly \u201ctries to do right by people\u201d \u2014 not just his party \u2014 and noted he supported the Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul passed under Obama.\n\n\u201cJoe Donnelly and I didn\u2019t agree all the time. But Joe always let me know where he stood and I knew what he believed in and that he always was focused on: \u2018What\u2019s the best thing for the Hoosiers that he served?\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe was honest and he was direct. So you can count on that. That\u2019s what you want. You don\u2019t want just a yes man all the time.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s stop was sandwiched between his successor\u2019s trips to the state Friday and Monday on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\nFor Braun, a businessman who has campaigned as a steadfast Trump ally, the current president\u2019s appearances in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne are no-brainers in a state he won two years ago by 19 points. But for Donnelly, who frequently touts how often he votes with Trump, the Obama rally was a little more complicated.\n\n\u201cIf he does need to inoculate himself from some of his firmer conservative rhetoric, it\u2019s a pretty effective way to do it,\u201d said Christina Hale, a former state lawmaker and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nObama has proven a polarizing figure with independent and Republican voters and is credited with some of Indiana\u2019s rightward political shift, even though he won the state in 2008. To win in Tuesday\u2019s election, Donnelly not only needs high turnout from his party\u2019s base but also must peel off some moderate Republicans and independents.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sunday\u2019s rally in Gary, a heavily African-American city that has more in common with the Democratic stronghold of nearby Chicago than deep red parts of the state, could prove strategic. The northwest Indiana region supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, and driving turnout there on Tuesday will be critical for Donnelly.\n\nA spokesman for Braun, Josh Kelley, said Donnelly was \u201cdoubling down on the liberal resistance movement\u201d by campaigning with Obama.\n\nObama criticized Republicans for passing a tax bill that benefited the wealthy, and for trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions provided through the Affordable Care Act. And without mentioning Trump\u2019s name, he told the crowd they could return the country to a kinder, less divisive kind of politics.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday you can vote for politics that is decent and honest and lawful and tries to do right by people like Joe Donnelly does,\u201d he said, adding at one point that his voice was growing hoarse from all his campaigning in recent days.\n\nTrump was keenly aware of Obama\u2019s visit, which he mentioned Friday during an event at an Indianapolis-area high school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\u201d Trump said as the crowd jeered. He later added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to the Obama days.\u201d\n\nAs a red-state Democrat, Donnelly has had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly defeated Republican Richard Mourdock in 2012, when the former state treasurer said a woman who gets pregnant from her rapist is carrying a \u201cgift from God.\u201d\n\nDonnelly has walked a delicate line since then, often frustrating his own party and Republicans alike with the votes he takes.\n\nTrump was having none of it on Friday, tying Donnelly to \u201cradical left\u201d figures in the party who are widely reviled by the GOP base.\n\n\u201cThis Tuesday I need the people of Indiana to send a message to Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters and the radical Democrats by voting for Mike Braun,\u201d Trump said as the crowd erupted in boos. \u201cI\u2019m really speaking more to the television cameras than to you because I don\u2019t think we have too many Donnelly voters. Anybody going to vote for Donnelly in this room?\u201d\n\nThe boos grew even louder.\n\n___\n\nSlodysko reported from Indianapolis.", "", "Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (13) rushes on a 44 yard touchdown carry in the second half of an NCAA college football game in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018.

The Predators announced before the game they had signed the Vezina Trophy winner to an extension worth $10 million that runs through the 2020-21 season, and Rinne went out and earned his 316th victory.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Rinne has notched a shutout on his birthday after signing a contract extension.

The Packers take on the New England Patriots on Sunday, Nov. 4. (AP Photo/Peter Joneleit)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers are universally regarded as two of the best quarterbacks of their generation.\n\nBrady has spent the better part of his 19 seasons in the NFL eclipsing virtually every milestone set by his predecessors. Along the way, he\u2019s captured every major piece of hardware the league has to offer from multiple MVPs to Super Bowl titles, all while remaining at the top of his game at 41.\n\nRodgers isn\u2019t as decorated as Brady, but has been just as celebrated during his 14-year career for a free-wheeling style and an uncanny ability to pull off plays that have been rarely duplicated by his peers.\n\nBetween them, they have five regular-season MVP awards, nine Super Bowl appearances and six Super Bowl rings.\n\nYet when the Patriots host the Packers on Sunday night , it will mark just the second time that the future Hall of Famers have squared off as starting quarterbacks. Rodgers won the first meeting in 2014 in a game in which they combined for 613 passing yards and four touchdowns in Green Bay\u2019s five-point victory at Lambeau Field.\n\nRodgers capped that season by winning his second regular-season MVP trophy. Brady went on to hoist his fourth Super Bowl title.\n\nWatching each other\u2019s success from afar has bred a deep respect between them. Rodgers for Brady\u2019s longevity. Brady for the skillset Rodgers brings to the position.\n\n\u201cTom\u2019s been at the top of his game for over a decade,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cObviously, we play a little bit different style of game, but the stuff that he does well is stuff that over my career I\u2019ve tried to incorporate into my own game.\n\n\u201cI enjoy competing against great players and obviously Tom is right at the top.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s similar to how Brady describes Rodgers.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s done as a quarterback, I think it is inspiring even for me,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI watch his game and it makes me want to get out there and practice and improve because I think he\u2019s so phenomenal with the way he manages himself in the pocket and his ability to throw the football is unlike anyone probably in the history of the league.\u201d\n\nThough he wants to play until he\u2019s 45, Brady will presumably retire before Rodgers, leaving the 34-year-old time to narrow the gap between them in career numbers.\n\nBut neither is interested in playing the hypothetical game about who the better quarterback is.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really try to get into the \u2018what-if\u2019 game,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have been drafted here and sit behind Brett (Favre) for three years. He was obviously drafted late there ... so his chip might have been a little bit bigger than mine starting out his career.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pride in that legacy part of your career, and I think him and I both feel the same way about our organizations.\u201d\n\nBrady also called any similar debate about the greatest quarterback of all-time a fruitless endeavor. Though he knows one name that belongs on his list.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to compare positions and eras. It\u2019s impossible to answer,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI think Aaron is one of the best ever to play the game. He\u2019s got every skill you need to be a great quarterback.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to watch for in Sunday\u2019s game:\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\nBrady enters Sunday\u2019s game second in NFL history for the most combination passing, rushing and receiving yards in the regular-season and playoffs. Peyton Manning tops the list with 79,978 yards. Brady is next with 79,781.\n\nSAFETY DANCE\n\nThe trade of Ha Ha Clinton-Dix means that the Green Bay Packers are without a five-year starter at safety .\n\nClinton-Dix, who led the team with three interceptions, was the most experienced player at a position that was still mired by inconsistency. Possible replacements include Jermain Whitehead, who missed practice at midweek with a back injury; or Josh Jones, a second-year player who missed time earlier this year with an ankle injury. Veteran cornerback Tramon Williams also has a couple games of experience playing safety while with the Browns a couple years ago. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland appears to be getting healthier from a hamstring injury and might be ready to play. The Packers didn\u2019t acquire players at the trade deadline, a sign that general manager Brian Gutekunst might like the depth in the secondary even without Clinton-Dix.\n\nCOMING A LONG WAY\n\nDavante Adams was a rookie the last time these teams played in 2014 at Lambeau Field. That 26-21 win by the Packers was a milestone game for Adams, now Green Bay\u2019s No. 1 receiver.\n\nAdams had six catches for 121 yards in the game, taking advantage of more targets after the Patriots elected to blanket then-top wideout Jordy Nelson. Now the roles might be reversed, and Adams could be the player who gets extra attention. If that\u2019s the case, it won\u2019t be much different from what Adams has faced all year. Adams has had at least 132 yards receiving in each of the last three games.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Genaro Armas in Green Bay, Wisconsin, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Tulsa storms back on UConn to take a 49-19 victory\n\nTULSA, Okla.

The Bulldogs finished with 532 total yards against Louisiana Tech.\n\nFitzgerald had plenty of time to throw most of the night and his four touchdown passes in the first half went for 11, 36, 23 and 10 yards.

On Saturday, he had four in less than 30 minutes of game action.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s defense was once again excellent, giving up just 238 total yards. The Bulldogs didn\u2019t give up a touchdown on Saturday and they\u2019ve given up just nine offensive touchdowns all season, which leads the nation.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLouisiana Tech was never a factor in this one. The offense occasionally moved the ball, but couldn\u2019t score touchdowns. The defense gave up too many big plays in the first half, especially in the passing game.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s offense has done a complete 180 over the past two weeks and Fitzgerald\u2019s arm has turned into an asset instead of a liability. Now the Bulldogs get their shot at top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa next weekend and there\u2019s no doubt Mississippi State will have to play a near-perfect game to have a chance.\n\n\u201cCertainly, when you\u2019re heading on the road to play the No. 1 team in the country, you definitely want to have momentum going in your favor,\u201d Moorhead said.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMississippi State won\u2019t get a huge bump from beating a team from Conference USA, but the convincing nature of the victory should give the Bulldogs a small boost.\n\nSTAT OF THE GAME\n\nMississippi State\u2019s defense has allowed just two touchdowns over opponents\u2019 last 51 offensive possessions.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLouisiana Tech hosts Rice next Saturday.\n\nMississippi State travels to face Alabama next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP .\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CONWAY, Ark.

(AP) \u2014 No. 3 Notre Dame looked as if it was running away with another victory, leading by 17 points early in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt turned out the Fighting Irish needed one more big dash to secure it.\n\nIan Book threw two touchdown passes and ran 23 yards for a score in the closing minutes to lead Notre Dame to a 31-21 victory over Northwestern on Saturday night.\n\nThe Fighting Irish (9-0, No. 4 CFP) remained in line for a playoff spot and continued to build on their best start since the 2012 team went undefeated before losing to Alabama in the BCS championship game. The Wildcats (5-4) had won four in a row to grab the Big Ten West lead and they stayed in this one when it looked like Notre Dame was ready to pull away.\n\nBook threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Miles Boykin in the corner of the end zone and a 47-yarder to Michael Young in the third to put the Irish ahead a 21-7. He sealed it in the closing minutes with that 23-yard run untouched up the left side, after a 17-point lead early in the fourth shrank to three.\n\nIan Book scores on a 23-yard run in the closing minutes to seal No. 3 Notre Dame\u2019s 31-21 victory over Northwestern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty awesome feeling,\u201d Book said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win in November. We\u2019re in such a good situation, and we know that, but I think this team does such a good job of focusing one week at a time. Everyone\u2019s excited, but everyone\u2019s just ready for Florida State (next week).\u201d\n\nThe Irish were in a similar spot last season, only to stumble down the stretch. They were No. 3 in the first two playoff rankings en route to an 8-1 start, only to go 2-2 the rest of the way \u2014 beginning with a blowout loss to Miami.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do a good job of just staying focused,\u201d linebacker Te\u2019Von Coney said. \u201cWe looked too far ahead and it cost us. This year, we have to stay in the moment; that\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nIt was 24-7 early in the fourth when Northwestern\u2019s Clayton Thorson threw a 27-yard touchdown to Riley Lees. Cameron Ruiz then blocked a punt by Tyler Newsome, giving the Wildcats possession on the Notre Dame 17. That led to a 1-yard sneak by Thorson, cutting it to 24-21 with 7:05 left.\n\n\u201cI could say we relaxed a little bit, but I think it was just Northwestern throwing their last punch,\u201d defensive end Julian Okwara said.\n\nEither way, Notre Dame didn\u2019t get rattled.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been like that all year,\u201d coach Brian Kelly said. \u201cThey just play one play at a time. They don\u2019t get too high, they don\u2019t get too low. They knew in the second half they needed to play much better football, especially offensively.\u201d\n\nBook improved to 6-0 as the starter, going 22 of 34 for 343 yards. Chase Claypool had eight receptions for 130 yards, and Dexter Williams ran for a 1-yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nThe Wildcats haven\u2019t beaten a top-five opponent since 1959, when Ara Parseghian was their coach. Though they are 0-3 in nonconference games, they still lead their division.\n\nThorson was 16 of 29 for 141 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for two TDs. Isaiah Bowser added 93 yards rushing on 23 attempts after back-to-back 100-yard games.\n\n\u201cBest atmosphere I\u2019ve ever played in at Ryan Field,\u201d right guard Tommy Doles said. \u201cWe were really excited about this game so it\u2019s very disappointing. But all our goals are ahead of us. We set out to win the West and that\u2019s what we plan to do.\u201d\n\nEARLY CHANCES\n\nBoth teams missed some big scoring opportunities in the first half. The Irish were also hurt by penalties.\n\nNorthwestern blew a big chance after linebacker Blake Gallagher recovered a fumble by Book on the game\u2019s opening possession. The Wildcats took over at the Notre Dame 35, only to come away empty-handed when Charlie Kuhbander missed a 39-yard field goal wide right.\n\nThe Irish then went 79 yards, with Williams plowing in from the 1 to give them a 7-0 lead and delight the fans in blue and gold. But they also missed a big chance late in the quarter. Two penalties helped drive them back from the Northwestern 5 to the 27 before Justin Yoon\u2019s 44-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.\n\nNorthwestern tied it midway through the second quarter when Thorson scored from the 1. Bennett Skowronek kept the drive going with a one-handed grab on fourth-and-5 at the Notre Dame 21, and the Irish\u2019s Jalen Elliott got flagged for interference breaking up a pass intended for Cameron Green in the end zone.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNotre Dame: The Irish remained in the playoff hunt even though this wasn\u2019t an easy game.\n\nNorthwestern: The Wildcats hung with one of the nation\u2019s best teams, only to come up short. The loss doesn\u2019t impact the division standings.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNotre Dame: Hosts Florida State on Nov. 10.\n\nNorthwestern: Visits Iowa on Nov. 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://collegefootball.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25", "MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Devin Singletary rushed for 184 yards and three touchdowns and Florida Atlantic posted a 49-14 upset over Florida International on Saturday night.\n\nSingletary is now tied with Donnel Pumphrey of San Diego State for ninth place in NCAA FBS history with 62 career rushing touchdowns.\n\nSingletary scored from three yards out when he recovered his own fumble in the endzone to give Florida Atlantic a 7-0 lead on the game\u2019s first drive.

Adversity struck. We got down but we battled back.\u201d\n\nDeon Jackson scored on a 75-yard rush on the game\u2019s first snap from scrimmage for Duke (6-3, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), which secured bowl eligibility. The Blue Devils \u2014 who lost when Miami scored on an eight-lateral kickoff return as time expired at Duke in 2015 \u2014 saw this game come down to the very last play, but Miami quarterback N\u2019Kosi Perry\u2019s pass from the Duke 28 fell incomplete.\n\n\u201cThe performance I had tonight, it\u2019s definitely not acceptable,\u201d said Perry, who completed 5 of 16 passes for 35 yards.\n\nDeejay Dallas had an 83-yard touchdown run for Miami (5-4, 2-3) and finished with 124 rushing yards, but also fumbled the ball away twice.

But Duke found a way to create its own breaks on the drive that gave it the lead.\n\nFacing third-and-3 at the Miami 15, Jackson took a handoff, stopped short of the line of scrimmage and threw a jump pass to the 6-foot-4 Helm \u2014 who couldn\u2019t make the initial catch, but tipped the ball over 5-foot-11 Miami safety Jaquan Johnson, then dove and caught his own deflection as Johnson punched the turf in disbelief.\n\n\u201cJust the game of football,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSometimes it goes like that.\u201d\n\nThe go-ahead pass from Harris came two plays later.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nDuke: Jackson finished with 113 rushing yards for Duke, and quarterback Daniel Jones completed 17 of 35 passes for 130 yards. Linebacker Joe Giles-Harris was huge for Duke, with 12 tackles and a blocked field goal in the third quarter.\n\nMiami: Dallas\u2019 touchdown run was the sixth-longest rush in Miami history, a run where he splashed with every step down the field. The Hurricanes rushed for 300 yards \u2014 the last time they ran for so many in a loss was in 2007, when quarterback Kirby Freeman went 1 for 14 against North Carolina State.\n\nPITCH IMPERFECT\n\nThe downpour that started shortly after kickoff left the turf at Hard Rock Stadium a complete mess. Countless puddles lined the field for most of the first half, and a considerable amount of grass was worn down to a layer of slick brown mud.

David Schweikert as part of the congressman\u2019s own get-out-the-vote efforts Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere should definitively be a strong border, especially for a country like the United States,\u201d said Ovanessoff, who immigrated from Iraq. \u201cBecause if you go outside to other countries there are millions and millions of people everywhere that want to come and live in this country.\u201d\n\nIn Tempe, outside Sun Devil Stadium, where thousands gathered wearing the team\u2019s bright yellow colors, Sinema was mobbed by well-wishers asking for hugs and selfies. The Democrat posed with voters as a band played a punk version of Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cFools Rush In.\u201d Sinema teaches two courses on social work at the university and has multiple degrees from the school, and was widely recognized, even by ticket scalpers.\n\nOne student gushed to Sinema, \u201cI\u2019ve heard your ads on Spotify.\u201d One man confided to her: \u201cYou\u2019re the most qualified candidate, but I can\u2019t vote for you \u2014 I\u2019m a Republican, my wife would kill me.\u201d\n\nGina Kilker was making her way through the crowd when she cried out, \u201cOh, my god, that\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema.\u201d Soon the candidate was posing with Kilker, her husband, daughter and son-in-law.\n\n\u201cWe did not expect to see her,\u201d Kilker said. She tried to quickly sum up her emotions about the last two years to a passing reporter, and boiled it down to this: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping and praying for a blue wave.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTom Beaumont in Hudson, Wisconsin; Michael Blood in Orange County, California; Bob Christie in Scottsdale, Arizona; John D.

Back with the Oilers this season after nine years away, he got two Saturday night.\n\nBrodziak scored his first two goals of the season and star center Connor McDavid ran his point streak to seven games in the Oilers\u2019 4-3 win over the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nBrodziak, 34, played for the Minnesota Wild and St. Louis Blues before returning to Edmonton this season as a free agent.

It was his first goal of the year, as he returned after missing eight games with a hand injury.\n\nBrodziak\u2019s second goal, 8:57 into the third period, restored Edmonton\u2019s two-goal lead.\n\nChiasson gave the Oilers a 2-1 lead, 1:15 into the second period. He scored on a one-time shot from the left circle, off a cross-ice pass from McDavid. The goal came with Edmonton playing 6-on-5, as a penalty was being called on Detroit and was Chiasson\u2019s sixth.\n\nBrodziak made it 3-1 with 5:31 left in the second on a one-timer from the slot for his first.\n\nCaggiula opened the scoring just 12 seconds into the game on a shot from the bottom of the right circle.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nShowdown Saturday disposed of the SEC pretenders and set up a rematch that seemed inevitable since last January.\n\nAlabama vs. Georgia in Atlanta, this time for the Southeastern Conference championship instead of the national title. It is the earliest the SEC championship game has ever been set.\n\nThe much-hyped SEC doubleheader that decided both divisions turned out to be a dud: The top-ranked Tide toyed with No. 4 LSU . The sixth-ranked Bulldogs left No. 11 Kentucky in the dust.\n\nThe Tigers and Wildcats can still go on to good seasons, maybe New Year\u2019s Six bowls, but they were out of their league Saturday. Alabama and Georgia have work to do over the next three weeks to set up one of the most highly anticipated SEC title games ever.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fathom the Tide not arriving at Mercedes-Benz Stadium with a 12-0 record. The Tide offense was sometimes slowed but the supposedly vulnerable defense feasted on LSU\u2019s limited offense. Tua Tagovailoa is the Heisman Trophy front-runner, but there is a case to be made that Alabama\u2019s best player is defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who was unblockable against LSU.\n\nGeorgia is not as safe a bet as Alabama to get through without another loss. And are the Bulldogs really a threat to take down the Tide? Comparing scores can dicey, but the Bulldogs lost at LSU a month ago.\n\nBoth Alabama and Georgia can probably afford a loss before they get to Atlanta and still make the College Football Playoff. No doubt Alabama would get in as a 12-1 SEC champion. Georgia, with a victory against \u2019Bama, could make a good case as an 11-2 SEC champ. The real question is: If Alabama enters the SEC championship game undefeated, does the result even matter for the Tide?\n\nA lot would depend on what else happens around the country.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the selection committee is not so quick to give Alabama a mulligan if it doesn\u2019t win the conference championship. There is little doubt Nick Saban\u2019s team is the best in the country \u2014 maybe the best he has ever had \u2014 but it\u2019s not as if the Tide has had to run a gantlet of a schedule this season.\n\nThere will be much complaining in advance about even the possibility that Alabama could make the playoff for a second straight season without winning its conference \u2014 which would also likely put two SEC teams in the CFP for the second straight year.\n\nAlabama is probably going to make all of that talk moot by stomping everything in its path.\n\nA\u2019MAIZE \u2019N BLUE\n\nNo. 2 Clemson may be the closest thing to Alabama right now. No. 5 Michigan is making a case that it is not that far behind the top two.\n\nThe Wolverines have one last big hurdle remaining before what would be their first College Football Playoff appearance, and it is an Ohio State team that still looks lost.\n\nThe Game is three weeks away. Michigan plays at Rutgers next week and has Indiana at home the week after. Then the Wolverines go to the Horseshoe. For the first time since Jim Harbaugh became the head coach in Ann Arbor, Michigan will clearly have the better team when it faces the Buckeyes.\n\nMichigan humiliated Penn State in the Big House. Its defense might be the best in the country and its offense has found an identity behind quarterback Shea Patterson and running back Karan Higdon.\n\nThe Buckeyes have dominated the rivalry with Michigan for more than a decade, winning 13 out of 14 and all three since Harbaugh took over. But Ohio State in its current state will be hard-pressed to keep Michigan out of the Big Ten championship for the first time. The Big Ten West is likely to throw out Northwestern as its representative in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Wildcats were the last team to come close to beating the Wolverines, jumping out to a 17-0 first-half lead on Sept. 29. Since then, Michigan has outscored the opposition 163-48. It\u2019s not quite the run Clemson has been on since that same day, when it rallied from 23-13 in the fourth quarter against Syracuse. Clemson has outscored its opposition 254-36 since that point. Michigan\u2019s run has come against better competition, though.\n\nFOR THE WIN\n\nDana Holgorsen and No. 12 West Virginia were going for the win all the way on their final drive against No. 15 Texas , and Will Grier converted the winning 2-point conversion to keep the Mountaineers in first place in the Big 12.\n\nHolgorsen rarely gets mentioned as being among the best coaches in college football, and that\u2019s probably fair. He has won only one conference title and that was when West Virginia was still in the Big East. But in some ways Holgo has become a little undervalued during his seven seasons at West Virginia, known as much for his mad-scientist hair and love of Red Bull than being a sharp offensive mind who fields winning teams without highly ranked recruits.\n\nThe transition for West Virginia to the Big 12 was no small task. Holgorsen guided the Mountaineers through it with only one losing season. Holgorsen\u2019s overall record is 60-38, and in the Big 12 he is 37-30.\n\nThere are always rumblings that Holgorsen might be on the lookout for another job and that he and athletic director Shane Lyons don\u2019t exactly see eye-to-eye. Now Holgorsen\u2019s team is a legitimate playoff contender heading down the stretch, with a home game against No. 7 Oklahoma to finish the season. At this point, Holgorsen is the conference\u2019s coach of the year.\n\nAROUND THE COUNTRY\n\nJust when you thought the ACC Coastal was the most muddled and mediocre Power Five division \u2014 first-place Pitt!\u2014 the Pac-12 South stepped up on Saturday, with Arizona State knocking off No. 16 Utah . Arizona, which was 3-5 and looking like a massive disappointment just a few weeks ago, is now tied for first in the division with Utah and USC at 4-3 ... Next week\u2019s big game? Try Clemson going to No. 24 Boston College . Clemson can clinch the ACC Atlantic with a victory, but BC would have the inside track to the division title if it can pull off the upset. It will be the first time this season ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d goes to the site of an ACC game ... After losing at home to Duke for the first time since 1976, Miami holds the title of most disappointing team in the country. The Hurricanes were No. 8 preseason and if not for a frantic rally against a terrible Florida State team, their last victory would be in September against North Carolina. ... Navy looks like it is headed toward its worst season since going 2-10 in 2002. The Midshipmen were shut out for the first time since 2012, losing to Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

It was his first multi-goal game of the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get back that shooting mentality,\u201d Stamkos said. \u201cObviously, when you get one early in the game, you\u2019re feeling more confident.

The Stars won 4-3 in overtime. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Remembering recent failures when it comes to extending winning streaks and fearing the defending Stanley Cup champions turned out to be a perfect recipe for the Dallas Stars.\n\nDallas started fast with two goals 10 seconds apart and finished strong in a 4-3 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals on Saturday night, giving the Stars their first three-game winning streak of the season. Jason Dickinson scored 3:17 into overtime to keep Dallas rolling under first-year coach Jim Montgomery.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of belief right now,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any complacency in our group. I just see a determination and a focus that I haven\u2019t seen before. That\u2019s the exciting part.\u201d\n\nThe excitement is building for the Stars, who are starting to develop some consistency. Jason Spezza scored on a breakaway and Tyler Pitlick forced a turnover for an unassisted goal 10 seconds later as Dallas jumped out to a 2-0 lead that showed players they could hang with the Capitals.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in here, there\u2019s a little bit of fear of knowing that they can run you out of the rink if you\u2019re not ready to go off the hop,\u201d Spezza said. \u201cYou can\u2019t take these guys lightly, and I thought we learned a lesson from some of the other games we played on the road.\u201d\n\nIn the process, the Stars also learned about rebounding from mistakes and moving forward after blowing a lead. Goaltender Ben Bishop allowed soft goals from sharp angles to Nicklas Backstrom and Evgeny Kuznetsov, Dallas\u2019 defensive structure was lacking and yet it was able to get to overtime.\n\nPlaying 3-on-3 in OT, Dallas outshot Washington 6-1. Capitals goalie Braden Holtby stopped Tyler Seguin on a penalty shot 59 seconds in, but Dickinson beat him on a deflection for his third of the season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it,\u201d said Bishop, who stopped 29 shots. \u201cThey\u2019re not always going to be Picassos. Sometimes you\u2019re going to have to grind. Last game we had to hold on at the end. This one we had to find a way to come back and get that one in overtime. Finding different ways to win, that\u2019s the big thing. It doesn\u2019t matter how, just as long as you get it.\u201d\n\nIt also was a struggle for the Capitals, who turned the puck over on all three Stars goals in regulation and still had a chance after Kuznetsov tied it on the power play with 12:03 remaining in the third period. Brett Connolly also scored for Washington, but ill-timed turnovers in the wrong places led to a second consecutive defeat.\n\n\u201cEvery team comes fast like that,\u201d said Holtby, who gave the puck away to Pitlick for his goal. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise. You just have to be prepared for it and have a plan and execute. A couple plays, we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nWhile the Capitals continue to search for the kind of 60-minute effort that defined their playoff run last spring, the Stars are feeling good in the middle of a long Eastern Conference road trip. Montgomery set the goal of three wins in six games, and his team is already there with two left before returning home.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s contributing,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cYou\u2019re together and it\u2019s a good feeling and everyone is enjoying being around each other.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Holtby finished with 32 saves plus his stop on Seguin on the penalty shot in overtime. ...

She was 91.\n\nRipston died Saturday at her home after several years of illness, said David Colker, a spokesman for the chapter.\n\nAs executive director of the ACLU SoCal from 1972 to 2011, Ripston oversaw the chapter\u2019s work on issues such as the Los Angeles Police Department spying on community activists, voting rights, abortion rights, racial profiling and gay rights. She also led efforts to get California to spend more money on schools in poor and minority neighborhoods, ACLU SoCal said in a statement on its website.\n\n\u201cShe had two things that are all too precious in this world \u2014 a vision of a better future and the courage to pursue it,\u201d said Hector Villagra, the executive director of the ACLU SoCal. \u201cThere are few people who provide such a shining example of living out their beliefs.\u201d\n\nRipston was able to establish good relationships between ACLU SoCal and the LAPD, convincing then-Chief Ed Davis to be the first LAPD chief to attend an ACLU SoCal event.\n\nRipston led the chapter\u2019s growth from one office above a coffee shop and a wig store to four locations, including the headquarters in downtown Los Angeles that has been named the Ramona Ripston Center for Civil Liberties and Civil Rights.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s national leader praised her work.\n\n\u201cRamona was a fierce and unrelenting opponent of injustice and oppression, who often drew the ire of those who stood in the way of reform,\u201d Anthony Romero, executive director of the national ACLU, said in a statement. \u201cBut no one could deny her unflinching commitment to the protection of civil liberties and the improvement of people\u2019s lives. She leaves behind a powerful legacy of selflessness that will continue to inspire advocates both inside and outside the ACLU.\u201d\n\nRipston drew criticism within the ACLU for some of her policies, the Los Angeles Times reported. Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates derided her as \u201cRamona the Ripper,\u201d and conservative radio\u2019s Rush Limbaugh labeled her and her husband \u201cleft-leaning commie socialists,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nTV producer Norman Lear, who worked with Ripston at his People for the American Way organization, told the Times that she inspired him. \u201cJust knowing her caused one to lean in every direction she leaned in,\u201d said Lear, one of many celebrities with whom she made alliances.\n\nRipston was born in New York City and started working for the ACLU there as a volunteer.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Laura Ripston, and son William Caplin.

As the ball dropped through the net, Oladipo skipped toward the bench.\n\n\u201cWe were really calm,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cThe crowd was excited, but we were calm. We knew we needed one more stop.\u201d\n\nAfter the Celtics used a timeout to advance the ball and draw up a final play, Gordon Hayward inbounded but had his pass deflected and stolen by Oladipo, snapping a four-game win streak for Boston, which reached the Eastern Conference finals last spring.\n\nThe Pacers, coming off a first-round playoff exit, passed an early-season test in large part by repeatedly earning free throws. While Boston attempted only nine, and made six, Indiana shot 19 of 25 from the line.\n\nThat came in handy on a night Boston shot 43 percent (38 for 88) and the Pacers 41 percent (36 for 87).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living on the edge a little too much,\u201d said Horford, who had 14 points and six rebounds. \u201cMaybe this will wake us up.\u201d\n\nTyreke Evans had 17 points for the Pacers, Bojan Bogdanovic scored 16, and Domantas Sabonis added 12 points, nine rebounds and five assists.\n\nIndiana trailed 28-18 after the first quarter, and by as many as 13 in the first half, but forged a tie at 45 at halftime and knotted the score at 72 on Evans\u2019 last-second 3 to close the third period.\n\n\u201cIt was huge moving forward, just to get a good spirit and energy for our season,\u201d Indiana guard Darren Collison said. \u201cWe all came together.

Leaf played the first five minutes of the fourth quarter and added a dunk to finish with seven points. . The team waived forward Ben Moore and recalled center Ike Anigbogu from the G League.\n\nWORKING HIS WAY BACK\n\nStevens said Hayward, coming back from leg surgery, would remain restricted to fewer than 30 minutes per game for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the \u2018increase by a tick\u2019 phase,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep evaluating him week to week. It\u2019s a long-term plan based on getting him back to not only playing one game but 82 games.

They quickly extended the lead to 29 points when Walker knocked down his fourth 3-pointer with 7:14 remaining in the game.

Borrego said he feels like the second unit is establishing an identity, adding that \u201cI love our bench.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are playing with haste, playing with urgency,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cTony Parker understands what we\u2019re trying to get done offensively and getting Malik Monk in the right spots.\u201d\n\nDIFFERENT LOOKS\n\nCavaliers acting head coach Larry Drew used several different combinations on the floor throughout the night, but nothing seemed to work.\n\n\u201cThis team is obviously going in a different direction than it\u2019s been the last four years,\u201d Drew said of the post-LeBron James era. \u201cAs a coach, you still have to find what works. And right now I don\u2019t know what works for this team.

The 49ers held the Vols to only 20 net rushing yards on 26 attempts for a 0.8 average per rush. Until UT\u2019s final offensive drive in the fourth quarter, the Vols were in negative rushing yardage.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make any explosive plays and we really struggled to be consistent running the football.

The 14 points were the most UT has scored in the first quarter this season.\n\nBut the early production wasn\u2019t a sign of things to come as the Vols offense bogged down for the remainder of the game. The Vols had only 93 yards of total offense in the first half, including 0 rushing yards. Charlotte held its fourth straight opponent to 21 points or fewer.\n\n\u201cI really thought we were able to control the line of scrimmage. I really wasn\u2019t sure of that coming into the game. Our guys up front played really well, and I was really proud of the tackling in the open field,\u201d Charlotte head coach Brad Lambert said. \u201cThat is thing you worry about playing against an SEC team. I thought they tackled well and did a nice job getting them behind the chains.\u201d\n\nUT\u2019s defense kept Charlotte from posing a serious threat for a comeback. The Vols recorded three sacks in the second half, and a fourth-down stop late in the fourth quarter secured the victory.\n\nGuarantano completed 16 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Palmer had four catches for 71 yards. UT tight end Dominick Wood-Anderson had career highs in catches (3) and yards (53).\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs completed 13 of 25 passes for 152 yards and threw an interception in the final minute.

I think we were ready to get onto Kentucky, and before doing that we had to take care of Charlotte and Charlotte really showed up and proved to us that we can\u2019t overlook them.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTennessee: It wasn\u2019t pretty, but the Vols did what was expected by beating their third non-Power 5 opponent this season. UT has won 30 straight against non-Power 5 opponents. But the Vols won\u2019t be happy with the lackluster performance on both sides of the ball. They will need to bring more energy as they return to SEC play next weekend for the final three games of the regular season.\n\nCharlotte: The 49ers are still searching for their first win over a Power 5 opponent. Charlotte fell to 0-4 all-time against Power 5 programs, including 0-2 against SEC opponents. But the 49ers can take some confidence from their defensive performance.

The Vols have been penalized for targeting three times this season. Linebacker Daniel Bituli was ejected in the second half against Auburn.\n\n\u201cI have no idea if it was targeting or what,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cBut I obviously don\u2019t know what targeting is....

Its VIP guest list includes prime ministers and other leaders from Russia, Pakistan and Vietnam.\n\nThe United States, fighting a tariff war with Beijing, has no plans to send a high-level envoy.\n\nXi\u2019s government is emphasizing the promise of China\u2019s growing consumer market to help defuse complaints Beijing abuses the global trading system by reneging on promises to open its industries.\n\n\u201cThis says, look, we\u2019re not a global parasite that is creating massive deficits, we are buying goods,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a Chinese politics specialist at King\u2019s College London.\n\nThe event also is part of efforts to develop a trading network centered on China and increase its influence in a Western-dominated global system.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his \u201cAmerican first\u201d trade policies that threaten to raise import barriers to the world\u2019s biggest consumer market loom in the background.\n\nExporters, especially developing countries, want closer relations with China to help \u201cinsulate themselves from what is happening with Trump and the U.S.,\u201d said Gareth Leather of Capital Economics.\n\nChina has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports, which rose 15.9 percent in 2017 to $1.8 trillion. But none address the U.S. complaints about its technology policy that prompted Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American imports.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields, ambitions that some American officials worry will undermine U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nTo keep the economy growing, China needs to nurture its consumer market and that requires more imports.\n\nBut foreign companies say regulators are still trying to squeeze them out of promising industries and that they face pressure to hand over technology.\n\nThe Shanghai expo \u201cwill be of little consequence to U.S. and other companies unless its pageantry is matched by meaningful and measurable changes in China trade practices,\u201d Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in an email.\n\nSome companies might get a brief sales boost, \u201cbut its long-run impact will be defined by China\u2019s willingness to end many of its unfair trade practices,\u201d said Jarrett.\n\nEurope, Japan and other trading partners have been leery of Trump\u2019s tactics but echo U.S. complaints.\n\nThey say Beijing improperly hampers access to finance, logistics and other service industries. European leaders are frustrated that Beijing bars foreign acquisitions of most assets while its own companies are on a global buying spree.\n\nWriting in a Chinese business magazine, the French and German ambassadors to Beijing appealed for changes including an end to requirements that foreign companies operate in joint ventures with state-owned partners. They called for an overhaul of rules they say hinder companies from profiting from and protecting their technology.\n\n\u201cWe encourage China to address these issues through concrete and systematic measures that go beyond tariff adjustments,\u201d Ambassadors Jean-Maurice Ripert of France and Clemens von Goetze of Germany wrote in the magazine Caixin.\n\nChina already is the No. 1 trading partner for all its Asian neighbors, though a big share of the iron ore, industrial components and other goods it buys are turned into smartphones, TV sets and other goods for export.\n\nTariff cuts announced over the past year were aimed at giving Chinese consumers better access to foreign goods. Chinese leaders emphasize those include anti-cancer drugs and other medical products. But many are specialty goods such as high-end baby strollers, avocados and mineral water that don\u2019t compete with Chinese suppliers.\n\nThe Shanghai expo also gives Beijing a chance to repair its image following complaints about its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe.\n\nGovernments including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have scrapped or scaled back projects due to high costs or complaints too little work goes to local companies. Sri Lanka, Kenya and other nations have run into trouble repaying Chinese loans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become too associated with debt and China getting what it wants,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey are trying to get out this more positive message that China is open for business.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nChina International Import Expo: https://www.ciie.org/zbh/en/", "", "", "", "", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Jimmie Robinson rushed for 208 yards and three lightning-bolt touchdowns, and Trevor Merritt picked off a pass with less than a minute remaining as Bethune-Cookman edged Morgan State 30-28 on Saturday night.\n\nWith starting quarterback Akevious Williams lost to injury two weeks ago, Bethune-Cookman (5-5, 3-2 Mid-Eastern Athletic) ramped up its ground game, rushing for 314 yards while throwing just 12 passes for 26 yards.\n\nRobinson burst 61 yards late in the first quarter, scoring on a one-play drive for a 9-0 Wildcats\u2019 lead.

Lesnar shoved Cormier in the chest while the fighters traded insults to hype a potential future bout.\n\nUFC President Dana White has said he wanted a Lesnar-Cormier bout signed for next year, a showcase that would surely be the biggest ever for heavyweights. Lesnar is still with WWE and left the promotion\u2019s controversial Crown Jewel event on Friday in Saudi Arabia as the Universal champion. His status remains as murky as ever \u2014 he still has to serve out the remainder of a USADA suspension \u2014 and was not spotted at MSG.\n\nCormier beat Anthony Johnson in 2015 to win the light heavyweight title and defended it against the likes of Alexander Gustafsson and Volkan Oezdemir.\n\nCormier has never lost to anyone except Jon Jones, the star-crossed former light heavyweight champion who beat him twice. The second bout last year was changed to a no-contest when Jones failed a doping test that kept him out of the sport for 15 months. Cormier will be stripped of his light heavyweight title and the 205-pound crown will go to the winner of the Jones-Gustafsson bout at UFC 232 on Dec. 29 in Las Vegas.\n\nJones has ruled out a trilogy, and Cormier\u2019s next challenger will surely give him a better fight than Lewis.\n\nLewis (21-6) served 3\u00bd years in prison in his early 20s stemming from a parole violation when he was charged with aggravated assault shortly after high school. Lewis took up mixed martial arts shortly after his release and used his big right hand to ascend to a title shot. He had won nine of his last 10 fights and his self-deprecating humor \u2014 including a randy answer as to why he stripped off his shorts inside the cage after his last win \u2014 earned him a sponsorship deal with Popeyes Chicken.\n\n\u201cLook who just slid into our DMs before the weigh in,\u201d the fried chicken joint tweeted, with a picture of Lewis chomping on a drumstick.\n\nMuch like attacking a bucket of chicken, Cormier tagged Lewis everywhere: leg, thigh, and then the neck for the decisive blow.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have to understand that I\u2019ve been doing this for nine years and I fought at a championship level for eight of them,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cIf you have a puncher\u2019s chance it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d\n\nThe main event had history, if not the thrills of the earlier bouts.\n\nRonaldo \u201cJacare\u201d Souza connected on a flush right hand to the temple to knock out Chris Weidman in the third round in a battle of two fighters who both badly needed a victory.\n\nSouza and Weidman were engaged in a brutal slugfest that kept both fighters on their feet for most of the first 2\u00bd rounds. Weidman finally got caught and clung to Souza\u2019s leg as he tried to find his bearings. Souza got a couple of punches in for good measure until referee Dan Miragliotta mercifully stopped the fight.\n\nSouza rebounded from a loss to Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 224 and did it with a busted nose. Weidman stunned Souza with a right that smashed the Brazilian\u2019s nose, making it spew blood for the remainder of the first round.\n\nIsrael Adesanya had a breakout performance with a dominant destruction of veteran Derek Brunson than ran his record to 15-0 and launched him as serious contender in the middleweight division.\n\nAdesanya flipped off Brunson early in the first round and finished him not much later for the TKO win. Adesanya landed a knee to the face that stumbled Brunson and finished him off with a left that had the crowd on its feet. Adesanya, who has earned comparisions to a young Anderson Silva, danced in the middle of the octagon on a night where a new star was seemingly born.\n\nHis bio on his @stylebender Instagram account says he likes to \u201csay the darndest things.\u201d Adesanya had something to witty to say to the MSG crowd.\n\n\u201cThey say this is a walk in the park? Nah, it\u2019s a walk in the Garden,\u201d Adesanya said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Illinois running back Reggie Corbin (2) breaks away to the end zone in the second half of a NCAA college football game against Minnesota, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Champaign, Ill. (AP Photo/Holly Hart)\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) \u2014 The hot seat Illinois coach Lovie Smith has found himself on lately cooled down a bit on Saturday as Illinois beat Minnesota 55-31 in a game that saw some impressive and long scoring runs.\n\nMeanwhile, things are heating up for Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck, who has watched his team drop five of its last six games.\n\nIllinois managed to win in dramatic fashion.\n\nReggie Corbin rushed for 213 yards and two touchdowns \u2014 both coming on runs of more than 70 yards \u2014 to become the first Illini player to rush for two 70-yard-plus touchdowns in a single game since 1944.\n\n\u201cReggie plays like that every game,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWeek in and week out, he just plays football for us.\u201d\n\nIt was Corbin\u2019s fourth 100-yard rushing game in the last five games.\n\nMinnesota (4-5, 1-5 Big Ten) had trouble all game stopping the run, giving up 430 yards and five touchdowns on the ground. Illinois racked up 646 total yards of offense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lack of consistency that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all over the field, on offense, defense, special teams. This was just not a good football game for us. And that\u2019s on me.\u201d\n\nThe 55 points were the most for Illinois (4-5, 2-4) since Smith took over as head coach before the 2016 season.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t tackle anyone,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cI think our speed got exposed on defense. They were running away from us.\u201d\n\nIllinois quarterback AJ Bush managed the game well and accounted for four Illinois touchdowns, going 18 of 25 for 216 yards passing with two touchdowns and one interception. Bush rushed for 127 yards on 14 carries and two more touchdowns.\n\n\u201cAJ played well, both running and passing,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown us what kind of a leader he is.\u201d\n\nRedshirt freshman Tanner Morgan got the start again at quarterback for Minnesota after an excellent performance in beating Indiana last week in his first career start. True freshman Zack Annexstad won the job in fall camp, hurt his ankle in the third game, played through it rather ineffectively and then suffered an unspecified midsection injury in a loss at Nebraska on Oct. 20.\n\nMorgan had the first 300-yard passing game last week for the Gophers since 2015 and may have secured the starting role even if Annexstad gets healthy.\n\nMorgan was 14 of 27 for 258 yards and two touchdowns against Illinois.\n\nIllinois led 24-17 at the half.\n\nSandwiched between the Illini scoring runs to open the game was a 12-play Minnesota drive that resulted in a 4-yard touchdown run by Mohamed Ibrahim.\n\nQUICK START\n\nIllinois\u2019 first two possessions resulted in two 72-yard touchdown runs \u2014 one by Corbin and the other by Dre Brown. Both came on second-and-long and both backs were untouched once they cleared the line of scrimmage. Corbin later ripped off a 77-yard scoring run.\n\nBrown rushed for 92 yards and one touchdown. He was playing in lieu of injured starting running back Mike Epstein, who generally shares carries with Corbin.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nTrailing 31-17 midway through the third quarter, the Gophers were starting to click offensively and were driving when running back Seth Green fumbled on the Illinois 30-yard line.\n\nOn the next play, Bush lofted a pass to Daniel Barker for an easy score and a 38-17 lead.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMinnesota: Needs six wins to nail down a bowl bid, and Saturday\u2019s defeat makes it all the more difficult. With three games left, against Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin, they need wins in two of them. Not impossible, but not easy.\n\nIllinois: Calling the defense after the abrupt resignation last week of coordinator Hardy Nickerson, Smith acquitted himself well, with his defense giving up 438 yards, substantially less than in past weeks.\n\n\u201cWe needed to come back and show we can play defense,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting closer.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMinnesota: Hosts Purdue on Saturday.\n\nIllinois: Travels to Nebraska next week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Bryson DeChambeau birdied four of the last six holes Saturday for a share of the lead with Peter Uihlein in the Shriners Hospitals For Children Open.\n\nDeChambeau shot a 6-under 66 to match Uihlein at 16-under 197 at TPC Summerlin.\n\n\u201cDefinitely nice to be able to ball strike it as well as I have the past three days,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cNice to be able to take two weeks \u2014 or three, four weeks off.

(AP Photo/Michael Thomas)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The last time West Virginia quarterback Will Grier ran for the corner of the end zone against Texas, a dive resulted in a gnarly broken finger that ended his season.\n\nHe stayed upright this time, untouched as he scrambled for a 2-point conversion that gave No. 12 West Virginia a 42-41 win at No. 15 Texas on Saturday that kept the Mountaineers in first in the Big 12 as they try for their first conference championship.\n\nGrier\u2019s scramble for the pylon came after he threaded a 33-yard touchdown pass to Gary Jennings with 16 seconds left, a perfect throw that Jennings caught in stride in the back of the end zone behind two defenders.\n\nInstead of going for the tie, Mountaineers coach Dana Holgorsen dialed up a game-winner. Holgorsen and Grier said the decision was made even before the final drive started.\n\n\u201cIt was an easy decision,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cIf you put the fate of the game in (Grier\u2019s) hands, I feel pretty good about it.... We\u2019ve had this 2-point conversion in our back pocket all year.\u201d\n\nIt still took two snaps to win it.\n\nOn the first, Grier connected with Davis Sills on a quick slant. West Virginia (7-1, 5-1, No. 13 CFP) celebrated but officials ruled the play dead because Texas had called timeout just before the snap. So Grier had to do it again.\n\nSills was covered the second time. Grier took a step up in the pocket, and then saw a clearing to his left because the Texas safety had dropped off into double coverage on Sills. He held the ball up as he crossed the goal line before slamming it into the stadium wall.\n\n\u201cI had four different options on that play,\u201d Grier said. \u201cI went with the fourth one, which was me running ... I stayed on my feet, which was good. Whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia linebacker David Long couldn\u2019t watch.\n\n\u201cI turned my back. All of a sudden, I heard the crowd get silent,\u201d Long said. \u201cThat told me everything I needed to know.\u201d\n\nTexas coach Tom Herman didn\u2019t seem to care for Grier\u2019s pre-score celebration.\n\n\u201cI thought taunting before you cross the goal line negated a score,\u201d Herman said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to brush up on my rules and get some questions answered.\u201d\n\nSills caught touchdown passes of 60 and 18 yards for the Mountaineers.\n\nEhlinger passed for 356 yards and three scores and also ran for a touchdown for Texas (6-3, 4-2, No. 17 CFP), which has lost two in a row after three weeks in first place in the Big 12.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is we play in the Big 12. We\u2019re not out of any race at this point,\u201d Herman said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t control our own destiny.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWest Virginia: The Mountaineers got a huge effort in the running game to complement Grier, and the defense held on just enough to force the Longhorns to kick two field goals that kept them in range for Grier\u2019s late-game magic. The Mountaineers ran through the Texas defense for 232 yards. Martell Pettaway rushed for 121 yards on nine carries and scored on runs of 55 and 13 yards.\n\nTexas: Injuries have become a problem while Texas has stumbled into the second half of its season. Starting safety Brandon Jones didn\u2019t play because he aggravated an ankle injury before the game at the team hotel, starting cornerback Davante Davis was knocked out on the first series with a shoulder and neck sprain and edge rusher Breckyn Hager dislocated his left shoulder in the first half.\n\nHORNS DOWN\n\nWest Virginia was penalized 14 times, eight in the first quarter alone. None were bigger than a pair of calls after Sills scored on a 60-yard touchdown pass.\n\nSills was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for flashing a \u201chorns down\u201d hand sign after the score. Then starting left tackle Yodny Cajuste was ejected after another unsportsmanlike call for throwing a punch on the extra point. The Mountaineers kicked off from their own 3 and Texas used three plays to drive the short field for a touchdown.\n\nBig 12 Assistant Commissioner Bob Burda said the penalty for the \u201chorns down\u201d hand signal is \u201csolely at the official\u2019s discretion\u201d and he is unaware of whether teams have been warned not to do it when playing Texas.\n\n\u201cHere is what I\u2019m disappointed about: We communicated with the refs if that thing was going to get called. I guess there was miscommunication,\u201d Holgorsen said, declining to say what game officials had told him before kickoff.\n\nNO PRESSURE\n\nTexas couldn\u2019t get to Grier and gave up 578 total yards. The Mountaineers didn\u2019t allow a sack despite losing Cajuste. Backup left tackle Kelby Wickline had a huge game against Texas sack leader defensive end Charles Omenihu, who had two tackles and no quarterback hurries.\n\n\u201cLose your all-American tackle, it doesn\u2019t bode well for what could happen,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe schemed some things up front, blocked hard. That\u2019s why we moved the ball.\u201d\n\nPOLL POSITION\n\nWest Virginia should get a boost for a big road win against a much improved Texas team compared to last season. The Longhorns likely drift back toward the bottom of the Top 25 after another game where the defense struggled again.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWest Virginia hosts TCU next Saturday.\n\nTexas travels to Texas Tech next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno"]
