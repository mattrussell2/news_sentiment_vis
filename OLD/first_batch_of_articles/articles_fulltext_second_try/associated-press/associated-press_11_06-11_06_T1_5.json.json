(AP) \u2014 Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s first season in Major League Soccer with the LA Galaxy was largely a success. The charismatic forward is under contract with the club for next season, but a few things have to happen if he is to return.\n\n\u201cI have some wishes and demands which is simple things,\u201d Ibrahimovic said Tuesday as players had end of season meetings. \u201cThere is interest in Europe, but my priority is Galaxy. They have wishes, I have wishes, but I\u2019m optimistic and I\u2019m positive.\u201d\n\nIbrahimovic is a finalist for the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player and newcomer awards after he had 22 goals and 10 assists in 27 games.\n\nAC Milan of Italy\u2019s Serie A has been the latest to express interest in bringing the Swedish player back to Europe on loan, but he said he is not interested in doing something like that, admitting that if he is under contract to one club, he wants to devote his attention to that club.\n\n\u201cIf I belong to Galaxy, I am a Galaxy player. If I belong to one club, I give my attention to one club, so I am here,\u201d he said.\n\nIbrahimovic made $1.5 million this season, according to Major League Soccer\u2019s Players Association contract figures. In order for him to earn more next year, the Galaxy would have to part ways with one of their three designated players.\n\nGalaxy president Chris Klein said initial conversations with Ibrahimovic have been promising, and bringing him back is a top priority for the club.\n\n\u201cWhat he did this year is certainly well documented,\u201d Klein said. \u201cHe wants to win and we want to win with him. Hopefully we can come to a resolution that is good for both sides.\u201d\n\nThe only thing Ibrahimovic couldn\u2019t do his first season in MLS was get the Galaxy to the playoffs. LA (13-12-9) would have earned the final spot in the Western Conference with a win in its final regular-season game but squandered a two-goal lead to Houston and lost 3-2.\n\nThe club announced Tuesday they fired vice president of soccer operations Pete Vagenas. Klein said he hopes to have that spot filled soon. Former Galaxy and US national team coach Bruce Arena is believed to be a candidate.\n\nThey also have to decide on a head coach. Dominic Kinnear was 3-2-1 after replacing Sigi Schmid in early September and drew positive reviews from most players, including Ibrahimovic.\n\n\u201cI think the season was like a roller coaster. Hopefully we make it better because that is the target,\u201d Ibrahimovic said. \u201cI want to be able to challenge for the trophy. Like I said, I\u2019m not here for a vacation, I\u2019m here for the challenge and I want to feel my team has a chance to be the best in MLS. I am the best, but I want to feel like my team can compete against the others.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Residents cast their ballots in the midterm elections at the Williamstown Elementary School on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Williamstown, Mass. (Gillian Jones/The Berkshire Eagle via AP)\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Massachusetts GOP Gov. Charlie Baker overcame intense dislike of his own party to win a second term, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nSixty-four percent of Massachusetts voters had a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of the Republican Party as they cast their ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found.\n\nMore than 7 in 10 Massachusetts voters said the country is on the wrong track, compared with fewer than 3 in 10 who said the country is headed in the right direction.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Massachusetts, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,010 voters and 587 nonvoters in the state of Massachusetts \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said she will take a \u201chard look\u201d at running for president in 2020 once her race to win a second term is over. On Tuesday, she beat Republican Geoff Diehl, who said during the campaign that Warren would soon abandon Massachusetts to focus on a presidential campaign. Diehl was the co-chair of President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.\n\nIn that race, Warren led Diehl both among voters with and without a college education.\n\nFifty-seven percent of voters had a very or somewhat favorable opinion of Warren, while 39 percent had a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of her. Asked whether Warren would make a good president, 62 percent of Massachusetts voters said no, while 36 percent said yes.\n\nForty percent of voters said former Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick would make a good president, while 57 percent said he would not.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nRepublicans make up a small fraction of the total voting population in Massachusetts \u2014 and just 32 percent of voters had a very or somewhat favorable opinion of the party \u2014 but Baker still beat Democrat Jay Gonzalez, who served as a top official in Patrick\u2019s administration.\n\nVoters under 45 were split between Baker and Gonzalez, while voters ages 45 and older were more likely to support Baker. Voters both with and without a college degree favored Baker over Gonzalez.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nHalf of Massachusetts voters said they voted to express opposition to President Donald Trump. By comparison, about 1 in 6 said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, while about a third said Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their votes.\n\nA majority of voters in Massachusetts had negative views of Trump: about two-thirds said they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president, while around one-third said they approve of Trump.\n\nMolly Downer, 68, a banker from Cambridge, Massachusetts, said she has drifted farther to the left in response to Trump\u2019s behavior and his policies.\n\n\u201cIn the old days I would say I had some Republican leanings, but not now, given the way the Republican Party has gone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very upset about the current political environment. I detest Trump and what\u2019s going on in politics in the country.\u201d\n\nHer dissatisfaction drove her to go to the polls, where she voted down the ticket for Democrats except for Baker. She supported Warren and Democratic Rep. Katherine Clark.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we will get a Democratic Congress,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of voters\u2019 minds: Around 1 in 4 named it as the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections. One in 5 named immigration as the top issue, while around 1 in 6 named the economy. More than 1 in 10 said gun policy or the environment was the top issue.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook \u2014 two-thirds said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with a third who said it\u2019s not good.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office, although none of Massachusetts\u2019 seats in the House were competitive this year. Still, nearly 7 in 10 Massachusetts voters said which party will hold control was very important as they considered their vote. More than 2 in 10 said it was somewhat important.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Massachusetts, two-thirds of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 about three-quarters \u2014 did not have a college degree. More nonvoters were Democrats than Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 4,010 voters and 587 nonvoters in Massachusetts was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

He conceded earlier in the night.\n\nHeller was once a critic of President Donald Trump, but the two have become allies. Rosen painted Heller as a rubber stamp for the president and counted on backlash to Trump to help her oust the incumbent.\n\nRosen\u2019s win puts Nevada with half a dozen other states represented by U.S. senators who are both female.

Dianne Feinstein has won a fifth full term representing California after shaking off a challenge from a fellow Democrat who argued she hasn\u2019t been tough in confronting President Donald Trump.\n\nFeinstein defeated state Sen. Kevin de Leon.\n\nVoters first sent Feinstein to Washington in 1992. At 85, she is the oldest current U.S. senator.\n\nShe faced a fellow Democrat because of California\u2019s system that sends the two candidates who win the most primary votes to the general election.\n\nThe race failed to generate much excitement, with Democrats more focused on winning seats in the U.S. House than on a safe Senate seat.\n\nFeinstein argued that her experience and tenure in Washington made her the best person to serve California.\n\n___\n\n1:40 a.m.\n\nMaine\u2019s independent Sen. Angus King has withstood a challenge from opponents on his ideological right and left to retain his seat.\n\nKing, a popular former Maine governor, defeated Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey and Democratic activists Zak Ringelstein to win a second term on Tuesday. King caucuses with the Democrats and was first elected to the Senate in 2012.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election was the first U.S. Senate race to use Maine\u2019s ranked-choice style of voting.\n\nBrakey or Ringelstein could have forced additional voting rounds under the system if King had fallen short of 50 percent of the popular vote.

Claire McCaskill in a national victory for the GOP.\n\nRepublicans have long hoped to flip McCaskill\u2019s seat in the increasingly Republican state. Missouri was once considered a bellwether known for picking the successful presidential candidate, but it\u2019s since lost that status and trended right.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the state by nearly 19 percentage points. Missouri\u2019s attorney general pinned his campaign to his support for the president.\n\nMcCaskill was one of 10 Democratic Senate incumbents up for re-election in states Trump won.\n\nVoters first elected McCaskill to the Senate in 2006. She won re-election in 2012 after Republican candidate Todd Akin said women\u2019s bodies can prevent pregnancy in cases of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d\n\n___\n\n11:40 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maria Cantwell has won re-election in Washington, beating Republican challenger Susan Hutchison.\n\nCantwell easily outdistanced Hutchison, a former Seattle TV anchor and state GOP chairwoman.\n\nCantwell is a former tech executive who previously served one term in the U.S. House and six years as a state representative in the state Legislature. She will be serving her fourth term.\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly a quarter century since the GOP has captured a major statewide race in Washington.\n\nThe last time voters sent a Republican to the U.S. Senate was 1994, when Sen. Slade Gorton was re-elected to his final term before being ousted by Cantwell in 2000.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has won a fourth term in the Senate, defeating Republican challenger John James.\n\nStabenow campaigned as a pragmatic lawmaker who forges bipartisan agreement despite the partisan rancor in Washington. She cited her work shaping farm legislation and pushing a new law that allows pharmacists to tell consumers when they can save on prescriptions by paying cash instead of using insurance.\n\nThe 68-year-old Stabenow criticized President Trump\u2019s attempt to slash federal funding for the Great Lakes. She said James would have been an unabashed enthusiast of Trump with no governing experience.\n\nJames is a black combat veteran and business executive. Trump won Michigan in 2016. He called James \u201ca star\u201d candidate.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nMississippi\u2019s U.S. Senate special election is headed to a runoff, and the state\u2019s voters will either elect a woman to the office for the first time ever or a black man for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy advanced Tuesday from a field of four. They compete in a Nov. 27 runoff, and the winner will serve the final two years of a term started by Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired in April.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith, who was state agriculture commissioner, to temporarily succeed Cochran until the special election is decided. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress, but no woman has been elected to the job from the state. She is endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nEspy is a former congressman and former U.S. agriculture secretary.\n\n___\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii has defeated Republican Ron Curtis to win a second term.\n\nHirono had an advantage going into Tuesday\u2019s midterm election as an incumbent with broad name recognition. Her challenger is a retired engineer who had never run for public office.\n\nHirono has served in the legislature, as lieutenant governor and as U.S. representative. The 71-year-old kept a relatively low profile early on in the Senate, but has gained attention for her outspoken opposition to President Donald Trump and his policies.\n\nHirono urged men to \u201cshut up and step up\u201d when the Senate was considering confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSome Hawaii voters cheered the statement, while others accused her of being anti-male.\n\n___\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith has won Minnesota\u2019s special election to finish the final two years of former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term.\n\nSmith defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley on Tuesday. The election was a 10-month sprint, triggered in January after Franken resigned amid a growing sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nSmith got a head start in the race when she was appointed to take the seat by Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Smith was Dayton\u2019s lieutenant governor and former top aide.\n\nHousley tried to brand Smith as a political insider. But national Republican groups largely bypassed Housley\u2019s race, sinking resources instead into more winnable races in states like North Dakota and Indiana.\n\n___\n\n11:10 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Deb Fischer has cruised to a second term in Nebraska, defeating Lincoln city councilwoman Jane Raybould.\n\nFischer won Tuesday despite Raybould\u2019s efforts to cast the first-term incumbent as a Washington insider who sided with her party even when it was harmful to the GOP-friendly state. Raybould pitched herself to voters as an outsider who would look for ways to lower health care costs.\n\nFischer rejected the criticism and noted her work on Senate committees focused on agriculture and the military, both important areas to Nebraska with its farm economy and Offutt Air Force Base.\n\nThe candidates differed on their support for new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual assault allegations during his confirmation process. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Fischer voted to confirm Kavanaugh, while Raybould said the allegations merited further investigation.\n\n___\n\n11 p.m.\n\nRepublican Marsha Blackburn has won a grueling, expensive contest to become the first female U.S. senator from Tennessee.\n\nThe congresswoman defeated Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen on Tuesday by closely aligning her bid with President Donald Trump. The president made three visits to the state for her.\n\nBlackburn has sought to undermine Bredesen\u2019s reputation as an independent thinker by tying him to national Democrats at every turn. Blackburn was first elected to the House in 2002 and has called herself a \u201chardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\u201d\n\nBlackburn will replace retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker. She represents a rightward shift from Corker and other more centrist senators that Tennessee has historically elected.\n\n___\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nRepublicans have retained Senate control for two more years, shattering Democrats\u2019 dreams of an anti-Trump wave sweeping them into majority.\n\nThe result was all but assured when Republican Kevin Cramer ousted North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and when Republican businessman Mike Braun ousted Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Ted Cruz fended off a spirited challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn triumphed in Tennessee.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s gains come even as the results in Nevada and Arizona have yet to be determined.\n\n___\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has handily won a U.S. Senate seat in his adopted home state of Utah after a campaign where he backed off his once-fierce criticism of Donald Trump.\n\nRomney clinched the win Tuesday as he defeated Democrat Jenny Wilson, a member of the Salt Lake County council.\n\nRomney was the heavy favorite to win the seat in conservative Utah, where he holds near-celebrity status as the first Mormon presidential nominee from a major party.\n\nHe replaces longtime Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chose not to seek re-election.\n\nRomney denounced Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony\u201d during the 2016 campaign, but has since said he approves of many Trump policies.\n\n___\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz fended off rising-star Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke to win re-election in a much-watched Texas race that began as a cakewalk but needed a visit from President Donald Trump to help push the incumbent over the top.\n\nCruz finished a surprising second in the 2016 Republican presidential primary and began the Senate race as a prohibitive favorite.\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke visited fiercely conservative parts of the state that his party had long since given up on, while shattering fundraising records despite shunning donations from outside political groups and pollster advice.\n\nCruz argued that his opponent\u2019s support for gun control and universal health care were too liberal for Texas.\n\nTrump and Cruz were bitter 2016 rivals, but the president visited Houston late last month to solidify the senator\u2019s win.\n\n___\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has turned back a challenge by Republican Patrick Morrisey to win his second full-term in a state carried by President Donald Trump.\n\nManchin survived the most difficult re-election campaign of his career against the comparative newcomer Morrisey. Manchin is a former governor who has held elected office in West Virginia for the better part of three decades.\n\nManchin heavily outspent Morrisey and portrayed himself as loyal to his home state rather than party ideology. Manchin was the only Senate Democrat to vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nManchin was critical of Morrisey\u2019s New Jersey roots and his past lobbying ties to the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMorrisey is a two-term state attorney general and a staunch Trump supporter.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has won a second term, fending off a challenge from a Republican who ran as a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nBaldwin led Leah Vukmir in fundraising and polls throughout the race.\n\nBaldwin is one of the most liberal members of Congress. The differences between her and Vukmir were stark. They disagreed on almost every issue.\n\nBaldwin made the campaign largely about health care and Vukmir\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Baldwin argued for keeping the law and its guarantee of insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe race was Wisconsin\u2019s first for Senate where both major party candidates were women.\n\n___\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has easily won a third term in Minnesota.\n\nKlobuchar defeated Republican state Rep. Jim Newberger on Tuesday. It comes as Klobuchar\u2019s name swirls amid the crop of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2020.\n\nThe race was never close. Newberger is a little-known state lawmaker who struggled to raise money against the popular Klobuchar.\n\nRepublicans put far more focus on the state\u2019s other Senate race to complete the last two years of Al Franken\u2019s term. State Sen. Karin Housley is carrying the party\u2019s hopes in that race against Democratic Sen. Tina Smith.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger looks for a receiver in the second half of an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sat out practice on Tuesday to give his broken left index finger a rest but he is expected to play on Thursday night when Carolina visits Heinz Field.\n\nRoethlisberger said the finger was \u201cfine\u201d after he threw the ball 47 times in last Sunday\u2019s victory over Baltimore.\n\nHe did leave the game briefly in the third quarter after getting the wind knocked out of him, but he returned after missing just one snap.\n\nThe 36-year-old is on pace to top 5,000 yards passing for the first time in his career. He came close in 2014 when he tied Drew Brees for the league lead with 4,952. Roethlisberger said reaching the 5,000-yard plateau \u201cis still a pretty big deal\u201d but he is keeping his focus on the team.\n\nThe Steelers (5-2-1) have ripped off four straight wins to climb into first in the AFC North. The short week means they won\u2019t have much time to prepare for the surging Panthers (6-2), which might not be a bad thing. Roethlisberger expects to rely a little more heavily on the no-huddle offense, a setup in which he thrives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it for a while,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cWe know it. We know it pretty well. We did it really well in Baltimore, really well, and just being able to pick up the pace and the tempo.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers often turn to the no-huddle in an effort to snap them out of a funk early in games, but Roethlisberger isn\u2019t using it as a method of trying to get the ball downfield.\n\nWhile he\u2019s on track to set a career high in yards, his production has dipped a bit during Pittsburgh\u2019s winning streak. He\u2019s gone over 300 yards just once in Pittsburgh\u2019s past five games after going over 330 yards in each of the first three weeks.\n\nAn improved defense has helped.

Tim Kaine of Virginia won re-election over a firebrand Republican supporter of President Donald Trump with strong backing from voters who say the country is headed in the wrong direction, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate shows.\n\nKaine, a former governor and Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016, beat die-hard conservative Corey Stewart to retain the Senate seat he won in 2012. As voters elected members of the U.S. Senate and Congress in Tuesday\u2019s midterm contests, AP VoteCast found that 6 in 10 of Virginia voters believed the country is headed down the wrong path, compared with 4 in 10 who deemed it to be on the right track.\n\nThe survey found those who considered health care, gun policy or the environment the top issues besetting the nation backed Kaine by lopsided margins of 7 in 10 voters \u2014 or more \u2014 against his rival.\n\nKaine had been heavily favored during the campaign against a rival who waged a fiery Trump-style attack campaign but ran largely bereft of any support from the White House or national Republicans next door in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Virginia, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 4,066 voters and 702 nonvoters in the state of Virginia \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR THE SENATE\n\nKaine was about tied with Stewart among white voters.

Barbara Comstock of Virginia was the first congressional incumbent to lose as her Northern Virginia district expressed continued dislike of Trump. Democratic state Sen. Jennifer Wexton won easily in the wealthy suburban district outside Washington, which Hillary Clinton had won by 10 percentage points. Comstock tried to emphasize her independence from Trump, but Wexton, a former prosecutor, portrayed the two-term incumbent as a Trump ally out of touch with the diverse, well-educated district.\n\n\u2014Democrat Abigail Spanberger defeated two-term Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s 7th District Congressional race. Brat made history by upsetting former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor four years ago. Now it was Spanberger scoring a dramatic win. A former CIA officer and political newcomer, Spanberger cast herself as a moderate and slammed Brat for being out of touch with voters in the district covering suburbs west of Richmond and rural areas. Brat, a former economics professor, touted the strong economy.\n\n\u2014Democrat Elaine Luria unseated Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor in Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Luria\u2019s win marked a swift change of heart in this traditionally Republican district on Virginia\u2019s coast. Luria\u2019s victory was likely boosted by antipathy toward President Donald Trump. National Democrats backed Luria. She had a military background vital for running in a district that\u2019s home to the world\u2019s largest Navy base and many veterans. Luria is a former Navy commander.

(AP Photo/Paul White)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 With voting for the 2018 Ballon d\u2019Or closing this week, Antoine Griezmann boosted his chances of lifting the most prestigious individual trophy in soccer with an inspired display and a goal in his 50th Champions League game on Tuesday.\n\nGriezmann helped Atletico Madrid bounce back from a heavy loss to Borussia Dortmund with a 2-0 win over the German club, a result that sent last year\u2019s semifinalist Monaco crashing out.\n\nLiverpool was handed a 2-0 shock loss at Red Star Belgrade while Barcelona, without Lionel Messi, drew 1-1 at Inter Milan in the evening\u2019s showcase match to become the first team to progress to the knockout stage this season.\n\nRed Star\u2019s victory left Group C wide open after Napoli was held to a 1-1 home draw by Paris Saint-Germain, with all four teams still in contention in a very tight pool.\n\nGriezmann, who has scored 10 goals in his last 10 home matches in the tournament, was set up by midfielder Thomas Partey and concluded the smooth counterattack with a soft touch from inside the area in the 80th minute after Saul Niguez had put the hosts ahead.\n\nDortmund and Atletico are atop Group A. Dortmund routed Atletico 4-0 last month at home in what was the Spanish team\u2019s worst loss under coach Diego Simeone.\n\nEarlier, Monaco was handed a humiliating 4-0 defeat by Club Brugge that prematurely ended the club\u2019s Champions League ambitions as Thierry Henry once again failed to secure a first win as coach. It was Club Brugge\u2019s first group win in 13 years.\n\nHans Vanaken scored twice, Brazilian forward Wesley made it 3-0 and captain Ruud Vormer completed the rout.

Substitute Malcom scored with seven minutes remaining but Mauro Icardi leveled in the 87th for the hosts.\n\nBarcelona is top of Group B, three points ahead of Inter and six ahead of Tottenham, which beat PSV Eindhoven 2-1. Harry Kane scored two late goals for Tottenham, which looked in danger of exiting the competition after just four games when the hosts went behind after only 61 seconds at Wembley.\n\nInstead, Kane\u2019s goals \u2014 in the 78th and 89th \u2014 gave the English team a glimmer of hope of a top-two finish.\n\nRED STAR SHINES AGAIN\n\nRed Star Belgrade revived memories of its time as one of Europe\u2019s top teams. Milan Pavkov scored in the 22nd and 29th minutes as the Serbian champions earned a first win in their debut appearance in the Champions League group stage. It last played in the European Cup in 1991 as holders, when beating the likes of Liverpool would not have been regarded as such a surprise.\n\nBack then, eastern European teams were genuine contenders for club football\u2019s biggest prize \u2014 Steaua Bucharest of Romania was European champion in 1986 \u2014 and Red Star had some of the world\u2019s best players like Robert Prosinecki and Dejan Savicevic.\n\nNearly three decades on, Red Star doesn\u2019t have a household name in its squad and needed to qualify for the group stage through the playoffs. It was thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool at Anfield when the gulf between the sides was huge.\n\nIn a competitive Group C, last season\u2019s runner-up Liverpool and Napoli have six points each after the Italian side and Paris Saint-Germain drew 1-1. Making his Champions League debut for PSG, goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon could not stop Lorenzo Insigne\u2019s equalizer from the penalty spot after Juan Bernat\u2019s opener just before halftime.\n\nVINTAGE PORTO\n\nPorto moved even closer to a spot in the knockout stage after beating Lokomotiv Moscow 4-1 to end the Russian champion\u2019s qualifying hopes.\n\nAfter scoring at Lokomotiv last month, Hector Herrera and Moussa Marega both netted again to help put Porto on 10 points at the top of Group D. With Schalke beating Galatasaray 2-0 in Tuesday\u2019s other game, Porto needs one point from its last two games to be sure of qualifying.

But it was still possible the race could go to a runoff. In Georgia, a race goes to an automatic runoff if neither candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cWe believe our chance for a stronger Georgia is just within reach, but we cannot seize it until all voices are heard,\u201d Abrams told supporters at an Atlanta hotel early Wednesday.\n\nKemp said he was \u201cconfident victory is near\u201d but added he would await final results.\n\nAbrams was seeking to become the first black female governor in U.S. history and end years of Republican dominance in Georgia. Kemp, a 54-year-old businessman and veteran secretary of state, sought to maintain the GOP\u2019s hold on a state that is nearing presidential battleground status courtesy of its growth and diversity. Republicans have won every Georgia governor\u2019s race since 2002.\n\nEarly returns showed Kemp running up large margins across rural and small-town Georgia, but parts of metro Atlanta, where Abrams\u2019 strength is concentrated, had yet to report. Some of those Atlanta-area counties had extended voting hours for some precincts to accommodate the crowds and compensate for problems.\n\nThe VoteCast survey showed Abrams had a sizable advantage over Kemp among voters under 45 in the race for governor. Voters ages 45 and older were more likely to support Kemp. Black voters and Hispanic voters were more likely to favor Abrams. White voters overall favored Kemp. Whites without a college degree were more likely to favor Kemp. In addition, white college graduates were more likely to favor Kemp.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUES\n\nTop issues for Georgia voters included health care and immigration, each chosen by roughly a quarter of those surveyed. Other issues of concern to Georgia voters were the economy (2 in 10), gun policy (nearly 1 in 10), and terrorism (less than 1 in 10).\n\nVoter Julia King touched on both in an election day interview. \u201cHealth, I think, is a right that everyone should enjoy,\u201d said King, 20, a college student in Decatur. \u201cAnd no matter your religion, your gender or immigration status or where you fall on the socio economic ladder.\u201d\n\nVoter Nicole Whatley said in an election day interview that she disliked President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration. However Trump supporter Cindy West said at a recent rally that she supported Trump\u2019s immigration stance. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a state that gives sanctuary to illegals,\u201d West said.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the nation\u2019s current economic outlook \u2014 about 7 in 10 said the nation\u2019s economy is good, compared with a third who said it\u2019s not good.\n\nA strong economy was a selling point used by Trump as he campaigned around the nation for Kemp and other candidates.\n\n\u201cI work at a small business and it\u2019s really important for me and my boss, who owns the business, that our taxes stay low so we can stay operating,\u201d said Kemp supporter Ryan Henschel, an 18-year-old casting his first ballot.\n\nEconomic inequality was on the mind of some voters supporting Democrats. Brian Sherman, 75, of the Atlanta area community of Decatur, said he was voting for Democrats to address that issue.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nFor 47 percent of Georgia voters, Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their votes. By comparison, 24 percent said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and 28 percent said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in Georgia had mixed views of Trump: 50 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, the same amount as those who said they disapprove of Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that Trump has promoted fear and bigotry in this country and really enabled the rise of fascism and I think today is an opportunity to turn that tide,\u201d Lena Kotler said while voting in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb.\n\nWest, on the other hand, ran through a list of issues that aligned with Trump positions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the Supreme Court,\u201d West said, \u201cI\u2019m anti-abortion, so that is always at the top of the list, and I want to build the wall.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Georgia, 75 percent of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45.

(Meg Vogel/The Cincinnati Enquirer via AP)\n\nTOLEDO, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Republican Mike DeWine won Ohio\u2019s governor race with the backing of men and older voters, according to a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nAs voters cast ballots for governor, U.S. Senate and members of Congress in Tuesday\u2019s elections, AP VoteCast found that DeWine also won a big share of the vote in the state\u2019s small towns and rural areas.\n\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of who voted and why in Ohio, based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast, an innovative nationwide survey of about 139,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,842 voters and 687 nonvoters in the state of Ohio \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR GOVERNOR\n\nDeWine\u2019s victory could be tied to a strong showing among men, older voters and people in small towns and rural areas, negating Democrat Richard Cordray\u2019s advantage in the state\u2019s urban areas.\n\nCordray only managed to split the vote with DeWine among women and had just a slight edge with voters under age 45. But older voters outnumbered younger voters.\n\nWhite voters overall favored DeWine, including those without a college degree. White college graduates were split between the two.\n\nDeWine hit hard at Cordray over his support of a state ballot issue aimed at reducing the state\u2019s prison population by making most drug possession cases misdemeanor crimes. That issue failed overwhelmingly Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nRACE FOR SENATE\n\nIn the race for U.S. Senate, Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown won another term by splitting the vote with Republican Jim Renacci among white voters and piling up a big advantage among black voters.\n\nVoters under 45 widely backed Brown while those ages 45 and older were more split.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP FACTOR\n\nOnly about one-third of Ohio voters said Trump didn\u2019t play a role in their decisions.\n\nFor everyone else, one-third said a reason for their vote was to express opposition to Trump while just about the same amount said they wanted to send a message that they backed the president.\n\nTrump made four trips to Ohio since the beginning of August to build enthusiasm for the state\u2019s Republican candidates including an election-eve rally in Cleveland. In Ohio\u2019s governor race, both Cordray and DeWine put their final bets on Trump, reminding voters how they either opposed or shared the president\u2019s positions.\n\nDeWine won in what had been expected to be a much closer race and courted Trump voters in the final weeks.\n\nTrump called Cordray a \u201cfar-left disciple\u201d of liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nDaniel Donhowe, a 56-year-old engineer who voted in Dublin, a Columbus suburb, said he went with a straight slate of Democrats and the president was a big reason why. \u201cI know they represent my core values. And I also know that they\u2019ll fight Trump, and I think he\u2019s taken us 100 percent in the wrong direction,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, the state\u2019s voters were evenly split over whether they thought Trump was doing a good job.\n\n___\n\nTOP ISSUE: HEALTH CARE\n\nMore voters in Ohio said health care was the most important issue facing the nation in this year\u2019s midterm elections followed by the economy and immigration.\n\n___\n\nSTATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\nOhio\u2019s voters had a rosy outlook on the nation\u2019s economy, with around two-thirds saying it\u2019s in good shape. Republicans were counting on positive feelings about the economy and employment numbers to give them an edge, but Democrats contend the results have been uneven and that many areas are being left behind.\n\n\u201cI ended up voting for a lot of Republicans because I think they\u2019ve got the best plan. And the economy is going extremely well now, and I think that\u2019s due to Republican leadership,\u201d said Gary Smith, a registered Republican who voted in Dublin.\n\nThe state\u2019s voters were almost evenly split on whether they thought the country was on the right track.\n\n___\n\nCONTROL OF CONGRESS\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections determined control of Congress in the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term in office. A large share of the state\u2019s voters said that was an important factor when they considered their vote, with nearly two-thirds saying it was very important. In Ohio, there was a U.S. Senate seat at stake, but only two competitive U.S. House races. Despite a few spirited Democratic candidates who were hoping for a \u201cblue wave,\u201d there ended up being no change in the Republicans 12-4 advantage.\n\n___\n\nSTAYING AT HOME\n\nIn Ohio, 3 in 4 registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 85 percent \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats as Republicans.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate in all 50 states conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 3,842 voters and 687 nonvoters in Ohio was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English or Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files and self-identified registered voters selected from opt-in online panels. Participants in the probability-based portion of the survey were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including from sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 When Iowa State coach Matt Campbell challenged Hakeem Butler to become the Cyclones\u2019 go-to receiver this year, Butler simply nodded and went to work.\n\nNow, with the No. 23 Cyclones (5-3, 4-2 Big 12) heading into the stretch run of their season, Butler has more than met that challenge.\n\nHe leads the team in receptions, yardage and touchdowns. His average of 24 yards a catch leads the nation. Of Iowa State\u2019s 11 longest plays from scrimmage, Butler owns nine of them. Most were highlight reel-worthy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in Hakeem\u2019s class. I came in with him,\u201d defensive back Braxton Lewis said Tuesday. \u201cWhen he makes those plays, to this day it still amazes me every time he does it.\u201d\n\nA 6-foot-6, 225-pound junior, Butler is freakishly athletic. He is strong enough to ward off defenders, fast enough to outrun them and has the hops and size to outjump them.\n\nAgainst Oklahoma earlier this year, Butler shed four would-be tacklers on a 51-yard touchdown play. Last week at Kansas, he reached behind him to catch the ball over the middle, turned upfield and easily outran the pursuit on an 83-yard touchdown.\n\nLess than 3 minutes later, he made an even more jaw-dropping play.\n\nRunning a deep route against cornerback Hasan Defense, Butler leaped over the defender to make the catch and then, while holding the ball with his left hand, used his right to fling Defense off him as if they were playing a kids\u2019 game of crack the whip. Defense recovered but couldn\u2019t catch Butler before he somersaulted into the end zone.\n\n\u201cI think Hakeem, bar none, is one of the most athletically talented guys I\u2019ve ever had the opportunity to coach at the wide receiver position,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nCampbell inherited Butler when he arrived at Iowa State from Toledo in late November 2015. Former coach Paul Rhoads had signed Butler, who had no other offers from Power Five schools, at the urging of assistant coach Louis Ayeni, who was intrigued by Butler\u2019s size and athleticism. Iowa State got onto him late in the recruiting process and Butler, who was living in Travis, Texas, after growing up in Baltimore, committed two days before signing day.\n\nAfter redshirting in 2015, Butler played sparingly during Campbell\u2019s first season, catching just nine balls. He increased his production significantly last fall, catching 41 passes for 697 yards and seven touchdowns, but he was only a secondary target behind senior Allen Lazard. Still, he had two 100-yard receiving games, including a five-catch, 111-yard performance against Memphis in the Liberty Bowl.\n\nWith Lazard no longer around, the team needed a new primary receiver. Enter Butler, who has 33 receptions for 791 yards and eight touchdowns heading into Saturday\u2019s home game with Baylor (5-4, 3-3).\n\n\u201cI thought his offseason was maybe as good as anybody in our football program,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cSo it was really fun to watch that maturity. He\u2019s really done that all three years since I\u2019ve been here, gotten better every year and really has put himself in a great position to be a phenomenal player.\u201d\n\nSome would argue he\u2019s close to that already. He has topped 100 yards receiving in each of his last three games, has caught a touchdown pass in each of the last four and has worked his way onto the watch list for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation\u2019s top receiver. Some players make those lists on reputation; Butler did it with his performance.\n\nAnd if Campbell is to be believed, the best is yet to come.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing I\u2019m really excited about because I think there\u2019s still another level or two that he can get to in terms of some of the detail of playing the wide receiver position,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll only see him get better because he does have that passion to be really, really special.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 It was a smoldering pile of campaign fliers his wife found on their front porch but Jumoke Emery said it might as well have been a burning cross.\n\nEmery, a leading proponent of a ballot measure to remove a reference to slavery in the Colorado Constitution, said that he believes the burned door hanger-style placards in support of the measure, discovered by his wife Monday afternoon, were intended to scare him and his family because of their work on the measure.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, someone may have burned a cross on my front lawn.

And so we got to make the next decision to see if we can get our heads completely above water.\u201d\n\nThe Titans (4-4) still trail the Houston Texans (6-3) inside the AFC South, but their 28-14 victory in Dallas on Monday night put Tennessee into the sixth and final playoff spot in the AFC for now. The Titans shook off a horrific start with two fumbles by Marcus Mariota on their first two drives to turn score a season-high in points after managing just 31 points all of October.\n\nVrabel credited the Titans with shaking off that start. Tennessee turned two turnovers into 14 points, came up with five sacks and held Ezekiel Elliott to just 61 yards rushing.\n\nOffensively, the young Titans showed serious signs of progress in offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur\u2019s scheme.\n\nThey converted 11 of 14 attempts on third down for a 78.6 percent rate that was the best in the NFL this season and tied for the league\u2019s highest in the past three years. The Titans tied up the game at 7-7 with the franchise\u2019s longest drive since Dec. 9, 2012, using up 8 minutes, 55 seconds.\n\nTennessee scored touchdowns on four of five trips inside the Dallas 20 against a Cowboys defense that came in as the NFL\u2019s second stingiest in the red zone. Mariota also completed passes to nine different receivers and had a season-high 119.9 passer rating throwing for 240 yards and two touchdowns. He ran for 32 more yards and another score.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s that guys are understanding where they fit, what they need to do to get open and understand when they get open, Marcus is going to try to get them the ball,\u201d Vrabel said of the Titans\u2019 offense.\n\nLeft tackle Taylor Lewan, who spoke about the Titans deserving respect after a 3-1 start, said he is just relieved to win a game and get back to .500.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll definitely keep my (expletive) mouth shut from now on about that kind of stuff,\u201d Lewan said. \u201cDaddy learned his lesson.\u201d\n\nCornerback Logan Ryan said the Titans knew they were in a must-win situation in Dallas and that one win in the NFL can turn things around.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge win,\u201d Ryan said after the game. \u201cNow we know we\u2019ve got a tough test next week, and we will be ready.\u201d\n\nThe Titans host the Patriots (7-2) on Sunday before heading back on the road to Indianapolis and Houston. The Patriots routed Tennessee 35-14 in an AFC divisional game last January. Titans controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk fired Mike Mularkey after that game and chose Vrabel to take this franchise further.\n\n\u201cWe have to just get our players as ready as we can for the game,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nNotes: Vrabel made it clear he didn\u2019t like safety Kevin Byard celebrating his interception by running to the star at midfield and posing like Terrell Owens 18 years ago. The coach said he plans to talk again with the safety and the Titans on Wednesday, and Vrabel said he wants them to celebrate with each other.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(AP Photo/Bryan Woolston)\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) \u2014 No. 12 Kentucky is determined not to let a disappointing loss to No. 5 Georgia derail the rest of its season.\n\nThe Wildcats (7-2, 5-2 Southeastern Conference) need to correct a myriad of issues exposed in the 34-17 loss heading into Saturday\u2019s SEC finale at Tennessee (4-5, 1-5).\n\nKentucky\u2019s defense wilted against Georgia, yielding season highs in points, total yards (444) and rushing yards (331). The Wildcats\u2019 offense moved the ball at times, but costly mistakes early thwarted good scoring chances. Special teams also had breakdowns.\n\nWhile Kentucky\u2019s postgame mood was understandably somber after the loss, the Wildcats also seemed eager to turn the page. Their resolve has coach Mark Stoops encouraged about quickly bouncing back from the setback.\n\n\u201cYou have to learn and grow from every opportunity,\u201d Stoops said Monday, \u201cand certainly in that game, we have to take some good from that and they will.\n\n\u201cYou have to earn the right to get in that position from a lot of hard work, and we\u2019ve got to continue to do that. I think it\u2019s pretty evident that we need to continue to recruit. Those guys (Georgia) are pretty talented.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats believe they\u2019re skilled as well and want to get back on the winning track.\n\nHaving a short memory is a good first step for Kentucky. The Wildcats are still pretty good, though they dropped seven spots to eighth nationally in scoring defense (15.3 points per game) and rank 15th overall in total defense (giving up 311.8 yards per game).\n\nThe priority is shoring up the run defense and making things even more difficult for Tennessee\u2019s SEC-worst rushing attack (127.7 yards).\n\n\u201cWe know where our heads are,\u201d senior linebacker Josh Allen said. \u201cWe know what we have to do. We\u2019ve got to learn from our corrections and just move on.\u201d\n\nOffensively, the passing game has been a bright spot for Kentucky. Sophomore quarterback Terry Wilson has thrown for 493 yards and two TDs the past two weeks.\n\nThe Wildcats need to rejuvenate their strong ground game to complement Wilson\u2019s arm. While junior back Benny Snell Jr. rushed for 73 yards to break 1,000 for the third straight season, Kentucky has failed to break 100 yards three times in the past four contests and hasn\u2019t scored more than 17 points over that span.\n\nStoops acknowledged that a season-long heavy workload is taking its toll on Snell, who\u2019s nursing a sore ankle. But the coach also said the offensive line needs to improve from inconsistent recent play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a group effort and it has something to do with the guys on the other side as well,\u201d he said.\n\nIt will be an uphill battle against the Volunteers. The Wildcats have not fared well in Knoxville. Kentucky hasn\u2019t won at Tennessee since 1984.\n\nStoops won\u2019t discuss that frustrating streak with players, following his approach used before his team traveled to Florida in hopes of ending a 31-game slide against the Gators.\n\nThe Wildcats knew the situation and finally got the last word with a 27-16 upset that has jump-started their best start in 41 years. Now they want to avoid their first losing streak this season.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to let this loss turn into two,\u201d running back A.J. Rose said. \u201cWe have a goal and we came short of that goal, but we still want to finish the SEC strong.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "How major US stock indexes fared Tuesday\n\nU.S. stocks rose Tuesday as industrial and technology companies recovered some of the big losses they took over the last month.

As I told my teammates, I\u2019ve had a pretty long career and I\u2019ve won at Napoli twice, so it\u2019s pretty complicated,\u201d said Buffon, who transferred to PSG for this season after nearly two decades at Juventus. \u201cI think PSG showed today we are a solid team and that\u2019s a crucial element if we want to go far in the Champions League.\u201d\n\nIn an extremely tight Group C, last season\u2019s finalist Liverpool and Napoli lead with six points each.\n\nPSG is next with five points and Red Star Belgrade, which stunned Liverpool 2-0 in Tuesday\u2019s other group game, is still in contention with four points.\n\nMbappe had been controlled by Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly before he finally broke free down the left flank and pulled back a cross for the advancing Bernat in first-half added time.\n\nThere was tension as the teams walked off the pitch at halftime as Koulibaly and Napoli midfielder Allan had to be separated from PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.\n\nNapoli coach Carlo Ancelotti then went to protest to the referee, perhaps because he thought there was more than the single minute of announced added time.\n\nHowever, it was a deserved advantage for PSG, which controlled for long stretches.\n\nAfter the break, Buffon showed that he\u2019s still \u2014 at age 40 \u2014 one of the world\u2019s most skillful goalkeepers with a series of reflex saves.\n\nFirst, Buffon deflected a dangerous angled effort from Dries Mertens. Then he made a leaping save to push another effort from Mertens over the bar with his fingertips.\n\nHowever, Buffon couldn\u2019t stop himself from slamming into Callejon when the Spain winger got sandwiched between the goalkeeper and defender Thiago Motta.\n\nBuffon guessed right on the direction of Insigne\u2019s spot kick but the Napoli striker\u2019s shot was struck precisely into the bottom corner.\n\nBuffon was making his Champions League debut for PSG, having served a three-match ban for his comments about the referee at the end of Juventus\u2019 run last season.\n\nStill viewed as a rival from his Juventus days, Buffon was booed loudly on each touch.\n\nInsigne now has three goals in four Champions League matches this season and 10 in 14 games in all competitions this season.\n\nNapoli captain Marek Hamsik made a record 512th appearance for the club.\n\n\u201cNapoli mostly tried to keep the tempo down and slow it down in the first half, but then after going behind they changed their approach and poured forward,\u201d Buffon said. \u201cThere was a period of adjustment after the break, when Napoli came out fighting and it was only natural to be under pressure. In the end, there was one half each and a draw was a fair result.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/asdampf", "Inter forward Mauro Icardi, left, celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal with his teammate Inter midfielder Ivan Perisic during the Champions League group B soccer match between Inter Milan and Barcelona at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

But Inter has made a habit of scoring late goals and did so again as Mauro Icardi leveled in the 87th.\n\nBarcelona could have won Group B with a victory at San Siro but a combination of wayward finishing and fine saves by Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic means it will have to wait until the final two group matches.\n\n\u201cWe had a great game,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cWe played very well. We didn\u2019t win but we qualified.

It was Malcom\u2019s first goal for the club and the Brazilian was in tears as he was embraced by his teammates.\n\nBut Inter substitute Lautaro Martinez also had an immediate impact as his cross was deflected into the path of Icardi, who fired in his third goal in four matches in the competition. It was his seventh goal in his past six Inter matches.\n\n\u201cI think the goal was deserved because of how the team reacted after Barcelona\u2019s goal,\u201d Inter coach Luciano Spalletti said. \u201cIcardi is the example \u2014 after he equalized he took the ball and ran back with it to the center circle.

She backed Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court the same day Trump nominated him, and criticized Bredesen for taking so long to say he would have supported Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation as well.\n\nBlackburn thanked Trump and Pence in her victory speech and said she will be a leader who will \u201cwork with the president and keep this nation on the path to prosperity that we are on today.\u201d She said she will work to confirm more constitutional judges, decrease taxes, limit regulation, oppose abortion, protect gun rights, get federal spending under control and build the border wall.\n\nFirst elected to the House in 2002, Blackburn aligned with the tea party movement and regularly appeared on Fox News. She opened her campaign by dubbing herself a \u201chardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\u201d Before that, she made a name for herself as a state lawmaker who helped lead the revolt against a proposed Tennessee income tax in the early 2000s.\n\nThe $85 million-plus race set a state record in spending by candidates and outside groups, gaining national interest because of its potential implications for the GOP\u2019s slim majority in the Senate.\n\nPop superstar Taylor Swift even broke her political silence for the Tennessee contest when she went on Instagram to endorse Bredesen and encourage people to vote.\n\n\u201cI just really want those young people to know how important it is to the future of our country that you not get discouraged, that you stay engaged and you never, ever, ever give up,\u201d Bredesen said Tuesday night.\n\nBlackburn took aim at Bredesen for donating to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and receiving campaign checks from high-profile Democrats. Although Bredesen largely kept his distance from other well-known Democrats, Blackburn had no qualms bringing Trump and fellow national Republicans to Tennessee.\n\nShe welcomed in Pence three times. The president\u2019s son Eric Trump, and U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina also came along for separate campaign events.\n\nVoters like Cody Wheeler in the Nashville suburbs were skeptical about Bredesen\u2019s promise to independents and Republicans that he wouldn\u2019t toe the party line in Washington.\n\n\u201cI had a hard time believing his campaign,\u201d said Wheeler, a 30-year-old Blackburn voter from Williamson County. \u201cWith Marsha, you knew what you were going to get.\u201d\n\nCorker, the outgoing senator, had backed Blackburn but refused to campaign against Bredesen, whom he considers a friend. Corker briefly heard out pleas from some peers last winter that he reconsider retirement, prompting a Blackburn spokeswoman to say anyone who thinks she can\u2019t win the general election is a \u201cplain sexist pig.\u201d\n\nAfterward though, she managed to consolidate support across the GOP\u2019s various political circles, including from former U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher, who briefly opposed her in the primary and called for Corker to run again upon dropping out of the race.\n\nOn Tuesday night, she was happy to claim a piece of Tennessee history for women in the Senate.\n\n\u201cAnd just imagine this: It is a conservative woman to boot,\u201d she said to loud applause.\n\n___\n\nAdrian Sainz contributed from Memphis.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Health care, immigration and President Donald Trump were high on voters\u2019 minds as they cast ballots in the midterm elections, according to a wide-ranging survey of the electorate conducted by The Associated Press.\n\nAP\u2019s VoteCast survey of more than 115,000 voters paints a portrait of an enthusiastic yet deeply divided electorate. Women voted considerably more in favor of Democrats in the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nDemocrats seized the House and were poised to put a check on Trump. Republicans retained control of the Senate.\n\nHere are some takeaways from VoteCast:\n\nHEALTH CARE AND IMMIGRATION\n\nHealth care was at the forefront of many voters\u2019 minds: 26 percent named it as the most important issue facing the country. Immigration was not far behind, with 23 percent naming it as the most important issue.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 of those who voted for a Democratic House candidate named health care as the most important issue facing the nation, while about as many Republican voters considered immigration to be the top issue.\n\nOthers considered the economy (19 percent), gun policy (8 percent) and the environment (7 percent) to be the top issue.\n\n___\n\nIS IT ALL ABOUT TRUMP?\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters said Trump was a reason for their vote, while about a third said he was not. Nearly 4 in 10 voters said they cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, while a quarter of voters said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\n___\n\nWOMEN VOTERS\n\nWomen voted considerably more in favor of their congressional Democratic candidate: 56 percent voted for the Democrat, compared with 41 percent voting for the Republican. Men were more narrowly divided in their vote.\n\nWomen ages 18 to 29 voted strongly Democratic, with 65 percent of those voters favoring the Democratic candidate.\n\nWhite women were narrowly divided in their views: 50 percent of white women voted for the Republican, while 47 percent voted for the Democrat. Among non-white women, 80 percent voted for the Democrat.\n\n___\n\nENTHUSIASM\n\nA large majority of voters were enthusiastic heading to the polls, with nearly 9 in 10 reporting that they were extremely or very interested in the midterm election.\n\n___\n\nNONVOTERS\n\nNationally, 70 percent of registered voters who chose not to vote in the midterm election were younger than 45. A wide share of those who did not vote \u2014 around 8 in 10 \u2014 did not have a college degree. About as many nonvoters were Democrats (32 percent) as Republicans (32 percent).\n\n___\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nVoters have a positive view of the state of the national economy \u2014 about two-thirds said the condition of the economy is excellent or good, compared with a third who said it\u2019s not good or poor.\n\n___\n\nWRONG DIRECTION\n\nA majority of voters overall said the country is headed in the wrong direction. Nearly 6 in 10 voters said it is headed in the wrong direction, while around 4 in 10 said it\u2019s on the right track.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nA quarter of voters said the Affordable Care Act, often called \u201cObamacare,\u201d should be repealed entirely. About another quarter said parts of the law should be repealed. Around a third of voters said it should be expanded, and about 1 in 10 preferred it be left as it is.\n\nNearly 6 in 10 voters said it should be the responsibility of the federal government to make sure that all Americans have health care coverage.\n\n___\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nAbout three-quarters of voters said the debate over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination was very or somewhat important to their vote. Those who said it was very important to their vote were more likely to support the Democratic candidate. The GOP-led Senate confirmed Kavanaugh after a California professor accused him of sexual assault when both were in high school. Kavanaugh denied the allegations.\n\nRoughly half of voters approve of Trump\u2019s handling of Supreme Court nominations.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIAN COLLUSION\n\nThe country is evenly divided on whether Trump\u2019s campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. Democrats overwhelmingly said there was collusion, and Republicans overwhelmingly said there was not.\n\n___\n\n#METOO\n\nRoughly three-quarters of voters were very or somewhat concerned about women not being believed when they make allegations of sexual misconduct. About the same share said they were very or somewhat concerned about men not being given the opportunity to defend themselves against allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n___\n\nCOMMUNITY TYPE\n\nIn suburban areas, where key House races will be decided, voters skewed toward Democrats by 8 percentage points. Urbanites voted more than 2 to 1 in favor of Democrats, and small-town and rural voters cast votes for Republicans by a significant, though smaller, margin.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP APPROVAL\n\nThe survey found that 45 percent of voters approve of Trump\u2019s job performance \u2014 a finding that is largely consistent with recent polling. More voters gave Trump a positive rating on his handling of the economy (56 percent), and around half approve of the president on border security.\n\nNearly half of Americans said Trump is a strong leader and has brought needed change to the government. About 7 in 10 voters said Trump stands up for what he believes in.\n\nStill, only about a third said Trump has the right temperament to serve as president. Around the same share see him as honest and trustworthy.\n\n___\n\nAP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News. The survey of 116,789 voters and 22,137 nonvoters was conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 6, concluding as polls close on Election Day. It combines interviews in English and Spanish with a random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files; with self-identified registered voters conducted using NORC\u2019s probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population; and with self-identified registered voters selected from nonprobability online panels. Participants selected from state voter files were contacted by phone and mail, and had the opportunity to take the survey by phone or online. The margin of sampling error for voters is estimated to be plus or minus 0.5 percentage points. All surveys are subject to multiple sources of error, including sampling, question wording and order, and nonresponse.

If the Bulldogs have any hope at pulling off of pulling off an upset, it will likely have to start with a defense that\u2019s been among the best in the country all season.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to play a perfect game, but got to be darn near close,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that range, because they\u2019re not going to beat themselves and they\u2019re very well coached.\u201d\n\nMississippi State is giving up just 12.3 points per game and has allowed nine offensive touchdowns this season, which is the fewest in the nation. The Bulldogs have allowed just two touchdowns over their opponents\u2019 past 51 possessions.\n\nThe group is anchored by the defensive line, which includes defensive end Montez Sweat and defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons. Sweat has 12 tackles for a loss, including 9\u00bd sacks, while Simmons is fourth on the team with 42 tackles, including 9\u00bd for a loss and also has five quarterback hurries.\n\nWhile Mississippi State\u2019s offense has been a work in progress \u2014 and mostly responsible for the team\u2019s three losses \u2014 the defense has been a steady force. The Bulldogs have given up less than 14 points in seven different games this season, which also leads the nation.\n\n\u201cEvery year I\u2019ve been here, they\u2019ve had a really tough defensive line, tough front seven,\u201d Alabama running back Damien Harris said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything to be any different this year.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs had just finished another impressive, workmanlike defensive performance in a 45-3 victory over Louisiana Tech last weekend when the conversation turned to the Crimson Tide.\n\nBulldogs\u2019 linebacker Erroll Thompson is proud of the resume the defense has built through its first nine games of the season. But he knows the ultimate test is coming, especially when it comes to slowing down Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nThe sophomore has put up stellar numbers this season, completing 68 percent of his passes for 2,361 yards, 27 touchdowns and just one interception.\n\n\u201cWe know those guys are going to put in the air,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be explosive, they\u2019ve been explosive in every game this year. So it\u2019s a great challenge for us.\u201d\n\nDuring Moorhead\u2019s description of Alabama\u2019s season, he had good things to say about several people on offense, including coordinator Mike Locksley, running backs Najee Harris and Damien Harris, and receivers Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III.\n\nBut he saved special praise for Tagovailoa.\n\n\u201cI call them game wreckers, because they can take the games over by themselves,\u201d Moorhead said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it is ever necessarily a matter of stopping them as it is neutralizing them or containing them. That is our hope with him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer John Zenor in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, contributed to this story.

Tottenham is in third place, three points behind second-place Inter.\n\n\u201cWe had to dig deep and find another level when it mattered,\u201d Kane said. \u201cWe have been grinding results out here and there all season. We are getting wins.\u201d\n\nIn the Premier League, maybe, but this was Tottenham\u2019s first victory in its Champions League group and there was a touch of fortune about it.\n\nFor the winning goal, Kane met a cross from Ben Davies with a header that was directed straight at goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet. The ball, however, deflected into the net off PSV defender Trent Sainsbury, who held his head in his hands.\n\nPSV, which stayed on one point and cannot now qualify for the knockout stage, had defended stoutly after going ahead through Luuk De Jong\u2019s header from Gaston Pereiro\u2019s corner.

Only four of 128 FBS teams forced fewer turnovers.\n\nThis season, the Yellow Jackets have forced 20 turnovers, tied for the eighth-highest total in the nation.\n\nThe sudden jump in big plays caught the attention of Miami coach Mark Richt.\n\n\u201cTheir defense has done a good job with turnovers,\u201d Richt said, noting the Yellow Jackets \u201cdoubled their number. And in this last game, they picked off three passes and scored 17 points off those turnovers. So they did a great job there.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s 38-28 win at North Carolina marked the fifth time this season the Yellow Jackets have forced three turnovers. The takeaways have helped Johnson\u2019s offense score 38.3 points per game to rank third in the ACC.\n\nSaint-Amour has three forced fumbles and two interceptions, including one of the three thefts in last week\u2019s win. He also has four sacks and 10 \u00bd tackles for loss.\n\n\u201cI thought he would be a really good player,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you ever know he\u2019s going to have those kinds of sacks and tackles for negative plays. I think he\u2019s a good fit for what we do defensively.\u201d\n\nSaint-Amour set career highs with nine tackles and three quarterback hurries against the Tar Heels.\n\nGeorgia Tech led 35-28 with less than three minutes remaining when Saint-Amour\u2019s leaping interception set up a clinching field goal. On Monday, he was named the ACC\u2019s defensive lineman of the week.\n\nSaint-Amour said Georgia Tech has added more emphasis to forcing turnovers this season.\n\n\u201cIn practice we always emphasize takeaways,\u201d he said. \u201cThursday we\u2019re always trying to get picks, working on ball skills. Just practicing every day, every week and getting better at it.\u201d\n\nStill, Johnson is reluctant to heap praise on a defense that has been the Yellow Jackets\u2019 chronic weakness. Despite the big plays, the Yellow Jackets rank 78th nationally with their average of 28.2 points allowed. The unit faltered late even in last week\u2019s win.\n\nOne weak spot is the team\u2019s 13 sacks, good for only 13th among 14 ACC teams.\n\n\u201cI think Nate has had a pretty good history of creating some turnovers with what they do,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo I certainly don\u2019t want to diminish that, but at the same time it\u2019s like I can promise you we\u2019re not doing anything in practice that we didn\u2019t do before. I think it could be a function of maybe we get a little more pressure, but still our sacks numbers are not very good. We do have way more tackles for loss.\u201d\n\nJohnson also is looking for better results on third down.\n\nThere is room for improvement, but the leap in takeaways is a good start.\n\n\u201cWe know if we want to be a top defense, if we want to be a good defense and we want to win games we have to win the turnover battle,\u201d Saint-Amour said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we try and do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Pac-12 Freshman of the Year?

Gonzalez, File)\n\nThe Pacific Northwest appears to be leading the way in the Pac-12 for freshmen running backs who are having an impact.\n\nA trio of talented backs, Oregon State\u2019s Jermar Jefferson, Oregon\u2019s CJ Verdell and Washington State\u2019s Max Borghi, are all taking on notable roles on their offenses as either true or redshirt freshmen.\n\nMeanwhile, Arizona State seems to have cornered the market on freshman defenders. And there\u2019s USC\u2019s still-could-be-in-high-school quarterback JT Daniels.\n\nAmong the Pac-12 freshmen making a mark this season:\n\nJERMAR JEFFERSON, Oregon State: Jefferson has rushed for 1,092 yards and 12 touchdowns this year. He\u2019s had five games with 100-plus yards rushing. But his progress was slowed a bit by injury that kept him sidelined for most of the Beavers\u2019 game against California, and USC was able to hold him to 58 yards rushing last weekend.\n\nHe ranks seventh in the nation for rushing yards, averaging 121.3 per game.\n\nCJ VERDELL, Oregon: Verdell leads the Ducks with 690 yards rushing with five touchdowns. He\u2019s notable as the Ducks look to re-establish their running game: In the team\u2019s loss to Washington State, the Ducks rushed just 58 yards, then in the loss to Arizona they managed just 84. The team vowed to be more physical up front before last Saturday\u2019s 42-21 victory over UCLA, where they ran for 200.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision,\u201d coach Mario Cristobal said. \u201cThe guys, we talked about it and it was about enough is enough; we are going to put our foot on the ground and we are going to recommit ourselves to being the physical team that we started the season as.\u201d\n\nVerdell is averaging 76.67 yards a game, fifth among freshmen nationally. He rushed for 100-plus yards in his first three conference games.\n\nMAX BORGHI, Washington State: As usual in Mike Leach\u2019s Air Raid offense, the Cougars\u2019 running backs often do some catching, too, and Borghi is no exception. He has 245 rushing yards for six touchdowns, along with 31 catches for 204 yards receiving and three touchdowns. His nine total touchdowns rank seventh in the Pac-12. He also has forced 10 missed tackles.\n\nLanding Borghi was something of a coup for the Cougars because of a late recruiting push by Stanford.\n\nJT DANIELS, USC: The future looks bright for the Trojans\u2019 true freshman quarterback, even if he\u2019s had to go through some challenges his rookie year. Daniels has thrown for 1,806 yards with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions. Just 18, he left high school a year early to enroll at USC and become just the second true freshman to start in the opener for the Trojans at quarterback, joining Matt Barkley.\n\nHe missed a game because of a concussion but returned last weekend in a 38-21 victory over Oregon State, throwing for 177 yards and a touchdown.\n\nJEVON HOLLAND, Oregon: The true freshman safety sits atop the Pac-12 with four interceptions this season. He\u2019s tied for fourth in the nation and tied for first among freshman. He had two interceptions against Cal. Holland also had an interception in the end zone last weekend against UCLA.\n\nFollowing the victory over the Bruins, teammate Thomas Graham Jr. crashed the postgame news conference to ask Holland how it felt to lead the team in interceptions. \u201cIt feels good. I\u2019ve got some bragging rights,\u201d Holland replied before adding with a laugh: \u201cI may need a ride home; don\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\nMERLIN ROBERTSON, Arizona State: The 6-foot-3, 235-pound linebacker was named Pac-12 defensive Player of the Week following Arizona State\u2019s 38-20 upset against then-No. 16 Utah last weekend. Robertson had nine tackles, one for loss, and had his first career interception. Robertson leads the nation among freshmen this season with 27 defensive stops.\n\nArizona State\u2019s defense also features a pair of other talented true freshmen, linebacker Darien Butler and defensive back Aashari Crosswell. Crosswell also had an interception against the Utes. Coach Herm Edwards said the guys are nicknamed the fabulous freshmen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif., smiles as she is cheered by a crowd of Democratic supporters during an election night returns event at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A record number of women were elected to the House on Tuesday, nearly two years after women spilled out into the streets of Washington and in cities across the country in defiance of the inauguration of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe incoming class of lawmakers could have a stark impact on politics in the nation\u2019s capital, particularly within the Democratic Party, after a midterm election that was widely seen as a referendum on Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nAs of Wednesday, voters were on track to send at least 100 women to the House, surpassing the previous record of 84. According to data compiled by The Associated Press, 237 women ran for the House as major-party candidates this year. That number is expected to grow, as results had not been called for more than a dozen races in which women are running.\n\nAmong the new lawmakers headed to the House is Jennifer Wexton, a Virginia state senator who defeated incumbent Barbara Comstock in one of the most closely watched races across the country. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the former Bernie Sanders organizer who won an upset primary victory over a senior House Democrat, will also head to Congress.\n\nThe Election Day gains by women were the capstone on a midterm election that has been defined by the energy of women, both on the political left and right. Women not only ran for office at an unprecedented rate, several knocked off white male incumbents during their party primaries. They mobilized on the grassroots level and played larger roles as donors than in previous election cycles.\n\nThere was also a historic gender gap that showed women more supportive of Democrats than Republicans. According to VoteCast, women voted considerably more in favor of their congressional Democratic candidate: About 6 in 10 voted for the Democrat, compared with 4 in 10 for the Republican. Men, by contrast, were more evenly divided in their vote.\n\nIn victory speeches across the country, women acknowledged the groundbreaking year.\n\n\u201cI am so honored to share both the ballot and the stage with the many visionary, bold women who have raised their hand to run for public office,\u201d said Ayanna Pressley, who became the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts. \u201cNow, listen, I know for a fact none of us ran to make history, we ran to make change. However, the historical significance of this evening is not lost on me. The significance of history is not lost on me, including my personal one.\u201d\n\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala noted that both of her opponents in the race for a House seat from Florida were women.\n\n\u201cThis is the year of the woman, and the fact that women were willing to put themselves on the line is important, whether they\u2019ve been Republicans or Democrats,\u201d said Shalala, a first-time candidate for elected office.\n\nWomen also contested governor\u2019s races across the country. Twenty-two states have never elected a woman as governor, and six states have female governors today. This year, women tied the record for most governor\u2019s seats women have ever held \u2014 nine \u2014 a number that was previously reached in 2004 and 2007. Stacey Abrams, one of 16 women running for governor this year, remains in a tight contest in Georgia.\n\nThe surge of female candidates this year has drawn comparisons to the \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d when in 1992 voters sent 47 women to the House, and four women joined the Senate bringing women\u2019s numbers to six.\n\nThis year, women not only increased their numbers, but the new class of lawmakers also includes women from a wide patchwork of backgrounds, adding to a Congress that is expected to be more diverse.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just the year of the woman, this is the year of every woman,\u201d said Cecile Richards, who served as the president of Planned Parenthood for more than a decade, noting the groundbreaking diversity among the women who have run for office this year.\n\nTexas is set to send its first Hispanic women to Congress, as Democrats Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia both won their races. In Kansas, Sharice Davids, a Democrat running in a suburban Kansas City district, will become one of the first Native American women elected to Congress, and the first openly LGBT person to represent Kansas at the federal level.\n\nWomen also reached a record number in the Senate. As of Wednesday morning, 24 women were set to serve in the Senate come January, one more woman than the current record of 23.\n\nTennessee gained the state\u2019s first woman in the Senate as Marsha Blackburn defeated former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\n\u201cNow you don\u2019t have to worry if you\u2019re going to call me congressman or congresswoman or congress lady,\u201d Blackburn said in her victory speech. \u201cNow, senator will do.\u201d\n\nAlso in the Senate, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin held off a challenge from Republican Leah Vukmir, but her fellow Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri were defeated by their Republican opponents.\n\nThe gains among women on Capitol Hill come as potential Democratic candidates for president are already taking steps to challenge Trump, several prominent female Democrats among them.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the Democrats who is considering the 2020 race, said that the two years since Trump ascended to the White House had ushered a new generation of women into public life.\n\n\u201cWomen who had never run for anything stepped up to put their names on the ballot,\u201d she said. \u201cThey ignored the party bosses who said they should wait their turn. They ignored the consultants who said they should cover up their tattoos and smile more, and they ignored the powerful men of the Republican Party who never took them seriously anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey refused to let anyone shut them up or stand in their way, and that is how real change begins,\u201d she added.", "Auburn Tigers quarterback Jarrett Stidham (8) celebrates the victory against Texas A&M following an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Auburn, Ala.

He\u2019s already proven he can get through adversity.\u201d\n\nMalzahn and the Tigers (6-3, 3-3, Southeastern Conference) have received a jolt of confidence \u2014 and now a vote of confidence \u2014 with two straight wins, including a comeback over Texas A&M .\n\nThey\u2019re hoping to build on it heading into Saturday night\u2019s game at No. 5 Georgia (8-1, 6-1).\n\nThe Tigers are still two-touchdown underdogs but have won back-to-back games after dropping two straight. They rallied from 10 points down over the final seven minutes to beat the Aggies 28-24.\n\nGreene told reporters after Malzahn\u2019s Tuesday news conference that the coach is coming back.\n\nMalzahn was already feeling pretty good about the team\u2019s situation after the win over the Aggies.\n\n\u201cYou could tell Sunday, it felt different from a confidence standpoint,\u201d Malzahn said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we needed, that kind of win to help give us some momentum moving forward.\u201d\n\nThe wins have dramatically changed the mood for a team that has still fallen short of expectations. The struggles, especially on offense, had raised questions about Malzahn\u2019s status even though he has a new seven-year, $49 million deal .\n\nThe latest win supplied a big boost. Quarterback Jarrett Stidham led two drives for touchdowns in the closing minutes, capped by his 11-yard pass to Seth Williams for the go-ahead score with 1:41 left.\n\nStidham, who has struggled at times this season, completed 7 of 8 passes for 125 yards over the final two drives.\n\n\u201cIt was a blast,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing down 10 with about seven minutes left, not many people were counting us in the battle still, so it was good to come back and prove everybody wrong, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nWith a closing stretch that includes road games against the Bulldogs and No. 1 Alabama, that win made Auburn bowl eligible and left the Tigers needing just one more victory to lock up a winning regular-season mark with Liberty visiting in between the two rivalry games.\n\nThe Tigers made key defensive stops, had a big punt return by Christian Tutt and delivered the two big drives. The big downside was continued struggles running the ball with Auburn producing just 19 yards on 21 carries.\n\n\u201cAll three phases helped win that game when the pressure was on the most and that\u2019s really what our team has taken from that,\u201d Malzahn said.\n\nThis will be the the third time Auburn and Georgia have met over the past year. The Tigers pulled off an upset in the regular season then got routed 28-7 in the SEC championship game rematch.\n\nNow, they\u2019re 14-point underdogs but at least feeling better about themselves.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in a good spot moving forward because we got that win,\u201d Auburn defensive tackle Dontavius Russell said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "SHREVEPORT, La.

Democrats fell short of those numbers even though they\u2019ll have at least 18 Senate seats and 36 House seats in the 2019 session.\n\nHouse Speaker Tina Kotek said stronger Democratic majorities in the House and Senate will help Democrats focus on school funding, climate change and a housing crisis.\n\nThe Democrats achieved a supermajority in the House when Rachel Prusak, a nurse, beat Republican Rep. Julie Parrish to represent a district south of Portland. Parrish had backed a ballot measure \u2014 defeated by voters in January \u2014 that would have eliminated a new tax to provide health care for low-income Oregonians.

Gomez had been DeBoer\u2019s legislative aide.\n\nCourtney said he was relieved voters defeated a measure on Tuesday that would have amended the state Constitution to require a legislative supermajority for bills that raise revenue through tax exemptions, deductions, credits or fees. Passage would have made it almost impossible to create a budget, Courtney said.\n\nIn the 2019 legislative session, which starts in January and runs to early July, Democrats will aim to pass a multibillion-dollar revenue measure to fund public education. Courtney said it would be a value added tax or a gross receipts tax, but not a sales tax.\n\nHaving a supermajority doesn\u2019t mean Democrats will act in unison to pass tax bills, said Christopher Shortell, associate professor of political science at Portland State University. For example, Golden, who will be sworn in along with other winners on Jan. 14, will have to be mindful he\u2019s from a fairly conservative district, Shortell said.\n\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re a Democrat in a seat that was held by a Republican ... if you come in and join the Democratic supermajority to enact some tax bill that\u2019s very unpopular with your constituents, that\u2019s a problem for you,\u201d Shortell said. \u201cA supermajority does not guarantee that all those Democrats will join in.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WICHITA, Kan.

Canada faces an uncertain future, despite keeping the football team together and forging a winning record amid the chaos surrounding the program.(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File)\n\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) \u2014 Maryland interim coach Matt Canada faces an uncertain future, despite keeping the football team together and forging a winning record amid the chaos surrounding the program.\n\nWhen this season ends, Maryland will be looking for a head coach to replace DJ Durkin, who was fired last week. Canada may be asked to apply, given that he\u2019s juggled the job of interim coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach well enough to keep the Terrapins (5-4, 3-3 Big Ten) in the hunt for a bowl bid entering Saturday\u2019s game at Indiana (4-5, 1-5).\n\nOr, Canada could end up unemployed if the school hires a coach who wants someone else to run the offense.\n\nIf any of this has been weighing on Canada\u2019s mind, he\u2019s not telling. Asked Tuesday if he\u2019s considered what the future might bring, Canada completely dodged the issue.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on today, on each other, on being able to do the best we can against Indiana,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not the answer you\u2019re looking for, but it\u2019s a true answer.\u201d\n\nThe football program has endured a myriad of deflating events since late May, when offensive lineman Jordan McNair collapsed on the field and subsequently died of heatstroke. There have been two internal investigations, one into McNair\u2019s death and the other into the culture of the program .\n\nDurkin was placed on administrative leave in mid-August. Canada took over, handed back the reins last Tuesday when Durkin was reinstated and regained control when Durkin was fired the following day .\n\nAll this preceded a rather predictable 24-3 loss to Michigan State.\n\n\u201cThere were some different events \u2014 we\u2019re going to be honest about that \u2014 but we went through them, our kids processed them,\u201d Canada said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t play well enough to win the game Saturday.\u201d\n\nCanada has never been a head coach. Although he\u2019s fulfilling that job description this season, the 46-year-old considers himself to the offensive coordinator with a few other obligations. The biggest change is that he no longer views the game up in the coach\u2019s booth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been presented with a few things that I wasn\u2019t expecting. Calling from the field has been a different challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to find the good in everything, and there\u2019s a lot of good. We\u2019ve all maintained our jobs, we\u2019ve all maintained our titles, we\u2019ve all done what we had to do and we\u2019ve kept it going.\u201d\n\nThroughout the season, Canada has steadfastly stuck to a day-at-a-time philosophy, absorbed the blame for the losses and foisted credit upon others for the victories. Not surprisingly, he downplayed his role in the Terps\u2019 5-4 record.\n\n\u201cThe story is these kids,\u201d Canada said. \u201cThe story is how awesome they are and how special they are, how much they\u2019re sticking together.\u201d\n\nFacing Indiana this week will bring Canada back to his coaching roots. He started as a graduate assistant for the Hoosiers under the late Bill Mallory in 1994.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a very good player,\u201d Canada said. \u201cI met with coach Mallory, and it changed my life. I always wanted to be a coach. There was no doubt about that. I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to work out.\u201d\n\nNow, 24 years later, Canada is the acting head of the Maryland football team. Upon accepting the job as interim coach, he called Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley to ask how shift between calling the plays and directing the team.\n\n\u201cI got some great advice.

An Associated Press investigation shows that the diocese based in Sioux City, Iowa, quietly transferred Coyle to New Mexico for treatment after he acknowledged in 1986 that he had sexually abused roughly 50 Iowa boys over a 20-year period. (Reuben Ortiz via AP)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 A Roman Catholic diocese issued an apology Tuesday for covering up an Iowa priest\u2019s sexual abuse of boys for decades and promised to identify all priests who have faced credible allegations.\n\nThe actions by the Diocese of Sioux City come in response to an investigation by The Associated Press, which last week broke the church\u2019s 32-year silence on serial abuse by the Rev. Jerome Coyle.\n\nIn a lengthy statement Tuesday, the diocese said more disclosures of misconduct may be forthcoming. It urged all victims to come forward and vowed to use their reports and other files to create and publish a list of credibly accused priests \u2014 a step the diocese had long resisted.\n\nCoyle admitted to then-Bishop Lawrence Soens in 1986 to having sexually abused 50 boys over a 20-year period. The diocese said that it should have notified parishes and asked victims to come forward back then, and apologized that its former leaders failed to do so. Instead, the diocese sent Coyle to a treatment center for accused priests in New Mexico, where he lived and worked as a civilian for decades.\n\nThe diocese said that its current leadership should have notified the public this summer when Coyle was placed at a retirement home near a Catholic school, which he moved out of last week following AP\u2019s disclosure of his history. But the statement said that its bishop, R. Walker Nickless, \u201cinherited many issues from the past,\u201d including the challenging of finding housing for accused priests who were never charged and aren\u2019t listed as sex offenders.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do with these men? We know that you do not want them in your community. Many care facilities will not, or cannot, take them. Their families sometimes will take them in, but not always,\u201d said the statement, issued through diocese spokeswoman Susan O\u2019Brien.\n\nThe diocese indicated that other accused priests were sent for treatment, rather than investigated by police, and \u201cwe know now that is not the way to handle any allegation of sexual misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that the former bishop, Soens, is now 92 and lives in a Catholic retirement home in Sioux City. After retiring in 1998, he was accused of abusing boys when he was a priest and principal in the 1960s in Iowa City, and the Diocese of Davenport paid settlements to his accusers. The statement said that Soens has not faced any misconduct allegations stemming from his tenure in Sioux City.\n\nAs for Coyle, the diocese continues to pay his pension because he is entitled to those benefits by law, the statement said.", "", "", "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Giants rookie quarterback Kyle Lauletta apologized Tuesday morning, a week after he was arrested for motor vehicle violations near his home in Weehawken, N.J.\n\n\u201cFirst things first, I want to apologize to the New York Giants organization, my teammates, the fans and my family,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cThe incident that happened last week is a terrible representation of who I am and what I stand for. Right is right and wrong is wrong. My parents raised me better than that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Weehawken police accounts, Lauletta, the Giants\u2019 fourth-round pick from Richmond, was driving his 2017 Jaguar on Tuesday morning, Oct. 30, when he was stopped for failing to obey a police officer\u2019s order to continue driving straight.\n\nThe report says Lauletta almost hit a police officer while making an illegal turn. He was stopped by a second police officer and refused to produce a driver\u2019s license or exit the car.\n\nThe incident happened close to renovations near the Lincoln Tunnel, which connects New Jersey with midtown Manhattan.\n\nPolice say he was arrested and charged with eluding police, obstructing administration of law and resisting arrest. He was also charged with reckless driving, disregarding an officer\u2019s directions, improper turn and failure to remain in a marked lane.\n\nPolice said Lauletta\u2019s car was involved in a similar incident Monday, but summons were mailed because the vehicle did not stay at the scene.\n\nThe Giants were on their bye week, so he did not have to report to any organized practices until Tuesday.\n\nAfter practice, Lauletta said he was apologetic about the incident.\n\n\u201cI understand the cops have a very tough job and it was very chaotic at that location,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cI respect these officers and I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m sorry enough. I have to prove myself worthy through my work ethic and put it all behind me. That\u2019s all I can control and I hope to move forward from this.\u201d\n\nGiants coach Pat Shurmur said that Lauletta will not face any suspension for his actions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being handled internally,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed with the way it went down. I spoke to Kyle and this is not the way we want our players to act. The whole incident is disappointing. He\u2019s back to work today and we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\n\nShurmur said that Lauletta\u2019s problems with the police stemmed from him being late for meetings prior to practices both Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, quarterbacks should be early,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cHe\u2019s working to be in a position to play. There is a lot to learn in order to prepare to play in the NFL.\u201d\n\nLauletta said that he immediately spoke with Shurmur after his arrest.\n\n\u201cI know he was disappointed and I know I can\u2019t put myself in that situation again,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cI have to deal with the consequences.\u201d\n\nIn other quarterback news, Shurmur also said that Eli Manning will remain the starter for Monday night\u2019s game against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s starting Monday with the idea that he is going to get us on a run here and win some games,\u201d said Shurmur, whose team is 1-7.\n\nVeteran Alex Tanney has been listed as the No. 2 quarterback on the Giants\u2019 depth chart all season. There was a possibility Lauletta would be given the opportunity to start a few games once the Giants were out of playoff contention. Now, Lauletta\u2019s chances to start have greatly diminished with this arrest.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I thought of was that I was leaving (home) later that I should have,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault. I will take this as a lesson. I can\u2019t put myself in these situations moving forward. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m worried about (not getting the chance to play). I can\u2019t afford to worry about it. I just have to do everything I can to prove that I can play. I\u2019m going to give it everything I have, keep my head down and keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nLauletta said that he did not want to \u201ctalk about the details of the incident,\u201d especially after he was asked about going through the same traffic pattern illegally two days in a row.\n\n\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cI know that. It\u2019s a horrible feeling. I stand with what happened. I made a decision I\u2019ll regret for the rest of my life. I have to show up early every day from now on. Hopefully, this all will be part of my past and I\u2019ll never allow what happened to happen ever again. I woke up late and put myself in that situation.\u201d\n\nLauletta said that he has spoken with Manning about the incident.\n\n\u201cEli has always been supportive of me,\u201d Lauletta said. \u201cHe\u2019s there for me. Right now, my goal, my main focus is to help Eli.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Giants announced that rookie defensive tackle R.J. McIntosh, the team\u2019s fifth-round draft pick out of Miami, has been cleared to play and will be activated in time to play Monday night. A roster spot will have to be created for McIntosh, who has been on the team\u2019s non-football illness list. McIntosh\u2019s illness has yet to be addressed. ... Shurmur also said that offensive guard Jamon Brown, acquired via waivers from the Los Angeles Rams last week, will more than likely be activated and see action. Brown could actually be a starter at guard if he can learn quickly in practice this week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this Nov. 1, 2018, file photo, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Nick Mullens throws a pass against the Oakland Raiders during the first half of an NFL football game in Santa Clara, Calif.

The murder conviction carries a mandatory prison sentence of life without parole.\n\nKoehn had blamed his son\u2019s mother for the death of 4-month-old Sterling Koehn. A trial is pending for the 21-year-old mother, Cheyanne Harris.\n\nKoehn and Harris were arrested after medics were called to an Alta Vista apartment on Aug. 30, 2017, and found the infant dead in a swing in a dark, sweltering back bedroom. An autopsy showed he\u2019d died of malnutrition, dehydration and an E. coli infection caused by being left in a maggot-infested diaper for up to two weeks.\n\nKoehn\u2019s defense team had argued that he had entrusted care of the baby to Harris, saying he had been working 70 to 80 hours a week as a trucker to provide for his family. His attorneys said Koehn simply failed to notice signs that Harris may have been suffering from depression, which kept her from caring for the baby.\n\nBut prosecutors argued that Koehn was a meth user who also provided Harris with drugs.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Denise Timmins told jurors that Koehn was home often enough to know that the baby wasn\u2019t being cared for and did nothing to help him.\n\n\u201cHe let Sterling rot in that room. He left him there to die,\u201d Timmins said.\n\nKoehn\u2019s trial was moved from Chickasaw County to Henry County to counter pretrial publicity in the case.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, http://www.wcfcourier.com", "Nov. 4, 2018\n\nThe (Champaign) News-Gazette\n\nCan it get worse? Oh, yeah!\n\nThe light at the end of the budget tunnel is a train that\u2019s picking up speed.\n\nAn editorial published Oct. 28 and headlined \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d made the argument that Tuesday\u2019s election would mark an end of the political happy talk that characterizes campaign seasons and put the state\u2019s serious financial problems back on the radar screen.\n\nIt was a pessimistic discussion of the financial challenges that lie directly ahead \u2014 $130 billion in underfunded pensions, a string of deficit state budgets going back to the early 2000s, unpaid bills that total $6.9 billion, as of Friday, and politicians who have made a long-standing habit of doing their best to avoid those issues.\n\nThis being Illinois, it turns out that the pessimistic prognosis was too optimistic.\n\nIt suggested reality would intrude after the Tuesday election. Instead, it didn\u2019t wait that long to bang down the door.\n\nLast week, the executive director of the Teachers Retirement System announced the General Assembly will have to make $4.8 billion in contributions to the TRS for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2019.\n\nThat\u2019s a roughly $400 million increase over what the legislature appropriated last year to TRS.\n\nIf that sum isn\u2019t enough to curl a reader\u2019s hair, get a load of what else Richard Ingram had to say. He noted that the $4.8 billion is the statutorily required contribution and the actuarial contribution level should be nearly $7.8 billion.\n\nSo that\u2019s one step forward and two steps back?\n\n\u201cTRS investments had a good year, but we cannot invest our way out of this problem. The unfunded liability is too large and grows every year,\u201d he said.\n\nLet\u2019s put that proposed spending in context.\n\nLast year, the General Assembly passed a $38.5 billion budget that was described as balanced. In fact, it was not balanced, for a variety of reasons actually running an estimated $1.2 billion deficit.\n\nThe $4.4 billion TRS contribution in that budget represented about 11 percent of the total.\n\nThe TRS is just one of five underfunded pension systems. Public pensions represent just a small piece of the state\u2019s overall obligations that include education, roads, social services, law enforcement, prisons and on and on. Every budget constituency will want more in the upcoming budget year.\n\nMeanwhile, if Democrat J.B. Pritzker is elected governor, as the polls suggest, he has promised to bring to the budget table a variety of new social-spending programs that include, among other costly things, state-provided health insurance.\n\nGiven the state\u2019s low unemployment rate and the strong national economy that is benefiting Illinois, the state should enjoy a strong increase in revenue, particularly considering last year\u2019s increase in the state income tax to 4.95 percent.\n\nBut the question is whether those new revenues will be consumed by the growing demands for existing programs at the same time the state already is awash in debt.\n\nThat, in fact, is putting it too kindly. Illinois is effectively bankrupt, although it can\u2019t file for legal bankruptcy.\n\nThe new budget year is eight months away. But state officials will start laying the groundwork far ahead of the start date \u2014 July 1.\n\nThat\u2019s why Ingram put down his marker last week. Others will follow. Bit by bit, they\u2019ll generate a flood that crushes everything in its path.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound too appetizing, does it? People can only hope this new round of pessimism, like the last one, isn\u2019t too optimistic.\n\n___\n\nNov. 3, 2018\n\n(Decatur) Herald & Review\n\nRead the new labels for health\n\nMost of us reach adulthood with an educated idea about what kinds of food are \u201cgood\u201d for you.\n\nBut as a species, we\u2019re still primitive in the manner of understanding how the things we put in our bodies affect and impact our physiology. Ongoing analysis brings different concerns to bear, and how we group specific foods changes, sometimes often. Ask a dozen different people the last thing they\u2019ve heard about how we should consume such dietary staples as eggs, coffee and wine and you may get a dozen different answers. Unless we\u2019re dieticians, we all struggle with keeping up with changes.\n\nSo the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is revamping its definition of \u201chealthy.\u201d The new definition, the FDA says, will reflect changes in what experts think about our diet. But it\u2019s a tricky path to maneuver.\n\nThe guidelines haven\u2019t changed since 1994, an eternity when it comes to food science. As the link between dietary cholesterol and heart disease became unclear and the dangers of some fats came to the fore, warnings began to change, and again, we as a general public became confused about what was \u201cbest\u201d for us to eat.\n\nThe focus of the most recent FDA changes are sugars, total calorie count and vitamin reporting.\n\nSugars are a huge concern. Additional sugar generally affects the way the body processes and stores nutrients and calories. An excess can lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes. The calorie counts will now clearly reflect the total calories in the packaging, eliminating the nebulous use of \u201cper serving.\u201d Vitamins A and C will no longer be listed on the labels, because research shows Americans rarely are deficient in those vitamins anymore. Tracking Vitamin D and potassium levels is presently more important, so those will be tracked on food labels.\n\nAmid these changes, companies are trying to get their products labeled as \u201chealthy.\u201d Water is not officially healthy, according to the FDA, because the current definition of \u201chealthy\u201d requires a product have at least some sort of presence of nutrients. On the flip side, sugar-free gum makers are arguing since their product has no fat and no sugar, they are \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nThe limits of our present understanding still prompt uncertainty. Saturated fat is the current miscreant on our menu. But according to Harvard Health, replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats or high-fiber carbohydrates is the \u201cbest bet for reducing the risk of heart disease\u201d but that also \u201ccould do the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe key is we have to make the commitment ourselves. We know what foods are \u201cgood\u201d for us. The revised labels can help us refine our diets to get closer to our ideal intake. But all the nutrition information in the world can\u2019t help us if we\u2019re not willing to look at what is literally in front of us.\n\n___\n\nNov. 1, 2018\n\nChicago Tribune\n\nThree months after Chicago\u2019s most violent weekend, the trail grows colder\n\nIn just 18 hours last Sunday, gunfire struck 26 people in South and West Side neighborhoods. Over the entire weekend, 42 were shot and five died, including a 16-year-old boy.\n\nAppalling? Yes. But if you\u2019ve been reading the Tribune\u2019s continuing examination of another weekend\u2019s carnage, you know this wasn\u2019t even the most violent outburst of the year.\n\nThat grim distinction belongs to the first weekend in August, when at least 41 people were shot over seven hours. In all, 75 people fell to gun violence that weekend, and 13 died.\n\nMany of these shootings likely were gang-related attacks that miss the intended target and hit innocent bystanders.\n\nThis slaughter on the streets is Chicago\u2019s tragedy. Just as tragic: Most of the people who pull the triggers get away with it. They\u2019ll never be caught. They\u2019ll be free to menace neighborhoods again and again.\n\nWhy? Because the Chicago Police Department has a dismal clearance rate. That\u2019s the measure of how often police solve homicides. For 2018 killings so far, the rate is about 17 percent, the department says. That\u2019s about the same as the 2017 rate, which was the lowest recorded in years.\n\nFor nonfatal shootings, the rate dips to 6.5 percent in 2018, compared to 7.2 percent for all of 2017. The odds of getting caught overwhelmingly favor criminals.\n\nTo better understand why police fail to arrest killers so often, the Tribune is tracking CPD\u2019s investigations of those 75 cases in August. The police arrest tally from that weekend is paltry so far: Chicago authorities filed the first murder charge in late September. Two other suspects have been charged in separate cases in which the gunshot victims didn\u2019t die. That\u2019s it. Three people charged in 75 cases.\n\nThe longer the remaining cases go unresolved, the colder the trail grows. Many will never be solved. That will leave a lot of violent criminals on the loose, reloaded and ready to splash more blood on the streets.\n\nWe know police have a hard job to do. By keeping tabs on arrests in these 75 shootings, Tribune reporters hope to learn more about the challenge of solving these crimes and how unsolved shootings affect violence-racked neighborhoods.\n\nAmong the Tribune\u2019s most troubling findings so far: The CPD clearance rate for homicide has been declining in recent years. There are many contributing factors. Chicago detectives often juggle large caseloads and gang-inspired shootings can be the most difficult to solve. Victims may fear retaliation and won\u2019t cooperate. Witnesses may not trust the police.\n\nReversing that trend \u2014 building trust in those communities \u2014 is vital to stopping the slaughter. Arresting, charging and jailing shooters at a greater rate would be a deterrent.", "TUKWILA, Wash.

Sinema is facing Republican Martha McSally in the race to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring. (AP Photo/Bob Christie)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Republicans filed a lawsuit Wednesday night to challenge the way some Arizona counties count mail-in ballots as election officials began to slowly tally more than 600,000 outstanding votes in the narrow U.S. Senate race -- a task that could take days.\n\nRepublican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema were separated by a small fraction of the 1.7 million tabulated votes.\n\nAbout 75 percent of Arizona voters cast ballots by mail, but those ballots have to go through the laborious signature confirmation process, and only then can be opened and tabulated. If county recorders have issues verifying signatures they are allowed to ask voters to verify their identity.\n\nThe suit filed Wednesday by four county Republican parties alleges that the state\u2019s 15 county recorders don\u2019t follow a uniform standard for allowing voters to adjust problems with their mail-in ballots, and that two counties improperly allow those fixes after Election Day.\n\nThe GOP complained about the issue before Election Day and threatened to sue. Democrats alleged it was attempted voter suppression and that recorders have followed the same procedures for years with no issues. Republicans said it was about following the law and having a timely ballot count.\n\nThe sluggish count is a perennial issue for Arizona, but has rarely received such a high level of attention because the GOP-leaning state generally has had few nationally-watched nail-biting contests.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that signature verification must stop when polls close, and seeks an injunction to stop the counting of such ballots that have been verified after then. It\u2019s unclear how many of these votes still remain outstanding, but the suit singles out the state\u2019s two biggest urban counties, the center of support for Sinema. It says the two counties allow voters to help clear up signature problems up to five days after the election.\n\nDemocrats believe the uncounted urban ballots dropped off shortly before Election Day favors Sinema.\n\nThe lawsuit is scheduled to be heard Friday, after the next release late Thursday of tallied ballots.\n\nIt\u2019s one window into the complexities of mail ballots and the so-called \u201clate earlies\u201d that arrive just before Election Day and regularly gum up the state\u2019s vote counting system.\n\nThis election featured heavy statewide turnout of about 60 percent, more in line with a presidential election than a midterm \u2014 part of the reason county registrars were overloaded with uncounted ballots.\n\nOne candidate familiar with the long wait is McSally. It took The Associated Press 12 days to name her as the loser of her first congressional race in 2012 because the margin was so narrow and vote counting was slow. McSally\u2019s second and successful bid for the seat ended with a recount in December of 2014, more than one month after the election.\n\nMcSally tweeted early Wednesday that she was going \u201cto bed with a lead of over 14,000 votes.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe\u2019re confident tomorrow will bring more good news.\u201d\n\nSinema tweeted that the \u201crace is about you and we\u2019re going to make sure your vote is counted. There are a lot of outstanding ballots \u2014 especially those mailed-in \u2014 and a lot of reasons to feel good!\u201d\n\nThe cliffhanger Senate race comes in what\u2019s otherwise shaping up to be another banner Arizona year for Republicans. The GOP has won every statewide race in Arizona over the past decade, and Democrats were hoping Sinema could break that streak.\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey was easily re-elected over a challenge from Democrat David Garcia, a professor. The GOP notched victories in the attorney general, treasurer and secretary of state races as well.\n\nThe picture was brighter for the state\u2019s Democrats in Congress, where Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick was elected to the Tucson-area swing district seat vacated by McSally and Democrats held all their other four seats, giving them a majority of the state\u2019s nine-member U.S. House delegation.\n\nThe Senate contest was the marquee race, featuring two champion fundraisers who are no strangers to tight races. They are battling over the seat vacated by Sen. Jeff Flake, a Republican who decided not to run for re-election because he realized his criticism of President Donald Trump made it impossible for him to survive politically.\n\nMcSally and Sinema have both remade themselves politically. McSally, 52, is a onetime Trump critic who has embraced the president since his election. She has tried to rally Republican voters by emphasizing her military background as the first U.S. female combat pilot while touting her support for the president\u2019s tax cut and other parts of his agenda.\n\nSinema, 42, is a former Green Party activist who became a Democratic centrist with her first election to the House of Representatives in 2012.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "BATON ROUGE, La.

(AP Photo/AJ Mast)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa entered the season\u2019s midway point looking like the most skilled team in the Big Ten West.\n\nConsecutive road losses to Penn State and Purdue have left the Hawkeyes likely playing just for pride and a decent bowl bid.\n\nIowa (6-3, 3-3 Big Ten), which has often been known for getting the most out of oft-modest talent under longtime coach Kirk Ferentz, sits at just .500 in the league and out of this week\u2019s Top 25 despite a cadre of future pros on its roster.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for us moving forward right now is moving forward. That takes mental toughness. We can\u2019t be looking back or worry about the what-ifs,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cCircumstances are always changing...it really gets down to your ability to focus on what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nThe Hawkeyes, whose point differential remains higher than the team that was 9-0 at this point three years ago, hosts Northwestern (5-4, 5-1) on Saturday. They\u2019re favored to win by 10 points \u2014 despite trailing by two games in the standings \u2014 in a last-ditch effort to remain relevant in the West.\n\n\u201cWe just want to play our best football,\u201d senior Iowa defensive end Parker Hesse said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to this team that we\u2019ve stuck together. We\u2019ve had two really tough losses in a row now. But no one is pointing fingers. No one is looking to blame anyone else.\u201d\n\nThese Hawkeyes might be one of Ferentz\u2019s most gifted teams, but they\u2019re also one of his most frustrating given that all three of their losses were winnable late in the fourth quarter. A few penalties that could\u2019ve gone either way didn\u2019t help their cause in last week\u2019s 38-36 loss at Purdue.\n\nBut Iowa has put itself in such last-minute peril in part because it can\u2019t run the ball \u2014 and thus control the tempo \u2014 like it has in the past.\n\nThe Hawkeyes have three sophomore running backs who\u2019ve looked at times like solid Big Ten starters. But they\u2019re also just 79th nationally with 157 yards a game on the ground.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Iowa hasn\u2019t tried to establish the run, attempting about 40 rushes a game. But the Hawkeyes\u2019 paltry 3.9 yards per carry \u2014 and the fact that they\u2019ve yet to spring a back for a 100-yard game \u2014 has put extra pressure on junior quarterback Nate Stanley to carry them.\n\nStanley has just one TD throw in his last two games after a recent stretch of 14 in just four.\n\n\u201cWe want to strive for 4.5 (yards per carry). Or at least four,\u201d center Keegan Render said. \u201cThere are just a couple of (missed assignments) that you can\u2019t have this late in the season.\u201d\n\nIowa\u2019s defense has hit a rough patch after a strong start too, allowing 30 points in a six-point loss to the Nittany Lions and 38 last week at West Lafayette. Even though the Hawkeyes still rank second-best in the Big Ten in scoring defense, those performances prompted a team meeting by that unit \u2014 one led by its senior leaders.\n\n\u201cI think some young guys, after two straight losses, they kind of lose sight of what we\u2019re trying to do, which is to go to work every day and get better and win games,\u201d end Sam Brincks said.\n\nDespite the fact that bragging rights and a sunny postseason trip are likely all the Hawkeyes have left on the table, there\u2019s a strong possibility that they\u2019ll end the regular season on a high note.\n\nAfter hosting the Wildcats, Iowa might also be a double-digit favorite in its last two games \u2014 at Illinois and at home against Nebraska on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only three, four possessions away from being undefeated.

Rules officials around the world have little time to learn a new set of rules effective Jan. 1. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)\n\nSlugger White spent three weeks in Asia as the lead rules official for PGA Tour events. He is officiating in Mexico this week at the Mayakoba Classic, and then he heads to Australia the week of Thanksgiving for his final event of the year, the World Cup.\n\nAnd then? He has four weeks to get up to speed on the largest overhaul of rules in golf history.\n\nWhite is among hundreds of rules officials worldwide who face a crash course on the modernized Rules of Golf that take effect Jan. 1. The modernized rules, which took more than five years to develop, were announced in early March. But the majority of officials did not get a head start on studying the changes for fear they might rely on 2019 rules at 2018 tournaments.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many differences,\u201d White said Tuesday from Mexico. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of tugged along on little things, but on a weekly basis, we don\u2019t want to confuse ourselves. The embedded ball is going to be different next year. It\u2019s one club length. Now it\u2019s drop as near as you can.\u201d\n\nTour officials typically go to USGA rules workshops in the fall, and they\u2019ve had half-day seminars every four years to go over any changes to the Rules of Golf. Now, however, officials from various tours plan an intensive two-day session with the USGA the second week in December.\n\nWhite said the USGA would be at five PGA Tour events to start next year.\n\nThe modernized rules were developed to make them easier to understand and to apply. Among the more drastic changes are penalty drops from knee-high height (instead of shoulder height) and eliminating penalties for balls that move accidentally on the green or clubs that touch the ground in a hazard. Also, players will be allowed to leave the pin in the hole while on the green and repair spike marks.\n\nMissy Jones on the LPGA Tour finished up the qualifying series last week and, like White, said she didn\u2019t study the new rules sooner because \u201cit\u2019s hard to look at those and officiate under 2018 rules.\u201d\n\nShe recalled one instance when a player removed a boundary stake that was impeding her swing.\n\n\u201cI was thinking that next year she would have a chance to put it back (before hitting her shot),\u201d Jones said. In this case, the player was docked two shots.\n\nThe toughest aspect for rules official is adapting to 24 rules instead of 36. They could recite rules by numbers, and that will make it particularly difficult on someone like White, who has been a rules official for 37 years.\n\n\u201cAn unplayable ball is no longer (Rule) 28,\u201d White said. Next year that falls under Rule 19.\n\nJones said recreational golfers won\u2019t have to worry about citing numbers, and the modernized rules will be easier to understand.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s erase the hard drive and start over,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just them. Jones said she handed out a 16-page booklet with highlights of the major changes to players in the scoring area at the LPGA qualifying series last week. The PGA Tour plans to distribute information and videos to players after its year ends Nov. 18 at the RSM Classic.\n\nMUSICAL CHAIRS\n\nJustin Rose had reason to celebrate his second time reaching No. 1 in the world because he got there by winning the Turkish Airlines Open.\n\nBut the celebration is short.\n\nBrooks Koepka replaces him at No. 1 next week with neither of them playing. And thus continues what amounts to musical chairs atop the world ranking in 2018, the most volatile \u2014 for now \u2014 since 1997.\n\nRose, Koepka, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have taken turns at No. 1 this year, the most since Greg Norman, Tom Lehman, Tiger Woods and Ernie Els each got to No. 1 during 1997. There were eight changes at the top in 1997, and next week will be the eighth change in 2018.\n\nThere could be more.\n\nKoepka has one more tournament this year. He defends his title in the Dunlop Phoenix on the Japan Golf Tour on Nov. 15-18. Rose is expected to play two more events, the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas the week after Thanksgiving and his title defense in the Indonesia Masters in Jakarta on Dec. 13-16.\n\nThey are the only two who can reach No. 1 the rest of the year. Johnson is not expected to play again until Kapalua, and Thomas would appear to be too far back even if he wins his final event of the year in the Bahamas.\n\nUS OPEN QUALIFIER\n\nThanks to the change in the PGA Tour schedule, players now can qualify for the U.S. Open in four countries.\n\nThere already was a 36-hole sectional qualifier in England for European Tour players and in Japan for players from various Asian tours. Because the Canadian Open is the week before the U.S. Open next year, the USGA is scouting golf courses near the Toronto area to have a 36-hole qualifier on the Monday ahead of the Canadian Open.\n\nPreviously, that qualifier was held in Memphis, Tennessee, ahead of the FedEx St. Jude Classic, which next year becomes a World Golf Championship in late July.\n\nFATHERS AND SONS\n\nJim Furyk\u2019s father is the only coach he has ever had. Mike Furyk now gets to be his partner.\n\nFuryk is among four newcomers to the PNC Father-Son Challenge, which will be held Dec. 15-16 at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, Florida. Others playing for the first time are Darren Clarke and David Toms with their sons, and Matt Kuchar with his father.\n\nPlayers must have won a major or The Players Championship to be eligible, and their partner must not hold a PGA Tour card. Davis Love III is playing with his son, Dru, who has played 11 times on the PGA Tour on sponsor exemptions as he starts his career.\n\n\u201cMy entire golf career has been a family affair and my dad has been there every step of the way,\u201d Furyk said. \u201cHe has taught me so many lessons about life and my golf swing, so to have this opportunity to team up with him is nothing short of a dream come true.\u201d\n\nAngel Cabrera and his son, Angel Jr., are the defending champions.\n\nJack Nicklaus returns with this grandson, G.T., who in April gave his grandfather one of his greatest thrills by making a hole-in-one during the Par 3 Tournament at the Masters.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The City Council in Spokane, Washington, has passed an ordinance prohibiting police from selling confiscated firearms, citing an Associated Press investigation that found that some guns sold by law enforcement were used in new crimes.\n\n\u201cDisposing of long guns and assault rifles is a sensible approach,\u201d Councilwoman Candace Mumm told The Associated Press in an email after the 6-1 vote on Monday night. \u201cInstead of spending time recycling weapons, our police staff can get back to the primary mission of solving crimes and protecting the public.\u201d\n\nThe Spokane Police Department has sold 311 firearms since 2011, spokesman Officer John O\u2019Brien said. The AP investigation went back to 2010, which included 25 sold that year and brought Spokane\u2019s total to 336 since 2010. The department sold its confiscated long guns through an auction house in Post Falls, Idaho, he said. The agency had been destroying forfeited handguns under an ordinance passed in 1993.\n\nThe Spokane City Council is the second political entity to order a ban on law enforcement gun sales, citing the AP\u2019s investigation into 6,000 guns sold by law enforcement between 2010 and 2017.\n\nThe Metropolitan King County Council passed an ordinance on Oct. 2 that prohibits the sheriff\u2019s office from selling forfeited firearms.\n\n\u201cWhile the practice of selling these firearms back into private hands is legal, a yearlong Associated Press analysis published in January 2018 found more than a dozen firearms sold by law enforcement agencies in Washington since 2010 later became evidence in new criminal investigations,\u201d the council said in its report supporting the ordinance. \u201cThe report noted that weapons auctioned by the Washington State Patrol, Kitsap, Pierce and Thurston counties and the Aberdeen, Bonney Lake and Longview police departments were used in the commission of crimes or to commit suicide.\u201d\n\nThe King County Sheriff\u2019s office has been destroying forfeited guns, but the ordinance ensures that practice continues, Council Chair Joe McDermott said.\n\nThe guns sold by Spokane police included Winchester .22-caliber rifles, Remington 12-gauge shotguns, a Colt AR-15, a Bulgarian-made AK47-style rifle, a \u201cRomar assault rifle\u201d and several Norinco SKS, 7.62 x 39 mm semi-automatic rifles. One of the Norincos sold for $180, according to police records.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2018, the forfeited firearms sales generated $16,787, according to the ordinance. The sales ranged from $633 to about $7,488 in any given year, the ordinance said.\n\n\u201cThe books show just a few thousand dollars a year are netted out after paying for the auction fees and the 10 percent fee to the state,\u201d Mumm said before the vote. \u201cThis amount does not take into account the expenses that are incurred by the police department for staff time to secure, catalog, process, transport and document the weapons. Nor does it account for the trade and fund balances.\n\n\u201cWe may actually be costing the city coffers by reselling and recycling the guns.\u201d\n\nSeveral members of the public spoke against the ordinance based on their support for the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. But Phyllis Holmes, who was on the Spokane City Council when it passed the original measure requiring the destruction of handguns, supported the plan.\n\nWhen the council passed that ordinance 6-1 in 1993, it conveyed the panel\u2019s \u201cdetermination to reduce the level of violent crime associated with firearms,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cCircumstances were a little different then. We didn\u2019t see on the streets the kinds of weapons that we now see.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has troubled me the past few years that we didn\u2019t include all guns,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cWe perhaps weren\u2019t thinking forward enough in terms of what might happen. Passage of this measure tonight would bring consistency to our position on the management of confiscated weapons.\u201d\n\nWithout further discussion, the council passed the ordinance, which states: \u201cThe City of Spokane intends to do all it can to prevent and reduce violent crime in Spokane and has determined that destroying all seized or forfeited firearms rather than reselling them to the public or to gun dealers is a simple, sensible and effective way to reduce access to firearms and help reduce and prevent gun violence.\u201d", "Man accused of threatening to shoot up polling place\n\nWASHINGTON, Pa.

The verdict against the Bangladeshi immigrant was returned on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Manhattan federal court. (New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission via AP, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A Bangladeshi immigrant was convicted Tuesday of setting off a pipe bomb in New York City\u2019s busiest subway station, disputing in court that he was supporting the Islamic State group and saying he was instead motivated by anger at President Donald Trump.\n\nThe unusual outburst by Akayed Ullah, who was convicted in Manhattan federal court of supporting the terrorist group, capped a trial in which the defense maintained he intended to kill only himself last Dec. 11. Nobody died, and most of the injuries were not serious.\n\nProsecutors said Ullah sought to maim or kill commuters in response to calls for \u201clone wolf\u201d terrorist attacks by the terror group. Just after jurors walked out, Ullah announced he had something to say and repeatedly insisted he did not act on the Islamic State group\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cI was angry with Donald Trump because he says he will bomb the Middle East and then he will protect his nation. So I said: \u2018Donald Trump, you cannot do like this.\u2019 Nobody likes bombing, your honor.\u201d\n\nJudge Richard J. Sullivan told him: \u201cRight now is not the time for a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour honor, you heard what the government is trying to do. They are trying to put me in the group, which I don\u2019t support, your honor,\u201d Ullah told Sullivan.\n\n\u201cMr. Ullah, now is not the time for this,\u201d said the judge, who set sentencing for April 5. Ullah faces a mandatory 30-year prison sentence and could be sent to prison for life.\n\nHearing about Ullah\u2019s new claims, juror Linda Artis told reporters Ullah could have swayed some jurors by taking the witness stand.\n\n\u201cHe did it. The big question was why,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a lot of it couldn\u2019t be answered because he didn\u2019t testify. That was the big hang-up for me.\u201d\n\nArtis, 38, of Manhattan, said she worried some vague laws might allow a lot of people to be \u201clabeled a terrorist if they are just a random whack job.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said the Election Day verdict on Ullah\u2019s attempt to make a political statement with deadly violence \u201cfittingly underscores the core principles of American democracy and spirit: Americans engage in the political process through votes, not violence.\u201d\n\nAt trial, prosecutors said Ullah would not have worn a bomb had he wanted to kill only himself. They cited Ullah\u2019s social media postings and said he told an investigator: \u201cI did it for the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nThe weeklong trial featured surveillance video of Ullah the morning when his pipe bomb barely exploded, seriously burning him in a corridor beneath Times Square and the Port Authority bus terminal, where most subway lines converge.\n\nUllah, 28, of Brooklyn, was confronted with his post-arrest statements and his social media comments, such as when he taunted Trump on Facebook before the attack.\n\nWithin hours of Ullah\u2019s blast, Trump was assailing the immigration system that had allowed Ullah \u2014 and multitudes of law-abiding Bangladeshis \u2014 to enter the U.S.\n\nUllah got an entry visa in 2011 because he had an uncle who was already a U.S. citizen. Trump said allowing foreigners to follow relatives to the U.S. was \u201cincompatible with national security.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said Ullah\u2019s radicalization began in 2014 when he started viewing materials online, including a video instructing Islamic State supporters to carry out attacks in their homelands.\n\nIn closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney George Turner said Ullah told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to avenge U.S. aggression toward the Islamic State group and had chosen a busy weekday morning to attack so he could terrorize as many people as possible.\n\nUllah\u2019s attorney, Amy Gallicchio, told jurors Ullah was not a terrorist and wanted to die alone.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley disputed that.\n\n\u201cIt was about martyrdom, not suicide,\u201d she said.", "CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 The Reds hired Turner Ward from the Dodgers as their hitting coach on Tuesday, their second significant addition under new manager David Bell.\n\nCincinnati also hired Derek Johnson from Milwaukee as its pitching coach. The Dodgers and Brewers played in the NL Championship Series, with Los Angeles advancing to the World Series for the second straight year and losing to Boston.\n\nWard spent the last three seasons as the Dodgers\u2019 hitting coach. They set club records for homers, extra-base hits and slugging percentage each of the last two seasons. The Dodgers led the NL with 235 homers last season.\n\nWard is from Alabama and was attracted to the Reds\u2019 job in part because it would get him closer to home.\n\n\u201cThe vision of what they\u2019re trying to do, I can see it,\u201d Ward said on a conference call. \u201cI\u2019ve been impressed with their offense. Also, add the logistics of being closer to home. Family is very important to me and it made it hard being in LA.\u201d\n\nThe Reds finished eighth in the NL in runs and ninth in homers despite playing in one of its most hitter-friendly ballparks. They batted only .227 with runners in scoring position after the All-Star break, contributing to another losing season. The rebuilding Reds have dropped 98, 94, 94 and 95 games in the last four years, their worst such slump since the 1930s.\n\nBell knew Ward from their playing days and spent hours on Sunday talking to him about his hitting philosophy. Ward played 12 seasons in the majors with Cleveland, Toronto, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Arizona and Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out this was a possibility, I immediately got excited about it,\u201d Bell said. \u201cTo Turner\u2019s credit, he was willing to spend basically the entire day with me.\u201d\n\nThe Reds fired manager Bryan Price after a 3-15 start and decided not to retain interim manager Jim Riggleman. Dick Williams, the president of baseball operations, said the Reds wanted to go outside the organization in its next step of rebuilding.\n\n\u201cWe went into the offseason committed to putting new leadership in place in the clubhouse, and interested in seeing where that would take us,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe thought some new voices in the clubhouse and a variety of perspectives coming in from other organizations would be a good thing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Orlando Magic's Mohamed Bamba (5) fouls Cleveland Cavaliers' Sam Dekker who goes up to shoot during the first half of an NBA basketball game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Orlando, Fla.

(AP Photo/Gary Cameron, File)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 When No. 24 Michigan State hosts No. 8 Ohio State, the Spartans will be leaning on an Ohio guy.\n\nMiddle linebacker Joe Bachie spearheads Michigan State\u2019s top-ranked defense. He is the team\u2019s leading tackler and an unquestioned leader. His work ethic and preparation are exemplary.\n\nIn fact, the player from Brook Park, Ohio, reminds Spartans coach Mark Dantonio of a Buckeyes star from the 1980s.\n\n\u201cI go back and I look at all the players that we\u2019ve been around in the past years. And not to disrespect anybody that\u2019s been here, but Chris Spielman to me is a guy that when I was at Ohio State as a graduate assistant, he was just coming in as a freshman,\u201d Dantonio said.\n\n\u201cThat guy was watching film every day. That guy was playing 100 miles an hour on field during practice. He had good motor, he had good skills, great skill set, as well. And I see that in Joe Bachie. ... He\u2019s an athlete in a variety of sports, I\u2019ve said that many times, and also he prepares and he gets himself ready to go. And he\u2019s a great leader, as well. People sort of follow him or he rubs off on people, however you take it.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans do follow Bachie, last week\u2019s Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week. He leads by example and by words. Co-captain Khari Willis says Bachuie \u201cwalks the talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can sense when someone\u2019s real, and someone\u2019s genuine. As a co-leader with him, that\u2019s something that I admire about him,\u201d Willis said. \u201cJoe gets out there, he speaks his mind, and he goes and performs. The way he is, the things he does on the field, it\u2019s very, very rare that you have a personality to match that.\u201d\n\nBachie isn\u2019t old enough to remember Spielman, so the comparisons don\u2019t mean as much to older fans. Spielman, now a broadcaster, was a two-time All-American middle linebacker, Lombardi Award winner and College Hall of Famer. He went on to earn All-Pro honors with the Detroit Lions in a 10-year NFL career.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I never really watched him. . I watched (Ohio State linebacker James Laurinaitis) when I was younger. He was somebody that, on Saturday, I\u2019d get excited to watch,\u201d said Bachie, who grew up an Ohio State fan, and still has some of his childhood Buckeyes gear stashed away in a box somewhere.\n\nTo Bachie and 27 other Ohio-born Spartans, this game means more than most, meaning that last year\u2019s 48-3 loss stings.\n\n\u201cI think about it a little bit because I\u2019m from Ohio. I\u2019ve got buddies of mine who will rag on me a little bit because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we just know we\u2019ve got to play better, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to do.\n\n\u201cA little something extra, just like the Michigan game to a lot of the Michigan guys, this Ohio State game is a big game for me. I grew up an Ohio State fan most of my whole life basically, until high school, and all my buddies back home, my family, friends \u2014 they\u2019re Ohio State people.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Start them right away? Ease \u2019em in? Have them sit a whole season?\n\nWhen it comes to developing young quarterbacks in the NFL, it all depends on who you talk to.\n\nSome teams think it\u2019s best to throw rookie QBs into the fire to learn on the job. Others prefer to gradually work them into the offense. Some say it\u2019s more beneficial to have them grab a cap and clipboard and take it all in from the sideline.\n\n\u201cI think every position is the same,\u201d Jets offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates said. \u201cIf someone can\u2019t handle it mentally, then you don\u2019t want to put them on the field, because naturally they\u2019ll play slower and be thinking instead of reacting.\u201d\n\nSam Darnold clearly passed that test for New York, and the No. 3 overall pick in April was under center to start the season.\n\n\u201cIf a player shows the athletic ability, the talent and has the mental capacity to handle a gameplan and go into a game and be successful,\u201d Bates said, \u201cthen he\u2019s ready to play.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean things have necessarily gone smoothly for the former USC star.\n\nDarnold\u2019s 14 interceptions lead the league and have contributed to the Jets\u2019 3-6 start. So have his 55.0 percent completion rate and 68.3 quarterback rating, which also rank among the worst in the league.\n\nStill, some point to these early struggles as crucial building blocks for the future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to learn,\u201d Darnold said Sunday after a 13-6 loss at Miami in which he threw four INTs. \u201cThere\u2019s always lessons to be learned.\u201d\n\nOf the 32 quarterbacks currently listed as starters for their teams, 12 were under center in Week 1 of their first season.\n\nOn the flipside, some veteran superstar QBs waited a while before they got their chances.\n\nAaron Rodgers was stuck behind Brett Favre in Green Bay before finally starting in his fourth season. Philip Rivers didn\u2019t start with the Chargers until his third year, when Drew Brees went to New Orleans. Even Brees didn\u2019t get his first NFL start until his second season.\n\nTom Brady, Eli Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Alex Smith weren\u2019t Day 1 starters, either.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, it gets to be like Drew, who had a chance to watch a little, or Tom Brady and Aaron,\u201d said former quarterback Rich Gannon, the 2002 NFL MVP and now an analyst for CBS Sports and SiriusXM NFL Radio.\n\nPatrick Mahomes sat behind Smith in Kansas City until Week 17 as a rookie last year, and now is a leading MVP candidate as one of the NFL\u2019s top gunslinger s with a league-leading 29 TD passes for the 8-1 Chiefs.\n\n\u201cWe knew that Patrick was very talented, but any time that an NFL team goes with a young quarterback, usually it\u2019s a very challenging endeavor,\u201d Chiefs owner Clark Hunt said. \u201cSometimes it takes time, several years, but as we\u2019ve seen, Andy (Reid) had Patrick ready to go Week 1.\u201d\n\nGannon thinks the Chiefs provide the perfect blueprint.\n\n\u201cMahomes had a chance to watch a master of his domain for a year,\u201d he said. \u201cAlex Smith knew that system inside and out, has great huddle command and leadership skills. Maybe he doesn\u2019t throw it like Mahomes does, but this is a guy who was willing to share and help him for that year, and we\u2019re seeing the fruits of it now.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best situation you can have.\u201d\n\nAgain, that depends on who you ask.\n\nIn the past three drafts, 11 quarterbacks were taken in the first round \u2014 including Darnold, Cleveland\u2019s Baker Mayfield, Buffalo\u2019s Josh Allen, Arizona\u2019s Josh Rosen and Baltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson this year.\n\nJackson is the only one to not yet start at least one game. Baltimore has Joe Flacco leading the huddle, but Jackson has still been used in the offense and is the Ravens\u2019 second-leading rusher.\n\nThe Browns wanted to have Mayfield, the No. 1 overall pick this year, sit and learn behind Tyrod Taylor. But like most plans in Cleveland, it backfired.\n\nTaylor got hurt in Week 3 and Mayfield was thrust into the lineup, helping the Browns rally to beat the Jets in a nationally televised game and end a 19-game winless streak. Mayfield has shown poise and promise, but lacks playmakers and is dealing with a coaching change after Hue Jackson was fired.\n\nIn Buffalo, the Bills weren\u2019t anticipating Allen starting in the second week. They were taking what coach Sean McDermott called a \u201ccalculated\u201d approach. But after AJ McCarron was traded before the season opener and Nathan Peterman bombed in Week 1, McDermott was left with no choice but to turn to Allen.\n\nThe rookie has been dealing with a sprained right elbow , and is uncertain to play Sunday against the Jets.\n\n\u201cWhen you draft a quarterback like we did, there\u2019s a part of it where you have to say, \u2018Hey, he\u2019s going to play either A, B, or C \u2014 early, middle, or late or next year.\u2019\u201d McDermott said. \u201cYou have to be OK with all of that.\u201d\n\nThe initial plan in Arizona was to have Rosen learn behind Sam Bradford. All that changed when the veteran was ineffective and benched in favor of the No. 10 overall pick.\n\nRosen took his lumps with some turnover-filled performances. Then, Mike McCoy was fired as the Cardinals\u2019 offensive coordinator and Bradford was later cut \u2014 leaving the job to Rosen.\n\n\u201cHis demeanor allows him to have success,\u201d new offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich said. \u201cQuarterbacking in this league is hard and when things go bad, this kid tends to be fine.\u201d\n\nBut, some say too many adverse situations could end up having long-term deleterious effects on a young player.\n\n\u201cWhen you put them in before they\u2019re ready, they also get hurt: Josh Allen, Josh Rosen,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cThe speed of the game is way too fast for them. ... Or they have a bad experience, like what wound up happening with (the Jets\u2019) Mark Sanchez and Geno Smith, or going back to Ryan Leaf (with the Chargers). They play right away before they are physically or mentally ready or maturity-level ready. They get benched and booed and maybe run out of town, the coach gets fired, and then the next thing, they\u2019re on their third or fourth team. They think he will be a savior and he\u2019s not ready to play.\n\n\u201cHow is that being responsible from a coach and ownership standpoint? It\u2019s doing a tremendous disservice.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay\u2019s Jameis Winston and Tennessee\u2019 Marcus Mariota started right away after being the top two picks in 2015, but the jury\u2019s still out on both.\n\nFor those who preach patience, 25 of the 32 current QBs started a game at some point in their rookie season. And, several held on to the job from there.\n\nQuarterbacks such as the Rams\u2019 Jared Goff (No. 1 in 2016) and the Bears\u2019 Mitchell Trubisky (No. 2 in 2017) started and struggled as rookies, but benefited from changes in coaching staffs and philosophies and took leaps in their second seasons.\n\nSo, who\u2019s right?\n\nWell, all of the above.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly valuable experience when you stand and watch,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cBut we all know there\u2019s no substitute for the experience when you\u2019re actually behind the wheel. There\u2019s a lot of value to that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner and AP Sports Writers Bob Baum, David Ginsburg, Dave Skretta, John Wawrow and Tom Withers contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "David Rosen, from left, Jennifer Karol and her husband Tom Karol react to an update on the 32nd Texas congressional race during an election night party for Democratic candidate Colin Allred at the Magnolia Hotel Dallas Park Cities in Dallas, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

Democrats lead in nine of those, Republicans in 14. The final count is likely to leave Democrats with a narrow majority that could be difficult to manage and preserve.\n\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is seeking to reclaim the gavel as House speaker, called it a \u201cnew day in America.\u201d\n\nShe saluted \u201cthose dynamic, diverse and incredible candidates who have taken back the House for the American people.\u201d\n\nWith the Republicans keeping control of the Senate, the outcome in the House could mean gridlock for Trump\u2019s agenda on Capitol Hill \u2014 or, conversely, it could open a new era of deal-making.\n\nA record number of women were elected to the House on Tuesday, nearly two years after women spilled out into the streets of Washington and in cities across the country in defiance of the inauguration of President Donald Trump. (Nov. 7)\n\nAs the majority party, the Democrats will chair important committees and will have expansive powers to investigate the president, his business dealings and the inner workings of his administration, including whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThey will have authority to request Trump\u2019s tax returns and subpoena power to obtain documents, emails and testimony.\n\nHowever, any attempt to impeach Trump is likely to run headlong into resistance in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nPelosi, meanwhile, is likely to face a challenge for the speakership from newer or younger members later this month. And the Democrats could see a struggle inside the party over how aggressively to confront the Trump administration.\n\nDuring the campaign, Pelosi urged candidates to focus on lowering health care costs and creating jobs with infrastructure investment, and she tamped down calls for impeachment.\n\nThe campaign unfolded against a backdrop of ugly rhetoric and angry debates on immigration, health care and the role of Congress in overseeing the president.\n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

The Democrats made only slight inroads in Trump country, where they tried to win back white working-class voters.\n\nMidterm elections are typically difficult for the party in power, but the GOP\u2019s hold on power was further weakened by an unusually large number of retirements as well as infighting between conservatives and centrists over their allegiance to Trump.\n\nThe Democrats, in turn, benefited from extraordinary voter enthusiasm, robust fundraising and unusually fresh candidates. More women than ever were running, along with veterans and minorities, many of them motivated by revulsion over Trump.\n\nAs the returns came in, voters were on track to send at least 99 women to the House, shattering the record of 84 now. Perhaps the biggest new political star among them is New York\u2019s 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal firebrand from the Bronx.\n\nAlso among them are the first two Native American women elected to the House \u2014 Democrats Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico \u2014 and the first two Muslim-American women, Rhasida Tlaib of Michigan and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Oman.\n\nThe Republican side of the aisle elected mostly white men.\n\nIn trying to stem Republican losses, Trump made only passing reference to his $1.5 trillion tax cut \u2014 the GOP Congress\u2019 signature achievement \u2014 and instead barnstormed through mostly white regions of the country, interjecting dark and foreboding warnings. He predicted an \u201cinvasion\u201d from the migrant caravan making its way toward the U.S. and decried the \u201cradical\u201d agenda of speaker-in-waiting Pelosi.\n\nOn Tuesday night, he called to congratulate Pelosi and acknowledged her plea for bipartisanship, the leader\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nHealth care and immigration were high on voters\u2019 minds as they cast ballots, according to a survey of the American electorate by The Associated Press. AP VoteCast also showed a majority of voters considered Trump a factor in their votes.\n\nIn the Miami area, former Clinton administration Cabinet member Donna Shalala won an open seat, while GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo lost his bid for a third term in a nearby district.\n\nIn the suburbs outside the nation\u2019s capital, Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock \u2014 among the most endangered GOP incumbents, branded Barbara \u201cTrumpstock\u201d by Democrats \u2014 lost to Jennifer Wexton, a prosecutor and state legislator.\n\nAnd outside Richmond, Virginia, one-time tea party favorite Rep. Dave Brat lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operative motivated to run for office after the GOP vote to gut the Affordable Care Act. Like other Democrats across the country, Spanberger emphasized protecting people with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage or charged more by insurers.\n\nPennsylvania was particularly daunting for Republicans after court-imposed redistricting and a rash of retirements put several seats in play. Democratic favorite Conor Lamb, who stunned Washington by winning a special election in the state, beat Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in a new district. At least three other red districts flipped to blue.\n\nIn Kentucky, the heart of Trump country, one of the top Democratic recruits, retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, lost her bid to oust to three-term Rep. Andy Barr in the Lexington-area district.\n\nRepublicans had expected the GOP tax plan would be the cornerstone of their election agenda this year, but it became a potential liability in key states along the East and West coasts where residents could face higher tax bills because of limits on property and sales tax deductions.\n\nThe tax law was particularly problematic for Republicans in high-tax New Jersey, where at least three GOP-held seats flipped. The winners included Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor who ran for a suburban Newark seat.\n\nThe GOP campaign committee distanced itself from eight-term Rep. Steve King of Iowa after he was accused of racism and anti-Semitism, but he won anyway.\n\nIn California, four GOP seats in the one-time Republican stronghold of Orange County were in play, along with three other seats to the north beyond Los Angeles and into the Central Valley.\n\n\u201cWe always knew these races are going to be close,\u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, co-chair of House Democrats\u2019 recruitment efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very robust class of candidates that really reflects who we are as a country.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .

But the race was considered too early to call.\n\nAs of 12:15 a.m. Wednesday, Dunleavy held a lead of 21,788 votes out of nearly 230,000 ballots counted. Roughly 20 percent of votes in Alaska are counted after Election Day.\n\nDunleavy, however, claimed victory. In a statement, he said he takes seriously the task ahead of him.\n\nDunleavy is a former state senator. He was the presumed front-runner for much of the race, which, until mid-October, included Gov. Bill Walker.\n\nWalker ended his campaign days after Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture to a woman. Walker said he voted for Begich.\n\nInitial results showed Walker receiving a small percentage of votes.\n\n____\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nU.S. Rep. Don Young said he was a little surprised by the margin of victory.\n\nThe 85-year-old Republican defeated Alyse Galvin for his 24th term in the U.S. House. He\u2019s the longest-serving member of the body.\n\nHe said he got more votes in this election than in the last few, and this came when everyone had him down to Galvin.\n\nYoung says he feels good about his campaign.\n\nHe says he was able to prove that Alaskans appreciate what he\u2019s been able to do.\n\nAnd he adds that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to have a good two years ahead of us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAlaska Republican Don Young has been elected to his 24th term. He is the longest-serving member of the U.S. House.\n\nYoung defeated Alyse Galvin, an education advocate who ran as an independent with support from the Democratic Party.\n\nYoung is a former school teacher who served in the Alaska Legislature and was first elected to Congress in 1973. He has rarely faced strong challenges.\n\nYoung and Galvin met in several testy debates. After one, Young accused her of being nasty to him. At the conclusion of another, Galvin complained that Young\u2019s handshake had hurt her hand.\n\nAt one debate, Young told the audience that if they think Galvin can do a better job, then they should vote for her.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nU.S. Rep. Don Young was hoping to stave off further Democratic gains the U.S. House in his bid for a 24th term.\n\nYoung and his opponent, Alyse Galvin, remained in a close contest late Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats were bolstered by wins in House races across the nation. Even though she is an independent, Galvin has said she would caucus with Democrats if she won.\n\nYoung, a Republican, is the longest-serving member of the House. He was elected in 1973. Galvin is making her first run for political office.\n\n___\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nRepublican Mike Dunleavy held an edge over Democrat Mark Begich in early returns in Alaska\u2019s governor race.\n\nDunleavy is a former state senator. He had been the presumed front-runner for much of the race, which, until mid-October, included Gov. Bill Walker.\n\nThe independent Walker ended his campaign days after Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture to a woman.\n\nWalker said he voted for Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage and one-term U.S. senator.\n\nBegich said he had momentum heading into Tuesday\u2019s election but worried voters might be confused since Walker\u2019s name was still on the ballot.\n\nEarly results showed Walker receiving a small percentage of votes.\n\n___\n\n5:05 p.m.\n\nThe Alaska Division of Elections says it provided guidance to poll workers on what to say if voters asked about the governor\u2019s race.\n\nGov. Bill Walker ended his campaign last month, leaving Democrat Mark Begich and Republican Mike Dunleavy as the major candidates. Libertarian Billy Toien also is running.\n\nWalker\u2019s name, however, remains on the ballot. The deadline to withdraw had passed when he dropped his campaign.\n\nWalker voted early and said he voted for Begich.\n\nDivision of Elections spokeswoman Samantha Miller says poll workers were provided with a statement if they were asked about the race.\n\nThe statement says no candidate for governor or lieutenant governor withdrew by the deadline and that a vote for a candidate on the ballot will count for that candidate.\n\n___\n\n4:25 p.m.\n\nParts of northwestern Alaska are spending Election Day under a winter storm warning.\n\nSamantha Miller is a spokeswoman for the Division of Elections. She says the division heard that about half of Kivalina was without electricity. But she says there have been no disruptions to voting.\n\nKivalina is about 80 air miles northwest of Kotzebue.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Miller says the division received a couple reports of campaign signs being used within 200 feet (60 meters) of a polling place. She did not have information about which campaign signs were involved. But she says the incidents were resolved.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Don Young, Alaska\u2019s only representative in the U.S. House, found support among noontime voters Tuesday in south Anchorage.\n\nRyan Hansen cast his ballot for Young at Kincaid Elementary School and said the incumbent is good for the state on resource development. Hansen says Young is a staple of Alaska and as long as Young wants to keep running, he will support him.\n\nHansen said Young\u2019s opponent, independent Alyse Galvin, was \u201ctoo much of an unknown.\u201d\n\nSheila Hill and Cliff Johnson voted for Young and cited his record of bringing federal resources to the state.\n\nDean Paul, who calls himself a non-partisan and disability advocate, said he was on the fence in the U.S. House race but chose Young.\n\nHe says Young is a known quantity and that he\u2019s supported people with disabilities.\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nAlaska Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Begich is getting help in his get-out-the-vote effort from former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBegich\u2019s campaign sent a message from Biden to supporters Tuesday urging them to vote.\n\nBegich campaign manager Nora Morse says by text message that Begich asked for Biden\u2019s help.\n\nMorse says former President Barack Obama did a robocall encouraging people in rural Alaska to vote. But she says the call did not mention Begich.\n\nBegich\u2019s main rival in the governor\u2019s race is Republican Mike Dunleavy. Dunleavy\u2019s campaign manager said Monday that robocalls on behalf of Dunleavy would go out from President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n___\n\n3 p.m.\n\nCatherine Bailey and her husband Mark Jones cast their votes Tuesday in Alaska\u2019s U.S. House race. Both staunchly backed political newcomer Alyse Galvin, an independent challenging the 85-year-old Republican Rep. Don Young.\n\nFor one thing, the Anchorage couple believes Young is out of touch and in office far too long. For another, they believe Galvin offers the best shot at making sure to hold President Donald Trump responsible, according to Bailey, a registered Democrat. Jones, who is registered as an independent, agrees.\n\nThe way Bailey sees it, Trump has no idea what leadership is and the Congressional majority has given him the green light to do whatever he wants to do. Bailey says the Congress Trump has \u201cright now is unforgivable.\u201d\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nOne Anchorage polling location had everything it needed when polls opened at 7 a.m. except the ballots.\n\nSamantha Miller, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Division of Elections, says the chairperson for the polling location at Romig Middle School forgot the ballots at home.\n\nThe official left the poll at 7 a.m. to retrieve the ballots, and was back at 7:30 a.m.\n\nMiller says the polling location remained opened and voters had the option of casting ballots on touch screens instead.\n\nShe says it\u2019s not clear why poll workers didn\u2019t give voters the option of voting sample ballots, and are investigating.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nKris Abel of Anchorage cast his vote Tuesday in Alaska\u2019s U.S. House race with a big goal on his mind: flipping the House to favor Democrats.\n\nThat meant a vote for political newcomer Alyse Galvin, an independent challenging the 85-year-old Republican incumbent, Don Young, the longest-serving member of the House. Abel wants to put more congressional reins on President Donald Trump.\n\nIn the Alaska governor\u2019s race, Abel, a registered Democrat, threw his support to Democrat Mark Begich, a former U.S. senator and Anchorage mayor.\n\nAbel says if the incumbent governor, Bill Walker, had not withdrawn from the race, however, that would have complicated matters. He says he might have voted for Walker in that case.\n\n___\n\n11:40 a.m.\n\nAnchorage resident Lauren Agee, a registered Republican, was among voters who turned out Tuesday morning to cast a ballot. In the governor\u2019s race, she voted for Republican Mike Dunleavy, a former state senator.\n\nTo Agee, a big issue in the race was Alaska\u2019s Permanent Fund, whose dividend checks have been capped since 2016 amid a budget deficit. She thinks Dunleavy is the one to restore dividends back to their full amount.\n\nFor U.S. House, Agee went with U.S. Rep. Don Young, the longest-serving member of that chamber. There was no overriding issue that got her vote, she said. She said she was going by Young\u2019s long history in Congress. She said she also was raised Republican, so she went with what she knows.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nResidents of the Kenai Peninsula are reporting vandalism on campaign signs in the run-up to the Alaska general election on Tuesday.\n\nKenai radio station KSRM reports residents took to social media, including Facebook, to ask vandals to \u201cbe respectful and stop\u201d damaging signs.\n\nSigns supporting Republican State Sen. Peter Micciche (mih-CHIK\u2019-ee) have borne the brunt of the damage.\n\nThe incumbent seeking to retain his seat in District O has had signs both damaged and stolen.\n\nMicciche\u2019s campaign says 33 large signs and sandbags that hold them in place have been stolen or destroyed. The campaign estimates the loss at $3,600.\n\nMicciche\u2019s district covers Kenai, Soldotna, Seward, Nikiski, Funny River, Sterling, Cooper Landing and Moose Pass.\n\n___\n\n12:01 a.m.\n\nPolls in Alaska will open at 7 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nVoters across the nation\u2019s largest state will then have 13 hours to cast their ballots in the midterm elections.\n\nAmong the high-profile races are those for governor and U.S. House.\n\nAlaska is expected to have a new governor as the incumbent, Gov Bill Walker, dropped his re-election bid last month. The major candidates remaining are Democrat Mark Begich and Republican Mike Dunleavy.\n\nIn the U.S. House race, Republican Rep. Don Young has been in office for 45 years and wants to be re-elected. Standing in his way is political newcomer Alyse Galvin, an independent who won the Democratic primary.\n\nThe polls close at 8 p.m. The first results won\u2019t be released until 9 p.m. or so.", "BILLINGS, Mont.

Bob Menendez won a third Senate term in New Jersey, despite a federal bribery indictment that prosecutors dropped this year after a mistrial. Also victorious was Republican Mitt Romney, the vanquished 2012 GOP presidential candidate, who grabbed an open Utah seat.\n\nAP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for the AP by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\n___\n\nAP reporters Jeff Baenen in Minnetonka, Minnesota, and John Flesher in Traverse City, Michigan, contributed.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "Democrats tried Tuesday to fight their way back to power in state capitols across the country by reclaiming governor\u2019s seats in several key states, marking significant steps in their nationwide strategy to reverse years of Republican gains in state capitols.\n\nStill, their victories in Illinois, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, were balanced by Republicans holding on to one of the top prizes, Florida, and the governor\u2019s offices in Ohio and Arizona. All three states will figure prominently in the presidential map in two years.\n\nThe nation\u2019s other closely watched governor\u2019s race, in Georgia, remained too close to call Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 toppling of Republican Scott Walker in Wisconsin completed a sweep for the party in the upper Midwest. Walker was a top target of Democrats and a polarizing figure in his state, sweeping into office during the tea party wave of 2010 and gaining national attention by leading a rollback of union rights that led to protests inside the state Capitol. He survived a recall attempt before falling short in a bid for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nThe win by Democrat Tony Evers gives his party a chance to undo some of Walker\u2019s accomplishments, including a strict voter ID law and the law that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers.\n\nLikewise, Democrats hope their victories signal a resurgence for their party in America\u2019s heartland, where President Donald Trump romped in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think the message is a simple one. A candidate with a moderate tone but progressive in thinking can win in the heartland,\u201d former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, said. \u201cWinning the governorships is huge in beginning the process of changing the direction of our politics.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer defeated Republican Bill Schuette, upending years of Republican control in the state. The former legislative leader will become the second female governor in a state where Democrats heavily targeted other statewide and legislative offices.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bruce Rauner in Illinois lost his bid for a second term to Democrat J.B. Pritzker. The billionaire appears to have capitalized not only on Rauner\u2019s lack of popularity but broader dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump. In Kansas, Democratic state lawmaker Laura Kelly defeated Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a close ally of Trump.\n\nNew Mexico also tipped into the Democratic column, as did Maine, where Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills won the race to succeed combative Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who was term-limited after eight years in office.\n\nDemocrats Andrew Cuomo in New York and Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania easily won re-election, as did two Republicans in Democratic-leaning states \u2014 Larry Hogan in Maryland and Charlie Baker in Massachusetts.\n\nIn Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds broke the Democrats\u2019 run of Midwest success by being elected to a full term. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a former Republican presidential candidate and Trump ally, was seeking a third term in a race that remained too close to call.\n\nIn all, voters were choosing 36 governors and 6,089 state legislators in general and special elections that have attracted record amounts of spending from national Democratic and Republican groups.\n\nRepublicans are in control more often than not in state capitols across the country, but Democrats were trying to pull a little closer in Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nThe political parties are trying not only to win now, but also to put themselves in strong position for the elections two years from now that will determine which party will have the upper hand in redrawing congressional and state legislative districts.\n\nVoters in Colorado, Michigan and Missouri approved ballot measures Tuesday overhauling the redistricting process in ways that are intended to reduce the likelihood of partisan gerrymandering by either major party. A redistricting ballot measure also was on the ballot in Utah.\n\nRepublicans entered Tuesday\u2019s election with a sizable advantage, controlling two-thirds of the 99 state legislative chambers and 33 governors\u2019 offices. The GOP held a trifecta of power in 25 states, compared with just eight for Democrats.\n\nDemocrats likely will gain full control in Illinois and New Mexico by winning the governor\u2019s races. The Democratic victories in Kansas and Michigan will break up Republican trifectas.\n\nRepublicans were largely on defense but also were angling for gains in a few traditionally Democratic states, such Connecticut.\n\nThe governor\u2019s races have extra emphasis in 28 states where the winners will serve four-year terms with the potential power to approve or reject district boundaries drawn for Congress or state legislatures.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association had focused on nine swing states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 where it believes the governorships could be pivotal in congressional redistricting.\n\nAs of mid-October, the Democratic Governors Association and its affiliated entities had raised $122 million during the past two years \u2014 a record outdone only by the Republican Governors Association\u2019s new high mark of at least $156 million.\n\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee and Republican State Leadership Committee, which focus on state races, also set record fundraising targets. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, led by former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder, has pumped additional money into state races viewed as critical in future redistricting decisions.\n\nAlthough most state lawmakers responsible for redistricting will be elected in 2020, voters on Tuesday were electing more than 800 state lawmakers in about two dozen states to four-year terms where they could play a role in approving new congressional or state legislative districts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Thomas Beaumont contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow David A.

Warren)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 In the first statewide referendum on transgender rights, Massachusetts voters on Tuesday beat back a repeal attempt and reaffirmed a 2016 law extending nondiscrimination protections to transgender people, including their use of public bathrooms and locker rooms.\n\nVoters in 37 states considered an array of intriguing ballot measures Tuesday.\n\nMichigan voters made their state the first in the Midwest to legalize recreational marijuana by passing a ballot measure that will allow people 21 or older to buy and use the drug. A similar measure was defeated in North Dakota, meaning there are now 10 states that allow recreational use of pot. Missouri became the 31st state to approve the medical use of marijuana, while Utah was considering that step.\n\n\u201cWestern and northeastern states have led the way on legalizing marijuana, but the victory in Michigan powerfully demonstrates the national reach of this movement,\u201d said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, who questioned how long the federal government could resist the legalization wave.\n\nThe outcome in Massachusetts was a huge relief to LGBT-rights activists, who feared that a vote to repeal the 2016 law would prompt a wave of similar efforts to roll back protections in other states. Already, some protections at the federal level are under threat from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cWhen transgender rights are being threatened nationally, we absolutely must preserve the rights we have secured at the state level,\u201d said Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.\n\nCivil-rights activists also scored a major victory in Florida, where voters approved a ballot measure that will enable more than 1 million ex-felons to regain their voting rights. That could alter the future election landscape in the nation\u2019s most populous swing state.\n\nFloridians also approved a measure aimed at phasing out greyhound racing in the state, the last stronghold of the sport in the U.S.\n\nIn all, 155 statewide initiatives were on the ballot across the country. Most were drafted by state legislatures, but 64 resulted from citizen-initiated campaigns, including many of the most eye-catching proposals.\n\nA minimum wage increase was approved in two states. An Arkansas measure will raise the wage from $8.50 an hour to $11 by 2021; Missouri\u2019s will gradually raise the $7.85 minimum wage to $12 an hour.\n\nProposals to change the redistricting process so it\u2019s potentially less partisan were approved in Missouri, Colorado and Michigan. A similar proposal was on the ballot in Utah.\n\nMedicaid expansion was another multistate topic, on the ballot because Republican-led legislatures refused to take advantage of expanded coverage offered under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. Nebraska and Idaho voters approved measures to expand Medicaid health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income residents; a similar measure was on the ballot in Utah, while a Montana measure would raise tobacco taxes to extend an existing expansion.\n\nA number of initiatives dealt with criminal justice or victims\u2019 rights.\n\nIn Ohio, voters defeated an ambitious proposal to make drug possession a misdemeanor in an effort to reduce the state prison population and divert any savings to drug treatment.\n\nWith the vote in Florida, most felons will automatically have their voting rights restored when they complete their sentences or go on probation. The amendment exempts those convicted of sex offenses and murder.\n\nSupporters said the state\u2019s current system was too onerous. It required felons to wait at least five years after completing their sentence before they could file a request with the governor and Cabinet. About 1.5 million people are affected. Nearly all states allow felons to vote after completing their sentences.\n\nHoward Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Florida affiliate, said the result would remove \u201can ugly stain\u201d from the state constitution.\n\n\u201cFor too long, Florida has been an extreme outlier \u2014 our state\u2019s lifetime voting ban was the single most powerful voter suppression tactic in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe greyhound measure will ban betting on greyhound races starting in 2021. The sport remains active in five other states, but may be too small-scale to survive.\n\nProponents said racing is inherently cruel, pointing to the average of two deaths weekly from illness or injury among Florida\u2019s 8,000 racing dogs.\n\nWhile liberal-leaning groups succeeded in getting some of their favored policy proposals on the ballot in Republican-controlled states, the partisan pattern was reversed in a few states.\n\nIn Democratic-leaning Oregon, conservatives unsuccessfully targeted two policies. Voters there upheld a law allowing use of state money to pay for low-income women to have abortions, and also reaffirmed a \u201csanctuary state\u201d law forbidding law enforcement agencies from using state resources or personnel to arrest people whose only crime is being in the U.S. illegally.\n\nClimate change was an issue in Arizona, where voters defeated a measure that would have required 50 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. Colorado voters rejected a measure that could have sharply reduced oil and gas drilling, including the method known as fracking, by requiring new oil and gas wells to be farther from occupied buildings than allowed under current law.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Crary at https://twitter.com/CraryAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/ad4909603a18455c9281ce7126a157e0\n\nThe following are TEST returns.\n\n11 of 40 precincts - 28 percent\n\nCarter Turner, Dem 6,294 - 62 percent\n\nJoe McNamara, GOP 3,875 - 38 percent\n\nAP Elections 10-22-2018 13:44", "EASTON, Pa.

And we wanted to use pizza\u2019s ubiquitous appeal to get people through the door and looking at art and hearing about history in a different format,\u201d said Alexandra Serio, Chief Content Officer at Nameless Network, the group that baked the Museum of Pizza idea.\n\n\u201cOur approach to this Museum of Pizza is a fine art approach, so we went out to multiple artists contemporary in many mediums, and asked them for their interpretation of pizza,\u201d said Serio. \u201cAnd what we got back is_it ranges the gambit, let\u2019s just say that. That\u2019s an understatement.\u201d\n\nLocated on the street level of Brooklyn\u2019s William Vale hotel, the museum is an expansive, one-floor space that houses a wide variety of art, from giant photographs to sculptures to large installations that engulf visitors. And the pop-up museum, also known as \u201cMoPi,\u201d has already drawn a lot of interest_more than 6,000 people came through the doors when they opened this month.\n\nThe pop-up Museum of Pizza is now open in New York, celebrating pizza and art at once. (Nov. 6)\n\nAnother instantly recognizable attribute of the space is the bright colors that are weaved throughout the exhibits_perfect for taking social media-ready pictures.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I thought it would be like more of a museum like at the beginning, with the pizza boxes and it kinda tells you when it was developed and stuff like that,\u201d said Nene Raye, visiting from New Jersey. \u201cThen I was kinda hoping they had something artsy in it because I love taking pictures. So this is a mashup of everything_so you get a little bit of education and then some fun, which I love.\u201d\n\nSerio said selfie-friendly exhibits are becoming a priority for museums as they try to get younger legs to walk through their doors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of paradigm shift with museums,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, I think in the next few years because of museums like the Museum of Ice Cream, and multiple pop-ups of this ilk, museums kind of courting a younger audience and seeing how they can make their exhibitions more tactile, touch and photography friendly.\u201d\n\nLydia Melendez, a self-described \u201cpizza aficionado,\u201d bought her tickets in April.

But this is definitely one for the books.\u201d\n\nWhile pizza may be the hook that draws those interested to the museum, the focus of MoPi is to expose visitors to the fine art world_even if the education is fed one slice at a time.\n\n\u201cThe Museum of Pizza\u2019s target demographic isn\u2019t necessarily the same type of people that are making a quarterly trips to the MoMA or the Frick collection or the LACMA (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) \u201d, said Serio. \u201cWe\u2019re really putting fine art in a place that\u2019s easily accessible for a wide range of people.\u201d\n\nThe pop-up museum, which costs $35 for adults but is free for kids under 5 and seniors, closes Nov. 18.", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/cfd88647f50348e39fff8a114912eb03\n\nThe following are TEST returns.\n\n62 of 109 precincts - 57 percent\n\nRichard Hilderbrand , GOP (i) 8,055 - 43 percent\n\nBryan Hoffman , Dem 7,564 - 40 percent\n\nSam Habjan , Lib 3,267 - 17 percent\n\nAP Elections 10-08-2018 12:38", "SYRACUSE, N.Y.

(AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nThe Vikings, Broncos, Texans and Ravens being off in Week 10 means there are plenty of bye week players to replace in lineups.\n\nYou\u2019ll be without the likes of Adam Thielen, Kirk Cousins, Phillip Lindsay, Emmanuel Sanders, DeAndre Hopkins and Deshaun Watson this week. Work the waiver wire aggressively and with a forward-looking focus.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nDUKE JOHNSON JR., Browns (49.6 percent owned): He was cut in some very competitive leagues recently, but a coaching overhaul in Cleveland has led to Johnson quickly regaining fantasy relevance. Johnson caught nine passes for 78 yards on Sunday, and with the Browns lacking a quality second wideout he should remain in the flow going forward. Make him a top waiver priority or be willing to spend handsomely if your league uses a free agent acquisition budget. If you need RB help in a point-per-reception format, don\u2019t hesitate to spend 50 to 60 percent of your budget.\n\nMIKE DAVIS, Seahawks (18.5): He totaled 107 yards from scrimmage and caught seven passes on Sunday as Chris Carson could not make it out of the early stages of the game. Carson is already looking iffy this week with hip and groin problems and he has been a consistent injury concern. Davis is clearly preferred by the Seattle coaching staff over Rashaad Penny and faces the league\u2019s worst run defense (the Rams) in Week 10.\n\nJOSH ADAMS (3.0): We advised picking him up last week but he was only added in 2.5 percent of leagues. Many owners passed on him because Adams was on a bye week. Don\u2019t overlook players who have byes, when you can get the jump on passive league mates. Adams may start for the Eagles coming off the bye.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nMARQUES VALDES-SCANTLING (20.8): Not enough owners paid attention to injury news late last week, which indicated Geronimo Allison would likely be out with a groin injury, boosting Valdes-Scantling\u2019s outlook again. Now Allison may be done for the season and Randall Cobb is oft-injured and only had 24 receiving yards last week. The rookie has either reached 100 yards or scored in his last four games and has quickly risen to fantasy WR3 status.\n\nADAM HUMPHRIES, Buccaneers (2.8): In the past, he had flashed some potential to be a decent fantasy player, then totally defied expectations in Week 9 with eight catches for 82 yards and two TD receptions. He used to be more of a Jameis Winston favorite, but Ryan Fitzpatrick can use him as a reliable option from the slot.\n\nJOHN ROSS, Bengals (8.1): Ross has started to practice as he anticipates a potential return from a groin injury, and with A.J. Green possibly missing two games or more with a toe problem, Ross becomes a viable waiver target because of increased opportunity. Tyler Boyd may get extra defensive attention during Green\u2019s absence, and Ross will likely be more targeted more frequently. His big-play promise is no secret to seasoned fantasy players.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nC.J. UZOMAH, Bengals (18.2): He has disappointed since becoming the clear No. 1 at his position in Cincinnati because of injuries, but Uzomah also still has some lingering appeal because of the Green injury. Andy Dalton will always consider his tight ends when inside the 10-yard line, and Uzomah has some TD potential while Green is out.\n\nJEFF HEUERMAN, Broncos (7.9): Here\u2019s a guy on a bye that you need to add now if TE is a desperation need. Heuerman immediately stepped into the Demaryius Thomas void left by the WR\u2019s departure, catching 10 passes for 83 yards and a TD in a career performance. While his statistical ceiling may not be as high as those numbers indicate going forward, you have to take a waiver chance on the improved production possibly lasting more than one game.\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nLAMAR JACKSON, Ravens (1.5): This is a forward-looking waiver move where you possibly can get ahead of the rest of the league, as Baltimore is on a bye. Joe Flacco has four TD passes in his past five games and 398 passing yards with one TD and two interceptions in his last two outings. There could be a QB change coming in Baltimore soon. Jackson looked like an erratic passer in the preseason, but his rushing and playmaking skills point to some tantalizing fantasy possibilities if he gets inserted into the Ravens guiding role.\n\n___\n\nFor more waiver and Week 10 advice, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 Russia\u2019s space agency says that one of the International Space Station\u2019s computers has malfunctioned, but the glitch doesn\u2019t pose any risks to the crew.\n\nRoscosmos said Tuesday that one of three computers in the station\u2019s Russian module has failed.

November 1, 2018\n\nLisa Beck will bring new energy, focus to key Region issues\n\nServing constituents in a district that is pretty much equally divided between Republicans and Democrats can be tough for a legislator.\n\nGoing directly to the people may seem like the best course, however daunting, especially in a close-knit community like District 19, which covers east-central Lake and a slice of west-central Porter counties.\n\nAnd that is just what Democratic challenger Lisa Beck has done, with her campaign canvassing more than 6,000 houses in the past few months, having conversations with voters of varied political stripes to learn what is most important to them.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the many reasons we endorse Beck over incumbent Indiana House Rep. Julie Olthoff, R-Crown Point. Olthoff, who runs a marketing communications firm in Crown Point, is seeking a third term.\n\nWhat Beck, who lives near Lakes of the Four Seasons, learned shaped her vision for what she hopes to accomplish if she wins the seat. She said the three overarching issues of most concern to residents in her district are infrastructure, good-paying jobs and public education.\n\nOlthoff has focused on initiatives to fight domestic violence and sexual assault, and she\u2019s now a board member of Fair Haven, Lake County\u2019s rape crisis center. She also sponsored a law that requires school employees to be trained in youth suicide prevention at least once every three years.\n\nDespite these efforts, Olthoff sometimes focuses on topics of limited scope and overemphasizes the minutiae of issues, often eclipsing the bigger picture as it relates to the Region.\n\nBeck, a Valparaiso University law graduate, stressed to The Times Editorial Board the importance of distilling constituents\u2019 myriad concerns into several larger concrete issues on which to stay focused. Tactical thinking is key but needs to be tied to an overall strategy.\n\nBeck is high-energy and enthusiastic, and she also has a grasp of issues facing not just the state but also the Region, and the need to improve Northwest Indiana\u2019s economy and enhance its profile in the Chicago area.\n\nShe believes her work for nine years in the Lake County Prosecutor\u2019s office, first in child support and then trial work, followed by years in private practice, instilled in her a love of public service and the ability to navigate complex processes.\n\nIn response to those who would back Olthoff solely to keep a local Republican majority downstate to better achieve Region goals in a cohesive fashion, Beck said not only is that view \u201cnot representative of democracy,\u201d but also misses the core of who she is and what she stands for.\n\nBeck would reach across the aisle and work with all Region lawmakers to achieve unity and forward momentum for the residents in her district, she said.\n\nBeck referenced a 2018 vote on House Bill 1319, which would have raised the 72 percent interest cap on payday loans to 222 percent and allow them to be larger and longer-term. It passed the House 53-41, with Olthoff in favor.\n\nBeck said she would have voted with state Rep. Hal Slager, R-Schererville, to kill the bill, which she said most Region lawmakers agreed could harm local families.\n\n____\n\nThe (Fort Wayne) Journal Gazette. November 2, 2018\n\nSafety above all\n\nBus-stop protections worth the investment\n\nThe horrific crash that killed a 9-year-old girl and her 6-year-old twin brothers as they crossed Indiana 25 to board a school bus Tuesday morning prompted quick review of school policies - and rightly so.\n\nTippecanoe Valley School Corp. announced it will move the students\u2019 bus stop off the state highway and into the mobile home park where they lived. But the state and all Indiana school districts should consider what more can be done to protect students. And motorists must be mindful of school buses at all times.\n\nAlivia Stahl and Xzavier and Mason Ingle died at the scene. A fourth student, Maverik Lowe, 11, was airlifted to Fort Wayne\u2019s Parkview Regional Medical Center with serious injuries. Alyssa Shepherd, a mother of two and the children\u2019s director at a Rochester church, was arrested and charged with three counts of reckless homicide and one misdemeanor count of passing a school bus with its arm-signal device extended.\n\nSchool bus drivers witness motorists committing similar passing violations every day, according to Frank Jackson, transportation director for Fort Wayne Community Schools. An annual survey by the Indiana Department of Education asks bus drivers to report violations observed on a single day. On April 18, drivers in the Fort Wayne district reported 158 violations, he said.\n\nAt East Allen County Schools, 70 violations were observed - 48 on rural roads and 22 on city streets, according to figures provided by Tamyra Kelly, public information officer for East Allen.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the public is in a rush,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on those important things, like a child who might be crossing the street.\u201d\n\nThe Fulton County crash occurred about 7:15 a.m. - before dawn. Citing school bus safety, a Central Time Coalition has worked since 2009 to move Indiana out of the Eastern time zone. But Jackson said he doesn\u2019t believe the change would make a difference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a factor,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been with this district 27 years. Stop-arm violations have always been a major issue - even when we weren\u2019t on daylight-saving time. The majority of violations are probably when we are delivering kids home from school.\u201d\n\nJackson noted that school buses display flashing yellow lights before pulling up to a bus stop and flashing red lights when students are entering or leaving the bus, including flashing lights on the stop arm.\n\nSome school districts have adopted another innovation: an aluminum frame extending the flashing stop-sign 61/2 feet from the bus, into the opposite traffic lane. It won\u2019t stop an inattentive driver, but it makes a stopped bus much more difficult to miss. FWCS\u2019 Jackson said he would be interested in looking at the device.\n\n\u201cI think any piece of technology or any piece of equipment that will prevent this sort of thing from happening is worth exploring,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for the Indiana Department of Education said the State School Bus Committee would have to approve use of the Extended Stop Arm, but has not done so.\n\nJeff Harris, transportation director for Guilford County Schools in Greensboro, North Carolina, said his district installed 10 of the devices as part of a statewide pilot in 2015. It clearly showed the longer stop arms helped make motorists aware of stopped buses, so his district installed an additional 140.\n\n\u201cThe device proved to be an effective tool in our efforts to reduce stop arm violations,\u201d Harris wrote in an email. \u201cThe extended stop arms were installed on buses where a violation was reported by the bus driver in previous years or where the likelihood was greater. The device does not prevent stop arm violations - each year (the) extended stop arms are hit by motorists failing to stop for a bus making a passenger stop. While the device does not prevent all violations, I remain convinced that it is an effective tool in reducing the frequency of stop arm violations.\u201d\n\nIn a pilot program earlier this year, Albemarle County Public Schools in Virginia found the number of passing violations fell by 89 percent with the longer stop arm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never know how many lives we\u2019ve saved,\u201d Transportation Director Jim Foley told a Charlottesville TV station.\n\nJust since Tuesday\u2019s deadly accident, a 9-year-old boy was struck and killed in Mississippi as he crossed a highway to catch a school bus and a 7-year-old boy died waiting at a bus stop in Pennsylvania.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb spent more than $330,000 to make handheld metal detectors available to Indiana schools after a school shooting in Noblesville last spring. He should consider an investment in school bus safety.\n\n____\n\nSouth Bend Tribune. November 1, 2018\n\nIndiana\u2019s attorney general should resign\n\nThe special prosecutor\u2019s decision announced last week means that Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill won\u2019t face criminal charges regarding sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIt does not mean \u2014 contrary to the claims of Hill\u2019s defense attorney \u2014 that he has been \u201cexonerated.\u201d\n\nNor does it mean that the distractions and concerns that have swirled around Hill since four women said he inappropriately touched them have disappeared.\n\nIn fact, Daniel Sigler, the special prosecutor investigating the allegations, said he found the witnesses to be credible, but decided \u201cthat there was no crime that could be proven.\u201d\n\nThe 25-page report released by Indiana\u2019s inspector general paints a disturbing picture of Hill\u2019s conduct during a party in March at an Indianapolis bar. Multiple witnesses stated that Hill\u2019s conduct was \u201cinappropriate, \u2018creepy,\u2019 unwelcome and made many of the women at the party uncomfortable. Men and women from both parties, the political left and political right, provided accounts of what transpired that night,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe report says that Hill\u2019s level of intoxication is supported by witness interviews and \u201cit no doubt contributed to his actions at the bar.\u201d His behavior that night left at least one woman in tears, \u201cothers were upset enough to actively avoid any contact with Hill the rest of the night, and still others sought the protection of men and other women who were there,\u201d according to the report.\n\nHill, a Republican and former Elkhart County prosecutor, has denied wrongdoing.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb and other prominent Republicans have called on Hill to resign.\n\nA brief statement released by Hill\u2019s attorneys following the special prosecutor\u2019s announcement says that \u201cMr. Hill will continue to serve the people of Indiana in the capacity for which he was elected as the Indiana Attorney General.\u201d\n\nBut just how effectively can he serve the people of Indiana, given the evidence of his shameful behavior described in the report \u2014 behavior that one witness describes as \u201clike a freshman at a college frat party\u201d? How much trust can Hoosiers place in Hill and the office he leads?\n\nWhile Hill won\u2019t face criminal charges, other legal issues lie ahead: Hill\u2019s four accusers and their attorney have announced plans to file a civil lawsuit, saying the women were victims of sexual harassment, employment retaliation and assault.\n\nHill has demonstrated that he is no longer fit to fill the role of Indiana\u2019s highest ranking law enforcement official. It\u2019s time for him to do the right thing by the people he was sworn to serve. It\u2019s time for him to resign. Failing that, lawmakers should explore the possibility of impeachment.\n\n____\n\n(Terre Haute) Tribune-Star. November 1, 2018\n\nThere is unquestionably a lot at stake in Tuesday\u2019s election, and Hoosier voters find themselves in a critical position to play a major role in the long-term political direction of our country.\n\nThe U.S. Senate race in Indiana between incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly and Republican challenger Mike Braun is tight and tense. What\u2019s more, it could decide which party controls the U.S. Senate for the next two years. That control means much to the future of Americans on issues related to health care, immigration, Social Security and Medicare, and whether Congress will truly act as a check and balance on the executive branch of government.\n\nFortunately for Hoosiers, the fundamental decision can be cut along clear lines. Joe Donnelly is a moderate who adheres to his party\u2019s principles in many areas while demonstrating independence in others. His record shows a willingness to support President Trump when he thinks his policies are good for Indiana, and isn\u2019t afraid to challenge or reject those policies when he disagrees, despite the fact Trump enjoys support here. Braun bills himself as a conservative whose sole purpose in the Senate would be to support whatever policies Trump advances.\n\nIndiana is a red state that occasionally shows an independent streak. That Donnelly was able to win a Senate seat here in 2012 against unwavering, hard-core conservative Richard Mourdock demonstrates that Hoosiers appreciate a moderate Democrat\u2019s value in their political system and trust him to exercise good judgment on the hottest of issues.\n\nDonnelly has fulfilled his promise to Hoosiers. While partisans from both sides occasionally feel frustration with him, he wields his moderate mantle consistently and understandably. Whether he sides with Republicans or Democrats on the issues before him, he earnestly explains his decisions and listens to all points of view with concern and sincerity.\n\nAmong the major issues with which Donnelly has earned Hoosiers\u2019 trust is health care. He supported the Affordable Care Act, also know as Obamacare, and has defended it against the constant assault from Republicans wanting to destroy it in any way they can despite its growing acceptance, even popularity, with voters. He is right to point out that the ACA has done great things for those who previously could not get or afford health insurance and has saved those with pre-existing conditions from being denied access to the system. He acknowledges the system can and should be improved but rejects conservative calls to repeal it outright.\n\nBraun\u2019s strength as a candidate is that his real-world experience comes from building and operating a successful private business in Jasper. He would not have had that kind of success if he didn\u2019t have considerable leadership and management skills. Voters can be confident that he has the ability to be a visionary and problem solver when confronting challenges and opportunities.\n\nStill, Braun\u2019s campaign rests on his promise to blindly support Trump and Republicans. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s a visionary and a problem solver if he isn\u2019t willing to use those skills. A willingness to simply go along with whatever GOP leaders put forward does not qualify him in any remarkable way.\n\nHoosiers have a right to demand more of their elected representatives in Congress. We endorse Donnelly for a second term in the U.S. Senate because he embraces the challenge of doing the hard work of making reasoned, sound judgments on difficult issues and not being a partisan rubber stamp.\n\nHoosiers voted for that type of open-minded, independent politician when they elected Donnelly in 2012. They got what they asked for. For his work on behalf of Hoosier voters during his first term, he deserves to be re-elected.\n\n___", "CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fox News said Tuesday that it has addressed the \u201cunfortunate distraction\u201d of Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro speaking at President Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Missouri the night before, and that it doesn\u2019t condone such behavior.\n\nThe network did not say what, if any, discipline that the two network personalities would face.\n\nMeanwhile, Hannity tweeted on Tuesday that he was being \u201c100 percent truthful\u201d earlier on Monday when he tweeted that \u201cI will not be on stage campaigning with the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president\u2019s request,\u201d Hannity tweeted. \u201cThis was NOT planned.\u201d\n\nHannity, who told the audience at Trump\u2019s rally that \u201call these people in the back are fake news,\u201d also tweeted Tuesday that he was not referring to any of his Fox News colleagues. Fox reporter Kristin Fisher, who tweeted a copy of Fox\u2019s statement on Tuesday, was covering the rally.\n\nIt\u2019s considered standard for employees of news organizations not to engage in political campaign activities so their outlets do not appear unfair; some journalists go so far as to not vote at all for this reason. Fox News resisted Monday when the Trump campaign had advertised to its followers that Hannity would appear as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the Missouri rally, saying Hannity was only there to cover the event.\n\nHannity, cable news\u2019 most popular personality and a vocal Trump defender, has twice been publicly rebuked by Fox for campaign activity. Hannity was made to cancel a 2010 appearance in Cincinnati when it was revealed he was participating in a fundraiser for the Tea Party. When he was featured in a 2016 Trump campaign video, Fox told him to never do it again.\n\nSince then, Fox opinion personalities have doubled down on their support of Trump. Already No. 1 in the cable news ratings, Fox has had a strong fall with the campaign and hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, with Hannity leading the way.\n\nCritics have claimed that Fox News Channel is less of a news organization than an arm of the Trump campaign, and Monday\u2019s rally gave them fresh ammunition. In the past, Hannity has said that he\u2019s a talk show host, not a journalist. But in an interview with The New York Times a year ago, he said he was a journalist, more specifically an advocacy or opinion journalist.\n\nHannity broadcast his show from the site of the rally Monday, where he exhorted viewers to vote Republican and echoed a Trump campaign theme seen on banners: \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d He spoke briefly on camera with Trump at the end of the show.\n\nWhen it was done, White House Communications director Bill Shine, a former Fox News Channel executive, high-fived Hannity, according to the White House pool report.\n\nTrump called Hannity to the stage after praising Fox, saying, \u201cthey\u2019re very special, they\u2019ve done an incredible job for us. They\u2019ve been with us from the beginning.\u201d Hannity hugged Trump and, after lobbing his crowd-pleasing insult at the media, recited economic statistics. Pirro, a former New York state attorney general who has a weekend show on Fox, spoke after him.\n\nTheir speeches weren\u2019t televised on Fox News, but were seen on C-SPAN.\n\nHannity\u2019s appearance meant either Fox lied Monday about its collaboration with the Trump campaign, or that it has no control over Hannity, said Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal think tank Media Matters for America, which has unsuccessfully called for an advertiser boycott of Hannity\u2019s show in the past.\n\n\u201cFox\u2019s admitted lack of control is only reinforced by the absence of sanction here,\u201d Carusone said. \u201cAnyone doing business with Fox News should worry about the network\u2019s inability to enforce even the most bare minimum standards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, whether Hannity was sanctioned or not. Fox has not addressed the question publicly.\n\nSome surprised journalists at other news organizations didn\u2019t hesitate to make their feelings known on social media. \u201cThe White House-Fox News nexus has rarely been as evident as tonight in Cape Girardeau,\u201d said Philip Rucker, White House bureau chief at The Washington Post, on Twitter.\n\nWhite House reporter Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted: \u201cStill can\u2019t get over Hannity denying he would be on stage the whole day, getting brought up by Trump, and then pointing to actual news reporters and calling them fake.\u201d\n\nAlisyn Camerota, a former Fox News anchor who now hosts a morning show on CNN, said executives at Fox \u201cknow vaguely\u201d that they\u2019re not supposed to have one of their hosts endorse a candidate or party, but that Hannity can\u2019t help himself.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a schizophrenic moment over there trying to figure out what their role is going to be with the Trump presidency,\u201d Camerota said on CNN.\n\n___\n\nWhite House correspondent Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.", "The Latest: Wyoming\u2019s Liz Cheney wins 2nd term in US House\n\nVoters fill out ballots at the Bar Nunn Fire Department Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Bar Nunn, Wyo.

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on Louisiana elections (all times local):\n\n10:37 p.m.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s secretary of state\u2019s race will be a two-person face-off between Republican Kyle Ardoin and Democrat Gwen Collins-Greenup in December.\n\nThe candidates to be Louisiana\u2019s top elections official were the top vote-getters among nine vying for the job on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. The runoff will be held Dec. 8.\n\nThe winner will fill the remaining year of the term of Republican Tom Schedler, who resigned in May after one of his employees sued him for sexual harassment.\n\nArdoin is Schedler\u2019s top aide who is working in the interim position. Though only in the job a few months, Ardoin ran as the incumbent.\n\nCollins-Greenup reached the runoff in a surprise upset of another candidate favored by the Democratic Party, Renee Fontenot Free. Collins-Greenup, a lawyer from Clinton, raised only about $3,000 for her campaign.\n\n___\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\nOnce a political upstart and now an incumbent, Republican U.S. Rep. Clay Higgins is heading back to Washington for a second term in Louisiana\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nHiggins bested six challengers in Tuesday\u2019s open primary election to keep the 3rd District seat representing southwest and south central Louisiana.\n\nThe former sheriff\u2019s captain dubbed the \u201cCajun John Wayne\u201d for his attention-grabbing Crime Stoppers segments surprised the political establishment when he won the House seat in 2016. This time, he had the backing of President Donald Trump and state GOP leaders.\n\nHiggins\u2019 opponents included Republican Josh Guillory, a Lafayette attorney and Iraq war veteran and Democrat Mimi Methvin, a former federal magistrate judge from Lafayette.\n\nThe 3rd District covers all or part of 10 parishes, including Lake Charles and most of Acadiana.\n\n__\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nLouisiana voters want to end raids on the state\u2019s Transportation Trust Fund, to keep dollars solely available for road, bridge, port and airport work.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s constitution allowed the trust fund containing state gasoline and fuel tax income to be spent on transportation projects and Louisiana State Police traffic control operations.\n\nUnder a constitutional amendment approved in Tuesday\u2019s election, state police will be removed from the list.\n\nGovernors have used the money to fill gaps in the state police budget, with an estimated $700 million diverted to state police operations since 1991.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards ended the practice, but lawmakers who sent Amendment 4 to the voters didn\u2019t want future governors and legislatures to have the option.\n\n___\n\nLarge property tax hikes in Louisiana will be slowed down, to give homeowners time to adjust.\n\nVoters in Tuesday\u2019s election supported a constitutional change that requires a four-year phase-in of higher property taxes when a tax assessor\u2019s reappraisal boosts a home\u2019s value by more than 50 percent.\n\nThe change only applies to property that qualifies for a state homestead exemption.\n\nState lawmakers approved the proposal earlier this year.\n\nSupporters of Amendment 6 said homeowners should be given time to adjust to sizable tax hikes caused by sharp upticks in home values for a neighborhood. Opponents said easing in such property tax increases will deprive local government of money they are owed, create headaches for tax collectors and continue inequities among homeowners.\n\n___\n\nLouisiana voters have decided that local government agencies should be able to share equipment and staff.\n\nConstitutional Amendment 3 allowing the donations won passage in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nThe provision addresses a Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that allowed government agencies to make such sharing agreements, but only for something equivalent in exchange.\n\nThe constitutional change will authorize donations of public equipment or personnel between agencies for a specific activity or function if they have a written agreement. Nothing of comparable value will have to be exchanged.\n\nState lawmakers approved the proposal earlier this year, placing it on the ballot.\n\n___\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House\u2019s third-ranking Republican, has beaten five opponents to win re-election to his 1st District seat representing southeast Louisiana.\n\nTuesday\u2019s victory in the open primary was Scalise\u2019s first election since he survived life-threatening injuries from a shooting at a 2017 congressional baseball practice.\n\nScalise, from Jefferson Parish, was first elected to Congress in 2008. He\u2019ll be entering his sixth term, where he\u2019s expected to advance in GOP leadership if Republicans control the House.\n\nThe congressman was confident in his re-election to represent the conservative district that covers part of New Orleans and much of the suburban New Orleans region. He spent most of the election cycle campaigning for GOP contenders elsewhere.\n\nAmong Scalise\u2019s opponents were Democrats Tammy Savoie of New Orleans and Jim Francis of Covington.\n\n___\n\n9:47 p.m.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson has defeated two opponents to retain his seat representing Louisiana\u2019s 4th Congressional District for a second term.\n\nJohnson, a former state lawmaker from Benton, easily won Tuesday\u2019s open primary election to hang onto the northwest Louisiana-based seat.\n\nHe faced little competition from his opponents: Mark David Halverson, of Bossier City, who ran without party affiliation, and Ryan Trundle, a Democrat from Shreveport. Trundle couldn\u2019t compete on the fundraising circuit, and Halverson didn\u2019t report any money raised at all.\n\nThe 4th District is largely rural, stretching from the Arkansas line into southwest Louisiana, including the Shreveport area.\n\n___\n\n9:28 p.m.\n\nDespite multiple opponents, Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves won a third term representing Louisiana\u2019s 6th District in Congress without a runoff election.\n\nGraves defeated three other candidates in Tuesday\u2019s open primary. The former congressional aide and former state coastal chief from Baton Rouge first won the seat in 2014.\n\nAmong Graves\u2019 opponents was Justin DeWitt, a Baton Rouge Democrat who described himself as the first openly gay candidate to run for a Louisiana congressional seat.\n\nAlso on the ballot were Devin Lance Graham, an independent from Gonzales, and Andie Saizan, a Democrat from Springfield. Only DeWitt and Saizan reported fundraising, but Graves\u2019 multimillion-dollar campaign account dwarfed his competitors\u2019 donations.\n\nThe 6th District includes all or part of 13 parishes, around Baton Rouge and stretching southeast into Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes.\n\n___\n\n9:22 p.m.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s property tax rules will be changing.\n\nThe state exempts the first $75,000 value of a home from property taxes. Under current laws, tax assessments are frozen for the elderly, disabled veterans and others. In addition, the state gives higher property tax breaks to homeowners who are surviving spouses of people in the military, state police, local law enforcement and firefighters who die in the line of duty.\n\nVoters in Tuesday\u2019s election backed a constitutional change, listed as Amendment 5, that will extend the existing special property tax treatments to homes that are placed into a trust.\n\nState lawmakers approved the proposal earlier this year, placing it on the ballot.\n\n___\n\n9:12 p.m.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham has cruised to a third term as congressman for Louisiana\u2019s 5th District.\n\nThough he had three opponents, Abraham easily won re-election in Tuesday\u2019s open primary for the seat representing northeast and central Louisiana.\n\nNext, he\u2019ll face questions about whether he intends to challenge Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards in the 2019 election. Abraham, a doctor from rural Richland Parish, has said he\u2019s eyeing the race.\n\nIn his re-election bid, Abraham defeated Billy Burkette, an independent from East Feliciana Parish; Jessee Fleenor, a Democrat from Tangipahoa Parish; and Kyle Randol, a Libertarian from Monroe. Only Fleenor reported campaign fundraising.\n\nThe largely rural 5th District contains all or part of 24 parishes, including parishes that run along the Mississippi state line.\n\n__\n\n9:12 p.m.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond will return to Washington for a fifth term representing Louisiana\u2019s 2nd District in Congress.\n\nRichmond, chairman of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, defeated three opponents without party affiliation in Tuesday\u2019s open primary election.\n\nThe lawmaker from New Orleans is the only Democrat and only African-American currently in Louisiana\u2019s congressional delegation. The majority-minority district he represents includes most of New Orleans, running up the Mississippi River into part of Baton Rouge.\n\nRichmond, a former state legislator elected to Congress in 2010, was deemed so safe the Republican Party didn\u2019t field a candidate against him. His opponents did little to no fundraising for their campaigns.\n\nThe three competitors were Belden \u201cNoonie Man\u201d Batiste of New Orleans, Shawndra Rodriguez of Baton Rouge, and Jesse Schmidt of Gretna.\n\n___\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nConvicted felons in Louisiana will have to wait five years after serving their sentences before they can run for office in the state.\n\nVoters in Tuesday\u2019s election agreed to Amendment 1 enacting the new prohibition in Louisiana\u2019s constitution.\n\nLouisiana had an amendment barring felons from seeking office for 15 years after serving their sentences. The state Supreme Court overturned the provision in 2016, saying voters approved a version differing from the one that lawmakers passed.\n\nLawmakers debated re-enacting the ban for several years without reaching an agreement. The five-year provision was a compromise that won final passage from the state House and Senate earlier this year, placing it on the ballot.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nPolls have closed in Louisiana\u2019s election.\n\nTop of the ballot is a special election for secretary of state, to fill the remaining year of the term of Republican Tom Schedler, who resigned in May amid a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nNine candidates are competing, including Schedler\u2019s top aide Republican Kyle Ardoin, who has been working as interim secretary of state.\n\nOther Republicans vying for the job include Turkey Creek Mayor Heather Cloud, former Sen. A.G. Crowe, Rep. Rick Edmonds and Rep. Julie Stokes. Democrats include Renee Fontenot Free, a former first assistant to two secretaries of state, and lawyer Gwen Collins-Greenup.\n\nThe race is expected to head into a Dec. 8 runoff.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s U.S. House seats also are up for grabs, with all six incumbent congressmen seeking re-election.\n\n___\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nThe chief elections official in Orleans Parish says turnout has been good and voting operations have been going smoothly.\n\nArthur Morrell says he hopes \u201csomething has shaken the voters and made them realize how important it is to vote.\u201d\n\nHowever, Morrell says his office has encountered one problem. A new charter operator took over a school on Esplanade Avenue that has been a longtime polling place. The new school management decided not to allow voters to use a school yard behind the building to park.\n\nThat\u2019s made it especially difficult for handicapped voters. He says he\u2019s working to get the situation resolved.\n\n__\n\n1:05 p.m.\n\nLots of voters in Louisiana did not get the \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers on Election Day.\n\nThe Advocate reports the secretary of state\u2019s office said in a Twitter message that \u201cbudgetary constraints\u201d prevented the office from providing the stickers for Tuesday\u2019s voting.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s 2016 \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers were an internet sensation, as they featured a George Rodrique blue dog and started selling on sites like eBay.\n\nSome votes in Lafayette did receive the more traditional \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, but many early voters did not.\n\nAfter complaints showed up on social media, the secretary of state\u2019s office said local clerks of court were responsible for providing them. But the Baton Rouge clerk of court\u2019s office said the secretary of state\u2019s office was supposed to provide them.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nNo significant problems have been reported as voters cast their ballots in Louisiana.\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s office reported only one polling location was affected because of the severe weather that moved across the state. The report says power was only out for about 15 minutes and the voting machines were not affected because of battery backups.\n\nPolls did not open as scheduled at 6 a.m. Tuesday at a middle school in the town of Iowa in Calcasieu Parish. Clerk of Court Lynn Jones says there was a miscommunication about getting the doors unlocked at J.I. Watson Middle School.\n\nVoters are taking part in a special election for secretary of state. There is also a proposed constitutional amendment to require a unanimous jury for all felony convictions.\n\n___\n\n12:45 a.m.\n\nLouisiana has one statewide position on the ballot - a special election to fill a secretary of state seat vacated because of a sexual harassment scandal.\n\nBeyond filling that elections chief job, Louisiana voters Tuesday are deciding whether to return six U.S. House incumbents to Washington for another term and whether to rewrite six provisions in the state constitution.\n\nAmong the constitutional amendments are proposals that would require unanimous jury verdicts for all felony convictions in Louisiana and would make convicted felons in Louisiana wait five years after serving their sentences before they can run for office.\n\nThe packed primary competition for secretary of state and for Louisiana\u2019s other seats has lacked the attention-grabbing nature of state races around the country.\n\nRunoff elections, as needed, will be Dec. 8.", "GREAT FALLS, Mont.

A woman later began punching Mitchell, and Longee also started attacking him.\n\nAn autopsy determined Mitchell\u2019s death was caused by \u201cmultiple blunt force injuries and neck compression.\u201d\n\nLongee is scheduled to be sentenced in February.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com", "The Associated Press has been honoring college football\u2019s best with an All-America team since 1925. The full three-team AP All-America selections will be unveiled in December. The eighth All-America watch of the season features Arizona State\u2019s top target; Alabama\u2019s dominant defensive tackle and Boise State\u2019s quarterback, all on the verge of breaking records.\n\nSPOTLIGHT\n\nN\u2019Keal Harry, WR, Arizona State\n\nHarry came into the season as one of the most highly touted receivers in the country. He has not put eye-catching numbers as Arizona State has tried to lean heavily on its running game, but he has been steady and productive. No Pac-12 receiver has been a more effective target, according to Pro Football Focus . Harry broke out with his best game of the season last week in a huge victory for the Sun Devils against Utah. The 6-foot-, 221-pound junior had nine catches for 161 yards and three touchdowns. For the season, he has 55 catches for 828 yards and nine TDs.\n\nWhat they are saying: \u201cWe didn\u2019t throw it a lot, but we made it count. N\u2019Keal\u2019s a fabulous player and he has two back-to-back games now where without his presence, it hurts you,\u201d Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said.\n\nOutlook: The Sun Devils are in the driver\u2019s seat in a cluttered Pac-12 South race. Some more big efforts from Harry could help get them to the conference title game.\n\nWHO\u2019S HOT\n\nQuinnen Williams, DT, Alabama\n\nWilliams has been hot all season , but he came up huge in Alabama\u2019s biggest game of the season so far against LSU. He had 10 tackles, seven solo stops and 2\u00bd sacks against the Tigers. The third-year sophomore entered the season without much fanfare after being a reserve for the Crimson Tide last year. The 6-foot-4, 298-pounder is talked about as the possible first overall pick in next year\u2019s NFL draft, surging past a slew of talented defensive line who will be available in April.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nEd Oliver, DT, Houston\n\nOliver figures to be high first-round draft pick by the NFL in April, and the school was promoting him as a Heisman Trophy contender coming into this season. He was mostly living up to his hype, making the midseason All-America team, but he was injured against Navy three weeks ago and has not played the Cougars\u2019 last two games. Last week he was expected to come back, but was a late scratch against SMU. The competition at defensive tackle is stiff. If Oliver misses more time, he could get shut out from postseason honors.\n\nGROUP OF FIVE STAR\n\nBrett Rypien, QB, Boise State\n\nThe senior has thrown for 2,779 yards with 24 touchdowns and six interceptions for a Broncos team that began the season with hopes of a getting into a New Year\u2019s Six bowl and the playoff discussion. That\u2019s likely gone after two losses, but the Mountain West crown is still very much in play. Rypien leads Boise State against No. 16 Fresno State this week. Last season, he threw for 246 yards against the Bulldogs tough defense, but completed only 53 percent and didn\u2019t throw a touchdown pass. He is poised to become the Mountain West career leader in yards passing and completions.\n\nON THE LINE\n\nESPN analyst Cole Cubelic, a former guard at Auburn, identifies an offensive lineman playing at an All-America level \u2014 Calvin Throckmorton, OT, Oregon.\n\nThe junior has not allowed a sack in his last 27 games.\n\n\u201cVersatile. Combines power and quickness while playing three different positions on the offensive line this season, including both tackle spots and center,\u201d Cubelic said.\n\nALL-AMERICA MATCHUP\n\nChris Lindstrom, OG, Boston College vs. Clemson DTs Dexter Lawrence and Christian Wilkins.\n\nBoston College\u2019s offensive line has been one of the best in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season and Lindstrom is its leader. The 310-pound senior is a three-year starter and expected to be one of the first guards taken in the NFL draft. Lawrence and Wilkins are both possible first-rounders, with different styles. Lawrence is massive and powerful at 340 pounds. Wilkins is a 300-pounder with rare athleticism. In a game that could decide the ACC Atlantic division, the interior line matchup will be pivotal.\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

He said he would work to ensure that peace returns to Cameroon.\n\nOpposition parties have demonstrated against Biya\u2019s re-election, and violence has increased in the country\u2019s English-speaking North West and South West regions, where the armed separatists are fighting for an independent English-speaking state.\n\nLate Sunday, 79 students and three staff members were abducted from a school near the northwestern regional capital of Bamenda.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the kidnappings and called Tuesday for the immediate release of the abducted students and adults.\n\nGuterres stressed \u201cthere can be no justification for these crimes against civilians, particularly minors,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nA video was released on social media Monday by the apparent kidnappers, showing some of the boys saying they were taken by separatists fighting to create the independent state of Ambazonia.\n\nHowever, the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatists\u2019 official organization, released a statement condemning the kidnappings and demanding freedom for people taken from the school.\n\nThe council called on the military to withdraw from the regions it calls Ambazonia, to avoid further escalation of violence.\n\nThe unrest began in November 2016 when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest began calling for reforms and greater autonomy in the largely French-speaking country.\n\nThey marched in the streets, criticizing what they called the marginalization of English speakers by French speakers. Armed separatists later took over the protests and began using violence in pursuit of their goal.\n\nFighting between the armed separatists and security forces has killed hundreds. The unrest has also forced tens of thousands to flee. The Oct. 7 presidential election saw few voters in the Anglophone regions.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the secessionists is against our constitution that consecrates the indivisible nature of our nation,\u201d Biya said at his inauguration. \u201cWe have started implementing measures to attend to the grievances raised by teachers and lawyers by accelerating the decentralization process.\u201d\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s Dujarric said Guterres reiterated the need for a peaceful solution to the crisis in the English-speaking regions \u201cthrough an inclusive dialogue process.\u201d He said the U.N. \u201cstands ready to assist in this regard.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPetesch reported from Dakar, Senegal.

China is expected to have overtaken France by then to become the world\u2019s number one destination.\n\nMuch of the sustained boom in travel and tourism, which has outpaced growth in the global economy for eight years, is centered in the Asia-Pacific region, where trips are expected to grow by 10 percent this year. The region has benefited from rapidly growing economies as well as an expanding middle class that seeks to spend disposable income on leisure.\n\nEuromonitor\u2019s senior travel analyst, Wouter Geerts, said the gradual process of loosening visa restrictions has made travelling in the region easier, with 80 percent of arrivals in Asia originating from the region. He also said sporting events will likely further boost the region, with Tokyo hosting the 2020 Summer Olympic Games and Beijing the 2022 winter event.\n\n\u201cTourism is a key pillar of the Chinese economy, and much investment has been made to improve infrastructure and standards, in addition to tourism-friendly policies and initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nOther bright spots in the forecast are countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey, which have seen sharp falls in tourist numbers over the past few years linked to security concerns.\n\nEgypt, in particular, appears to be doing well, following a long period of decline largely linked to the political upheaval since a popular uprising in 2011 and the downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula in 2015 by an affiliate of the Islamic State group, killing 224 people.\n\nThough Egypt\u2019s bookings were up 134 percent in 2017-18 from the year before, according to Euromonitor, the industry is still short of where it was in 2010. Egyptian government figures show 8 million tourists visited the country last year, way down on the 14 million recorded in 2010.\n\nEurope is also proving resilient and growing strongly despite economic and political turmoil in some countries and a slew of extremist attacks in recent years.\n\nOne source of uncertainty for the outlook centers on Brexit. A \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit, which would see Britain crashing out of the European Union in March, would see millions opt to stay at home \u2014 an estimated 5 million in 2022 \u2014 rather than book overseas holidays, the report says. That would have a ripple effect across many destinations, notably in Spain, where U.K. travelers account for around a fifth of the tourist-related revenues.\n\nEuromonitor also warned that the U.S. tourism industry could face a hit if the trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate.", "INEZ, Ky.

Hearing his first arguments in a death penalty case, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed open Tuesday to the arguments of Missouri inmate Russell Bucklew, who says his rare medical condition could result in severe pain if he is executed by lethal injection. The court's newest justice could hold the key vote in Bucklew's case. (Missouri Department of Corrections via AP File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Hearing his first arguments in a death penalty case, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed open Tuesday to the arguments of a Missouri inmate who says his rare medical condition could result in severe pain if he is executed by lethal injection.\n\nThe court\u2019s newest justice could hold the key vote in Russell Bucklew\u2019s case. That\u2019s because his eight colleagues split 4 to 4 earlier this year over whether to allow Bucklew\u2019s execution to proceed. Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the fifth vote to spare Bucklew. Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy, who retired in July.\n\nBucklew, on death row for a 1996 murder, has said that a tumor in his throat is likely to burst during the lethal injection procedure, causing him to choke on his own blood. Bucklew argues that subjecting him to lethal injection would violate the Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAmong the questions Kavanaugh wanted answered was whether Bucklew would be lying flat during the execution, which Bucklew\u2019s attorneys have said would be problematic. Kavanaugh, who heard no death penalty cases in his 12 years as an appeals court judge, also asked whether there\u2019s any legal limit on pain associated with an execution. The justice also aimed all his questions at the lawyer representing Missouri, which can be a sign at the Supreme Court that a justice is inclined to vote for the other side.\n\n\u201cAre you saying even if the method creates gruesome and brutal pain you can still do it because there\u2019s no alternative?\u201d Kavanaugh at one point asked Missouri\u2019s attorney, D. John Sauer. He later asked Sauer: \u201cYour opposing counsel said, even if everything goes according to plan, there will still be significant suffering. Can you respond to that?\u201d\n\nBucklew is up against Supreme Court precedent in trying to get the justices to agree with him. The court has previously ruled that inmates challenging a method of execution have to show that there\u2019s an alternative that is likely to be less painful. Bucklew has proposed that Missouri execute him by having him breathe pure nitrogen gas through a mask instead of by injecting him with a lethal dose of pentobarbital.\n\nBucklew says it is likely he would feel as though he\u2019s suffocating for several minutes during a lethal injection execution. He says if the state uses nitrogen gas, he\u2019d become unconscious within 20 to 30 seconds.\n\nMissouri says no state has ever carried out an execution as Bucklew suggests, calling his proposal vague and untested. And the state says Bucklew would not suffer severe pain during a lethal injection execution because pentobarbital would make him unconscious within 20 to 30 seconds, likely sooner.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts suggested Bucklew\u2019s proposed alternative wasn\u2019t reasonable, asking \u201chow can it be a reasonable alternative if it\u2019s never been used before?\u201d Roberts was one of the four justices who would have let Bucklew\u2019s execution proceed earlier this year. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch also would have allowed it to go forward.\n\nBucklew\u2019s lawyer Robert Hochman told the justices that his client\u2019s medical condition has changed since the court agreed to take his case. He told the justices that Bucklew now has a tracheostomy tube to help him breathe. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the four liberal justices who stopped Bucklew\u2019s execution, wanted to know how that didn\u2019t alleviate concerns about Bucklew choking on his own blood during a lethal injection execution. Hochman said it\u2019s not clear how long the tube will remain in and that even if it does \u201cthere would still be complications that would need to be investigated.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer suggested holding a new hearing to determine whether \u201cthere really is a special problem\u201d in Bucklew\u2019s case.\n\nBucklew is on death row for the 1996 murder of Michael Sanders, who was living with Bucklew\u2019s former girlfriend. After entering a trailer where the two were living with their children, Bucklew fatally shot Sanders and later raped his former girlfriend. Bucklew was arrested after a car chase and shootout with police.\n\nA decision in Bucklew v.

On Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, the Labor Department reports on job openings and labor turnover for September. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The number of jobs posted by U.S. employers declined slightly in September but still exceeded the number of unemployed Americans and remained near a two-decade high.\n\nThe report Tuesday from the Labor Department provided the latest evidence that many U.S. companies are straining to fill jobs in the face of a robust job market with low unemployment.\n\nThe department said job openings declined 4 percent to roughly 7 million, still close to the highest levels on records dating to December 2000. The number of openings far exceeded the roughly 6 million people who were unemployed in September.\n\nThe number of available jobs, in fact, has topped the number of unemployed for six straight months. Steadily strong hiring has lowered the U.S. unemployment rate to a nearly five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nAnd wages have begun picking up. Average hourly pay rose 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the fastest year-over-year gain since 2009, the year the Great Recession ended.\n\nEven with the dip in job openings in September, hiring remains robust. In October, U.S. employers added a strong 250,000 jobs, the government reported last week.\n\nIn September, the number of people who quit their jobs was essentially unchanged at around 3.6 million, a record high. A high number of people quitting their jobs is typically an encouraging sign: Most people quit when they have another job lined up or are confident they can find one.\n\nTuesday\u2019s figures come from the government\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, which tracks the number of openings, quits and hires. They showed several industries with a particular abundance of openings:\n\nTrade, transportation and utilities; professional and business services, which include many higher-paying positions in engineering, accounting and architecture, as well as temporary help; education and health services; health care and social assistance; and hospitality and leisure.\n\nA slight pickup in inflation has eroded some of the value of higher pay. And a storm-related drop in average wages a year ago, resulting from Hurricane Harvey, helped inflate October\u2019s average hourly pay gain.\n\nStill, a broadening rise in wages suggests that the benefits of a healthy economy have been rippling out to more people. A more dynamic job market, with more people quitting and finding new work, typically helps produce higher pay.\n\nWith the economy growing at a brisk pace and consumers spending freely, employers are generally optimistic about customer demand and want to hire more.\n\nEmployers hired about 5.7 million people in September, down slightly from 5.9 million in August. The new hiring was close to record levels, partly reflecting population growth. The percentage of the workforce that found jobs in September slipped to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in August.", "BOULDER, Colo.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Christian Pulisic is scheduled to be back with the U.S. national team, while Michael Bradley was dropped again just a month after his return.\n\nEntering what are likely his final matches in charge of the Americans, interim coach Dave Sarachan announced a 28-man roster Tuesday for exhibitions at England on Nov. 15 and against Italy five days later at Genk, Belgium.\n\nPulisic has played just once for the U.S. since the October 2017 loss at Trinidad and Tobago that ended the Americans\u2019 streak of seven straight World Cup appearances, a May 28 exhibition against Bolivia at Chester, Pennsylvania, near his home in Hershey. The 20-year-old midfielder has missed games because of injuries and wanting at times to concentrate on his career at Borussia Dortmund in Germany.\n\nSarachan has given debuts to 22 players in 10 matches since taking over when Bruce Arena quit after the defeat in Trinidad, but last month he brought back the 31-year-old Bradley and 34-year-old goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Sarachan kept Guzan for these games but didn\u2019t see a need for Bradley.\n\n\u201cHaving earned 142 caps, his need for these games is far less important than it would be for players with less experience,\u201d Sarachan said. \u201cSecondly, Michael\u2019s schedule the past two years with Toronto FC has been virtually nonstop and he has largely played without a break.\u201d\n\nRomain Gall, a 23-year-old midfielder with Sweden\u2019s Malmo, is the lone player on the roster with no international experience.\n\nThese are the last matches this year for the Americans. Earnie Stewart, the new men\u2019s team general manager, has said a new coach will be hired by the end of the year.\n\nMidfielders Weston McKennie and Tyler Adams also are returning from injuries. Adams, a New York Red Bulls star, is among seven players still involved in Major League Soccer\u2019s playoffs, joined by Red Bulls defender Aaron Long, Atlanta goalkeeper Brad Guzan and midfielder Darlington Nagbe, Columbus goalkeeper Zack Steffen and midfielder Wil Trapp, and Portland left back Jorge Villafana. Sarachan picked a larger roster than usual because six of the MLS players have Sunday night games and will arrive late.\n\nSebastian Lletget is on the roster, and the 26-year-old midfielder could play for the U.S. for the first time since injuring his left foot during a March 2017 World Cup qualifier against Honduras. He attended a September training camp but left because of an abdominal injury.\n\nGoalkeeper Ethan Horvath also returns and could play for the first time since Sarachan\u2019s first game, a 1-1 tie at Portugal last November.\n\nColumbus\u2019 Gyasi Zardes, the top American scorer in MLS this season, was bypassed.\n\nFifteen of the players are based in Europe, 17 are 23 or younger and 18 have made 10 international appearances or fewer. The average age is 23 years, 241 days.\n\nThe roster:\n\nGoalkeepers: Brad Guzan (Atlanta), Ethan Horvath (Club Brugge, Belgium), Zack Steffen (Columbus)\n\nDefenders: John Brooks (Wolfsburg, Germany), Reggie Cannon (Dallas), Cameron Carter-Vickers (Swansea, Wales), Aaron Long (New York Red Bulls), Matt Miazga (Nantes, France), Shaq Moore (Reus Deportiu, Spain), Antonee Robinson (Wigan, England), Jorge Villafana (Portland), DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle United, England), Walker Zimmerman (LA FC)\n\nMidfielders: Kellyn Acosta (Colorado), Tyler Adams (New York Red Bulls), Luca de la Torre (Fulham, England), Marky Delgado (Toronto), Romain Gall (Malmo, Sweden), Julian Green (Greuther Fuerth, Germany), Sebastian Lletget (LA Galaxy), Weston McKennie (Schalke, Germany), Darlington Nagbe (Atlanta), Christian Pulisic (Borussia Dortmund, Germany), Kenny Saief (Anderlecht, Belgium), Wil Trapp (Columbus), Tim Weah (Paris Saint-Germain, France)\n\nForwards: Josh Sargent (Werder Bremen, Germany), Bobby Wood (Hannover, Germany)\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "PEORIA, Ill.

The unofficial results have Harris with a lead of about 1,850 votes from almost 280,000 ballots cast in the race. Absentee ballots will continue to trickle in this week.\n\nThe current margin between Harris and McCready means McCready could seek a recount.\n\nRepublicans have held the 9th District seat since the early 1960s. Harris is a Baptist minister who upset Rep. Robert Pittenger in the May GOP primary. McCready is an Iraq War veteran and solar energy investment firm owner whose campaign outraised Harris.\n\n___\n\n11:55 p.m.\n\nNorth Carolina Democrats have won enough state House seats to end the Republicans\u2019 veto-proof control, handing Gov. Roy Cooper more leverage to fight right-leaning policies and press his agenda.\n\nDemocrats won at least 49 of 120 House seats on Tuesday \u2014 one more than was needed to end the GOP\u2019s supermajority in the chamber. The supermajority had allowed Republicans to override Cooper vetoes at will.\n\nDemocrats needed to pick up at least four House seats to help the Democratic governor, who\u2019s been hamstrung by the General Assembly since he was elected in 2016. Republican lawmakers have eroded his powers and avoided his proposals on teacher pay, expanding Medicaid and blocking recent tax cuts.\n\nDemocrats could strengthen their hand further if they pick up enough Senate seats to end the GOP\u2019s supermajority there.\n\n___\n\n11:45 p.m.\n\nU.S. Rep.

Critics said the result could mean that a recession could lead legislators to raise sales or property taxes or impose cutbacks on education, safety and other government services.\n\nA constitutional change that would expand guarantees to crime victims was approved in exchange for a predicted cost of about $11 million per year.\n\nNorth Carolinians also approved enshrining hunting and fishing with undefined \u201ctraditional methods,\u201d but also limited those rights to take wildlife to laws the General Assembly adopts.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nA new constitutional amendment will require North Carolina voters to show a photo ID before being allowed to cast ballots, but legislators will decide later what will count as valid and what won\u2019t.\n\nA change to North Carolina\u2019s constitution approved Tuesday adds the state to the handful in the country that strictly require showing a photo ID to a poll worker when voting.\n\nSome of the states allow exceptions to the law if people have religious objections to being photographed, are poor, or are granted special confidentiality as domestic abuse or stalking victims.

In 2016, Republicans held a 4-3 advantage.\n\nEarls led the Southern Coalition for Social Justice when she helped sue over legislative and congressional districts and challenged a voter ID law.\n\nJackson and Anglin both ran as Republicans in the officially partisan election, but legislators cancelled party primaries this year, leading to multiple candidates.\n\nAnglin was a registered Democrat but switched parties just before filing.

Appointments to the board were traditionally overseen by the state\u2019s governors before lawmakers began taking steps in the past two years to reduce the governor\u2019s role in the process.\n\nThe amendment was opposed by all living governors, both Republican and Democrat.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote came after a legal battle between Republican legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper over the board. The state Supreme Court struck down a 2017 law establishing a politically divided eight-member board because it took executive authority from governors.\n\n___\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nA Republican congressman has won his fourth term in office as voters selected him over a Democratic challenger and small business owner to represent North Carolina\u2019s 8th District.\n\nU.S. Rep.

His campaign website said he was invited to speak at this year\u2019s National Rifle Association convention, along with President Donald Trump.\n\nOn his campaign website, McNeill stressed his support of affordable health care, along with public schools and the environment.

Judges who fill vacant seats now can serve only until the next election, meaning two years or less.\n\nThe change also could have weakened gubernatorial powers because governors wouldn\u2019t be able to veto legislation filling a judicial vacancy, giving lawmakers a way to push through new issues.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nNorth Carolina polls have closed across the state.\n\nPeople waiting in line at the 2,700 precincts statewide at the 7:30 p.m. closing time are still able to vote.\n\nTwo voting locations will remain open a little longer after some delays earlier in the day.\n\nThe state elections board voted to keep a Tabor City precinct site open until after 9 p.m. It opened Tuesday morning lacking one of three ballot styles that precinct voters can cast there. And a Gastonia precinct will accept voters 20 minutes longer after it was evacuated when a fire alarm sounded at the polling site.\n\nNorth Carolina voters are choosing all 170 members of the General Assembly and members of North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation.

With more Democrats elected, she said, \u201cWe can have our voices heard.\u201d\n\nBeckett said she doesn\u2019t feel like she has a voice in the country\u2019s direction right now because everything Trump says or does, \u201ceverybody goes along with it, and it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d\n\n___\n\n4:36 p.m.\n\nBob Jenkins says there are some instances where he will go against his Democratic leaning and vote for Republicans, but the Raleigh attorney says when it comes to legislative and congressional races, he\u2019s sticking with his allegiance in the 2018 elections.\n\n\u201cBut when it comes to the state House, state Senate, U.S. House, U.S. Senate, there aren\u2019t any Republicans now who voice any type of approach that I find appropriate or even what would be beneficial to us,\u201d said Jenkins, 56.\n\nHe grew up in a Democratic home. His mother was a two-term clerk of court in Rutherford County when he was a teenager.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been around politics all my life and grew up in an era where, of course when I was a kid, the Democratic Party ruled,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThings have changed, but I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m a stronger Democrat now than I used to be, given what\u2019s going on in the broader picture.\u201d\n\nJenkins said he was also troubled by the six constitutional amendments up for a vote in North Carolina on Tuesday, specifically the amendments lowering a cap on income tax rates and the right to hunt and fish.\n\n\u201cBut a constitutional amendment protecting hunting and fishing . . . to me, that\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cHunting and fishing are not in danger.

I would prefer that it be primarily bipartisan. It should be even so they have to get the other side. Since it doesn\u2019t work that way, you have to play within the system. . . . To me, it shouldn\u2019t tilt left or right, it should be teamwork.\u201d\n\nHe said he wasn\u2019t voting on any particular issues but mainly on the issue that no Republicans will stand up to Trump \u201ceven though he\u2019s not going right.\u201d He said with Trump in office, \u201cthe Republicans are scared to speak up on issues they were vocal about before.

Fifteen years after becoming the first woman to qualify for a PGA event in 58 years, Whaley is expected to be elected on Friday as the first female president of the PGA of America. (Traci Edwards/PGA of America via AP)\n\nTwo moments of discrimination took place 1,000 miles and worlds apart, neither pointing to Suzy Whaley making history this week at the PGA of America.\n\nWhaley was just getting hooked on golf in Syracuse, New York, and she was good enough to compete in tournaments when her name was scratched off the entry list of a junior tournament for boys because she was a girl.\n\n\u201cAnd now I\u2019ve played in a PGA Tour event,\u201d said Whaley, who at the 2003 Greater Hartford Open became the first woman in 58 years to qualify for a PGA Tour event. \u201cLook how far we\u2019ve gone. It\u2019s not where we need to be, but we\u2019re making progress. And that makes me smile.\u201d\n\nAround the time Whaley had her first whiff of discrimination as a young girl, Barrie Naismith Jeffcoat was working at a golf club in Atlanta as a 29-year-old woman who was giving lessons and going nowhere.\n\nShe hired young men to handle the carts and pick up golf balls from the range. Some of them went on to become PGA professionals and got jobs at other clubs.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t join the PGA as a certified pro because she was a woman.\n\n\u201cSomething was wrong with this picture,\u201d Naismith Jeffcoat said in a telephone interview Monday from her home in Virginia. \u201cAt the time I was giving lessons to Superior Court Judge (Joel) Fryer. He gave me the name of his attorney. The attorney advised me to call the PGA. I got a lawyer on the phone with the PGA and he told me, \u2018You can call Jimmy Carter, but it won\u2019t do you any good.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead of calling the president, she filed a lawsuit against the PGA in 1978. By the end of the year, the PGA signed the Naismith Consent Degree, giving women equal rights to become PGA professionals. Naismith became the first female member on Feb. 1, 1979.\n\nShe stayed with the PGA a few more years, yet the impact will be felt strongest this week at the PGA of America\u2019s annual meeting in California.\n\nWhaley is set to become the first female president in its 102-year history.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so thrilled she\u2019ll have a high profile,\u201d said Naismith Jeffcoat, who has never met Whaley. \u201cThere will be a lot of young women that will take up the game and want to be involved. It\u2019s very exciting to me to see it come to fruition.\u201d\n\nWhaley is a consensus-builder, perhaps her greatest asset.\n\nShe is foremost a golf professional, still giving private lessons at Suzy Whaley Golf, the course she owns in Cromwell, Connecticut, and serving as PGA director of instruction at the Country Club of Mirasol in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, during the winter months. Her husband, Bill, was her first golf coach. Both her daughters played in college.\n\n\u201cMy strength would be that I love the game of golf. I want to get clubs in people\u2019s hands,\u201d said Whaley, recently certified as a master professional. \u201cMy vision for the membership is to help enhance their careers. How can we get them resources and tools to go where they want to go?\u201d\n\nShe also recognizes the historic occasion of the annual meeting Friday, and she doesn\u2019t take it lightly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely historic, and I\u2019m honored and completely grateful the membership has that faith and trust,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at myself as a PGA professional first. Obviously, I\u2019m a woman. I understand the moniker. There are women who have paved the way before me.\u201d\n\nOne was Renee Powell, who last year was inducted into the PGA of America Hall of Fame. Another was Sue Fiscoe, who ran unsuccessfully for national office at the PGA in 2012, which motivated Whaley to run herself two years later.\n\nWhaley rose to national prominence when she won the Connecticut PGA section in 2002, earning a spot in the Greater Hartford Open. That\u2019s what inspired Annika Sorenstam to say she would accept an invitation to a PGA Tour event, which she received within weeks at the Colonial. Sorenstam played two months before Whaley.\n\nHer name recognition might have received a boost when weeks before Whaley\u2019s election as secretary in 2014, Ted Bishop was ousted as PGA president for calling Ian Poulter a \u201cLil girl\u201d during a social media rant.\n\nBut while Naismith Jeffcoat caused consternation in some circles \u2014 after she joined the PGA of America, two men threatened to sue to join the LPGA \u2014 Whaley received 53 percent of the votes from PGA delegates, only three of whom were women, and won election by 19 percentage points.\n\nAfter two years as secretary and two years as vice president, it\u2019s time for the 51-year-old Whaley to lead the 29,000 men and women at the PGA of America. She didn\u2019t want to be president because she\u2019s a woman.\n\nShe still understands the moment in front of her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to have a seat at the table, a voice in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at it as male or female. I felt I had something to contribute. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not difficult. It\u2019s an enormous opportunity for equality, and to showcase to women what they can do.

Nov. 3, 2018.\n\nRevising the 14th Amendment: Campaign tactic for the midterms or earnest policy? With this president and his preference for playing to crowds rather than studied governance, who can tell? This much we know: Republicans and conservatives repeatedly howled that President Obama was constitutionally wrong to use a 2012 executive order to delay deportation of certain individuals brought to the United States illegally as children. If that was indeed a lawless undertaking, then by simple logic President Trump\u2019s vow to use another executive order to overturn a constitutional amendment must also be illegal. Or are the president and his supporters guilty of double standards?\n\nAlong with the 13th and 15th, the 14th Amendment is one of the great legacies of the Republican Party, at least when it pursued the policies of Lincoln in the 1860s and early 1870s. Ratified in 1868, the 14th was meant to combat \u201cblack codes\u201d enacted across the South to relegate newly freed African Americans to secondary status and prevent them from doing everything from voting to owning firearms. The amendment stated that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States\u201d automatically became citizens of the United States as well as residents of the state in which they lived. While the South continued to resist this great rebirth of freedom, the 14th Amendment allowed the courts to increasingly safeguard all minority rights.\n\nWe\u2019re not surprised some dedicated conservatives express grave reservations about any president using an executive order to negate or revise a constitutional amendment. After all, if one president can legally negate or revise a constitutional amendment \u2014 the law of the land \u2014 and the high court backs this up, you set up a legal precedent for negating or revising other constitutional amendments. Say, the Second Amendment.\n\nOf course, court rulings have repeatedly made clear not even the most fundamental constitutional amendments are absolute, which is why you can\u2019t incite a mob under the First Amendment right to free speech \u2014 and why background checks and certain weapon bans are permissible despite the Second Amendment. But the Founding Fathers intended the business of revising the Constitution to involve plenty of stakeholder engagement \u2014 not the sweep of a pen in the Oval Office on the impulse of any president.\n\nAt the least, reinterpreting provisions of the 14th Amendment should require thoughtful congressional consideration and approval; at best, the matter should go to the people, as the Founders intended. (This constitutional principle seems to escape State Attorney General Ken Paxton; champions of the Constitution should keep this in mind when voting on Tuesday.) Of threats to tweak or revise or tinker with the 14th Amendment, however accomplished, one should also keep in mind that it could set a precedent in which the powerful and the entitled begin consigning fellow citizens and their progeny to sub-citizen status for all sorts of wrong-headed or questionable reasons. And thereby our great republic perishes.\n\n___\n\nVictoria Advocate. Nov. 3, 2018.\n\nCity of Victoria officials need to open their eyes to the role they can play in the affordable housing crisis plaguing our community.\n\nThis is by no means a simple problem that anyone should expect government alone to fix. But city leaders can take the lead in, first, acknowledging the problem exists and, next, accepting they have a job to do in addressing it.\n\nOne simple, key step the city needs to take immediately is to form a quasi-governmental committee to work with nonprofit and business leaders to identify ways to boost housing that people can afford. This is a move that would cost zero tax dollars but would provide some of the leadership needed to address the city\u2019s critical housing shortage.\n\nThe need ought to be painfully apparent to anyone looking at what\u2019s \u201cHidden in Plain Sight\u201d \u2014 the title of this newspaper\u2019s ongoing special series about economic inequality intensified by Hurricane Harvey. About half of the community\u2019s renters spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. The 30 percent figure is a widely accepted percentage for a household to be financially stable.\n\nWhen households are financially vulnerable, whether to hurricanes or medical catastrophes, the community suffers greatly. For example, one of the first expenses people cut is health insurance. Along with leaving families vulnerable, the lack of health insurance hits Victoria County taxpayers hard. Last year, the county-owned Citizens Medical Center saw its charity care costs soar 33 percent.\n\nMany other compelling fiscal arguments abound. Prevention is much cheaper than law enforcement and other public costs incurred when families and individuals suffer. For example, a commission in Central Florida estimated that the region spends $31,000 a year per homeless person because of the costs of law enforcement, jail stays, hospitalization and emergency room visits. By comparison, it costs $10,000 to put that same person experiencing homelessness into a house and give him or her a caseworker.\n\nSome City Council members have argued the government has no place in providing housing. This is highly selective reasoning. The same council members have no qualms about spending millions of dollars to build a new road \u2014 Placido Benavides Drive \u2014 because they think it will spur retail sales. Since it was founded in 1982, the public-private partnership known as the Victoria Economic Development Corp. has received up to several hundred thousands of tax dollars each year because the city and county hope this investment will generate new jobs.\n\nDuring the past decade, council members have spent about $1 million supporting the Texas Zoo because they think the educational and entertainment opportunities it provides are important to Victoria\u2019s quality of life. Shortly before Hurricane Harvey hit, council members also decided to take on the operation of the financially struggling Riverside Golf Course because this is considered an essential city amenity. Another significant public expense each year is the annual street party known as Bootfest.\n\nThe list of choices for spending goes on and on. All of the items listed above come with strong arguments supporting the public investment. Not one is stronger than the argument for a city investing in the basic need of adequate shelter for its residents.\n\nThe good news is many of the steps the city can take don\u2019t have to cost money. For one, the city could examine ways to boost the number of affordable rental units by removing barriers to construction, such as offering incentives for development through density bonuses, tax abatements or fee waivers. The Washington Area Housing Partnership is one of many examples of a public-private partnership promoting affordable housing. The city, county and the Golden Crescent Regional Planning Commission should study the toolkit offered by the Washington partnership and look around the country for other best practices.\n\nConsidered creatively, this effort could coincide with other city priorities, such as revitalizing downtown. Affordable housing doesn\u2019t have to mean only subsidized or big apartment buildings. Instead, the city could offer incentives for the development of duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes in existing single-family neighborhoods such as downtown, where experts agree a higher population density is needed to support more businesses there.\n\nTo get started, the city needs to understand that thoughtful and reasonable governmental policies are a hand up, not a handout, to those in need. The middle class is the backbone of every community, and Victoria\u2019s working class is being strained beyond its limits. If the city doesn\u2019t act soon and smartly, the crisis will only deepen.\n\nIf that happens, what\u2019s hidden in plain sight will become impossible to ignore.\n\n___\n\nSan Antonio Express-News. Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nSending 5,200 troops to the border \u2014 up to 15,000 ultimately, says President Donald Trump \u2014 represents an escalation intended to convey a war footing. And the president\u2019s own words reinforce this. The approaching caravan (actually, more than one) represents an \u201cinvasion.\u201d And without proof, the president has claimed that among the Central American migrants are \u201cunknown Middle Easterners,\u201d gang members and other criminals.\n\nGot it? Armed federal troops \u2014 not just National Guard members \u2014 are needed because dangerous invaders approach. We are at war!!!\n\nBut if these migrants are armed, this has escaped notice despite extensive news coverage and scrutiny by Mexican authorities. The travelers are mostly destitute families, with children, seeking better lives and fleeing violence in their own countries. They are traveling together because there is strength in numbers, protection against the traditional predators arrayed against them on journeys through Mexico.\n\nAnd, yes, one group of them recently stormed the Mexico-Guatemala border. And Hondurans clashed with Mexican police. That signals the desperate straits from which they are fleeing. And none of this warrants the largest peacetime deployment of U.S. troops at the border since Pancho Villa led a violent incursion into Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916.\n\nThe United States has an obligation to safeguard its borders. It has the largest law enforcement entity in the federal government \u2014 the Border Patrol \u2014 to do that, already aided by the National Guard. And that\u2019s the point. This is a law enforcement duty, not a military one.\n\nThere will be rules of engagement. The troops, less bellicose elements in the administration than the president himself insists, will be there only in supportive roles \u2014 not to engage or administer the migrants.\n\nBut using such a blunt instrument as the military to, essentially, enforce civilian law carries a risk. With blunt instruments, things have the potential to get hammered, exacerbated now that the president has essentially said troops should fire on rock-throwers.\n\nThe fact is that, with some 50,000 apprehensions at the border monthly, these traveling migrants represent only a fraction. Moreover, while apprehensions have been up lately, they are still part of a downward trend since 2000. And walking up to the border to seek asylum is legal, though the president says he will make it harder for immigrants to apply for asylum and erect huge tent cities to house those detained.\n\nStay tuned for all the legal challenges. It is not at all clear that the asylum limitation in particular is legal.\n\nMr. President: We are not at war. With this fearmongering, you are playing with fire.\n\n___\n\nThe Dallas Morning News.

Greg Abbott recently sent a letter to U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson requesting nearly $371 million to \u201cjumpstart a strong recovery\u201d from June floods that imparted heavy damage throughout the Rio Grande Valley. We hope Carson sees fit to allocate the funds, taking to heart the governor\u2019s statement that \u201d(t)his is a community of limited resources that would greatly benefit\u201d from the help.\n\nAny HUD funding sent here could be used to repair infrastructure damaged by the rains and subsequent flooding. It certainly would help; although President Trump issued a disaster declaration for Cameron, Hidalgo and Jim Wells counties following the floods, the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied requests from local city and county governments for funding to make such repairs, although the agency did issue about $30 million to individual homeowners and businesses.\n\nWithout infrastructure improvements to reduce the risk of future flooding, however, any repairs funded by those individual grants could last only until the next major storm.\n\nAny recovery from such major events \u2014 in fact, all utilization of taxpayers\u2019 money \u2014 should strive to be as efficient as possible, and reduce the need for future allocations. Thus, improvements to drainage systems and other infrastructure can be a one-time expense that can reduce the need for repeated homeowner claims from storm damage to personal property that might have been reduced if not eliminated by the infrastructure improvements.\n\nNot to mention the incidental and indirect costs that potholes and other defects from storms and floods inevitably create. In addition to the hazards of hitting such obstacles unexpectedly, studies have shown that damaged roads create millions of dollars in hidden costs by damaging cars and other vehicles, in addition to the obvious safety hazards. Alignment problems, damaged suspensions and cracked windshields are just some of the costs drivers must endure, and that are hard to prove are directly related to road hazards created or worsened by storms.\n\nGov. Abbott noted in his letter that he understands that the state must compete with claims from other areas for limited funds, and some events, such as the recent hurricane damage to northern Florida or similar flooding in Central Texas, received more national attention. But the needs in the Valley are just as real as they are in those areas.

Nov. 5, 2018.\n\n\u2014 Vian school board allows Native American students to wear eagle feathers in graduation ceremonies\n\nWe commend the Vian School Board for its decision to allow Native American students to wear eagle feathers to graduation ceremonies.\n\nThe district refused a Cherokee student\u2019s request to wear an eagle feather at the end-of-school ceremony last year and was considering doing the same thing with a second student this year.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation got involved in the issue. While conceding that a federal court had found in a previous comparable case that refusing to allow eagle feathers at graduation was not a violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s guarantee of religious freedom, the tribe said Vian should accommodate the student\u2019s religious traditions because it is the right thing to do.\n\nState records from 2016 show 41 percent of Vian students are Native American.\n\nThe deciding voice turned out to be that of Attorney General Mike Hunter, who wrote a formal letter to the school board, pointing out that the Oklahoma Religious Freedom Act \u201cgenerally requires public schools to permit Cherokee students to engage in the spiritual practice of wearing eagle feathers to important events, such as graduations.\u201d\n\nWhen it read Hunter\u2019s letter, the school board made room for the eagle feather at graduation.\n\nTribe officials said they hope Vian\u2019s decision, and the attorney general\u2019s stance, will influence other school districts to allow feathers at important events.

Oklahoma Department of Transportation will take down the east side first and rebuild it, before moving traffic to that side in order to rebuild the other half.\n\nThe demolition work will affect Chestnut, which goes under the overpass. Beginning Wednesday, Chestnut will be closed, ODOT officials said, to allow for removal of the bridge deck. Work is expected to be completed by Friday.\n\nCity of Enid engineering officials said Chestnut will be accessible by way of Poplar, intersecting with Van Buren and the west frontage road.\n\nThe $10.9 million contract for the work was awarded by ODOT in June to Bridges Inc. doing business as Scudder Bridge Co. of Newton, Kansas. There\u2019s a 15-month estimate for construction to be complete.\n\nThe work definitely is needed. The bridge was built in 1957 and has been deemed structurally deficient.

Nov. 6, 2018.\n\n\u2014 Social media giants\u2019 record not improving\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, it became clear social media sites had been used to spread false information, including bogus ads placed by foreign entities. Social media companies promised to clean up their act, but the events of the 2018 campaign cycle suggest that was more lip service than serious commitment.\n\nSocial media sites continued to promote paid advertisements with little basis in reality. And when tech companies did reject ads, the decisions appeared driven by partisanship, not any combating of false claims.\n\nThe most notable rejection occurred earlier this year when Elizabeth Heng, a Republican congressional candidate in California, tried to place a video ad that provided her basic biography and platform. The video, titled \u201cGreat things come from great adversity,\u201d began with the story of her parents\u2019 escape from the Cambodian genocide, illustrated by historic photos. Facebook refused to place the ad, saying it violated the company\u2019s advertising policies, which ban ads that contain \u201cshocking\u201d content or depict \u201cviolence or threats of violence.\u201d Twitter also banned the ad, saying it had \u201cinappropriate\u201d content.\n\nThat produced well-deserved blowback since both social media giants were banning an ad for distributing accurate historical information. The companies soon backed down.\n\nContrast the scrutiny Heng\u2019s ad received with that given to another ad distributed in the final days of the 2018 campaign. It warned hunters that if they voted in North Dakota\u2019s elections, \u201cyou may forfeit licenses you have in other states.\u201d That was news to North Dakota\u2019s secretary of state and the state\u2019s wildlife department. The ad was traced to the North Dakota Democratic Party; the state\u2019s incumbent Democratic U.S. senator was in a tough re-election race.\n\nFacebook verified the hunter ad, even though it contained false information and may have violated election laws since it appeared designed to suppress voter turnout. One wonders how Facebook officials could look at the ad and not blink, given how improbable its claims were, yet conclude that the child of Cambodian immigrants discussing her family\u2019s history was inappropriate.\n\nThe hunter ad wasn\u2019t the only instance of ridiculous content getting by the supposedly heightened review of social media giants.\n\nVice News, posing as a political ad-buyer, received Facebook\u2019s approval to run ads in the name of all 100 members of the U.S. Senate. Vice News also received approval from Facebook to run ads \u201cpaid for\u201d by Islamic State and Vice President Mike Pence. Again, how is it that such ads don\u2019t raise red flags with Facebook reviewers when other ads that are far more innocuous are declared problematic?\n\nIn June, when Gallup and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation released survey information on Americans\u2019 views of media, the poll found U.S. adults believe that 62 percent of news in newspapers, television or radio is biased, 44 percent is inaccurate, and more than a third is misinformation. But the ratings for social media outlets were worse.

The constitutional change now requires all state taxes and fees imposed for transportation needs, including public transportation and improvements and maintenance of roads and bridges, is spent on those purposes.\n\nWhile some Republican state legislators have complained the language isn\u2019t strict enough to prevent future raids by the General Assembly, Senate Republican leader Len Fasano supported the measure, saying it\u2019s a good start.\n\nIt comes as Connecticut faces hundreds of millions of dollars in needed transportation infrastructure fixes.\n\n___\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nU.S. Rep.

He said he stepped up when nobody else was willing to challenge the incumbent, but he was promised help that never materialized.\n\nCourtney has emphasized his efforts as a member of the House Armed Services Committee to bolster submarine construction at Electric Boat in Groton and the nearby Navy base.\n\nAlso on the ballot were Green Party candidate Michelle Louise Bicking and Daniel Reale, a libertarian.\n\n___\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nThe Secretary of the State\u2019s office says some new, first-time voters in New Haven have been allowed to vote after swearing as a group they\u2019ve never been registered to vote before in Connecticut.\n\nSpokesman Gabe Rosenberg says there was a long line Tuesday at the city\u2019s registrar\u2019s office, where only two people were working. He says the city\u2019s election staff asked state officials for guidance.\n\nWhile the new voters\u2019 ballots will count, he says they\u2019ve been separated \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Bob Stefanowski\u2019s campaign has raised concerns about a \u201cmass swearing in\u201d of new voters in New Haven and at the University of Connecticut, claiming it\u2019s illegal.\n\nConnecticut law requires people to be registered and in the system before the polls closed at 8 p.m.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy has won a second term in office, defeating a little-known Republican small businessman.\n\nMurphy had amassed a war chest 100 times bigger than Matt Corey, who runs a high-rise window clean business in Hartford. It was a marked difference from his 2012 victory, when Murphy defeated former professional wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who spent about $50 million of her own money on the race.\n\nThe 45-year-old Murphy spent much of the campaign helping fellow Democrats. He also transferred $320,000 from his $14.5 million campaign fund to the state Democrats to help with field organizing.\n\nMurphy has said he wanted to make sure Democrats were doing \u201ceverything possible to get the biggest turnout we could.\u201d\n\nCorey accused him of not taking the race seriously.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nSecretary of the State Denise Merrill says roughly 40 percent of registered voters have turned out so far across Connecticut to cast their ballots.\n\nThe Democrat says Tuesday\u2019s rainy weather hasn\u2019t hampered turnout, which is typically about 55 percent to 65 percent in midterm elections.

Dannel P. Malloy.\n\nThe two-term governor narrowly won the state\u2019s top office in 2010 and 2014.\n\nAs in those years, Connecticut continues to face fiscal challenges, including projected budget deficits and unfunded pension liabilities.\n\nPetitioning independent candidate Oz Griebel has urged voters to vote for a team that\u2019s not beholden to political parties.\n\nBesides governor, there are battles for other statewide offices and the legislature. In many cases, Republicans are accusing Democrats of supporting Malloy, while Democrats have accused Republicans of backing President Donald Trump.", "HELENA, Mont.

Don Bacon has won a second term in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, defeating Democratic hopeful Kara Eastman in one of the state\u2019s few competitive races.\n\nBacon\u2019s win on Tuesday ensures that the district encompassing Omaha and most of its suburbs will remain in Republican hands.\n\nBacon has described himself as a conservative supporter of President Donald Trump who is open to compromise on issues including immigration, health care and climate change.\n\nEastman campaigned on a progressive platform that focused on Medicare-for-all, greater gun control and tuition-free college for families making less than $125,000 a year.\n\nBacon was first elected to the seat in 2014 after defeating one-term Democratic Rep. Brad Ashford.\n\n___\n\n12:25 a.m.\n\nNebraska voters have approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid coverage to an estimated 90,000 low-income residents under federal health care law.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote was a victory for advocates who fought for years to extend the current program, only to have lawmakers reject their efforts six times.\n\nSupporters say the measure will help the so-called working poor in industries that generally don\u2019t provide health insurance, such as construction and fast food.\n\nOpponents voiced concerns about the measure\u2019s expected cost to the state, even though the federal government will cover 93 percent of the expense next year and 90 percent in subsequent years. Lawmakers will now have to find a way to cover the rest of the cost, estimated at $40 million to $69 million a year.\n\n___\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican Bob Evnen has been chosen as Nebraska\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nEvnen defeated Democratic challenger Spencer Danner in Tuesday\u2019s contest to replace Republican Secretary of State John Gale, who is retiring.\n\nEvnen, a Lincoln attorney, touted his support for requiring voters to show identification at the polls. Gale supported similar proposals, but they always stalled in the Legislature.\n\nEvnen also highlighted his work as a co-founder of Nebraskans for the Death Penalty, the group that campaigned successfully to overturn the Legislature\u2019s 2015 vote to abolish capital punishment. As secretary of state, Evnen will serve on the Nebraska Board of Pardons, which has the power to commute sentences.\n\nDanner, of Omaha, promised to push for automatic voter registration for residents when they go to the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\n___\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry has won an eighth term representing Nebraska\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which includes Lincoln.\n\nFortenberry defeated Democratic challenger Jessica McClure in Tuesday\u2019s election. The two differed on health care, immigration and the federal tax law signed by President Donald Trump last year.\n\nMcClure faced an uphill battle against Fortenberry, an incumbent in a GOP-leaning district who held about $1.9 million in campaign cash as of October. McClure raised about $57,000.\n\nFortenberry faced large crowds and criticism at town hall events last year over health care and the GOP\u2019s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He argued that some parts of the law are worthwhile, such as protecting people with preexisting conditions, but opposed other parts. McClure noted that Fortenberry voted for the GOP bill that undermined the law.\n\n___\n\n9:25 p.m.\n\nNebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts has won re-election, defeating a Republican-turned-Democratic challenger who campaigned on promises to reduce partisanship at the state Capitol.\n\nRicketts\u2019 victory on Tuesday allows him to serve a second and final term in the GOP-dominated state. Ricketts ran on pledges to lower taxes, keep tight reins on state spending and promote Nebraska businesses domestically and abroad.\n\nState Sen.

He also promised promote nonpartisanship in the Legislature, where he served for 10 years.\n\nRicketts was first elected in 2014.

Deb Fischer has cruised to a second term in Nebraska, defeating Lincoln city councilwoman Jane Raybould.\n\nFischer won Tuesday despite Raybould\u2019s efforts to cast the first-term incumbent as a Washington insider who sided with her party even when it was harmful to the GOP-friendly state. Raybould pitched herself to voters as an outsider who would look for ways to lower health care costs.\n\nFischer rejected the criticism and noted her work on Senate committees focused on agriculture and the military, both important areas to Nebraska with its farm economy and Offutt Air Force Base.\n\nThe candidates differed on their support for new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual assault allegations during his confirmation process. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Fischer voted to confirm Kavanaugh, while Raybould said the allegations merited further investigation.\n\n___\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Adrian Smith has cruised to a seventh term in Nebraska\u2019s GOP-friendly 3rd Congressional District.\n\nSmith easily defeated Democratic challenger Paul Theobald in Tuesday\u2019s election. The vast, rural district Smith represents is one of the most Republican-heavy in the nation. Smith far outraised Theobald, with more than $1 million in campaign cash on hand, compared to $19,000 raised by his opponent.\n\nSmith campaigned on his continued opposition to the Affordable Care Act and sought to add new work requirements for people to qualify for federal assistance.\n\nTheobald, a professor and hog farmer, touted his support for universal health care and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\n8 p.m.\n\nPolls have closed in Nebraska for an election that will determine contests for governor, Congress and a ballot measure to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law.\n\nVoters had plenty of major races and issues to consider in Tuesday\u2019s election.

That would be a sharp jump from the last midterm election in 2014, which drew about 45 percent of registered voters. Andahl had predicted turnout of about 53 percent.\n\nAndahl says early voting played a large role. County officials sent 25,000 early ballots to voters who requested them and have received about 95 percent back. Voters have until 8 p.m. Tuesday to return early ballots to the election commission\u2019s main office or one of its drop boxes located throughout the county.\n\nTurnout in Sarpy County topped 74 percent in the 2016, a high-interest presidential turnout year with a tight race for the 2nd Congressional District, which includes part of the county.

Kruse called it, \u201cBrisk \u2014 more than normal, but not presidential-year numbers.\u201d\n\nKruse says more than 80,000 voters have received early-voting ballots or voted early in person. That\u2019s more than double the number that cast an early ballot in the 2014 midterm election.\n\nKruse had projected the county would receive about 65,000 early ballots. Both major political parties made a concerted effort this year to lock in as many early votes as possible.\n\nThe county will continue to accept early ballots at its drop-box locations until 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nKruse says his office has encountered a few small problems when poll workers called in sick, but overall the election is running smoothly.\n\n___\n\n12:25 p.m.\n\nA Lincoln man who describes himself as a nonpartisan voter says he voted against the Medicaid measure because expanding the program would crowd out those who need it most.\n\nSeventy-one-year-old Brad Ferguson said Tuesday after voting that he thinks the current program already serves too many people and that expanding it would \u201clet more people get on that don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\nFerguson also says he voted for Democrats Bob Krist in the governor\u2019s race and Jane Raybould for U.S. Senate because he thinks Democrats are needed to balance out the GOP\u2019s political power in the President Donald Trump era.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nA man who moved to Omaha for a medical residency says he intended to vote for incumbent Republican Don Bacon in the 2nd Congressional District race.\n\nJohn Weseman said Tuesday that Bacon appeals more to his Libertarian ideals and morals than Democrat Kara Eastman.\n\nWeseman also says he tends to support Republicans so he intended to vote for Gov.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Georgia elections (all times local):\n\n3:25 a.m.\n\nSeveral statewide races in Georgia remain too close to declare a winner.\n\nGeorgia Democrats are hoping for some upset victories after Republicans have kept them shut out of all statewide offices since 2010. Unofficial election returns showed tight races for open seats for secretary of state and insurance commissioner. Two GOP members of the Public Service Commission are also in close contests with Democratic challengers.\n\nRunoffs were possible in the secretary of state\u2019s race as well as the two PSC contests because Libertarians candidates on the ballot could keep any candidate from surpassing 50 percent of the vote as required to win. Any runoff elections for statewide office would be held Dec. 4.\n\n___\n\n3 a.m.\n\nRepublican nominee for Georgia governor Brian Kemp says he is \u201cconfident victory is near\u201d but is waiting on final results in the close race.\n\nKemp told supporters at his election party Tuesday night that \u201cthe math is on our side to win this election\u201d but stopped short of claiming victory.\n\nEarlier, opponent Stacey Abrams implied that a runoff is likely in the election. The Democrat told supporters they would \u201chave a chance to do a do-over.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nKemp has a narrow lead in the vote count but the race could still go to a runoff. In Georgia, a race goes to an automatic runoff if neither candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\n___\n\n2:40 a.m.\n\nRepublican Geoff Duncan has been elected Georgia\u2019s next lieutenant governor.\n\nDuncan of Cumming defeated Democratic businesswoman Sarah Riggs Amico of Marietta in the race for the state\u2019s No. 2 office Tuesday.

It was Carr\u2019s first contested race since Gov. Nathan Deal appointed him in November 2016 to fill the unexpired term of then-Attorney General Sam Olens, who left to become president of Kennesaw State University.\n\nBailey is a former Fulton County prosecutor who accused Carr of lacking the legal experience to serve in the job. Carr earned his law degree in 1999. He previously spent three years leading the Georgia Department of Economic Development and six years as chief of staff to U.S. Sen.

Karen Handel faced Democratic gun-control activist Lucy McBath on Tuesday in metro Atlanta\u2019s 6th District. Four-term Rep. Rob Woodall was matched with Democratic college professor Carolyn Bourdeaux in the neighboring 7th District. Unofficial election returns showed both races were too close to call, with only a thin margin separating the rivals.\n\nDemocrats hoped to capitalize on voters disaffected by President Donald Trump, as well as demographic shifts that have made Atlanta\u2019s suburbs less white.\n\nHandel was running again after winning a closely watched special election last year against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Woodall has held his seat since 2011.\n\n___\n\n1:50 a.m.\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams says votes remain to be in the tight Georgia governor\u2019s race and vows to wait for them all.\n\nAbrams told supporters at her election night party Tuesday that they would \u201chave a chance to do a do-over\u201d in her race against Republican Brian Kemp, implying a runoff.\n\nKemp has a narrow lead in the vote count, but it was still possible the race could go to a runoff. In Georgia, a race goes to an automatic runoff if neither candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nEarly returns showed Kemp running up large margins across rural and small-town Georgia, but parts of metro Atlanta, where Abrams\u2019 strength is concentrated, had yet to report.\n\nSome of those Atlanta-area counties had extended voting hours for some precincts to accommodate the crowds and compensate for problems.\n\n___\n\n11:21 p.m.\n\nRepublican Gary Black has been re-elected to a third term as Georgia\u2019s agriculture commissioner.\n\nBlack defeated Democratic challenger Fred Swann of Macon at the polls Tuesday.

Here\u2019s a look at the issues on the ballot:\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 1: VETERANS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING BONDS ACT\n\nAllows the state to issue $4 billion in bonds for existing affordable housing programs for low-income residents, veterans and farmworkers. Private investors would buy the bonds and the state would repay them with revenues from the General Fund, the account that pays for California\u2019s ongoing government expenses.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 2: NO PLACE LIKE HOMES ACT\n\nAuthorizes the state to use up to $140 million per year in existing county mental-health funds to pay for housing for homeless people with mental illnesses. The goal is to get Californians suffering from mental illness off the street and into facilities that bring better access to services.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 3: WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND WATERSHED CONSERVATION BOND INITIATIVE\n\nIssues nearly $9 billion in bonds for water infrastructure including storage and dam repairs, watershed and fisheries improvements, and habitat protection and restoration. The bulk of the revenue would go toward conservancies and state parks to restore and protect watershed lands and nonprofits and local agencies for river parkways. Money would also go toward improvements to meet safe drinking water standards.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 4: CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL BONDS INITIATIVE\n\nPuts forth $1.5 billion in bonds for the construction, expansion, renovation, and equipping of children\u2019s hospitals in California. Seventy-two percent would go to eight nonprofit hospitals; 18 percent would be allocated for five University of California general acute hospitals; and 10 percent would go to hospitals that provide pediatric services to children eligible for California Children\u2019s Services, the state program for kids with certain diseases or health problems.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 5: PROPERTY TAX TRANSFER INITIATIVE\n\nAllows homebuyers who are 55 or older or severely disabled to transfer their tax assessments from their prior home to their new home \u2014 no matter the new home\u2019s market value or its location in the state or the buyer\u2019s number of moves. It removes certain existing requirements and makes them eligible for property tax savings when they move to a different home.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 6: VOTER APPROVAL FOR FUTURE GAS AND VEHICLE TAXES AND 2017 TAX REPEAL INITIATIVE\n\nRepeals a 12-cent gas tax hike and increases in vehicle registration fees approved by lawmakers last year. The effect would be reduced funding for highway and road maintenance and repairs, as well as transit programs. The proposition would also require the Legislature to get a majority of voters to approve new or increased state fuel and vehicle taxes.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 7: PERMANENT DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME MEASURE\n\nWould pave the way for year-round daylight saving time in the state. The issue would still need a two-thirds vote from the Legislature and a change in federal law.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 8: FAIR PRICING FOR DIALYSIS ACT\n\nWould cap dialysis center revenues. Money collected above the cap would have to be paid back in rebates. Clinic operators who exceed the cap would also have to pay a fine to the state.\n\n___\n\nPROPOSITION 10: LOCAL RENT CONTROL INITIATIVE\n\nWould let cities and counties regulate rental fees in buildings that state law currently shields from such control. The measure would repeal the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a law that banned rent control on single-family homes and all housing built after Feb. 1, 1995.

If voters approve Proposition 7 on Nov. 6, that would pave the way for year-round daylight saving time in the state. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel,File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Voters who hate resetting their clocks twice a year took the first step Tuesday to making daylight saving time year-round in California.\n\nWith nearly 4.5 million ballots counted, Proposition 7 led by more than 62 percent. The measure permits the state Legislature to establish permanent daylight saving time. However, a change in federal law would be required before the initiative can take effect.\n\nThe time-change issue was fresh on voters\u2019 minds when they went to the polls. California and most of the rest of the nation reset clocks last Sunday, falling back on standard time and seeing the day get dark one hour earlier.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kansen Chu of San Jose said last month that he sponsored Proposition 7 after his dentist called him to complain about springing forward when clocks are moved up an hour every March. That switch takes away an hour\u2019s sleep in the middle of the night as it shifts an hour of sunlight from the morning to the evening.\n\nChu said he investigated the issue further and learned the original reason for implementing daylight saving \u2014 to save energy during World War I\u2014 no longer seemed to apply to the modern world.\n\nChu said he also came across studies showing an increased risk of car accidents and heart attacks following the spring change when people lose an hour of sleep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a public safety measure,\u201d Chu said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know anybody who really enjoys doing this adjustment of their schedule twice a year.\u201d\n\nOpponents argued that even if California voters and the Legislature approve year-round daylight saving, the hurdle of getting the federal government to agree is too high given the state\u2019s tense relationship with Washington.\n\nAnd making the switch to permanent daylight saving will cause its own headaches, said Democratic state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, who represents Ventura County.\n\nIf California goes to year-round daylight saving, the sun won\u2019t rise until 8 a.m. on some winter months, forcing children to walk to school or bus stops in darkness and likely leading to an increase in car and pedestrian accidents, Jackson said.\n\nChu said he was open to implementing year-round standard time since the key is eliminating the need to change the clocks.\n\nHawaii and Arizona (with the exception of Navajo Nation) do not recognize daylight saving time. In March, Florida became the first state in the nation to approve year-round daylight saving time, but the shift can\u2019t take effect unless Congress changes federal law.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer John Rogers contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this June 2, 2018 file photo, Ariana Grande performs at Wango Tango in Los Angeles.

(AP) \u2014 In a story Nov. 7 about statewide races in California, The Associated Press erroneously attributed a statement to Controller Betty Yee. The statement about building a \u201cfiscal wall\u201d against Trump administration policies actually was from Treasurer-elect Fiona Ma.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nKounalakis, Yee, Ma among statewide victors in California\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Controller Betty Yee will all return to office\n\nPart of AP\u2019s California election package\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Controller Betty Yee will all return to office. Eleni Kounalakis will be the first female lieutenant governor. The four are among several statewide offices voters cast ballots for Tuesday. In the contest for insurance commissioner, Republican-turned-independent Steve Poizner had the edge over Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the down-ballot races:\n\n___\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nXavier Becerra, who was appointed California\u2019s first Latino attorney general last year after Kamala Harris left for the U.S. Senate, was elected to stay on the job.\n\nBecerra defeated Republican Steven Bailey, a former state court judge, with 58 percent of the vote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored and elated by the voters\u2019 confidence to continue as Attorney General of our great state,\u201d he said.\n\nBecerra vowed to continue battling the Trump administration. Formerly a longtime Los Angeles congressman, Becerra regularly makes national headlines challenging the GOP president\u2019s efforts to change environmental and immigration policies.\n\nBailey called the focus on Trump policies \u201ca waste of taxpayer resources.\u201d\n\nIn his short time as chief law enforcement officer , Becerra said he has secured more than 20 legal victories in federal court in cases involving health care, fraudulent college lenders and gun safety laws.\n\nHe also previously served as a state assemblyman and California deputy attorney general.\n\nBailey lagged in fundraising and ethics questions further complicated his efforts. He denied allegations he used his judgeship to aid his political campaign, improperly accepted gifts and steered business to a firm where his son worked.\n\nA judicial ethics panel is reviewing the case and a decision is expected after the election.\n\n___\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nEleni Kounalakis will be California\u2019s first female lieutenant governor after defeating Ed Hernandez in a Democrat-on-Democrat matchup.\n\nKounalakis won with nearly 57 percent of the vote and will replace Gavin Newsom, who was elected governor.\n\nDuring the race, Kounalakis emphasized her background as a developer and former ambassador to Hungary.\n\nShe vows to fight sexual harassment in workplaces, hold perpetrators accountable, and ensure women receive equal pay for equal work.\n\nAlthough the job holds little real power, it\u2019s seen as a launching pad to higher office.\n\nThe lieutenant governor serves as a University of California regent, a Cal State trustee and as a state lands commissioner overseeing conservation and public access. The lieutenant also acts as governor when the top executive is away.\n\nKounalakis and Hernandez, a state senator, advanced after no Republican finished in the top two spots during June\u2019s blanket primary.\n\n___\n\nINSURANCE COMMISSIONER\n\nRepublican-turned-independent Steve Poizner had the edge over Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara as they vie for insurance commissioner.\n\nPoizner held 51 percent of the vote with nearly five million ballots tallied early Wednesday.\n\nEither candidate will break ground for a California statewide office. Poizner, a former insurance commissioner, would be the first independent to win such an election and Lara would be the first openly gay statewide officeholder.\n\nThe Department of Insurance enforces insurance laws, licenses and regulates companies and investigates fraud.\n\nPoizner, a wealthy Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur who lost a bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 2010, ran as an independent because he said the office should be free of politics.\n\nLara, who authored a failed bill that would have provided state-run health insurance, said that remains a top priority.\n\nPoizner has said he would focus on making sure homeowners have adequate protection against wildfires and other natural disasters.\n\nBoth have promised not to take insurance money, though Lara had to give back money he took from the political action committee of the nation\u2019s largest physician-owned medical malpractice insurer.\n\n___\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic Secretary of State Alex Padilla was re-elected after campaigning on his record of sparring with President Donald Trump.\n\nPadilla defeated Republican Mark Meuser Tuesday to keep his position as the top state official overseeing elections. He won with 59 percent of the vote.\n\nPadilla often denounced the president\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud in California.\n\nHe also refused to comply with the Trump administration\u2019s requests to provide data on California voters, arguing it was politically motivated.\n\nPadilla was elected to his first term in November 2014.\n\nMeuser ran on a platform of purging voter rolls of people who have moved or died and conducting audits to ensure ineligible people aren\u2019t registered to vote.\n\n___\n\nTREASURER\n\nDemocrat Fiona Ma is the voters\u2019 choice to replace outgoing Treasurer John Chiang.\n\nMa defeated Republican Greg Conlon with 59 percent of the vote.\n\nThe treasurer manages the state\u2019s money and sits on the boards of California\u2019s public employee pension funds.\n\nMa, a State Board of Equalization member and former assemblywoman, vowed to build a \u201cfiscal wall\u201d against what she called harmful policies coming out of the White House.\n\nShe said her experience as a certified public accountant will help keep the state\u2019s fiscal house in order.\n\nCalifornia is on the right track, she said, outpacing the rest of the nation in job growth, economic development and record-low unemployment.\n\nConlon, also an accountant, challenged Chiang in the last general election. He served on the California Public Utilities Commission as president for two years and commissioner for four.\n\n___\n\nCONTROLLER\n\nDemocrat Betty Yee fended off a Republican challenger and won re-election as California controller.\n\nYee, a certified public accountant, defeated Konstantinos Roditis with nearly 61 percent of the vote.\n\nThe controller serves as the state\u2019s top accountant and audits various state programs, and has seats on several state boards and the State Lands Commission.\n\nThe daughter of Chinese immigrants, Yee has promoted tax policies that are equitable for vulnerable populations, including people living in poverty and LGBT people.\n\n___\n\nSUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION\n\nLos Angeles schools executive Marshall Tuck is leading with 52 percent of the vote as he vies to be the state\u2019s top public education official.\n\nAfter more than 4.5 million ballots were counted Tuesday night, Tuck led Assemblyman Tony Thurmond in the superintendent of public instruction race.\n\nThe race has become a proxy battle in a larger fight over how best to improve California schools. On one side of the debate are powerful teachers unions, which back Thurmond. On the other side are wealthy charter-school and education-reform proponents, which support Tuck.\n\nThurmond has stressed opposing the Trump administration\u2019s agenda, including proposals to transfer money from traditional public schools to charters.\n\nTuck has emphasized giving families a choice in the schools their children attend, including nonprofit charter schools. His donors include charter school advocates such as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nTuck ran for the seat unsuccessfully in 2014. Incumbent Tom Torlakson beat him with union backing.\n\nTuck and Thurmond both want to spend more on public schools and ban for-profit charter schools.\n\nThurmond and Tuck are Democrats, but the race is nonpartisan and their party affiliation won\u2019t appear on the ballot.\n\n__\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections", "FLINT, Mich.

Scholten, a former minor league baseball player who raised more money than King and spent months crisscrossing the 39-county district.\n\nKing did little campaigning but maintained his hardline views on immigration and support of gun rights were in step with the conservative district.\n\nScholten argued the district needed a representative more focused on their needs than on promoting King\u2019s controversial views.\n\nLibertarian Charles Aldrich also was seeking the office.\n\n___\n\n11:35 p.m.\n\nIowa Secretary of State Paul Pate has been elected to a second term, beating Democrat Deidre DeJear.\n\nPate won Tuesday after a campaign that focused largely on his successful efforts to implement voter identification.\n\nPate worked with his fellow Republicans in the Legislature to approve voter ID regulations, then argued he took all steps possible to ensure people knew about the rule changes and were able to obtain necessary forms of identification.\n\nDeJear opposed voter ID but pushed for doing more to ensure everyone was able to vote, rather than seeking repeal of the law.\n\nPate has served as secretary of state since 2015 and also held that office in the 1990s.

Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nFor years, those hoping to reform education in Arkansas advocated for bonuses to be paid to the best schools and teachers \u2014 in the form of merit pay, because it was thought that rewarding excellence would improve schools. Then somebody thought about rewarding schools that not only performed the best \u2014 as measured by student test scores_but rewarding the schools that made the most improvement, too. Thus was born the Arkansas School Recognition Program.\n\nSuch programs have been in the law in one form or another for years. Governor Mike Beebe began funding this program, often out of discretionary funds. But now this is an annual initiative \u2014 and one of the best investments out of the billions this state alone spends on K-12 education. Last week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Education Commissioner Johnny Key handed out $7 million to 175 schools around the state. For years the state focused on punishing schools for low performance. So it is a welcome change to reward schools that excel. Principals and teachers also get a kick out of being recognized for their best efforts_and should be more often.\n\nThe state measured the 2018 ACT Aspire Exams from the spring, and handed out rewards to those districts that did the best. The law says that financial awards are given to the top 5 percent and 10 percent of the top academic performing schools, and the top 5 percent and 10 percent of schools that made the most improvement from the prior year. The money can be used for staff bonuses, equipment or hiring extra help, with all those decisions made at the local school.\n\nOne school, Roberts Elementary in Little Rock, was given nearly $185,000 because it ranked on both scales: best and most improved. Several schools in Cabot and Bismarck were singled out in both categories, too.\n\n(Here\u2019s an idea: If we can\u2019t bottle what\u2019s going on at Roberts Elementary, Cabot and Bismarck, why not have teachers there spread out across the state, to show how it\u2019s done?)\n\nIn the news last week, and often enough most weeks, were the stories about bad news in our public education system. Failing schools, poor test scores, teachers fighting with administrators and/or the state. But every once in a while \u2014 at least once a year when these reward checks are cut \u2014 the good news will out.\n\nCongratulations all around. And not just to those hard-working teachers, principals and students, but to our political leaders who know a good program when they fund it.\n\n___\n\nNorthwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nOur state\u2019s second-largest city is looking at enacting a spay-neuter ordinance to combat the rising number of stray animals and overcrowded shelters. It\u2019s a wonder why more cities don\u2019t have similar policies.\n\nIn September, Fort Smith\u2019s HOPE Humane Society said its facility had twice as many animals as it was designed for. Here\u2019s more from Talk Business & Politics: \u201cHOPE Humane Society Vice President Storm Nolan addressed the Board on Sept. 4 to push for consideration of a spay-neuter ordinance. He said the HOPE facility had 622 pets as of last Friday in a facility only designed to hold 300. He said the organization has taken in around 1,900 animals through August, with the trend suggesting that around 2,900 animals will come through the facility in 2018. Nolan called the issue \u2018a city problem.\u2019\u201d\n\nA city problem indeed. And a state problem. See North Little Rock\u2019s shelter, or, why, any number of animal shelters across the state.\n\nA spay-neuter ordinance is a practical solution to a realistic problem. In a perfect world, dog and cat owners would keep their animals under control so they wouldn\u2019t roam around the city, mate uncontrollably and produce more puppies and kittens that\u2019ll grow up to do the same thing.\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t live in a perfect world, and the fact of the matter is far too many people simply let their dogs and cats run wild. The result: too many puppies and kittens (and believe us, there is such a thing).\n\nUnless you\u2019re a licensed breeder, your pet doesn\u2019t need to mate. And if you think you can\u2019t afford the procedure, think again. Many shelters and vets offer free or discounted rates when it comes to spaying and neutering animals.\n\nSo we\u2019d encourage Fort Smith to adopt some sort of spay-neuter ordinance. If a city can tell you how fast you can drive on its streets or what time of the year you can post political signs on your property, and if it\u2019s using taxpayer money to fund shelters, it can have a spay ordinance on the books. Call it a public health decision.\n\n___\n\nTexarkana Gazette. Nov. 5, 2018.\n\nSometimes the media is criticized for sensationalizing a story and then, when the hoopla dies down, failing to report the outcome.\n\nAnd often the criticism is justified.\n\nTake the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAllegations of sexual assault leveled against Kavanaugh drew a lot of headlines and TV coverage. A lot.\n\nThe judge denied the allegations. There were hearings where both sides were heard. And in the end a majority in the Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the court.\n\nBut what many may not know \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 is that late Saturday, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued its full report on its investigation into Kavanaugh allegations.\n\nThe committee found no evidence to support the allegations against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThis was a serious and thorough investigation that left no stone unturned in our pursuit of the facts. In the end, there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against the nominee,\u201d U.S. Sen Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a prepared statement\n\nThat\u2019s the rest of the story.\n\nNo doubt here are those who will cry \u201ccover up\u201d or continue to believe Kavanaugh guilty of wrongdoing. Nothing anyone can say will change that.\n\nWe agree any accusation of sexual assault or misconduct should be taken seriously. But it\u2019s important to remember in this country we do not convict on words alone. The allegations against Kavanaugh were heard and they were investigated. There was no evidence.

NASA has begun a series of supersonic research flights off the Texas Gulf Coast near Galveston to test how the community responds to noise from a new experimental aircraft. (Steve Gonzales/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nGALVESTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 NASA is monitoring how residents living near the Texas Gulf Coast react to quiet sonic booms as the space agency works on an experimental aircraft that could significantly reduce commercial flight times.\n\nNASA launched a two-week research project Monday on quiet supersonic research flights near Galveston, the Houston Chronicle reported. NASA is flying an F/A-18 jet in a unique maneuver over the Gulf of Mexico to assess the community\u2019s response to the noise.\n\nA spokesman said NASA officials hope the tests will produce data that can be used by the agency when testing the X-59 low boom flight demonstrator, the experimental aircraft it hopes could eventually reduce commercial flight times by half.\n\nThe Concorde, an airplane tested decades ago, could cross the Atlantic in just over three hours by traveling twice the speed of sound. But federal aviation officials banned it after residents complained about the plane\u2019s sonic boom.\n\nSupersonic flights by passenger planes are banned over land or close to shore in the U.S., although the Federal Aviation Administration can allow exceptions.\n\nNASA recruited about 500 volunteers from the Galveston area to give feedback and define the level at which they were able to hear the sonic booms from the F/A-18. The project marks \u201cthe first time in decades that we have reached out to a large community as part of our supersonic research,\u201d said Peter Coen, NASA\u2019s commercial supersonic technology project manager.\n\nAtmospheric turbulence and humidity can affect how some areas perceive the \u201cquiet thumps\u201d made from the jet\u2019s special maneuver, according to NASA officials.\n\nNASA will provide the collected public response data to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA has banned supersonic passenger flights over land partly because of concerns about how they\u2019ll affect communities and infrastructure.\n\nSome Galveston residents posted on Facebook about the sonic booms on Monday, the first day of testing.\n\n\u201cI heard the \u2018quiet thump\u2019 this morning,\u201d resident Jeff Daniels wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely much better than a traditional sonic boom but I wouldn\u2019t want to listen to it all the time such as regular commercial air flights. It still rattles the windows.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the test flights near Galveston are being conducted by F/A-18 jets, not the experimental aircraft, and that NASA didn\u2019t conduct the Concorde tests.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Houston Chronicle, http://www.houstonchronicle.com", "LAWRENCE, Mass.

(AP) \u2014 The Latest on South Carolina elections (all times local):\n\n2 a.m.\n\nIn a loss for a candidate who had the backing of President Donald Trump, South Carolina is sending a new Democrat to Congress for the first time in more than 25 years.\n\nAttorney and ocean engineer Joe Cunningham beat state Rep. Katie Arrington in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nThe Republican Arrington knocked off incumbent U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford in June\u2019s primary thanks to Trump\u2019s support.\n\nBut Cunningham used that Trump backing to say Arrington was too conservative for the coastal South Carolina district whose residents are richer and less to the right than the rest of the state.\n\nThe Democrat hit Arrington especially hard on offshore drilling, an important issue in a district that stretches from Charleston to Hilton Head Island.\n\nCunningham is the first new Democrat from South Carolina to head to Congress since Jim Clyburn in 1992.\n\n___\n\n11:45 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson has survived a rough few months to win a third term.\n\nThe Republican incumbent defeated Democrat Constance Anastopoulo in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nLess than a month before the election, a State Grand Jury report said Wilson impeded an investigation into corruption at the South Carolina Statehouse involving a political consultant he hired and was a friend to whether he meant to or not.\n\nWilson called the report repackaged garbage and a political hit job.\n\nWilson survived similar allegations in a three-candidate Republican primary.\n\nAnastopoulo ran a number of ads, saying Wilson was part of a corrupt good-old-boy network holding South Carolina back.\n\nDemocrats rarely run TV spots in lower ballot races. A Democrat hasn\u2019t won a statewide election in South Carolina since 2006.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis has been elected to a third term.\n\nThe Republican defeated two challengers in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nLoftis has tangled with legislators over investments and how to handle the state retirement system. But he faced no opposition in the June primary.\n\nLoftis defeated Democrat Rosalyn Glenn, a consultant who helps business and other groups with their financial strategies. American Party candidate Sarah Work was also in the race.\n\nThe state Treasurer is responsible for investing the state\u2019s money and managing its bank accounts as well as running saving accounts to help pay for college tuition and for long-term care for people with disabilities.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina Secretary of State Mark Hammond has been elected to a fifth term, despite a controversy over a decade of laws being passed without him putting the state seal on them.\n\nHammond defeated Democrat Melvin Whittenburg in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nHammond won both a contested primary and general election after opponents emphasized that more than a hundred South Carolina laws passed for a decade did not have the state seal, which is one of the secretary of state\u2019s duties. Hammond blamed human error for the problem and said the lack of a seal did not invalidate the laws.\n\nWhittenburg is a retired U.S. Army Major, who promised to not just do the job\u2019s requirements, but also add new initiatives like waiving the application fee for new businesses started by someone who graduated college in the past two years.\n\n___\n\n11:35 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina voters will keep picking an Education Superintendent every four years.\n\nA state constitutional amendment allowing the governor to appoint the superintendent starting in 2023 was rejected Tuesday.\n\nOpponents of the amendment said the proposal takes power away from the people. Supporters said having the governor appoint the head of schools in South Carolina would assure they work as a team.\n\nCurrent Superintendent Molly Spearman supported the amendment, saying it ensures South Carolina will always have a qualified person running its public schools.\n\nVoters in South Carolina have already taken the adjutant general and lieutenant governor positions off ballots this decade.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nRepublican Ralph Norman has been elected to a full term in the U.S. House.\n\nNorman beat Democrat Archie Parnell on Tuesday. It was a rematch of the 2017 special election Norman won by just 3 percentage points to finish the term of Mick Mulvaney after he was named President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director.\n\nThe complexion of this year\u2019s race changed in May when divorce records surfaced showing Parnell broke a glass door and beat his then-wife with his fists in 1973.\n\nParnell said he deeply regretted it and will be ashamed the rest of his life, but he should not be defined by his worst mistake.\n\nThe 5th District covers more than a dozen counties in the northern part of the state including the Charlotte, North Carolina, suburbs.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers has won a fourth term.\n\nWeathers had no Democratic opposition, defeating two minor party candidates Tuesday.\n\nWeathers is a third generation dairy farmer.

Brown also won his party\u2019s nomination in 2004, but received just 29 percent of the vote in the general election then.\n\nThe 4th District is anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg and is one of the most conservative parts of conservative South Carolina.

He\u2019s also running for his seat in the South Carolina House which he has held for six terms.\n\n___\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nVoters have sent U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson back to Congress.\n\nThe Republican won re-election Tuesday to a ninth full term in the western South Carolina 2nd District.\n\nAs he does in nearly every election, Wilson faced reminders of how he shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Barack Obama during a 2009 speech to Congress health care speech. He has easily won re-election every two years since.\n\nWilson\u2019s Democratic opponent was Army veteran Sean Carrigan, who characterized himself in June\u2019s primary as a moderate who could beat Wilson.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn\u2019t sent a freshman Democrat to the U.S. House or U.S. Senate since U.S. Rep.

Henry McMaster has won his first full term in office. With the victory, he\u2019s achieved the office he\u2019s held for two years but long sought to win on his own merit.\n\nThe Republican defeated Democratic state Rep. James Smith in Tuesday\u2019s general election.\n\nMcMaster became governor when Nikki Haley left the office in 2017 to join the Trump administration as U.N. ambassador.\n\nAs lieutenant governor, McMaster was the first statewide elected official in the country to back Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nMcMaster was forced into a primary runoff earlier this year, defeating GOP businessman John Warren. Trump stumped for his ally, making an eleventh-hour visit to the state to campaign for McMaster.\n\n___\n\n8:55 p.m.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan is heading back to Congress.\n\nThe Republican incumbent earned a fifth term beating Democrat Mary Geren in Tuesday\u2019s election in the western South Carolina 3rd District.\n\nDuncan is often the most conservative member of South Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation. He promised in his campaign to bring the values talked about around the dinner table to Washington.\n\nGeren is a college instructor from Anderson who touted education issues, telling her story about how she was the youngest in a house of seven and the first person in her immediate household to graduate from high school and college.\n\nThe 3rd District covers eleven South Carolina counties in the northwest part of the state.\n\n___\n\n8:55 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s only Democrat in Washington is returning to the U.S. House.\n\nU.S. Rep Jim Clyburn won a 14th term in Congress on Tuesday, beating Republican Gerhard Gressmann in the 5th District.\n\nClyburn is the state\u2019s longest serving congressman, first winning the seat in 1992 when the district that connects parts of Columbia with parts of Charleston was drawn to insure it had a majority of minority voters.\n\nClyburn is House Assistant Minority Leader and has hinted at possibly taking on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s position as House Speaker if the Democrats take over the chamber.\n\nGressmann is a Vietnam veteran and ordained minister who said he ran because not just Democrats but some Republicans were resisting President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\n___\n\n7 a.m.\n\nA woman in South Carolina says she called 911 after waiting outside her polling place for 45 minutes to get help because she\u2019s disabled.\n\nSandy Hanebrink told the Anderson Independent-Mail she can\u2019t walk inside her polling place at an Anderson church because she can\u2019t walk on the gravel or grass where vehicles have to park.\n\nHanebrink says she tried to flag down poll workers and call Anderson County\u2019s election hotline before calling 911.\n\nPoll workers came out after she made her call.\n\nPoll manager Michael Bratcher says workers weren\u2019t aware people were waiting outside and he didn\u2019t have enough workers to monitor voters inside and possible curbside voting outside.\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nElection officials in South Carolina say no serious problems have been reported in the voting.\n\nState Election Commission spokesman Chris Whitmire said in an email there was the usual crowd of people voting as soon as the polls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nHe said the agency is not aware of any problems that would prevent anyone from voting.\n\nBut Whitmire said some voters in Pickens County cast paper ballots because of a mistake in preparing a device that poll managers use to open electronic voting machines. He said Pickens County elections officials were sending new devices where they were needed. He said each polling location had plenty of paper ballots to use until the machines were activated.\n\nWhitmire said no one was turned away from voting.\n\n___\n\n9 a.m.\n\nSouth Carolina Democrats are getting another shot to wrestle power from the grip of Republicans.\n\nPolls are open until 7 p.m. Tuesday as South Carolina voters choose a governor, six other statewide officers, and all seven U.S. House seats.\n\nNo Democrat has won a statewide election in South Carolina since 2006. Democrats haven\u2019t flipped a congressional seat from Republicans since 1986.\n\nAs of Friday, election officials say 230,000 people already cast ballots with two days of early voting left. That\u2019s a 46 percent increase from 2014 early voting, which set a midterm record.\n\nAll 124 state House seats are up for re-election, but 68 of them are uncontested. Just 45 races have a Republican facing a Democrat.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "HERNDON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov 6, 2018--Ntrepid Corporation, a leading provider of cutting-edge managed attribution solutions, today announced that Nfusion, the company\u2019s secure virtual desktop for online research and investigations, has been named a 2018 Industry Innovation Award Winner.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 California voters overwhelmingly approved a measure Tuesday requiring that all eggs sold in the state come from cage-free hens by 2022.\n\nProposition 12 also bans the sale of pork and veal in California from farm animals raised in cages that don\u2019t meet the new minimum size requirements. That means the Golden State\u2019s new rules will apply to farmers nationwide whose eggs, veal and pork are sold in California.\n\nSupporters say the measure is a big step toward more humane farming practices, while opponents say it is misleading and maintains cruel practices for animals.\n\nDubbed the Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act, Proposition 12 builds on an earlier ballot measure, Proposition 2, that passed in 2008 and banned keeping hens, calves and pigs in tiny cages so cramped they couldn\u2019t stand up, lie down or turn around.\n\nThat measure took effect in 2015 but lacked specific size requirements and did not apply to out-of-state farmers whose products were sold in California.\n\nProposition 12 specifies how much floor space farmers need to give each animal.\n\n\u201cChange is coming,\u201d said Josh Balk, vice president at the Humane Society of the United States, which sponsored and financed the measure. \u201cThis vote is a massive blow against industrial animal agriculture\u2019s abusive confinement systems.\u201d\n\nIt requires that, starting in 2020, calves confined for production have at least 43 square feet (4 square meters) of usable floor space, while breeding pigs be given at least 24 square feet (2.2 square meters) of floor space in their pens starting in 2022.\n\nStarting in 2020, egg-laying hens must be been given 1 square foot (144 square inches) of floor space each on the way to being cage-free by 2022.\n\nThe measure also had support from several animal welfare groups, including the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Sierra Club and Center for Food Safety, and a variety of veterinarians and religious organizations.\n\nThe Humane Society, which also sponsored Proposition 2, says the upgrade will strengthen the earlier measure and restore California as a leader in the ethical treatment of farm animals.\n\nA decade ago, Proposition 2 was the furthest-reaching law for farm animals in the country. Since then a dozen states have banned or restricted confinement for at least one farm animal. Massachusetts passed a comprehensive measure in 2016 that is similar to Proposition 12.\n\nAmong those opposed to the measure were the National Pork Producers Council and the Association of California Egg Farmers, which said it will raise costs for farmers and, as a result, prices for consumers.\n\nBradley Miller, a spokesman for Californians against Cruelty, Cages and Fraud, which led a \u201cNo on Proposition 12\u201d campaign, said the measure makes misleading claims and does little to end cruelty to animals in the near term.\n\n\u201cWe are vehemently opposed to the 1 square foot per hen cage space,\u201d said Miller, who is also president of the Humane Farming Association. \u201cIt is a cruel step backward.\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office says Proposition 12 would likely result in an increase in prices for eggs, pork and veal partly because farmers would have to remodel or build new housing for animals.\n\nIt could also cost the state as much as $10 million a year to enforce and millions of dollars more a year in lost tax revenues from farm businesses that choose to stop or reduce production because of higher costs, the office said.\n\n__\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Aug. 7, 2018 file photo, Emily Carlson, left, and Nikita Smith, right, stack ballots from Washington state's primary election at King County Election headquarters in Renton, Wash.

Just a few thousands votes separated the two with more than 87,000 votes counted, with the lead switching back and forth.\n\nDemocrats need 27 seats for a two-thirds majority in the 40-member Senate and had 26 heading into the election. The party also worked to defend its supermajority in the Assembly, where Republicans led in key races. Contests in Bakersfield and Riverside County where Democrats are defending seats were also close Tuesday.\n\nA supermajority would let Democrats raise taxes, suspend legislative rules or override vetoes without Republican votes.\n\nThat would be a benefit to Democrat Gavin Newsom, who won the governor\u2019s race.\n\nAll 80 California state Assembly seats and half the Senate seats were up for election.

The Blackhawks have fired three-time Stanley Cup winning coach Joel Quenneville on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Joel Quenneville knew the deal. After three Stanley Cup titles and nine playoff appearances with the Chicago Blackhawks, the longtime coach figured this was a big season for him.\n\n\u201cI only think we\u2019re in the winning business and we better win,\u201d Quenneville said on the first day of training camp.\n\nTwo months later, it was over.\n\nThe Blackhawks fired Quenneville on Tuesday, ending a wildly successful run that returned the franchise to the top of the NHL after years of heartache.\n\n\u201cWe want to win,\u201d team president John McDonough said. \u201cWe want to re-win. We want our building filled and we want our fans to see an exciting brand of hockey. Sometimes, as painful as it is, you need a fresh start.\u201d\n\nThe move comes in the wake of a winless three-game trip, extending Chicago\u2019s losing streak to five in a row heading into Thursday\u2019s home game against Carolina. The power play, a persistent problem, ranked 27th in the NHL heading into Tuesday. The Blackhawks (6-6-3) also are allowing an unseemly 3.73 goals per game.\n\n\u201cA decision like this isn\u2019t made on one game, one play, or one specific thing,\u201d general manager Stan Bowman said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a collection of things. Certainly the road trip was concerning. But I think even heading into that, there were some elements to our game where they weren\u2019t where they needed to be.\u201d\n\nAssistants Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson also were let go. Jeremy Colliton was hired as the 38th head coach in franchise history, and Barry Smith, 66, moved from Chicago\u2019s front office to the bench as an assistant coach.\n\nColliton goes from Chicago\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford, Illinois, to the NHL\u2019s youngest head coach at 33. Blackhawks forward Chris Kunitz, defenseman Duncan Keith and goaltenders Corey Crawford and Cam Ward are older than Colliton, and defenseman Brent Seabrook also is 33.\n\n\u201cI have a huge amount of respect for Joel,\u201d Colliton said. \u201cThose are huge shoes to fill. I won\u2019t try to fill them. I\u2019ve got to be myself. And we\u2019re different people, so I\u2019ll bring different things to the table, different ideas to the table.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old Quenneville was the longest-tenured head coach in the NHL. He had another year left on a three-year contract extension he signed in 2016 that pays him $6 million per year, second highest in the NHL behind Mike Babcock in Toronto.\n\nHe also was the second coach fired in the past three days after the Los Angeles Kings dismissed John Stevens.\n\nWhenever Quenneville wants to get back to work, he likely will have plenty of suitors.\n\nThe former NHL defenseman has 890 wins in 22 years as a head coach with St. Louis, Colorado and Chicago. Scotty Bowman, Stan\u2019s father and a senior adviser with the Blackhawks, is the only man with more regular-season victories.\n\nQuenneville took over Chicago four games into the 2008-09 season, replacing Denis Savard after the Hall of Famer was let go by former general manager Dale Tallon. What followed was an unprecedented run for one of the NHL\u2019s Original Six franchises.\n\nJonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Keith and Seabrook blossomed with Quenneville behind the bench, and the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. They also made it to the conference finals in 2009 and 2014.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be an icon in Chicago for the longest time, the great things he\u2019s done for this organization, winning three Stanley Cups, so that will never be forgotten,\u201d Kane said.\n\nToews said the players learned of the move Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some pretty crazy highs and you remember all the good stuff, so it\u2019s tough to see a coach and a friend like Joel go,\u201d the captain said.\n\nThe pressure on Quenneville began to ramp up when Chicago was swept by Nashville in the first round of the 2017 playoffs after the Blackhawks finished with the best record in the Western Conference. Then they missed the playoffs entirely last season for the first time in a decade.\n\nQuenneville finishes with a 452-249-96 record with Chicago. He also went 76-52 in the playoffs with the Blackhawks for the best record in franchise history.\n\nThe dismissal turns up the heat on Bowman, who has made a couple of questionable moves that helped hasten the Blackhawks\u2019 decline. He traded Artemi Panarin to Columbus and Teuvo Teravainen to Carolina in part because of salary-cap issues, and each player has put up big numbers with his new club.\n\n\u201cI believe in this roster, I believe in Stan,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cStan is meticulous, he\u2019s very thorough and when you break down free agents, when you break down trades, some work, some don\u2019t. You\u2019d like most to go your way and over time, they may. But his body of work is excellent.

Susana Martinez leaves office. Lujan Grisham defeated Republican Rep. Steve Pearce in a campaign focused on expanding preschool education, lowering crime rates and expanding an oil-dependent economy into new industries.\n\nRepublicans in New Mexico had little to celebrate. Democratic candidates won re-election to secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer \u2014 and defeated an appointed Republican state auditor. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich and U.S. Rep Ben Ray Lujan were re-elected. The congressional seat vacated by Lujan Grisham will be filled by fellow Democrat Debra Haaland, who defeated Republican former state lawmaker Janice Arnold-Jones on Tuesday.\n\nLujan Grisham, a 59-year-old former state health secretary, has been a leading critic in Congress of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies on immigration.\n\nHer victory opens the door for initiatives to authorize recreational marijuana, to institute gun safety measures such background checks on private sales and to overhaul funding for public education and preschool.

She broke with most Republican governors to expand Medicaid in her first term and won re-election in a landslide, but her popularity waned amid limited progress toward improving public education and reducing poverty.\n\nDemocrats also sought to expand their majority control of the Legislature. Democrats last held unified control of the Legislature and governor\u2019s office in 2010 under Gov.

She also highlighted her past ownership role in a consulting firm that runs a statewide high-risk insurance pool for the severely ill \u2014 as Pearce, in a series of attack ads, condemned the arrangement as self-serving and corrupt.\n\nLujan Grisham will inherit a bulging budget surplus for the coming fiscal year \u2014 an estimated at $1.2 billion in government income beyond current annual spending obligations of $6.3 billion from the state general fund.\n\nMost of the budget windfall is linked to the state\u2019s oil and natural gas sector, whose fortunes fluctuate wildly with the gyrations of international oil markets \u2014 complicating efforts to make sustained investments in teacher salaries.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office and incoming Legislature will confront pressure from the judiciary to shore up educational opportunities for minority and low-income students. A recent court order described widespread violations of constitutional rights to an adequate education, responding to lawsuits from parents and school districts.\n\nLujan Grisham plans to drop the state\u2019s legal appeal and work with the Legislature to provide more resources to public schools.\n\nA three-term congresswoman, Lujan Grisham traces her New Mexico family lineage back 12 generations to the Spanish-colonial era prior to U.S. acquisition of the region in the Mexican American War. Martinez, by contrast, is native of El Paso, Texas, who says her paternal grandparents migrated from Mexico.\n\nLujan Grisham, whose second last name derives from her deceased husband, has family ties to a prominent political family.

Current law also limits out-of-county transfers.\n\nProposition 5, backed by the California Association of Realtors, would have allowed over-55 homeowners to transfer their assessments to any new home \u2014 no matter what it costs \u2014 anywhere in the state and as many times as they wish.\n\nIt was a low-key campaign with high stakes.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decisive defeat sends a strong message to the California Association of Realtors that voters won\u2019t tolerate self-interested initiatives that attack the critical local services that strengthen our communities,\u201d Graham Knaus, executive director of the California State Association of Counties, one of the main backers of the No on Prop 5 campaign, said late Tuesday.\n\nThe Realtors Association said Wednesday that it would pursue a revised measure on the November 2020 ballot and seek changes through the state Legislature.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed in the election outcome, but we remain committed to helping seniors, disabled homeowners and those impacted by California\u2019s natural disasters to not be subject to a punitive property tax increase when moving to a safer, more practical home,\u201d said Jared Martin, president of the Realtors Association.\n\nThe Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office concluded that schools and local governments would each probably lose more than $100 million in property tax revenue a year initially and that, over time, those losses would reach about $1 billion a year for each. About 85,000 homeowners over 55 who move every year without the tax break would pay much less.\n\nCurrent law requires the state to provide more funding to most schools to cover property tax losses. Not so for local governments.\n\nSupporters said passage would end a \u201cmoving penalty\u201d on older people and encourage more to sell, helping alleviate California\u2019s housing shortage. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimated home sales would increase by tens of thousands a year.\n\nThe Realtors paid for a consultant\u2019s report that contended Proposition 5 would have much less of an effect on state and local governments, resulting in annual losses of $120 million to annual gains of $200 million.\n\nOpponents challenged the assertion that Proposition 5 would spur construction and warned about a hit to public services.\n\nAs a result of Proposition 13 passed in 1978, a home is typically taxed at 1.1 percent of the purchase price and increases no more than 2 percent a year. Prices have risen much more, sticking many homeowners with much higher taxes when they move.\n\nSupporters raised $13.2 million as of Oct. 23, mostly from the Realtors, whose benefit from sales commissions.

A health care workers union, Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, funded the $18 million supporting campaign. Dialysis companies contributed more than $111 million to kill the initiative.\n\nThe union argued Proposition 8 would stop the dialysis companies from cutting corners to make money and force them to invest more of their revenue into patient care. Supporters say the profit-hungry companies don\u2019t adequately clean clinics and overwork staff.\n\nDialysis providers say the measure was actually a tactic to pressure the dialysis companies to let workers unionize and would have forced clinics to close. They say most California clinics provide high quality care.\n\n\u201cProp 8 would have made it more difficult for me and for all dialysis patients to get the life-sustaining treatment we need,\u201d DeWayne Cox, a dialysis patient working with the opposition campaign, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that the UHW union was willing to put our lives at risk to further their organizing agenda.\u201d\n\nDialysis companies\u2019 effort to kill the measure was the most expensive campaign on one side of a ballot initiative in the U.S. since at least 2002. Most of that money came from the two largest dialysis companies operating in California: Denver-based DaVita Inc. and Germany-based Fresenius Medical Care.\n\n\u201cThey used that massive spending to scare and mislead Californians,\u201d Emanuel Gonzales, a dialysis technician working with the Proposition 8 campaign, said in a statement. \u201cWe set out to hold the dialysis industry accountable... We won\u2019t stop until it is truly reformed.\u201d\n\nProposition 8 supporters say they plan to try to pass the measure again in 2020 and in the meantime will lobby for it in the Legislature.\n\nThe measure would have barred dialysis clinics from charging patients more than 115 percent of what providers spend on patient care and quality improvement. If clinics exceeded that limit, they would have to provide rebates or pay penalties.\n\nAlthough the measure didn\u2019t spell out exactly which expenses counted toward the limit, dialysis companies argued critical management expenses would be classified as profits and bankrupt clinics.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office estimates dialysis companies currently make roughly $3 billion in annual revenue from their California operations.\n\nDialysis patients typically undergo hourslong treatments three times a week when machines filter their blood, essentially performing kidney functions outside the body. Tens of thousands of patients receive dialysis treatment in California each month, according to the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\n\nIt was one of several health care-related measures on California ballots.\n\nVoters on Tuesday also approved Proposition 11, a measure that will let private ambulance companies require workers stay on-call during paid breaks.\n\nVoters also authorized $1.5 billion in bond funding for children\u2019s hospitals by passing Proposition 4.

Californians who rent apartments built after 1995, single-family homes or condominiums have limited protections from rising costs under a state law passed that year that restricts rent control. That could change if voters pass Proposition 10 in November. It would overturn the 1995 law and open the door to more rent control in cities and counties across the state. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Californians soundly rejected a costly ballot measure that would have allowed more rent control as a way to alleviate the state\u2019s housing crisis.\n\nMore than 60 percent of the 5 million voters whose ballots were counted early Wednesday rejected Proposition 10.\n\nIt was one of the most expensive and contentious items on the ballot, attracting more than $100 million in campaign contributions.\n\nOpponents said the measure would have lowered real estate values and further decreased the state\u2019s already limited housing supply by discouraging building. Supporters argued more rent control would protect low-income people from being priced out of their homes.\n\nThe failure of the measure preserves restrictions on rent control on apartments built after 1995, single-family homes and condominiums. It also preserves rules preventing cities and counties from telling landlords what they can charge new tenants.\n\nCalifornia has a disproportionately high rate of homelessness, and nearly a third of California renters spend more than half their income on rent, according to the state\u2019s housing agency.\n\nOf two other ballot measures aimed at the housing crisis, one passed to pay for housing the mentally ill. Another to house homeless veterans and the poor led in returns, but was too close to call.\n\nIn light of the rent control defeat, supporters of Proposition 10 called on Gov.-Elect Gavin Newsom to freeze rent increases and pressure lawmakers to repeal the restrictions Proposition 10 sought to end.\n\n\u201cThe burden to act returns to the governor and the Legislature, who should work to represent Californians, not Wall Street landlords,\u201d said Christina Livingston, one of the leaders of the Proposition 10 campaign.\n\nNewsom opposed the measure, but said he would work to address the housing crisis.\n\nThe nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office predicted the initiative would have lowered the value of rental properties. Economic research generally shows that rent control benefits some individual renters but it limits supply overall and raises rents because it decreases incentives to build.\n\nMore than a dozen California cities including Los Angeles and San Francisco already have some rent control on properties built before 1995.\n\nThe lion\u2019s share of funding for the $75 million opposition campaign came from the real estate industry. The California Association of Realtors was the largest single donor, followed by Essex Property Trust and investment firm Blackstone. It was also opposed by a range of influential groups, including NAACP\u2019s California conference and the California Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cThe stunning margin of victory shows California voters clearly understood the negative impacts Prop. 10 would have on the availability of affordable and middle-class housing,\u201d said Tom Bannon of the anti-Proposition 10 campaign.\n\nProposition 10 supporters included the state Democratic party, the California Teachers Association, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit known for backing controversial ballot measures, contributed $23 million of the $25 million raised to pass the measure.\n\nVoters approved a housing measure that authorizes $2 billion in bond funding to house homeless people with mental illness. Returns early Wednesday morning showed Proposition 2 leading with 60 percent of the vote.\n\nLawmakers approved the bonds in 2016 with plans to repay them using funds from a tax on millionaires that voters approved in 2004. But the funds became tied up in court because of a lawsuit that argues voters approved the tax to fund mental health services, not housing. Lawmakers and the governor decided to resolve the legal dispute by taking the issue to voters.\n\nAnother measure that would authorize $4 billion in general obligation bonds for low-income and veteran housing, which would be repaid over time with interest, appeared to be winning. Preliminary returns showed Proposition 1 leading with more than 52 percent of the vote.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "Former Detective David March, from left, Chicago Police Officer Thomas Gaffney and former officer Joseph Walsh appear at a pre-trial hearing with Judge Domenica A.

Even as college costs climb, there are still options to borrow that cash, whereas it\u2019s often noted that you can\u2019t borrow for retirement.\n\nYet about one-third of Americans with kids under 18 say they plan to use retirement savings or \u201ccould use if needed\u201d to help pay for their children\u2019s education, according to a recent survey by Sallie Mae, one of the nation\u2019s largest student loan lenders.\n\nThe good news for retirement savings is that number is declining \u2014 in the 2016 edition of Sallie Mae\u2019s survey, 39 percent of parents said they planned or may use retirement savings as a last resort to fund their children\u2019s education.\n\nMore parents are now thinking twice about using retirement savings to fund college dreams, and here\u2019s why their hesitation is warranted.\n\nLOST RETIREMENT SAVINGS COULD HURT YOU\n\nPaying for school from a tax-advantaged employer retirement account like a 401(k) can hurt you in several ways:\n\n?A 10 percent tax penalty on early withdrawals below age 59\u00bd.\n\n?A potentially bigger tax bill the year of withdrawal as the money you withdraw is counted as income.\n\n?Loss of tax-free growth of your savings. Unlike taxable investment accounts, where you may have to pay the IRS annually for capital gains, employer-sponsored retirement accounts can grow tax-free.\n\n?Less benefit from compounding. Early withdrawals will erode your portfolio\u2019s growth potential.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to tap into your retirement savings, experts say the \u201cleast worst\u201d option is to fund a Roth IRA . Unlike qualifying contributions to a 401(k) or traditional IRA, Roth IRA contributions aren\u2019t tax-exempt. But as a result, there are also fewer restrictions on early withdrawals.\n\n\u201cYou can withdraw any Roth IRA contributions that you\u2019ve made without penalty,\u201d says Crystal Wipperfurth, a certified financial planner with Bronfman Rothschild in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cThis is not ideal, because it reduces your retirement savings, but it is an option.\u201d\n\nIT COULD HURT YOUR KIDS, TOO\n\nTapping your retirement savings can boomerang to hurt your kids if they need to provide financial help for you in your later years.\n\n\u201cWe see clients want to help their kids through college at the expense of their own retirement, and we always advise against it,\u201d says Matt Ahrens, a financial advisor at Integrity Advisory in Overland Park, Kansas. \u201cParents have to understand that sacrificing to help their kids through college may only put more stress on their children when they see their parents struggling financially in retirement.\u201d\n\nA more immediate blow: Using your retirement funds could hurt your child\u2019s ability to qualify for student aid. Why? The cash is considered \u201cordinary income\u201d and may put your total wages for the year beyond what qualifies for assistance.\n\nBecause retirement accounts aren\u2019t counted when considering if a family economically qualifies, \u201cfunding your 401(k) or 403(b) is an advantage for college financial aid,\u201d says Kimberly J. Howard, a certified financial planner with KJH Financial Services in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nCash them out, and that exclusion goes away.\n\nA 529 PLAN IS THE BEST WAY TO SAVE\n\nMore Americans tuck college savings into ordinary bank accounts (45 percent) than a 529 savings plan (29 percent), according to the 2018 Sallie Mae survey. But 529 plan investments have much more earning potential than an ordinary savings account, which often grows less than 1% a year.\n\n\u201cParents of young children should start a 529 fund right away, and add money every month. Every little bit helps, and it will have the advantage of years of compounding,\u201d Ahrens says.\n\n\u201cThe first savings a family should make should be into their retirement account at work in order to get their company match. Then the remaining savings can be split between retirement \u2014 either at work or into a Roth IRA \u2014 and a college savings plan, like a 529 plan,\u201d says Derek Hagen, a certified financial planner with Hagen Financial in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\n_______\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet .

Union!\u201d\n\nSisolak said he had received a congratulatory phone call from Laxalt for a hard-fought campaign and promised the crowd and those watching his speech on TV that he will work his \u201cheart out\u201d to earn their support regardless of who they voted for.\n\n\u201cRight here in Nevada we are going to prove that we won\u2019t be divided by partisan politics in Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not be divided by North versus South, rural or urban. We will be one Nevada working together and that starts right now.\u201d\n\nParamedics were called to his casino-resort suite earlier in the night after his 92-year-old mother had a medical episode.\n\nLaxalt, a former U.S. Navy lieutenant, is popular on the right and proved his ability to win statewide when he emerged victorious in the 2014 attorney general race with a difference of fewer than 5,000 votes over his opponent. Billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity backed his campaign.\n\nLaxalt during the campaign cited sanctuary cities and burdensome regulations as ill-considered California policies that Nevada should avoid.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we came up short tonight. ... I don\u2019t have to tell you how difficult this is,\u201d Laxalt told about 200 backers at a Reno hotel-casino ballroom. \u201cThis was our campaign, not just my campaign. ...

(AP Photo/Gary Landers)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Election Day in Ohio. (all times local):\n\n12:01 a.m.\n\nRepublicans have retained their supermajority in the Ohio House, despite Democrats\u2019 hopes that strong candidates and national momentum would help them cut into GOP legislative majorities.\n\nWith nearly all races called, House Republicans had secured at least 64 of 99 House seats, more than the 60 votes needed to flex powers like overriding vetoes and more easily placing constitutional amendments before voters. Democrats picked up three Republican seats, while Republicans took one held by a Democrat.\n\nWith Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine also retaining the party\u2019s control of the governor\u2019s office, outnumbered Democrats will continue to have little sway over state law-making. DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray, the former federal consumer protection chief, in the governor\u2019s race Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans, as expected, also retained control of the Ohio Senate.\n\n___\n\n11:20 p.m.\n\nDemocrats have won both Ohio Supreme Court seats up for election, cutting into total GOP control of the court.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election results show that Democratic challenger Judge Melody Stewart, a Cleveland appeals court judge, defeated Republican incumbent Justice Mary DeGenaro, of suburban Youngstown, on Tuesday. DeGenaro was appointed by Gov. John Kasich (KAY\u2019-sik) earlier this year.\n\nIn the court\u2019s open race, Democrat Judge Michael Donnelly, of Cleveland, beat GOP appeals court Judge Craig Baldwin, of Newark.\n\nThe winners join five GOP justices on the state high court and along with U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown were the only Democrats winning statewide races.\n\n___\n\n11:03 p.m.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine has defeated Obama-era consumer protection chief Richard Cordray in the race for Ohio governor.\n\nThe 71-year-old DeWine\u2019s win over Cordray on Tuesday puts him in an influential position as a key swing state draws new legislative and congressional maps and makes its 2020 pick for president.\n\nThe takeaway for Republican President Donald Trump is unclear. The victory comes after DeWine\u2019s 11th hour embrace of both Republican President Donald Trump and GOP Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a key detractor.\n\nDeWine walked a careful line on the president, choosing instead to tout his own long record of public service, including as lieutenant governor, congressman and U.S. senator.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama campaigned for Cordray and other Democrats, arguing Democratic wins were needed as a check and balance on Congress and the White House.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nA fledgling Ohio congressman who was backed by President Donald Trump and Gov. John Kasich (KAY\u2019-sik), a Trump critic, has won his congressional rematch, retaining a coveted open House seat for Republicans.\n\nVoters on Tuesday picked U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson, of Zanesville, over Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O\u2019Connor, for the second time since August. That means he\u2019ll serve the next full term representing the 12th District formerly held by Republican ex-U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi (TEE\u2019-behr-ee), who retired in January.\n\nBalderson\u2019s close victory came as Republicans were concerned about how Trump is playing in swing states. O\u2019Connor was considered a long shot in the district, held by Republicans for nearly 35 years.\n\nKasich represented the district before Tiberi.\n\n___\n\n10:40 p.m.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Keith Faber (FAY\u2019-bur) has been elected Ohio auditor, defeating former U.S. Rep. Zack Space on Tuesday to lead the staff that audits thousands of public offices, including cities, state agencies and schools.\n\nFaber, a 52-year-old lawyer from Celina, has advocated additional performance audits to boost government efficiency and cost savings.\n\nFaber argued against using the role for political purposes after Space suggested the office could review how Ohio has been affected by trade deals and the saga of its largest online charter school, the now-defunct Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow.\n\nDuring the campaign, both men faced questions about tax payment problems. Space\u2019s campaign cited administrative errors for two tax penalties in his past. A bookkeeper took responsibility for tardy tax payments tied to Faber.\n\nFaber succeeds two-term Republican Dave Yost.\n\n___\n\n10:37 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Frank LaRose has won the race for Ohio Secretary of State.\n\nVoting returns from Tuesday show LaRose defeated Democrat Kathleen Clyde, a state representative from Kent.\n\nThe 39-year-old LaRose will replace Secretary of State Jon Husted (HYOO\u2019-sted), who ran on the Republican ticket for governor.\n\nLaRose has been in the state Senate since 2011 and before that served in the U.S. Army Special Forces.\n\nHe has said in recent interviews he wants to change how the state aggressively trims its voter rolls by targeting people who haven\u2019t voted in a while.\n\nBut he also supports the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that upheld Ohio\u2019s methods of pruning voters in a case closely watched around the nation.\n\nLaRose also has backed efforts to replace aging voting machines in Ohio.\n\n___\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nA veteran Republican congressman has been elected to a 12th term after a heated challenge by a Democrat who drew national attention.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s Steve Chabot (SHA\u2019-but) of Cincinnati held off Aftab Pureval (AF\u2019-tab PYUR\u2019-vawl) in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nThe 36-year-old Pureval was coming off a major local upset in 2016, when he unseated the Republican incumbent clerk of courts for Hamilton County. He also drew attention as the son of immigrants: a Tibet-born mother and India-born father.\n\nThe 65-year-old Chabot lost in 2008 as Democrat Barack Obama was elected president, but won his seat back in 2010. Redistricting then put Republican-dominated Warren County just northeast of Cincinnati into his district. President Donald Trump campaigned there Oct. 12 with Chabot.\n\n___\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nOhio\u2019s Republican state Auditor Dave Yost has defeated a former Democratic federal prosecutor to become the state\u2019s next attorney general.\n\nYost and Democrat Steve Dettelbach traded barbs on health care, clergy abuse in the Roman Catholic church, a failed charter school and the state\u2019s unrelenting opioid crisis during the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nYost campaigned on his efforts to fight public corruption in the state and to keep special interests out of the lawmaking process. Dettelbach highlighted his efforts as U.S. attorney for northern Ohio to combat human trafficking and drug trafficking.\n\nThis was Dettelbach\u2019s first bid for elected office. He served as U.S. attorney for northern Ohio from 2009 to 2016. Before being elected state auditor in 2010, Yost served as Delaware county auditor and prosecutor.\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Robert Sprague has been elected Ohio treasurer, defeating attorney Rob Richardson on Tuesday for the office tasked with collecting taxes and managing the state\u2019s investment portfolio.\n\nThe 45-year-old Sprague\u2019s platform centered on financing drug addiction treatments and improving the transparency of state spending. He has served as city auditor and treasurer in his northwest Ohio hometown of Findlay.\n\nDuring the campaign, Democratic candidate Richardson faced legal questions about his handling of money. Court records show the 39-year-old attorney\u2019s then-wife accused him of hiding money in a private account before their divorce. Richardson\u2019s campaign said the allegation was unsubstantiated.\n\nThe state treasurer\u2019s office managed more than $224 billion in fiscal year 2017, including an investment portfolio of more than $21.5 billion.\n\nSprague succeeds two-term Republican Josh Mandel, who is term-limited.\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nVoters have rejected an Ohio constitutional amendment to make possession of all types of drugs misdemeanors in an effort to reduce the state prison population and divert savings to drug treatment.\n\nMost judicial and law enforcement groups opposed the measure known as Issue 1. And it became a point of debate in the Ohio governor\u2019s race, with Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine opposed and Democratic candidate Richard Cordray supporting it.\n\nSupporters argued Issue 1 would have saved tens of millions of dollars in prison costs, money that would be dedicated not only to drug treatment but to crime victim programs, as well.\n\nOpponents balked at the prospect of basically decriminalizing possession of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid blamed for thousands of overdose deaths in Ohio.\n\n___\n\n8:55 p.m.\n\nAn Ohio elections official says a paper jam caused an issue with a voter whose paper ballot appeared to show a different selection for governor.\n\nA video posted to Instagram showed a voter in Franklin County in central Ohio making a touch-screen selection for Ohio Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine but it appearing instead on a paper record as a vote for Democratic candidate Richard Cordray.\n\nAaron Sellers is a spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections. He says the machine in question had a paper jam that showed a previous voter\u2019s choice. Sellers says the voter who experienced the problem got a poll worker to cancel out on the machine in question and then voted successfully on another machine.\n\n___\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nA woman who during the 2016 presidential election accused Donald Trump of sexually harassing her more than a decade ago has lost her bid for a seat in Ohio\u2019s legislature.\n\nDemocrat Rachel Crooks lost on Tuesday to incumbent Republican state Rep. Bill Reineke (RY\u2019-nuh-kee) in her first attempt at a public office.\n\nThe former Trump Tower receptionist said she met Trump in 2006 and that she was 22 when she says he kissed her \u201cdirectly on the mouth\u201d against her will.\n\nTrump denied the accusations when they first surfaced a month before the 2016 election.\n\nCrooks says she decided to run in Ohio\u2019s Republican-leaning 88th House District partly because she thinks Trump escaped consequences for harassment alleged by her and others.\n\n___\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nA Democratic U.S. senator who\u2019s in his fifth decade of Ohio politics has been elected to a third term.\n\nSherrod Brown on Tuesday defeated fourth-term U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci (ruh-NAY\u2019-see), who dropped a governor\u2019s bid to run for Senate at Trump\u2019s urging.\n\nThe 65-year-old Brown won his first election to the state\u2019s House in 1974 and unseated Republican Sen. Mike DeWine in 2006. With a history of blue-collar appeal and union support, Brown has backed Trump moves on steel tariffs and renegotiating trade agreements.\n\nThe 59-year-old Renacci, a businessman, called Brown a liberal out of touch with Ohio values.\n\n___\n\n8:05 p.m.\n\nAn Ohio elections official says a paper jam caused an issue with a voter whose paper ballot appeared to show a different selection for governor.\n\nA voter in Franklin County in central Ohio posted an Instagram video that showed a touch-screen selection for Ohio Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine appearing on paper as the Democratic candidate, Richard Cordray.\n\nAaron Sellers is a spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections.

Sellers says the voter who experienced the problem was moved to another machine and cast a ballot successfully.\n\nA few other problems were reported at polling places in Lucas and Hamilton counties, where elections officials say the issues have been resolved.\n\n___\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nPolls have closed in Ohio as vote counting gets underway in a number of closely watched races.\n\nVotes in the midterm election include ballots cast Tuesday as well as thousands cast through early voting over the past month. Polls closed at 7:30 p.m. Ohioans are choosing a new slate of statewide officeholders, including governor, attorney general, auditor, secretary of state and treasurer.\n\nVoters also cast ballots in the U.S. Senate race pitching two-term incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown against GOP U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci (reh-NAY\u2019-see).\n\nThe election also included a ballot issue reducing sentences for certain lower-level drug crimes, two state Supreme Court races, seats in the Ohio House and Senate, and 16 congressional races.\n\n___\n\n6:30 p.m.\n\nA federal judge has ordered a county elections board in Ohio to deliver absentee ballot applications and ballots to two jail inmates named in a lawsuit seeking emergency ballots for Ohioans in police custody through Election Day.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Tuesday by three voting rights groups on behalf of two Montgomery County Jail inmates. The Campaign Legal Center, MacArthur Justice Center and Demos requested officials statewide be required to notify detainees of their rights to submit absentee ballots.\n\nThe lawsuit argues recently jailed inmates are denied their constitutional right to vote because they\u2019re in custody with no voting options.\n\nThe state delivers ballots to jailed Ohioans, but the deadline for requesting such ballots passed Friday.\n\nThere was no answer to calls to Montgomery County\u2019s board Tuesday.\n\n___\n\n6 p.m.\n\nAn Ohio elections official says a paper jam caused an issue with a voter whose paper ballot appeared to show a different selection for governor.\n\nA voter in Franklin County in central Ohio posted an Instagram video that showed a touch-screen selection for Ohio Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike DeWine appearing on paper as the Democratic candidate, Richard Cordray.\n\nAaron Sellers is a spokesman for the Franklin County Board of Elections.

He says that\u2019s mostly because of Trump, adding he\u2019s \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the way the president is acting.\n\nGrant Stitzlein, a 30-year-old registered Republican, says he followed Trump\u2019s advice when casting his ballot in the Columbus suburb of Dublin. Stitzlein says he voted for Republicans in an effort to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nSeventy-one-year-old Linda Bishop from Westerville says she voted for candidates from both major parties but stuck with Democrats in the gubernatorial and congressional races.

That compares with around 719,000 people mailing in ballots in 2014 and 146,000 people voting early in person, for a total of about 865,000.\n\nJust over 1 million votes were cast early in 2010.\n\nThe total number of votes cast statewide in 2014 was 3.1 million compared with nearly 4 million in 2010.\n\nAround 8 million Ohioans are registered to vote.\n\n___\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nA few problems were reported at polling places in at least two Ohio counties, where elections officials say the issues have been resolved.\n\nLucas County\u2019s Board of Elections in Toledo says at least three sites had technical problems Tuesday morning involving setup of electronic poll books.

Jim Renacci (ruh-NAY\u2019-see). Richard Cordray, President Barack Obama\u2019s appointee as federal consumer protection chief, is in a tight governor\u2019s race with Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. It\u2019s a rematch of the 2010 election when DeWine narrowly ousted Cordray to become attorney general.\n\nRepublicans have dominated recent statewide elections, capped by Republican Donald Trump\u2019s decisive 8-point victory for president over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nOhioans are choosing four other statewide officeholders, two Supreme Court justices and deciding a statewide drug sentencing ballot issue.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Democrats picked up a U.S. Senate seat in Nevada on Tuesday night when Rep. Jacky Rosen ousted incumbent Republican Dean Heller, a one-time critic of President Donald Trump who later tethered himself to the president.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump said that he was on the ballot in this election,\u201d Rosen said in her victory speech. \u201cWell, I\u2019m really proud to say Nevada responded accordingly.\u201d\n\nRosen, a 61-year-old first-term congresswoman from Las Vegas, will become Nevada\u2019s second-ever female U.S. senator, serving alongside the first, fellow Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto.\n\nRosen is a former computer programmer, software designer and president of a Henderson synagogue who narrowly won her House seat in 2016 after being recruited to run by longtime former U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, whom she thanked Tuesday night.\n\nHeller\u2019s re-election race was never going to be easy, as the only GOP senator seeking another term in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\n\nHe has faced a rocky road since last summer, when he initially opposed some GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ticking off members of his party and the president. He later supported other repeal efforts and aligned himself with Trump, who helped keep a more conservative challenger out of Heller\u2019s primary race.\n\nRosen highlighted that alliance throughout the campaign, calling Heller a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the president.\n\nIn turn, Heller contended Rosen was seeking the job not with decades of delivering results for the state, as he has, but with heavy support from outside liberal groups and Hollywood celebrities.\n\nJerry Lamb, a 72-year-old manager who lives in Henderson, was among the voters who cited Heller\u2019s positions on the health care law as the reason he voted for Rosen.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t like the fact that Dean Heller said one thing and did something else,\u201d said Lamb, an unaffiliated voter.\n\nThe race was seen as one of the Democrats\u2019 best chances to take power in the U.S. Senate, but before results were released in Nevada on Tuesday, Republicans victories elsewhere in the country ensured the GOP would retain Senate control.\n\nBesides looking to flip Heller\u2019s seat, Democrats kept two open U.S. House seats near Las Vegas in their column and flipped the Nevada governor\u2019s mansion blue.\n\nHeller said in a concession speech in Las Vegas that Rosen and the Democratic Party had a great race up and a \u201cblue wave\u201d all down the ballot in Nevada.\n\n\u201cMy hat\u2019s off to what they have been able to achieve,\u201d he said as he marked his first election loss in three decades of serving in federal and state office.\n\nHe said going into Tuesday evening, he expected to win. He took the blame for his loss, saying, \u201cI know that perhaps there were more things that I could have done.\u201d\n\nHeller, 58, had to navigate a state with strong Trump supporters while trending blue. It\u2019s also where the Affordable Care Act has been credited with helping 400,000 Nevadans gain health insurance coverage.\n\nThe close race at the top of the ticket has drawn nearly $100 million in campaign spending \u2014 with about $33 million being spent by the Rosen and Heller campaigns and an additional $66 million from outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nDuring the campaign, Heller highlighted Rosen\u2019s light track record in the House and her decision to run for his seat after only six months on the job. He\u2019s also pointed out that the bulk of the money Rosen raised has come from people living in New York and California.\n\nIn his concession speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, Heller cited the 2017 GOP tax law he helped write and the confirmation of judges to the U.S. Supreme Court as \u201cgenerational changes\u201d he was proud of achieving while in office.\n\nRosen said Tuesday that she\u2019s humbled by her win, and plans to work on getting a $15 an hour minimum wage, ease college loan debt for students and pass \u201ccommon-sense gun safety legislation,\u201d among other goals.\n\nThe senator-elect took the stage Tuesday night to celebrate her victory at Caesars Palace, where she briefly worked as a cocktail waitress four decades ago.\n\n\u201cI never could have imagined all these years later really that I\u2019d be standing here on this stage as your next United States senator,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Trey Arline and Marquis Ealy in Las Vegas and Scott Sonner in Reno contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of file photos shows candidates for Texas' 23rd District Congressional seat in the November 2018 election from left, incumbent GOP Rep.

John Carter has fended off a high-profile challenge from a well-funded ex-Air Force pilot to win re-election in a reliably red suburban Austin district that Democrats had longshot hopes of flipping.\n\nCarter, from Round Rock, north of Texas\u2019 capital, was first elected to the House in 2002 and had rarely been challenged since, winning re-election by 20 points in 2016.\n\nBut Hegar produced an ad highlighting her having survived an abusive father and being shot down and injured by the Taliban in Afghanistan while flying a helicopter in 2009. It became a national sensation, helping her raise $4-plus million \u2014 more than triple Carter\u2019s haul.\n\nShe then blanked TV airwaves with anti-Carter ads.

But Texas\u2019 shifting demographics now mean that 60 percent of his district voters are minority and 20 percent are Asian, making it one of the state\u2019s largest Asian districts.\n\nBoth candidates raised over $1 million and charges of racism marred the race. The Fort Bend County Republican Party apologized for an ad in a district newspaper popular with Indian-Americans that likened Hindu deity Ganesha to the GOP\u2019s elephant symbol.\n\nNational Democrats that Kulkarni, while a longshot could upset Olson as they look to retake control of the House.\n\n___\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nFormer NFL linebacker and civil rights attorney Colin Allred has defeated longtime Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, flipping a reliably conservative Dallas enclave.\n\nSessions has been in Congress since 1997 and rarely challenged in an area that is home to the likes of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. He didn\u2019t even face a Democratic opponent in 2016.\n\nBut Hillary Clinton topped Donald Trump in the district two years ago. Its growing minority population helped prompt national Democrats to pour funding and field staff into supporting Allred. Sessions had national help too, including an October visit from Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nDemocrats hope a surge nationally can help them gain 23 seats and retake the House. Allred\u2019s victory marks their first Texas pickup.\n\nNews of Allred\u2019s win sent booming cheers through the ballroom at a Dallas hotel.

Perhaps because he had low expectations.\n\n\u201cI had just got back from a lads\u2019 trip to Lisbon. Good preparation! I had a few days out there when Ed Smith (selector) gave me a ring.

Katie Arrington in the coastal 1st District means South Carolina\u2019s U.S. House delegation now has five Republicans and two Democrats.\n\nDemocrats had less luck in statewide races. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster had an easy re-election win as Republicans again won all seven statewide offices. A Democrat hasn\u2019t won a statewide race in South Carolina since 2006.\n\nAll 124 state House seats were up for re-election. More than half of them, 68, were uncontested. Just 45 races had a Republican facing a Democrat. One incumbent Democrat and one incumbent Republican lost.\n\nThe Democrats did flip a state Senate seat for the first time since 2000 as former state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian won a special election to fill the remainder of the term for Republican Sen. John Courson, who resigned after pleading guilty to converting his campaign money to personal use.\n\n___\n\nSTATEWIDE OFFICES\n\nAlong with touting his accomplishments, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson spent campaign time this year explaining his role in an investigation into corruption at the Statehouse.\n\nWilson defeated Democrat Constance Anastopoulo, even though less than a month before the election, a State Grand Jury report said Wilson impeded an investigation into corruption at the South Carolina Statehouse involving a friend he hired as a political consultant.\n\nAnastopoulo spent nearly $500,000 of her own money trying to knock off Wilson, much of it on TV ads.

Melvin Whittenburg, said he would make sure the job\u2019s requirements are met, and also add new initiatives like waiving application fees for new businesses started by recent college graduates.\n\nRepublican state Treasurer Curtis Loftis won a third term. He has tangled with legislators over investments and how to handle the state retirement system.

Ralph Norman in the 5th District.\n\nNorman won a special election last year by just 3 percentage points, but appeared on his way to a much bigger win in 2018. The complexion of this year\u2019s race changed in May when divorce records surfaced showing Parnell broke a glass door and beat his then-wife with his fists back in 1973. The 5th District is in the northern part of the state and includes suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s longest serving congressman is the delegation\u2019s lone Democrat, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn. He won a 14th term against Republican Gerhard Gressmann in the 6th District, which connects parts of Columbia with parts of Charleston and was drawn to insure it had a majority of minority voters.\n\nIn the 2nd District, Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson won handily over Democrat and Army veteran Sean Carrigan. Wilson hasn\u2019t faced a close election since his district was redrawn in 2010. It includes Aiken, Barnwell and Lexington counties as well as parts of Orangeburg and Richland counties.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan easily won a fifth term against Democrat Mary Geren in the 3rd District that covers 11 counties in northwest South Carolina.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tom Rice is defeated state Rep. Robert Williams in the 7th District. Rice is the only congressman the district which stretches from Darlington to Florence has ever known. Williams is also running to keep his state House seat.\n\nThere is one new face from South Carolina in the U.S. House. Republican state Sen.

It\u2019s easy to get swamped by everything until someone comes in to sort and organize the collection.\n\nThe painting she referred to is called \u201cSundown\u201d and it hangs near the front of a museum.\n\nRyan was best known for his paintings of the 6666 Ranch in Guthrie. He was one of the museum founders and died in 2011.\n\nAnother work is by Avery Johnson, not known as a Western artist but as a prolific water colorist.\n\n\u201cHis work hangs in the Smithsonian in Washington D.C.,\u201d Wedeking said. \u201cThese were treasures we didn\u2019t know we had, until we started researching them.\u201d\n\nA centerpiece of the collection in the main gallery is the chuck wagon from the SMS Flat-Top Ranch. They know it\u2019s authentic because they\u2019ve also got pictures of it in use from about 100 years ago.\n\nIt was sitting in the back of the room, Keunstler and a volunteer decided to pull it up to the front.\n\n\u201cIt was very hard, it was extremely heavy,\u201d Keunstler said, with relief in her voice. \u201cI felt sorry for the horses that pulled it.\u201d\n\nShe clarified that it actually rolled very well. It was just the initial shove to get it moving that proved difficult. That and steering it.\n\n\u201cThe Swenson Ranch was started in 1882 so it could have been original from that time,\u201d Wedeking said.\n\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to tell the story of the Swensons, how they and Stamford came to be here,\u201d Keunstler said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this look like a cowboy camp, so when you come in here you actually feel like you\u2019re out with a working chuck wagon.\u201d\n\nSwante M. Swenson came to Texas from Sweden in the 1830s, according to the Texas State Historical Association\u2019s Handbook of Texas. He introduced the Colt revolver to the Texas navy and the army. His family owned a handful of ranches across Texas, at one time owning nearly 500,000 acres before the Civil War.\n\nAfter the war, the Swensons established three ranches in the northern Big Country and started the Texas Cowboy Reunion in 1930. The family had offices in New York City but Stamford and West Texas remained close to their hearts, as evidenced by their award-winning cattle and the old documents Keunstler showed me, on koan to the museum\u2019s archive.\n\n\u201cAs you go through them, you can see the Great Depression happening,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can see the money problems they are having, the community is having.\u201d\n\nShe described how the Swensons would parcel their land to attract farmers to the community. But as the 1930s progress, the correspondence clearly indicates how some farmers were struggling and couldn\u2019t always make their payments.\n\n\u201cThey would almost always reply that everybody is having a hard time, and to give them another two years,\u201d Keunstler recalled. \u201cThey were afraid if they foreclosed on them, it would start a chain reaction and they didn\u2019t want to do that to the town.\u201d\n\nThe entire west wall of the new gallery is covered by memorabilia honoring the Stamford High School Bulldogs. During homecoming, Wedeking said it was their Instagram wall.\n\nTo the left is another kind of school history.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to tell the history of all of Stamford,\u201d Keunstler said, gesturing to the binders and photographs. \u201cThose are rural schools, some of those closed when they consolidated with Stamford.\u201d\n\nThis was before school integration, when students of color attended their own schools. But in the years since, it\u2019s been Stamford High School that has been remembered longer.\n\nThat has changed now, thanks to the University of North Texas, a grant from the Tocker Foundation and the sponsorship of the Stamford Carnegie Library. Their support enabled the museum to have their entire newspaper archive digitized.\n\n\u201cThis is every article that appeared in Stamford newspapers on Booker T. Washington School,\u201d Wedeking said, opening a book. \u201cThere is an element of our community that went to different schools, so now their history that is here is celebrated, and it\u2019s searchable.\u201d\n\nA group of 17 juniors and seniors from Stamford High come to the museum Friday mornings to read through the old newspaper articles and write down any names they find. They add them to an index so family members researching genealogy can search them.\n\nSeeing the kids helping out at the museum has contributed to what Wedeking describes as a \u201crenaissance\u201d in Stamford. That\u2019s especially true with the Grand Theatre, soon to reopen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several community members say that it is so cool to drive around the square on Friday morning and see a big football player out here with his jersey on, sweeping the sidewalk in front of the museum,\u201d she said. \u201cPreserving and celebrating history gives these kids something to take pride in.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Abilene Reporter-News, http://www.reporternews.com", "Sydney Crawford, 84, left, of New York City, and JoAnn Loulan, 70, of Portola Valley, Calif., watch election returns during a Democratic party election night event at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democrats seized the House majority from President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party on Tuesday in a suburban revolt that threatened what\u2019s left of the president\u2019s governing agenda. But the GOP gained ground in the Senate and preserved key governorships, beating back a \u201cblue wave\u201d that never fully materialized.\n\nThe mixed verdict in the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency underscored the limits of his hardline immigration rhetoric in America\u2019s evolving political landscape, where college-educated voters in the nation\u2019s suburbs rejected his warnings of a migrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d But blue-collar voters and rural America embraced his aggressive talk and stances.\n\nThe new Democratic House majority will end the Republican Party\u2019s dominance in Washington for the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term with major questions looming about health care, immigration and government spending.\n\n\u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d declared House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who would be in line to become the next House speaker.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 edge is narrow. With 218 seats needed for a majority, Democrats have won 219 and the Republicans 193, with winners undetermined in 23 races.\n\nTrump was expected to address the results at a post-election news conference scheduled for midday Wednesday.\n\nThe president\u2019s party will maintain control of the executive branch of the government, in addition to the Senate, but Democrats suddenly have a foothold that gives them subpoena power to probe deep into Trump\u2019s personal and professional missteps \u2014 and his long-withheld tax returns.\n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

Two can play that game!\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear what \u201cleaks\u201d he was referring to.\n\nIt could have been a much bigger night for Democrats, who suffered stinging losses in Ohio and in Florida, where Trump-backed Republican Ron DeSantis ended Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s bid to become the state\u2019s first African-American governor.\n\nThe 2018 elections also exposed an extraordinary political realignment in an electorate defined by race, gender, and education that could shape U.S. politics for years to come.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s successes were fueled by a coalition that\u2019s decidedly older, whiter, more male and less likely to have college degrees. Democrats relied more upon women, people of color, young people and college graduates.\n\nRecord diversity on the ballot may have helped drive turnout.\n\nVoters were on track to send at least 99 women to the House, shattering the record of 84 now. The House was also getting its first two Muslim women, Massachusetts elected its first black congresswoman, and Tennessee got its first female senator.\n\nThree candidates had hoped to become their states\u2019 first African-American governors, although just one \u2014 Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams \u2014 was still in the running.\n\nOverall, women voted considerably more in favor of congressional Democratic candidates \u2014 with fewer than 4 in 10 voting for Republicans, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and about 20,000 nonvoters \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn suburban areas where key House races were decided, female voters skewed significantly toward Democrats by a nearly 10-point margin.\n\nDemocrats celebrated a handful of victories in their \u201cblue wall\u201d Midwestern states, electing or re-electing governors in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and in Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was defeated by state education chief Tony Evers.\n\nThe road to a House majority ran through two dozen suburban districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats flipped seats in suburban districts outside of Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver. Democrats also reclaimed a handful of blue-collar districts carried by both former President Barack Obama and Trump.\n\nThe results were more mixed deeper into Trump country.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Sharice Davids beat a GOP incumbent to become the first gay Native American woman elected to the House. But in Kentucky, one of the top Democratic recruits, retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, lost her bid to oust to three-term Rep. Andy Barr.\n\nTrump sought to take credit for retaining the GOP\u2019s Senate majority, even as the party lost control of the House. In a tweet Wednesday, he referred to the election results as a \u201cBig Victory.\u201d\n\nHistory was working against the president in both the House and the Senate: The president\u2019s party has traditionally suffered deep losses in his first midterm election, and 2002 was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 dreams of the Senate majority, always unlikely, were shattered after losses in top Senate battlegrounds: Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, North Dakota and Texas.\n\nSome hurt worse than others.\n\nIn Texas, Sen Ted Cruz staved off a tough challenge from Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose record-smashing fundraising and celebrity have set off buzz he could be a credible 2020 White House contender.\n\nTrump encouraged voters to view the 2018 midterms as a referendum on his leadership, pointing proudly to the surging economy at his recent rallies.\n\nNearly 40 percent of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to VoteCast, while one-in-four said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

In addition to rain gear, voters will need to bring identification to the polls Tuesday.\n\nThat could be a Wisconsin driver\u2019s license, a state-issued photo ID card, a U.S. military ID card, a tribal ID card, a U.S. passport or a student photo ID issued by a Wisconsin university with an expiration date no later than two years after the date of issue.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wisconsin Elections Commission says more than 547,000 absentee ballots have already been returned for this election, breaking a record set in 2014 for a midterm election.\n\n___\n\n1 a.m.\n\nHigh-profile clashes for governor and the U.S. Senate top the ballot in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s governor\u2019s race, Scott Walker faces Democrat Tony Evers as he goes for a third term that the Republican governor promises will be his last should he win.\n\nWalker made history by defeating a recall in 2012, then mounted an unsuccessful presidential bid.

(AP) \u2014 Once pegged as a low-thrill election cycle without major statewide races, North Carolina\u2019s campaign season became a high-intensity fight over Republican governance in Raleigh and Washington, and whether Democrats deserve more power.\n\nRecord numbers voted early before Tuesday\u2019s midterms, reflecting the energy and money injected into legislative, judicial and congressional races and ballot questions.\n\nState Democrats raised mammoth sums of cash, buoyed by Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s call to \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d of the GOP in both the House and Senate this decade. Appraisals of state Republican control stretched to a state Supreme Court race, where the Democrat won, and six referendums, two of which failed. Three GOP congressional seats were also threatened with close races, although Republicans held onto at least two of those.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nAll General Assembly seats are on ballots. Democrats angry with Republican policies on public schools, taxes, the judiciary and social issues are focusing on this year\u2019s election at a minimum as a step toward regaining General Assembly control.\n\nRepublicans currently hold 75 of the 120 House seats and 35 of the 50 Senate seats. Democrats would need to pick up at least four House seats or six Senate seats to end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof margins and give more leverage to Cooper to pass his initiatives, like expanding Medicaid and curbing school choice options.\n\nTo regain outright majorities for the first time since 2011, Democrats would need to win 16 more House seats overall and 11 Senate seats.\n\nCooper raised at least $7 million for the state Democratic Party, which passed money along to the party\u2019s legislative candidates. Republican campaigns have highlighted the strong economy, passing lower taxes and increasing school spending and teacher raises. While many House Republican incumbents got outraised by Democratic challengers, Senate Republicans fared better.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nVoters said no Tuesday to two amendments shifting power to legislators from the governor, while an amendment requiring a photo ID to vote and three others passed.\n\nThe other amendments that passed lower the cap on income tax rates; expand crime victims\u2019 rights and enshrine the right to hunt and fish.\n\nThe six amendments Republican lawmakers submitted to voters filled the vacuum of having no races for governor or U.S. Senate. Groups for or against the amendments raised well over $20 million, according to campaign finance reports.\n\nCooper, the Democratic Party and allied groups pushed to defeat all six. The state GOP supported all six, but former Republican governors and the conservative Americans for Prosperity have come out against one or two individual amendments.\n\nAPPEALS COURTS\n\nVoters elected Democrat Anita Earls to the state Supreme Court, unseating the Republican incumbent.\n\nEarls, a longtime civil rights attorney from Durham, raised record campaign money and garnered national attention as she defeated Republican incumbent Justice Barbara Jackson.\n\nJackson was seeking a second eight-year term but got waylaid by the late entry of another registered Republican, Raleigh attorney Chris Anglin. He had been a registered Democrat until just before he filed. Democrats now hold five of the seven Supreme Court seats.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nRepublicans hold a 10-3 seat advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation.\n\nThe most likely district to flip would be in the south-central 9th District anchored by Charlotte, where Democrat Dan McCready has outraised Republican Mark Harris, who upset current Rep. Robert Pittenger in the GOP primary in May.\n\nIn the 13th District, covering parts of Greensboro and points west to Iredell County, first-term Republican Rep. Ted Budd was able to fend off a challenge by Kathy Manning. In the Raleigh-area 2nd District, three-term GOP Rep. George Holding retained his seat over Democrat Linda Coleman.\n\nNine other incumbents won, while 3rd District Rep. Walter Jones Jr. faced no ballot opposition.\n\nEARLY VOTING\n\nEarly in-person voting levels smashed the previous record high for midterms in 2014 with several days to spare in this year\u2019s 18-day period. But it\u2019s unclear how much front-loaded voting will translate to higher overall turnout when all mail-absentee ballots and those cast Tuesday in 2,700 precincts statewide are counted.\n\nThe state elections board counted 1.97 million people voting at early-voting sites statewide before they closed Saturday, compared to 1.1 million in 2014, when 10 days of early voting occurred.\n\nOverall 2014 election turnout was 44 percent, or 2.9 million voters.

Robert Bentley.\n\nZeigler previously was a lawyer, but he gave up his law license earlier this year.\n\nJoseph told voters the state needs a trained auditor to hold the job of state auditor.

Robert Bentley in 2012. The former business owner and bank manager also is an ordained minister.\n\nOden says he spent part of his campaign trying to educate voters about what Public Service Commission does.\n\nMcClure campaigned on the idea that the Public Service Commission needs more transparency as it oversees state utilities.

He also talked about supporting the military, tax cuts and replacing the health care law signed by former President Barack Obama.\n\nThe 29-year-old Hagan is from Opelika and was crowned Miss America in 2013.

The question is whether Democrats can translate newfound energy into even one win in a statewide or congressional race.\n\nNo Democrat holds statewide office in Montgomery, and Alabama\u2019s nine-member delegation to Washington includes seven Republicans.\n\nBut starting with the race between GOP Gov. Kay Ivey and Democratic challenger Walt Maddox, state Democrats are more optimistic than in recent years, partly because they managed to elect Doug Jones as U.S. Senator last year. Opposition to President Donald Trump \u2014 who is hugely popular among Alabama Republicans \u2014 helped bring out new Democratic candidates.\n\nHere are some of the top races and issues to watch in Alabama on Election Day:\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nThe race to be Alabama\u2019s attorney general features an odd dynamic \u2014 the challenger may have better name recognition than the incumbent.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Steve Marshall, an appointee who previously served as a county prosecutor in north Alabama, is being opposed by Democrat Joseph Siegelman, the son one of the best-known names in state politics, former Gov. Don Siegelman.\n\nMarshall, 53, took over in February 2017 after Luther Strange was appointed to the U.S. Senate. He endured personal tragedy earlier this year when his wife Bridgette took her own life in June just weeks before the Republican runoff.\n\nSiegelman, 30, is a Birmingham attorney who was making his first bid for public office. While many voters might recognize his name because of his father, they also might attach some unwanted baggage to it. Don Siegelman, Alabama\u2019s last Democratic governor, served time in federal prison after being convicted in a bribery conspiracy.\n\nLIEUTENANT GOVERNOR\n\nAlabama hasn\u2019t even had a lieutenant governor since April 2017, when Kay Ivey was elevated from the position to become governor following Robert Bentley\u2019s resignation. That\u2019s about to change.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Will Ainsworth and Democrat Will Boyd are vying to become lieutenant governor. The main job of the office is to preside over the state Senate.\n\nAinsworth was first elected to the Alabama House four years ago. The North Alabama resident billed himself as Christian conservative who will set a higher ethical standard at a Statehouse tainted by repeated scandals in recent years.\n\nBoyd is a minister from Florence. He has made several unsuccessful bids for public office, including last year when he sought the Democratic nomination for the seat now held by Jones.\n\nCONGRESS\n\nSix contested congressional seats are on the ballot, highlighted by the race for the District 3 office that represents much of eastern Alabama.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Rogers of Saks is being challenged by Democrat and former Miss America Mallory Hagan of Opelika as he seeks a ninth term in the solidly GOP district.\n\nWhile Hagan has portrayed Rogers as being out of touch with voters after years in Washington, Rogers has cast himself as a solid conservative who supports the president on issues including border security and strengthening the military.\n\nIn other races, GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne of Fairhope is opposed by Democrat Robert Kennedy Jr. of Mobile in District 1, and Republican Rep. Martha Roby of Montgomery is being challenged by Democrat Tabitha Isner in District 2 of southeastern Alabama.\n\nEleven-term Republican Rep. Robert Aderholt of Haleyville is on the ballot in District 4 of north central Alabama against Democrat Lee Auman, a camp manager from Union Grove. Democrat Peter Joffrion is attempting to unseat four-term Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Huntsville in District 5.\n\nIn the 6th District of metro Birmingham, GOP Rep. Gary Palmer is seeking a third term against Democrat Danner Kline, an early leader of Alabama\u2019s craft beer industry.\n\nSUPREME COURT\n\nThe ballot includes two contested races for Alabama Supreme Court, including the top position on the nine-member panel.\n\nRepublican Alabama Supreme Court Associate Justice Tom Parker and Democratic Circuit Judge Bob Vance Jr. of Birmingham are vying for the office of chief justice.\n\nParker was elected to the Supreme Court in 2004. His campaign appealed to social conservatives and emphasized his hope of one day overturning U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as the one that legalized abortion.\n\nVance was endorsed by six former chief justices, including three Republicans.\n\nIn the other Supreme Court race, Birmingham attorney Jay Mitchell and Jasper attorney Donna Wesson Smalley are both seeking the Place 4 position on the state\u2019s highest court.\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS\n\nConstitutional amendments about the hot-button topics of abortion and religion could help drive turnout on Tuesday.\n\nVoters will decide whether to add anti-abortion language to Alabama\u2019s 1901 constitution specifying that the state recognizes the \u201crights of unborn children.\u201d The measure does not impact abortion access unless Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, is reversed.\n\nThe statewide ballot also includes a constitutional amendment regarding the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools and government buildings. The proposal would allow for the display the Old Testament laws in a way that \u201ccomplies with constitutional requirements\u201d such as being intermingled with historical documents.\n\nBoth issues could help bring GOP voters to the polls given the numbers of Christian conservatives who vote Republican in the state.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Virginia voters have their say on Election Day\n\nElaine Luria speaks to a room full of supporters after upsetting incumbent Scott Taylor to win Virginia's 2nd Congressional District on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, night in Virginia Beach. (Stephen M. Katz/The Virginian-Pilot via AP)\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Virginia voters made their picks Tuesday in several competitive congressional races, flipping Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation from a Republican to a Democratic majority. Voters also cast ballots in a special state House election that kept Republicans in control in the Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some key races:\n\n___\n\nSENATE\n\nThe only statewide contest this year saw Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine easily defeat Republican Corey Stewart, a firebrand supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nKaine was the heavy favorite to win and had large leads in most polls. He also enjoyed a massive cash advantage to finance advertising and get out the vote efforts.\n\nStewart was all but abandoned by national Republicans and the White House. Best known for his outspoken support of Confederate monuments and hardline views on immigration, Stewart focused heavily on attacking Kaine personally.\n\nKaine, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate during her unsuccessful 2016 presidential run, emphasized inclusivity in his campaign and centered his message on a \u201cVirginia that works for all.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 10\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, who represents this northern Virginia district, was long considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress \u2014 the district includes many wealthy suburban voters who dislike Trump. Hillary Clinton won the district by 10 percentage points, and Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam won by 11.\n\nDemocratic state senator Jennifer Wexton took advantage of Comstock\u2019s vulnerability and cruised to a double-digit victory on Tuesday.\n\nComstock tried hard to emphasis her independence from Trump. She won re-election in 2016 when her district went for Clinton.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 2\n\nThis Hampton Roads-area seat, a swing district, also flipped from Republican to Democratic control. U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor sought a second term in a district Northam won by four percentage points. But the former Navy SEAL lost narrowly to Democrat Elaine Luria, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who spent 20 years on active duty.\n\nThe race was marked by a ballot-fraud scandal that tainted Taylor\u2019s campaign. Some of Taylor\u2019s staff members were accused of forging voters\u2019 signatures to help place a third-party \u201cspoiler candidate\u201d on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE DISTRICT 7\n\nDemocrat Abigail Spanberger has defeated two-term Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s 7th District Congressional race.\n\nThe former CIA officer and political newcomer scored a dramatic win Tuesday for Democrats in a district that has been held by Republicans since 1971.\n\nThe 39-year-old Spanberger cast herself as a moderate during the race and slammed Brat for being out of touch with voters in the district covering suburbs west of Richmond and large rural areas.\n\nBrat, a former economics professor, touted the strong economy and tax cuts under Republican President Donald Trump.

Larry Hogan has held big leads against Democrat Ben Jealous in recent polls in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1. That has the potential to transmit energy down the ticket to Republicans who are running for seats in the state legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. Republicans are focusing on breaking a supermajority of Democrats in the state Senate.\n\nJealous and other Maryland Democrats are hoping a \u201cblue wave\u201d of heavy Democratic turnout will enable them to regain the governor\u2019s office and maintain their supermajorities in the House and Senate. Democrats are also looking to at least keep their 7-1 advantage in the state\u2019s U.S. House delegation by winning an open seat in western Maryland.\n\nHere is a look at the key Maryland races in Tuesday\u2019s election:\n\nGOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\n\nHogan said a second term would look a lot like his first, and his priorities are the same: aiming to make improvements in education, job creation and transportation infrastructure. He said he also wants to continue working for tax relief. A moderate Republican who has emphasized bipartisanship, he hopes to become the first Republican governor to win re-election in Maryland since 1954.\n\nJealous is a former national president of the NAACP who would be Maryland\u2019s first black governor, if he prevails. He has won support from leading liberals on the national stage, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

(AP) \u2014 Delaware voters are deciding who will fill two of the three seats held by the state\u2019s congressional delegation and three statewide elected offices, as well as whether Republicans gain control of the state Senate for the first time in decades.\n\nCurrently, Democrats hold all three of Delaware\u2019s congressional seats, the attorney general\u2019s office, and control of both chambers of the General Assembly. Republicans are hoping they can hold on to the state treasurer\u2019s office and state auditor\u2019s office, score upset wins in U.S. Senate and House races, and take control of the state senate for the first time since 1973.\n\nHere is a look at the key races in Delaware:\n\nU.S. SENATE\n\nIncumbent Democrat Tom Carper is seeking a fourth-term in the U.S. Senate as he seeks to keep his unbeaten string during more than four decades in politics intact. Carper is running against Sussex County Councilman Rob Arlett, who owns a real estate business and was President Donald Trump\u2019s state campaign chair in 2016. Also running are Green Party candidate Demitri Theodoropoulos, a record store owner in Newark, and Libertarian candidate Nadine Frost, a political activist who ran for Wilmington city council two years ago.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nIncumbent Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester, the first black and first woman elected to Congress from Delaware, is seeking a second term as the state\u2019s lone representative in the U.S. House. She is being challenged by Republican Scott Walker, a businessman who ran for Congress two years ago as a Democrat and has been disavowed by the state GOP for his controversial statements.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nDemocrat Kathleen Jennings, a former state prosecutor who also held the number-two job in Delaware\u2019s Department of Justice, is now vying to become attorney general. Her Republican opponent is Bernard Pepukayi, a longtime Democrat who switched parties and filed for the office after the lone GOP candidate abruptly quit the race. Incumbent Democrat Matt Denn opted not to seek re-election.\n\nTREASURER\n\nRepublican Ken Simpler is seeking a second four-year term as state treasurer, an office that has been used in the past as a stepping stone to higher office. Simpler, who has a long background in the finance industry, is being challenged by Democratic newcomer Colleen Davis, a health care industry consultant.\n\nAUDITOR\n\nIncumbent Republican Tom Wagner\u2019s decision to retire for health reasons has given Democrats the chance to claim the state auditor\u2019s office for the first time since 1989, when Wagner first took office. Democrat Kathleen McGuiness, a businesswoman and longtime Rehoboth Beach commissioner, is vying for the seat against Republican James Spadola, a military veteran and former Newark police officer who has an MBA degree and a background in finance. Less than three weeks before Tuesday\u2019s election, Wagner appointed Spadola to fill the vacant post of deputy auditor, drawing complaints from Democrats of political favoritism and partisanship.\n\nDELAWARE SENATE\n\nDemocrats currently control the Delaware Senate by a narrow 11-10 margin, but Republicans are hoping to regain control of the chamber for the first time since Richard Nixon was president. Republicans have a chance to unseat two incumbent Democrats in northern Delaware but are setting their sights on a seat in central Delaware left open by a Democratic lawmaker\u2019s retirement.

The commission meets every 20 years.\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nFlorida voters have stripped the state Legislature\u2019s power to authorize most casino gambling.\n\nVoters on Tuesday approved Amendment 3, which says the only way casino gambling can be approved is through a statewide initiative placed on the ballot by citizen petition.

That created one of the few pickup opportunities for Republicans nationwide.\n\n___\n\n11:45 p.m.\n\nRepublican Pete Stauber has captured a once solidly Democratic northeastern Minnesota congressional district that swung hard for President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nStauber beat Democratic former state lawmaker Joe Radinovich to flip the seat back to the GOP for the first time since 2012. The seat opened up when Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan announced he wouldn\u2019t run for a fourth term.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s 8th District was a rare bright spot for Republicans in an otherwise bleak year for the GOP. The area was once considered a Democratic lock but has been trending toward Republicans. Trump carried the district by 15 points.\n\nStauber is a St. Louis County commissioner and retired police officer. He branded Radinovich as out-of-step with an increasingly Republican-leaning district.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nRep. Keith Ellison has been elected Minnesota attorney general, surviving an ex-girlfriend\u2019s accusation of domestic abuse.\n\nEllison defeated Republican Doug Wardlow for an office that threatened to swing to Republicans for the first time in nearly half a century.\n\nEllison rose to national prominence as the first Muslim elected to Congress and last year became deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He talked of using the attorney general\u2019s office to resist President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThen his ex-girlfriend accused him of dragging her off a bed during an argument in 2016. Ellison repeatedly denied her allegations, but they helped make the race close, even though Wardlow was a virtual unknown.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nRepublicans have won a high-stakes special election to keep control of the Minnesota Senate.\n\nGOP state Rep. Jeff Howe beat Democrat Joe Perske, a county commissioner, on Tuesday. Howe\u2019s victory preserves Republicans\u2019 34-33 majority.\n\nThe district surrounding St. Cloud is considered safely GOP but Democrats pounced on a chance to retake control of the chamber. The Senate was left deadlocked at 33-33 after Republican Sen. Michelle Fischbach vacated her seat to be sworn in as lieutenant governor.\n\nBoth candidates played up their experience in the area as outside political groups poured hundreds of thousands of dollars in to influence the race. Howe has represented half the district in the House.\n\nPerske was also former mayor of Sartell.\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nMinnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt has conceded that Democrats will take back control of the chamber.\n\nDaudt told The Associated Press that Republicans will lose the majority after Democrats flipped more than a dozen suburban districts. Democrats needed to win 11 districts to win back control of the chamber for the first time since 2014.\n\nHigh turnout in the Minneapolis area and surrounding suburbs helped power Democrats up and down the ballot to victory. Democratic candidate Tim Walz also won Tuesday\u2019s race for governor.\n\nThe final margin of Democrats\u2019 majority in the House wasn\u2019t immediately clear as votes are still being counted. And Democrats could retake the state Senate with a special election in the narrowly divided chamber.\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith says she\u2019s humbled by the Minnesota voters who elected her to fill out former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term.\n\nSmith defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley in Tuesday\u2019s special election. The race was triggered by Franken\u2019s resignation in January amid a growing sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nSmith told supporters at a Democratic-Farmer-Labor gathering Tuesday night that she\u2019s anxious to get back to work in the U.S. Senate. She\u2019s held the seat since Gov. Mark Dayton appointed her in January.\n\nSmith would have to face voters again in 2020 if she runs for re-election.\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\nTim Walz says his election as Minnesota\u2019s governor and high voter turnout is proof that the state\u2019s \u201ccan-do spirit\u201d is alive and well.\n\nWalz defeated second-time Republican candidate Jeff Johnson on Tuesday. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton chose not to run for a third term.\n\nWalz was the favorite throughout the race, but his victory was still unusual. It marks the first time one of Minnesota\u2019s political parties has held on to the office for three or more terms since the 1950s.\n\nWalz campaigned on expanding the state\u2019s low-income health care program to have a public option and increasing education funding. He said his victory was a sign that Minnesota residents want to see those policies enacted.\n\n___\n\n9:58 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith has won Minnesota\u2019s special election to finish the final two years of former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s term.\n\nSmith defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley on Tuesday. The election was a 10-month sprint, triggered in January after Franken resigned amid a growing sexual misconduct scandal.\n\nSmith got a head start in the race when she was appointed to take the seat by Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton. Smith was Dayton\u2019s lieutenant governor and former top aide.\n\nHousley tried to brand Smith as a political insider. But national Republican groups largely bypassed Housley\u2019s race, sinking resources instead into more winnable races in states like North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\n9:49 p.m.\n\nRep. Tim Walz has won Minnesota\u2019s open race for governor, keeping Democrats\u2019 hold on the state\u2019s top office.\n\nWalz defeated second-time Republican candidate Jeff Johnson. Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton chose not to run for a third term.\n\nWalz was ahead in public polling throughout the race, but his victory was still unusual. It marks the first time one of Minnesota\u2019s political parties has held on to the office for three or more terms since the 1950s.\n\nJohnson, a Hennepin County commissioner who ran against Dayton in 2014, struggled to gain ground against Walz after surpassing former Gov. Tim Pawlenty in the August primary.\n\nWalz spent six terms representing a Republican-leaning congressional district in southern Minnesota.\n\n___\n\n9:20 p.m.\n\nKeith Ellison has taken an early lead in Minnesota\u2019s attorney general race, but he trails some other Democrats in statewide races.\n\nEllison gave up a safe seat in Congress to seek the post, and he should have been a heavy favorite in a state that has not elected a Republican attorney general in half a century. But an ex-girlfriend\u2019s domestic abuse accusation \u2014 which he strongly denied \u2014 left him in a close and bitter race with Republican Doug Wardlow.\n\nThe seat opened abruptly in June when incumbent Lori Swanson launched a late bid for governor. Soon after that, ex-girlfriend Karen Monahan accused Ellison of dragging her off a bed.\n\nEllison has been a national political figure since 2006, when he became the first Muslim elected to Congress.\n\n___\n\n8:57 p.m.\n\nDemocratic businessman Dean Phillips has defeated Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen in a suburban Minnesota district that figures heavily into Democrats\u2019 hopes for a House takeover.\n\nPaulsen had easily won elections throughout his five terms in office even as the Minneapolis-area district trended toward Democrats.\n\nBut the district favored Hillary Clinton by nearly 10 points two years ago, and a statewide poll late in the race showed Phillips with a comfortable lead. Outside groups poured more than $10 million into the battleground race.\n\nPhillips ran his family\u2019s liquor company and started a chain of local coffee shops. He painted Paulsen as too in step with President Donald Trump, though Paulsen tried to distance himself from the president.\n\n___\n\n8:39 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has easily won a third term in Minnesota.\n\nKlobuchar defeated Republican state Rep. Jim Newberger on Tuesday. It comes as Klobuchar\u2019s name swirls amid the crop of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2020.\n\nThe race was never close. Newberger is a little-known state lawmaker who struggled to raise money against the popular Klobuchar.\n\nRepublicans put far more focus on the state\u2019s other Senate race to complete the last two years of Al Franken\u2019s term. State Sen. Karin Housley carried the party\u2019s hopes in that race against Democratic Sen. Tina Smith.\n\n__\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nState Rep. Ilhan Omar has won Minnesota\u2019s 5th District race to become the first Somali-American and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\n\nOmar will succeed U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, who gave up the safe seat in a heavily Democratic Minneapolis-area district to run for state attorney general. Ellison himself was the first Muslim elected to Congress more than a decade ago.\n\nOmar defeated Republican activist Jennifer Zielinski.\n\nOmar says she\u2019ll vote to impeach President Donald Trump if given the chance. She was dogged during the campaign by allegations first raised by conservative media two years ago that she married her brother and committed immigration fraud. She denounced those claims as \u201cdisgusting lies.\u201d\n\n__\n\n8 p.m.\n\nPolls have closed in Minnesota, where voter turnout in the midterm election was reported to be strong.\n\nSecretary of State spokesman Ben Petok says that as of Tuesday morning, elections officials had received nearly 615,000 absentee and mail-in ballots. That\u2019s close to the more than 650,000 early ballots received for the presidential election two years ago.\n\nJoe Mansky is elections manager in Ramsey County, which includes St. Paul. He visited some polling places and reported that turnout was good.\n\nFew technical glitches have been reported, though there was some confusion about rules.\n\nCouncilwoman Fran Holmes in the St. Paul suburb of Arden Hills says she was told to remove her campaign button when she voted, even though she thought a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision allowed it.\n\n___\n\n5 p.m.\n\nA councilwoman in the St. Paul suburb of Arden Hills says she was told to remove her campaign button when she voted.\n\nFran Holmes is running for re-election to her nonpartisan post.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court said Minnesota\u2019s broad restrictions on wearing political hats, T-shirts and pins to the polls were unconstitutional, but that states could still limit such items.\n\nThe Legislature hasn\u2019t met since Minnesota\u2019s law was struck down, so a new law on political clothing hasn\u2019t been enacted.\n\nSecretary of State Steve Simon issued guidance that barred campaign paraphernalia of candidates, slogans or issues that are on the ballot. But Secretary of State spokesman Ben Petok says if someone refuses to remove banned paraphernalia, he or she must still be allowed to vote.\n\nIn Holmes\u2019 case, she took off her pin and voted. But she said she\u2019s troubled that Simon put out instructions without a law created by the Legislature.\n\n___\n\n4 p.m.\n\nSome Minnesota voters say their opposition to Republican President Donald Trump brought them out to vote in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Sarah Roth of Minnetonka says Trump is \u201cmaking a lot of these wrong decisions,\u201d and she wants to see the U.S. House flip to Democratic control.\n\nRoth, a liberal Democrat, says she thinks Congress needs to do more to oppose Trump. She says she voted a straight-line blue ticket on Tuesday.\n\nAnother Minnetonka voter, Phillip Baum, describes himself as a moderate conservative who leans Republican. Baum is a general contractor and says the economy is the most important issue to him. He owns his own business and says he never wants to go through another Great Recession.\n\nBaum says he would like to see more compromise in Congress. He feels both sides are \u201ctoo stubborn, bullheaded and there\u2019s no compromise.\u201d\n\n___\n\n3:40 p.m.\n\nVoter turnout is strong in Minnesota\u2019s largest city for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMinneapolis estimates nearly 70,000 voters have cast their ballots as of noon. The total is based on unofficial tabulator counts from 95 percent of all precincts. That means about 28 percent of all registered Minneapolis voters showed up to vote Tuesday morning.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, more than 51,000 Minneapolis voters cast early ballots. That number is expected to climb as additional absentee ballots arrive by mail.\n\nRamsey County elections manager Joe Mansky says turnout also is good in his metro county. Mansky says he visited some polling places Tuesday morning, and the judges all reported high turnout, with a line of voters waiting for one polling place to open.\n\nMansky says absentee voting in Ramsey County through Tuesday morning was over 60,000. That compares with 64,000 during the presidential election two years ago.\n\n___\n\n12:20 p.m.\n\nMinnesota elections officials are anticipating a high voter turnout for Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMinnesota Secretary of State spokesman Ben Petok says as of Tuesday morning, elections officials had received nearly 615,000 absentee and mail-in ballots. That\u2019s close to the more than 650,000 absentee and mail-in ballots received for the presidential election two years ago.\n\nPetok says he has not heard of any major voting glitches. He says one precinct in Anoka County had problems starting up e-poll books, but quickly switched to a paper roster for signing in voters.

It\u2019s too soon to tell what impact the overcast skies, light rain and snow showers will have on voter turnout.\n\nElection officials are expecting presidential-level turnout after the August primary drew the highest primary turnout since 1994.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters have already marked their ballots. Election officials say nearly 540,000 Minnesotans have cast early votes since September when the window opened. That nearly matches the early general election turnout in 2016.", "CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. (AP) \u2014 A 10-year-old girl charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the death of a 6-month-old baby told investigators that she panicked after dropping the infant, and stomped on the child\u2019s head to stop the crying, according to a sheriff in western Wisconsin.\n\nHandcuffed and wearing a leather restraint around her waist, the girl sobbed as she appeared in Chippewa County Circuit Court on Monday. A judge set bond at $50,000. State law requires the case, at least initially, to be held in adult court, according to prosecutors.\n\nFirst responders were called Oct. 30 to a licensed home day care in the Town of Tilden near Chippewa Falls. The baby was found to be unresponsive and bleeding from the head, according to officials. The baby was rushed to HSHS St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Chippewa Falls, then airlifted to Gillette Children\u2019s Specialty Healthcare hospital about 90 miles (145 kilometers) to the west in St. Paul. He died Nov. 1.\n\nChippewa County Sheriff James Kowalczyk said a doctor called his office to inform investigators that it was his belief the baby\u2019s injuries were not an accident. Investigators interviewed four people at the home and the girl , who lives with foster parents at the house, \u201cconfessed to her involvement in the situation,\u201d Kowalczyk said.\n\nAccording to the sheriff, the girl said she dropped the infant, hitting his head on a footstool and causing the baby to cry. The girl told investigators that she panicked and stomped on the child\u2019s head, Kowalczyk said.\n\nThe girl\u2019s biological parents were with her in court. Authorities said she had been removed from their home in September and placed in foster care. The reasons for her removal have not been disclosed.\n\nDefense attorney Kirby Harless asked for a smaller bond, saying there was no reason to believe the girl wouldn\u2019t appear for future court proceedings.\n\n\u201cShe would like to return home, and given her age, that may be appropriate,\u201d Harless said.", "It\u2019s Election Day in America, and voters will deliver their first verdict of President Donald Trump\u2019s tumultuous tenure in a midterm that\u2019s expected to draw historic numbers to the polls.\n\nImmigration, the economy, women\u2019s issues, partisanship \u2014 all weighed heavily on voters\u2019 minds as they cast ballots to decide control of Congress and put Trumpism to the test. Though not on the ballot, the president looms large over decision day, among both supporters and detractors. Across the country, people are talking about this election as one of the most momentous in their lifetimes \u2014 a fight for the very soul of America.\n\nHere\u2019s what some of them had to say.\n\n___\n\nFIRST-TIMERS HIT THE POLLS\n\nThe extreme divisions in politics helped motivate Lance Whatley, 29, to vote for the first time in his life Tuesday. Whatley was among dozens of people standing in line as a cold rain drenched their clothes outside the Vinings Library northwest of Atlanta. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a lot of polarization with the rhetoric you\u2019re hearing on both sides,\u201d he said. Whatley, a software engineer, was still unsure whom he would vote for in the hotly contested race for Georgia governor. His wife favors Democrat Stacey Abrams, but he was leaning toward the Republican, Brian Kemp. \u201cIt might be a game-time decision for me when I get in the voting booth.\u201d\n\nRafael Acosta, a college student in McAllen, Texas, rose early on the first day of early voting in his state. The 22-year-old wanted to be sure he was at the head of the line for his first time voting. In doing so, he said he was making a statement for his many friends who are part of the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrival, or DACA, program that has protected young immigrants from deportation. The son of Mexican immigrants, Acosta has watched as Trump stirs fears over the migrant caravan in Mexico, and it troubles him that troops have been dispatched to his community. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I\u2019m fully for them to come over here,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cBut I think (the Republicans) are exaggerating. They don\u2019t need the Army here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u201cOUT OF CONTROL?\u201d\n\nBonnie Slade, a 45-year-old federal employee who lives in Potomac, Maryland, said politics in the nearby nation\u2019s capital shaped her vote this year. \u201cWashington is out of control,\u201d she said. \u201cThe politics are kind of dirty always, but this time is a bit much ... like do I want to vote? Does it really make a difference? But I felt like it\u2019s my duty.\u201d Slade, who is black, said Trump was part of what motivated her to vote. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t stand for anything that I believe in, period,\u201d Slade said. \u201cI\u2019m a minority. I\u2019m a woman. And he\u2019s just not the best choice for me, personally, or my family.\u201d\n\nIn Plano, Texas, Jeffrey Lawrence, a 59-year-old Uber driver, is so sick of the stalemate and mudslinging he wants to see term limits imposed on lawmakers. He voted for Republicans up and down the ballot because he likes the direction of the economy. But it seems like they can\u2019t get enough done because no one is willing to compromise. \u201cThe old-boys system up there says, \u2018I have the ability to get your bill passed, but you need to do this for me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how politics should be. It (should be) what\u2019s good for the people.\u201d\n\nKeith Lesage, a 50-year-old design engineer in Plainfield, Connecticut, said he\u2019s focused more on state issues but is concerned by the division he sees in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, some of the rhetoric that\u2019s coming out of Washington. I\u2019m not picking on Republicans or Democrats, but we\u2019re all adults. Let\u2019s come together for the American people \u2014 not this is what the red side wants, this is what the blue side wants. It\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s just dividing the country \u2014 and it\u2019s real sad to watch.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTAY THE ECONOMIC COURSE\n\nKen Wenzl, a 66-year-old computer trainer and a regular Fox News viewer, said he is grateful that Trump has cut government regulations. \u201cHe is amazing the way he is going after stuff,\u201d Wenzl said, acknowledging the president\u2019s penchant for upsetting the other side. \u201cBut we don\u2019t all have to be friends.\u201d When he voted in Plano, Texas, Wenzl chose Republican Sen. Ted Cruz because he worries that Democrats will try to block Trump\u2019s agenda if they win control of the House or Senate and \u201cjust sit on stuff for two years.\u201d He\u2019s already rooting for Trump 2020.\n\nRichard and Aleshia Murphy took their 7-month-old daughter when they voted early in suburban Los Angeles. The couple, who moved seven months ago from Reno, Nevada, to Lakewood, California, said the economy was foremost on their minds. \u201cI want to keep things going,\u201d said Richard, a Republican train operations manager. \u201cMy work feels the booming economy. We\u2019re hiring more people, all positions, from the bottom to the top.\u201d Both Murphy and his wife, an independent, voted for Trump in 2016 and like where the country\u2019s headed. \u201cI\u2019d rather have somebody who\u2019s going to come off as a complete jerk \u2014 but you know exactly what they\u2019re thinking because they have no filter \u2014 than a slick-haired politician that literally tells you anything you want to hear just so that you support them,\u201d Aleshia Murphy said.\n\n___\n\nSWITCHING SIDES\n\nAmanda Martin, a high school teacher in Dallas, said she is a Republican who decided to vote Tuesday for Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke for U.S. Senate over the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. Martin, 40, said she liked that O\u2019Rourke was \u201cmore in the middle.\u201d \u2033I think we were missing that during the election\u201d for president between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, she added. Her displeasure with Trump was also a factor in her decision. \u201cI like that Trump is trying to secure the borders, but I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s tactful in his relations with how he communicates with the media. And he\u2019s not a good face for our country.\u201d\n\nJosh Rent, 43, a small business owner and registered Republican in Portland, Maine, voted mostly for Democrats this time as \u201ca protest vote to Trump.\u201d \u2033I\u2019m generally a fairly reliable Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first time I ever voted pretty much Democrat all the way down the ballot.\u201d Of the president, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that dividing us is getting us anywhere. We need to actually solve this stuff.\u201d\n\nKevin Benson, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Westerville, Ohio, said he\u2019s registered as a Republican, considers himself an independent, and voted all Democrat on Tuesday. Why? \u201cMostly Trump, just as a check. I\u2019m frustrated with the way he\u2019s acting. Plus just Republicans in general. ... I\u2019m just kind of dissatisfied across the board with them.\u201d Benson said health care is his No. 1 issue and that he\u2019d like to see a single-payer system. \u201cWe\u2019re heading in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCONCERNS OVER HEALTH CARE\n\nFred Hoy, a 61-year-old from Reno, Nevada, said he\u2019s been out of work for 13 years but is scraping by to pay his rent and care for several ill family members and friends. Hoy has diabetes and is on Medicaid. He was taking care of his aunt in California but returned to Reno to make sure he could vote in time \u2014 and he\u2019s voting Democratic because he\u2019s worried Republicans will cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and threaten protections for pre-existing conditions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have some kind of medical,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to collapse as a nation.\u201d\n\nIn Juneau, Alaska, 34-year-old Will Muldoon considers himself nonpartisan. Health care is an issue he\u2019d like to see Congress take up, \u201cbut that\u2019s scary. It\u2019s almost, I don\u2019t know that they could come up with better than what we have right now, type of thing. My confidence in them having the competency to do OK on that\u2019s not too high,\u201d said Muldoon, a mainframe technician.\n\nCordell Chaney, 30, works at Superior Essex, a company that manufactures wire and cable products in Fort Wayne, Indiana. A member of the steelworkers\u2019 union, Chaney is a father of four with a fifth on the way. He says affordable health care \u2014including maintaining pre-existing conditions \u2014 is the most important issue for him. He voted straight Democratic Tuesday, which includes supporting U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly. Chaney worries that if the Republicans remain in control of Congress, they\u2019ll get rid of Obamacare. \u201cIt really upsets me. ... Decent health insurance should be a right. Everybody should have that. Right now, it\u2019s endangered.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAT ODDS OVER IMMIGRATION\n\nRachel Geiger\u2019s purple hair matched her black and purple dress and helped her stand out among hundreds of people waiting to get into an arena in Orlando, Florida, where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders spoke ahead of the election on behalf of Florida\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Geiger, 33, a blogger from Ocala, Florida, said \u201cTrump and immigration\u201d were the two motivating issues for her when she early-voted. \u201cIt\u2019s completely inhumane what he\u2019s doing,\u201d she said, referring to policies that have included sending troops to the border, separating immigrant children from their parents and efforts to build a wall. She voted a straight Democratic ticket.\n\nIn Phoenix, substitute teacher and lifelong Republican Kay Matthews said that while the economy is important to her, immigration is just as important. She\u2019s troubled by any influx of immigrants entering the country illegally. \u201cI\u2019ve been taught as a young child that you respect the law. You don\u2019t have to always agree with it, but you do respect it,\u201d the 72-year-old said. Matthews doesn\u2019t want Democrats taking control of either chamber of Congress, because she fears they would try to impeach Trump.\n\nMelvin Rubi Avila, 19, voted in his first national election Tuesday \u2014 and he was mindful of what weight that carried. The son of a Mexican mother and Honduran father, the Raleigh, North Carolina, native said he was voting for an America that won\u2019t see people like them as a threat. \u201cThey are very proud,\u201d Avila said, an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker shining brightly from the breast of his black leather jacket. \u201cThey feel like me voting is them voting as well.\u201d His father has temporary protected status, but Trump\u2019s rhetoric has made him fearful that his parents will be deported. \u201cI sometimes have nightmares about it.\u201d And as a so-called \u201cbirthright citizen,\u201d Avila is disturbed by the president\u2019s recent attacks on the 14th amendment. \u201cThat\u2019s not what America\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nA few miles north in the town of Wake Forest, North Carolina, Diana Zambrano \u2014 also a child of immigrants \u2014 had a different take. Wake Forest is in the 2nd Congressional District, where Republican incumbent Rep. George Holding was facing a serious Democratic challenge from Linda Coleman, an African-American. The GOP has run ads criticizing Coleman\u2019s support of sanctuary cities. Zambrano\u2019s mother is from the Dominican Republic, and her father is from Venezuela. Both came legally, and she was born here. \u201cThis country provides a lot of opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re able to come here legally ... I think that that should be something that is open to you. But for those that sort of circumvent that system, I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that.\u201d Zambrano, 43, wouldn\u2019t reveal how she voted other than to say: \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\n___\n\n#METOO STILL ON MINDS\n\nLea Grover, 34, a mother of three young daughters in Cary, Illinois, sees the midterms as a referendum on Trump and \u201ca referendum on empathy, and whether or not we as a nation have any.\u201d Grover, a former independent and now a registered Democrat, was particularly outraged by the hearings over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct. \u201cThe Kavanaugh hearings were so upsetting, for every woman I know, not just because of Kavanaugh specifically but because it was an opportunity for the entire Republican establishment to say (to women), \u2018We don\u2019t care.\u2019 Not: \u2018We don\u2019t believe you,\u2019 but \u2018we don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d Grover is a victim of sexual violence and works for a nonprofit that helps survivors. \u201cMy congressman has refused to speak out in defense of survivors of sexual violence. He refused to speak out against Brett Kavanaugh. He refused to speak out against the president. He has been utterly silent in the face of MeToo.\u201d\n\nNatalie Pig, a 31-year-old attorney in Arnold, Missouri, favored Republican candidates because she wants to see Congress do more to support Trump. She cited what she called the \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Kavanaugh, calling him \u201ca victim of the current political environment.\u201d \u2033If there are facts that someone has committed a crime, I\u2019m the first person to want to hear all about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, if we\u2019re taking measures to slander someone or defame them in a way that is going to inhibit the American process, then that\u2019s not helping us. So we need people who are going to support President Trump.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA MOMENT FOR YOUNG VOTERS?\n\nAt 22, Porter Nelson considers himself an independent and says he is a regular voter, but a ballot measure in Washington state creating a carbon tax motivated him even more this year. \u201cIt seems kind of like the world\u2019s ending and if we don\u2019t do something pretty quick, you know, I would like to have kids that have a planet. I would like to have a planet. So anything on any ballot anywhere that I see as being for the environment ... I\u2019m all for that.\u201d Nelson thinks Congress, too, needs to take climate change more seriously. \u201cI would love to see our political body finally get it through their heads that the gerrymandering, the politicking, the races, the runoffs don\u2019t matter if in 20 years the whole West Coast is on fire.\u201d\n\nAdam Alhanti was a typical high school student looking forward to graduating. Turning 18 and voting wasn\u2019t really on his mind. But after his classmates and teachers were gunned down at his Parkland, Florida, school in February, everything changed. \u201cI realized there\u2019s so much more going on than what\u2019s in my city. There are so many things that we need to take charge of, and we can really make a difference \u2014 not just in our nation but right down to our local communities with who represents us in office,\u201d said Alhanti, who voted for the first time in this midterm. He\u2019d like to see Congress take up gun reform. \u201cGun violence ... is something we really need to talk about more. Even though it seems like it\u2019s something being spoken about day after day, there\u2019s nothing being done \u2014 not a single thing that will really save the lives of American citizens.\u201d\n\nA steady stream of voters turned out in a light drizzle in the Albany suburb of Guilderland, New York, on Tuesday morning. Lauryn Schrom, a 27-year-old graphic designer, did not vote in the last off-year election but made a point to do it this time because of her dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. She said recent political events had \u201copened my eyes\u201d on issues like civil rights and women\u2019s rights. \u201cIf you are not engaged enough in the political process then you can lose your rights,\u201d she said, holding an \u201cI Voted\u201d sticker. \u201cI have a significant number of friends who are LGBT, and it\u2019s disturbing that they could lose civil rights as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSTRAIGHT TICKET THIS TIME\n\nLinda Codey, a 70-year-old from Georgetown, Indiana, voted a straight ticket for the first time in her life, for Democrats. She made that decision when moderate Republicans she trusted voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, despite his angry performance at a Senate hearing over allegations of sexual abuse. She feels like the nation\u2019s politics have become too tribal to trust politicians to cross the party line, and hopes her vote sends a message. \u201cI have two grandchildren, and they\u2019re going to inherit this mess,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m optimistic. But I can say I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d\n\nKeri Cook, 47, a Democrat from Westerville, Ohio, said she voted for Democrats straight down her ballot, including Danny O\u2019Connor in his U.S. House rematch against Republican Rep. Troy Balderson. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the House flips,\u201d Cook said, adding that Democrats\u2019 stances on health care and gun control factored into her vote and she wants Trump out of office. \u201cI think he\u2019s poison. ... His stance on the LGBTQ community, on women, on African-Americans, on immigrants \u2014 is just, to me, hate.\u201d\n\nJudy Jenkins, a 60-year-old Republican who works in accounting, also cast her ballot in Westerville, Ohio, and also went straight ticket: for all GOP candidates. She said she used to vote for people from both major parties but was so upset by how Kavanaugh was treated that she vowed not to vote for a Democrat again. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to consider it because of the hell they put his family through. No one should have to go through that, whether you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA TEST OF TRUMPISM\n\nRonald J. Hadley Jr. paused outside the branch library where he voted to explain his straight-ticket support for Republicans: It was all about Trump, even though the president\u2019s name was not on the ballot. \u201cI am, and I think the silent majority is, fed up. I\u2019m very Republican and very conservative, and I think we\u2019re getting four more years of that. And if we don\u2019t, we\u2019ve got problems,\u201d said Hadley, 58, of Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey. Hadley, retired from a job as a night foreman of a school custodial staff, said he hadn\u2019t voted in years until he heard Trump in 2016. Hadley embraces Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and voted Republican Tuesday so the president will have the support in Congress to continue his policies. \u201cI agree with Trump. ... You\u2019ve got to take this country back.\u201d\n\nRepublican Tina Kazee, a 50-year-old hospital worker from Canal Winchester, Ohio, said she stuck with her party when voting early. She said Trump has \u201chis flaws,\u201d but she feels he and the Republicans have done a good job for the country. \u201cI think he\u2019s helped our economy. I think there\u2019s more for him than there is against him, as far as my standards and my beliefs. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a perfect man, but I think he loves America \u2014 I think his heart is for America \u2014 and I stand for that. ... It\u2019s just that his tone needs to be turned down a little bit. Speak from the heart, but do it a little bit softer.\u201d\n\nMorris Lee Williams, a 67-year-old member of Zion Travelers Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis and an Army veteran, said he\u2019s worried the country \u201cis going down the tubes.\u201d \u2033We\u2019ve forgotten our decency. We\u2019ve forgotten the truth. We\u2019re supposed to be a group of people, Americans, who are supposed to be that light in the world. Instead of a light, it\u2019s turned into a nightmare.\u201d Williams said Trump is the catalyst \u201cfor a lot of crazy stuff going on, inciting people into hatred, to doing things that go against what this country stands for. It\u2019s just so divisive. It\u2019s almost as if he wants the country to go back to the way it was in the 1920s and before. Everybody\u2019s got their place and a certain group of people rule. ... This is supposed to be a place where if you have the desire, the education, the guts and the fortitude to do better, you can do better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMOURNING THE LOST MIDDLE\n\nFamily law attorney Patrick Markey, 43, voted in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park. He generally votes Democratic but has supported Republican candidates in Illinois, including in this election. Markey dislikes the two-party system because the polarization that dominates Capitol Hill creates a logjam. \u201cIt\u2019s almost two tribal camps. I\u2019d like to see more (elected officials) with middle-ground views who can vote conservatively sometimes and sometimes more liberally. ... I think that most of the country is like that. But in order to get into politics, you have to kiss the ring of the party. ... A lot of the normal moderate people just feel left out.\u201d\n\nVirginia Gollin, 75, describes herself as a moderate Republican but says she changed parties to become a Democrat because moderates are \u201clike a dinosaur.\u201d \u2033I\u2019m not by nature a progressive. But we\u2019re at a point in our country where all of the things I think we should have are being fiercely attacked,\u201d said Gollin, a retired airline worker in Hopatcong, New Jersey. She cited as an example the Affordable Care Act, which she does not want to see gutted.\n\nTory Dibbins, a physical therapist from Portland, Maine, said she\u2019d like to see more independent candidates, but she understands that many voters believe there\u2019s too much at stake to risk vote-splitting. The 53-year-old Democrat cast her ballot Tuesday. If Democrats do win big, she said, they should show they\u2019re willing to compromise. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk about \u2018let\u2019s end the divisiveness and be inclusive,\u2019 then you have to try to get people to be more bipartisan. ... You have to win people back to the center.\u201d\n\n___\n\nContributing to this story were AP reporters Adam Geller, Jeff Martin, Martha Irvine, Brian Witte, Susan Haigh, Amanda Lee Myers, Michelle Price, Jamie Stengle, David Koenig, Becky Bohrer, Sharon Cohen, Claire Galofaro, Summer Ballentine, Mike Schneider, Terry Tang, Allen G.

(Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune via AP)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Election Day in North Dakota (all times local):\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nNewly re-elected Secretary of State Al Jaeger says his eighth term will be his last.\n\nJaeger, a Republican, beat Josh Boschee, a Democratic state representative from Fargo, on Tuesday.\n\nJaeger\u2019s victory came despite being snubbed by his own party and attacked by opponents as behind the times. Jaeger says those attacks were unfair.\n\nThe 74-year-old Jaeger was first elected in 1992. He had to gather signatures to run as an independent after the GOP rejected him at its state convention in favor of Mandan businessman Will Gardner.\n\nBoth Gardner and Boschee portrayed Jaeger as behind the times in running the office charged with overseeing elections. Gardner quit the race after an older disorderly conduct conviction came to light.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Heidi Heitkamp says serving in the U.S. Senate was the \u201chighest honor\u201d of her life.\n\nHeitkamp issued a statement Tuesday after losing her seat to three-term U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\nHeitkamp, who served just one term, says she brought common sense to the Senate and thought every day how she could \u201cfight for rural America.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp narrowly won her first term in the sharply conservative state. She sought a second term by portraying herself as a maverick who wasn\u2019t afraid to buck her own party \u2014 or President Donald Trump.\n\nHeitkamp raised more than $27 million for her re-election campaign. That was almost five times as much as Cramer.\n\n___\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Al Jaeger has won another term despite being snubbed by his own party and attacked by opponents as out of date.\n\nJaeger beat Josh Boschee, a Democratic state representative from Fargo, on Tuesday.\n\nJaeger was first elected in 1992. He had to gather signatures to run as an independent after the GOP rejected him at its state convention in favor of Mandan businessman Will Gardner.\n\nBoth Gardner and Boschee portrayed Jaeger as behind the times in running the office charged with overseeing elections. Gardner quit the race after an older disorderly conduct conviction came to light.\n\n___\n\n10:45 p.m.\n\nNorth Dakota Supreme Court Justice Lisa Fair McEvers has won re-election.\n\nMcEvers won the 10-year term over longtime Bismarck trial lawyer Bob Bolinske Sr.\n\nBolinske also ran unsuccessfully in 2016.\n\nMcEvers was appointed in 2014 by then-Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill two of the four remaining years of retiring Justice Mary Maring\u2019s unexpired term. She won election in 2016 to fill out the final two years of Maring\u2019s term.\n\n___\n\n10:40 p.m.\n\nRepublican Kevin Cramer says his victory over North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp was the \u201chonor\u201d of his life.\n\nCramer ousted Heitkamp on Tuesday, persuading North Dakota voters that his emphatic conservatism would serve them better than her occasional independence from her own party.\n\nCramer, in his victory speech and Bismarck State College, says President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called to congratulate him.\n\nHeitkamp raised more than $27 million for her re-election. That was almost five times as much as Cramer.\n\nCramer says \u201cwhen you put up a bunch of money to push a bad message, it only makes it worse, not better.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nNorth Dakota Democrats might have something to celebrate in the form of an amendment to the North Dakota Constitution meant to overhaul government ethics.\n\nThe so-called \u201canti-corruption\u201d measure was leading by a narrow margin as the final votes were being tallied. Although the initiative is sponsored by a bi-partisan group, it\u2019s something Democrats have fought unsuccessfully for years to do.\n\nBackers say the measure will add transparency and accountability to government. They raised more than $400,000 to push it, with much of the money coming from left-leaning out-of-state groups.\n\nOpponents argued the state has no ethics problem. In the Republican-led Legislature, leaders said the measure isn\u2019t needed because lawmakers already follow high standards of conduct. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the measure, saying it restricts political speech and advocacy.\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nNorth Dakota residents have voted to explicitly bar non-U.S. citizens from voting in federal, state and local elections.\n\nThe outcome in Tuesday\u2019s election changes the North Dakota Constitution. Supporters said they believed it was necessary to clarify ambiguous wording, even though it\u2019s already illegal for noncitizens to vote in the state.\n\nOpponents called the measure pointless and said it played politics with the constitution.\n\nConservatives heavily promoted it, with a key supporter saying he hoped it could help the GOP in the state\u2019s close Senate race.\n\nSecretary of State Al Jaeger has said there have been some reports of non-U.S. citizens voting in North Dakota but nothing was ever proven.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nNorth Dakota voters have rejected a ballot measure that would have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\nThe measure defeated Tuesday would have made it legal for people 21 and older to grow, possess and distribute marijuana.\n\nIt also would have wiped away the records of anyone convicted of a marijuana-related crime that would have been legal under the new measure. That would have included tens of thousands of criminal records, and the attorney general\u2019s office says it would have been expensive.\n\nOpponents argued that legalizing marijuana would lead to a rise in violent crimes, impaired-driving fatalities and workplace problems. Supporters argued that legalizing pot would free up law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes.\n\nNine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana. North Dakota voters in 2016 legalized medical marijuana.\n\n___\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican Kevin Cramer has ousted North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nHeitkamp narrowly won her first term in the sharply conservative state. She sought a second by portraying herself as a maverick who wasn\u2019t afraid to buck her own party \u2014 or President Donald Trump.\n\nShe warned that Trump\u2019s trade war would damage North Dakota farmers and that Cramer\u2019s health care policy would hurt North Dakotans.\n\nBut Cramer, a three-term congressman, argued that Heitkamp wasn\u2019t the conservative the state needs. He stood strongly with Trump, who remains popular in North Dakota.\n\nA race that was already difficult for Heitkamp appeared to become even harder after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\n___\n\n9:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Wayne Stenehjem has won his sixth term as attorney general.\n\nThe former private attorney and state legislator defeated Grand Forks trial lawyer and Democrat David Thompson.\n\nStenehjem was first elected attorney general in 2000 and has been re-elected easily since.\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nRepublican Kevin Cramer is leading North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in early returns.\n\nHeitkamp narrowly won her first term in the sharply conservative state. She sought a second by portraying herself as a maverick who wasn\u2019t afraid to buck her own party \u2014 or President Donald Trump.\n\nShe warned that Trump\u2019s trade war would damage North Dakota farmers and that Cramer\u2019s health care policy would hurt North Dakotans.\n\nBut Cramer, a three-term congressman, argued that Heitkamp wasn\u2019t the conservative the state needs. He stood strongly with Trump, who remains popular in North Dakota.\n\nA race that was already difficult for Heitkamp appeared to become even harder after she voted against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Co\n\n___\n\n8:55 p.m.\n\nA measure to legalize marijuana in North Dakota was trailing in early returns.\n\nThe state approved medicinal marijuana in 2016, but the rollout has been slow and some voters said Tuesday that the state is not ready for recreational pot.\n\nLaw enforcement has lined up solidly against the broad legalization, arguing it would lead to more violent crime, driving accidents and workplace issues. The state also estimated it would be expensive.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Kelly Marthaller, a heavy equipment operator in Bismarck, said he voted against legalization after getting advice from his brother, who is a doctor and lives in Colorado, where recreational marijuana is legal. He said recreational pot \u201cneeds more time.\u201d\n\nBackers argued the legalization would free up law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes.\n\n___\n\n8:46 p.m.\n\nRepublican Kelly Armstrong has defeated Democrat Mac Schneider to keep North Dakota\u2019s U.S. House seat in GOP hands.\n\nArmstrong, a state senator from Dickinson and former state party chairman, will take the seat Kevin Cramer left to run for Senate.\n\nThe 41-year-old Armstrong has strong connections to the oil industry, including billionaire Harold Hamm, a key developer.\n\nIt was a low-key campaign between the two men, who largely agreed on fewer federal regulations and giving more control to local governments.\n\nThe 39-year-old Schneider is a former state senator who lost his bid for re-election in 2016.\n\nRepublicans have held the seat since 2010, when Rick Berg defeated Earl Pomeroy.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe polls have closed across North Dakota.\n\nThe last polls in the state closed at 8 p.m. in Cass County, which includes the state\u2019s largest city of Fargo. Polls closed at 7 p.m. local time in the capital city of Bismarck, in Burleigh County.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s Secretary of State\u2019s Office said voting went relatively smoothly during the day, though a professor helping monitor voting in Indian Country says some people had problems producing the required documents to vote.\n\nVoters need a provable street address, and many people on reservations don\u2019t know theirs and don\u2019t have IDs that list it.\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s Office said 150,894 people cast ballots in early voting. That was an increase from 2012 and 2016, both presidential election years.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s Secretary of State\u2019s Office says voting is going relatively smoothly, though a professor helping monitor voting in Indian Country says some people are having problems producing the required documents to vote.\n\nState Elections Director John Arnold says he hasn\u2019t heard of any widespread problems at reservation polling sites. But Professor Carla Fredericks with the University of Colorado\u2019s American Indian Law Clinic says dozens and perhaps hundreds of American Indians are having issues with the state\u2019s recently tightened voter identification laws.\n\nVoters need a provable street address, and many people on reservations don\u2019t know theirs and don\u2019t have IDs that list it.\n\nTribes and nonprofits worked before the election to provide free qualifying ID to thousands of members. But Fredericks says it\u2019s still a problem for some.\n\n___\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nNorth Dakotans who are turning out to vote have a lot on their minds, especially the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and Republican challenger Kevin Cramer.\n\nForty-three-year-old Bismarck banker Heidi Wahl-McDonald says she favors Heitkamp because of what she\u2019s done to help farmers and businesses, and because Heitkamp doesn\u2019t always vote along party lines.\n\nEighteen-year-old Bismarck retail store worker Connor Gref says he researched the candidates\u2019 claims about one another, and found Cramer to be more truthful and credible.\n\nThe outcome of the race could be key to control of the Senate. But it\u2019s not the only thing drawing voters. Other big issues being decided are whether to make recreational marijuana legal, whether to explicitly bar non-citizens from voting, and whether to create an ethics commission and restrict lobbying.\n\n___\n\n10:15 a.m.\n\nA lot of North Dakotans still vote on Election Day, but an increasing number are voting early.\n\nThe Secretary of State\u2019s Office says 150,894 people cast ballots in early voting at poll sites or through absentee and vote-by-mail ballots.\n\nThe total surpassed those from 2012 and 2016 \u2014 both presidential election years in which voter turnout is traditionally higher than in midterm elections like the one this year. In 2016, the number was 134,805. In 2012, it was 136,685.\n\n___\n\n7 a.m.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool, blustery Election Day in North Dakota.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast says highs will be in the 20s and 30s, but the wind will make it feel much colder. There\u2019s a wind advisory in effect for western and central North Dakota through the evening, with gusts up to 45 mph.\n\nSnow also is likely in some areas, with patchy blowing snow north of Lake Sakakawea and east of the Missouri River.\n\nPolls are beginning to open across the state. They\u2019ll stay open until 7 p.m. local time.\n\n___\n\n00:35 a.m.\n\nNine months after Kevin Cramer changed his mind about running for Senate, he\u2019ll find out if voters agree it was the right one.\n\nAfter entering the race in February after a personal plea from President Donald Trump, Cramer tied himself closer than ever to Trump in hopes of knocking off Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Heitkamp struck back by portraying Cramer as a yes-man and playing up her independence from her own party.\n\nVoters Tuesday were also weighing whether to legalize marijuana. Supporters relied mostly on a shoe-leather campaign after they didn\u2019t attract much help from big national groups.\n\nThe state\u2019s House seat was also up for grabs, with Republican Kelly Armstrong seen as a favorite to take Cramer\u2019s place.", "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Nov. 3\n\nEditorial: Trump stumps in Missouri, oblivious to the pain his trade war caused\n\nPresident Donald Trump ended his pre-election campaign blitz in Cape Girardeau Monday, highlighting the urgency of Missouri\u2019s U.S. Senate race in the Republican Party\u2019s quest to hold Congress in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. Trump\u2019s visit will also highlight, if unintentionally, the damage his unnecessary trade wars have wrought on rural America.\n\nCape Girardeau is surrounded by farm country that has been hit hard by China\u2019s agricultural tariffs in retaliation for Trump\u2019s tariffs. Cape Girardeau also is in the same southeast Missouri region as Poplar Bluff, where the nation\u2019s largest nail manufacturer, Mid Continent Nail Corp., sits on the brink of ruin thanks to Trump\u2019s steel tariffs.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the GOP candidates who join Trump in Cape Girardeau to make one peep about any of this. That would be out of character for today\u2019s blindly Trump-enabling Republican Party. But voters who watch Trump\u2019s appearance Monday should remember what\u2019s not being said.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs on $250 billion of China\u2019s imports were ostensibly a reaction to Chinese trade abuses that were real. But this president\u2019s response was akin to responding to a flat tire by slashing all four of them. America\u2019s agricultural community \u2014 which heavily backed Trump in 2016 \u2014 begged him not to do it. He did it anyway.\n\nChina, to no one\u2019s surprise, responded with a 25 percent tariff on U.S. agricultural goods. These include soybeans, of which the U.S. is the world\u2019s biggest producer and China the biggest market \u2014 a market in which Missouri and Illinois farmers can no longer compete.\n\nMid Continent, meanwhile, has been hit not by retaliatory foreign tariffs, but Trump\u2019s protective ones. The nail factory is owed by a Mexican company that provides the factory\u2019s steel. Its raw material now costs 25 percent more even though it\u2019s coming from within a company that, until recently, had about 500 Missouri employees. With its product priced out of the market, Mid Continent has laid off or lost about 200 of those workers. The company warns it can\u2019t survive much longer.\n\nIt all illustrates Trump\u2019s failure to grasp the interconnected nature of global trade with his zero-sum, us-versus-them approach \u2014 an approach that runs counter to conservative values. Republicans, remember, were the party of free trade before Trump\u2019s hostile takeover.\n\nNow the administration\u2019s solution to the damage done by its own trade policies is a $12 billion bailout for farmers and the possibility of granting tariff exemptions to companies like Mid Continent. What does it say about your trade war when the first thing you have to do is start making exceptions and passing out money to the economically wounded?\n\nMore to the point: What does it say about candidates whose party once prided itself on economic sobriety, and now they\u2019re positioning for photo ops with a president whose reckless trade policies are hurting their own constituents?\n\n_____\n\nThe Joplin Globe, Nov. 1\n\nBring early voting to Missouri\n\nThe early voting period for next week\u2019s midterm election is arriving for many residents in this region \u2014 but not for those of us in Southwest Missouri.\n\nIf you\u2019re an Oklahoma resident, you\u2019ll be able to cast a ballot beginning today. If you live in Arkansas, you\u2019ve already had early voting options available to you for more than a week.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Kansas, you\u2019ve been able to vote for about two weeks now. And if you are lucky enough to live in Crawford County, you might have seen Clerk Don Pyle and his staff out and about this week, setting up satellite locations at the Homer Cole Community Center, Pittsburg State University and Meadowbrook Mall for you to cast your vote.\n\nCrawford County is to be applauded for that initiative, which seeks to increase voter participation. Pyle says early voting eases accessibility for residents who might otherwise have a difficult time getting out to the polls on Tuesday, including those who work multiple jobs, those who lack transportation or those who can\u2019t afford the time away from work to stand in line at the ballot box.\n\nUnfortunately, voting early is a different case in Missouri, where residents must have a specific, designated reason \u2014 absence from one\u2019s precinct on Election Day or incapacitation because of physical illness or disability, for example \u2014 to fill out an absentee ballot before the day of the election. If any of us have already decided how we want to vote and want to do so today for the sake of convenience, well, we\u2019re out of luck. Or we must \u201cmake up\u201d an excuse.\n\nExpanding early voting in Missouri wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to be extensive to be meaningful. Here\u2019s one suggestion, adapted from Jasper County Clerk Marilyn Baugh: Open the absentee voting period to anyone who wishes to vote early and maybe add voting options at the county clerk\u2019s office the weekend before the election. It could be as simple as that, without a lot of extra expenditures.\n\nResearch from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan nonprofit operated by the New York University School of Law, suggests that early voting contributes to reduced stress on the voting system and shorter lines on Election Day, improved performance by poll workers, early identification and correction of system glitches and errors, greater access to voting and increased voter satisfaction.\n\nDemocracies depend on citizens being able to cast their votes in systems that are fair and accessible. Operating a more flexible early voting system in Missouri would support both, and we encourage lawmakers to revamp the state\u2019s procedures to allow it.\n\n_____\n\nThe St. Joseph News-Press, Nov. 1\n\nHalloween and sex offenders: A question of resources\n\nOn Halloween, true terror lies in the unseen.\n\nA haunted house creates a creepy aura of suspense, until a dark corner reveals nothing more than a teenager in face paint. The best horror movies don\u2019t show an actual monster; they provoke the unformed anxieties within our own minds.\n\nPoliticians, law enforcement and the media have joined forces to tap into something similar within all of us.\n\nOnce again, Buchanan County deputies spent Halloween night enforcing legal restrictions on the activities of sex offenders. These \u201cno candy laws\u201d include the posting of signs notifying children that no treats are available at a residence where a sex offender lives.\n\nThis is in no way a local phenomenon. Similar enforcement operations are conducted all across the country on Halloween.\n\nWe support efforts to protect children from sex offenders, but let\u2019s be clear: There\u2019s an air of theater to all this.\n\nA 2009 study found that children are no more likely to become the victim of a sexual predator on Halloween than on any other day of the year. Government data shows that the vast majority of sex crimes against children are not committed by strangers, but by family members, acquaintances and trusted authority figures.\n\nLocal prosecutors and child protection officials confirm this.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that legislatures passed these Halloween laws and officers and deputies give up an evening with their families for the best of reasons.\n\nThis is really is an issue of finite resources in a world of infinite problems. Major law enforcement operations tend to involve overtime and the diversion of resources from one area to another.\n\nWe think it\u2019s possible to tip our hats at the effort but also to ask if this is the best use of resources. Would the time and money find a better use in a push to serve outstanding warrants? Or how about simply increasing DWI and traffic enforcement on an evening when streets are filled with children and adults are attending drinking parties?\n\nThese are questions to consider before next year\u2019s Halloween.\n\nAt the very least, we shouldn\u2019t be lulled into a false sense of security just because the calendar has advanced to November. Halloween has passed, but sexual predators remain a real danger \u2014 not an imaginary one \u2014 365 days a year.", "The Lawrence Journal-World, Nov. 2\n\nEditorial: KU can\u2019t quit Adidas\n\nThe University of Kansas has made crystal clear that money comes first when it comes to its athletics programs. How else to explain the university\u2019s desire to continue taking millions from Adidas while refusing to make public basic information regarding its deal with the shoe company?\n\nLast month, three men were convicted of fraud for working on behalf of Adidas to funnel money to the families of some of the nation\u2019s top basketball recruits to get the recruits to sign with Kansas and other schools with which Adidas has relationships.\n\nThe convictions mean the jury found that Adidas was to blame for the illegal payments without involvement from KU, though the judge didn\u2019t allow into evidence text messages and call transcripts indicating KU coaches might have known more than the jury was made aware of. According to the trial, Adidas orchestrated this malfeasance on its own and victims like KU were defrauded, embarrassed, shamed, bamboozled and hoodwinked by the apparel company\u2019s chicanery.\n\nBecause of Adidas, Billy Preston, whose family allegedly took money from Adidas to sign with KU, never played college basketball. Because of Adidas, Silvio De Sousa, whose guardian allegedly took money from Adidas to get De Sousa to sign with KU, is now being withheld from games until questions about his eligibility can be answered. It is Adidas money man T.J. Gassnola who exchanged texts with KU basketball coach Bill Self about taking care of De Sousa\u2019s family, and Adidas consultant Merl Code who talked with KU assistant coach Kurtis Townsend in a phone call about the money and arrangements it would take to get the nation\u2019s top recruit to KU.\n\nSo, why would KU\u2019s leaders, who have known about the allegations against Adidas for more than a year, continue to be open to a partnership with Adidas? Why would KU still be accepting money from Adidas \u2014 at least $1.5 million in an extra payment, according to a statement by Kansas Athletics chief financial officer at a September board meeting?\n\nThe Journal-World filed a Kansas Open Records Act request seeking more information about the Adidas payments, but Kansas Athletics has refused to answer, twice saying personnel weren\u2019t available to help with the open records request before coming clean Monday and simply denying the request. An attorney for KU cited a provision of the open records act that gives public entities the option to withhold the release of notes, preliminary drafts, research data in the process of analysis, unfunded grant proposals, memoranda, recommendations or \u201cother records in which opinions are expressed or policies or actions are proposed.\u201d\n\nSo, anyone who thought the leadership at KU \u2014 specifically Chancellor Douglas Girod and Athletic Director Jeff Long \u2014 might stand up to the shoe company that put such a negative spotlight on its basketball program should think again. Given how bad the optics of taking the Adidas money are, the only conclusion is that KU must really need it.\n\nThe fraud trial exposed a money-driven cesspool into which many college basketball programs, including KU, willingly dived. Sadly, it appears KU has decided its best bet is to just keep swimming.\n\n_____\n\nThe Manhattan Mercury, Nov. 1\n\nThe city this week launched a party-registration program, which is a nice idea, if a bit idealistic.\n\nOfficials want residents to fill out a form when they\u2019re planning to have a kegger or other shindig. Then, if said party gets too noisy, the police department will have a contact person to call and warn before they resort to sending officers there to break things up.\n\nPractically speaking, it could be a good thing. The intent is to reduce the number of visits by police officers for noise complaints. As taxpayers, we want the government to make the best possible use of resources.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for party hosts? Well, theoretically, it makes them look responsible and proactive, and it opens lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nThat said, we\u2019re not sure how many people will take the step of tipping off the cops to a party, especially if they expect it to get wild.\n\nThe program is a partnership with K-State, the Riley County Police Department (RCPD) and the Manhattan city government. Officials said some other college towns across the country have similar initiatives.\n\nRegistration includes providing the address and date of the event as well as the name and phone number for the primary and secondary contacts (who must be tenants or property owners at the party location).\n\nWe agree with RCPD director Brad Schoen, who said his department is basically taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some internal discussions and have a good degree of curiosity about how popular this is going to be and whether it will work or not,\u201d he said.\n\nWe hope that it will be a great success.\n\n_____", "FILE - This combination of Oct. 23, 2018, file photos shows South Dakota gubernatorial candidates in the November 2018 election from left, Republican U.S. Rep.

The senator and former professional rodeo rider cultivated a moderate image to make the race unusually close in the conservative state.\n\nSutton says his team \u201cfought a heck of a fight,\u201d but they were always underdogs. Sutton says he hopes Noem focuses on government transparency, overhauling campaign finance and tamping down the cost of higher education.\n\nHe says there\u2019s a strong future for South Dakota if the state works together. Noem says her priorities include focusing on education, filling workforce needs and dealing with public safety issues.\n\n___\n\n12:35 a.m.\n\nVoters have rejected a ballot question that would have made South Dakota\u2019s constitution tougher to change.\n\nA ballot measure rejected Tuesday would have increased the majority vote threshold for a constitutional change to 55 percent of votes cast.\n\nCritics said the amendment could hamper direct democracy in the state, which in 1898 became the first in the nation to adopt citizen initiatives. Supporters argued it would be an added safeguard for the state\u2019s fundamental political document.\n\nThe Legislature voted this year to put the amendment before voters. Republicans have pushed changes to the ballot question system since the 2016 election season brought 10 questions and millions of dollars from out-of-state groups.\n\n___\n\n12:25 a.m.\n\nRepublicans have been elected to serve as South Dakota\u2019s auditor, treasurer and lands commissioner.\n\nRich Sattgast won his bid to become South Dakota\u2019s state auditor. Sattgast triumphed Tuesday over Democrat Tom Cool, a former legislative candidate. He succeeds outgoing state auditor Steve Barnett.\n\nSattgast maneuvered a switch from his current position as state treasurer to win the office of state auditor.\n\nJosh Haeder has beaten Democrat Aaron Matson in the race for state treasurer. Haeder is a former staffer for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds.\n\nSchool and Public Lands Commissioner Ryan Brunner has won re-election against Democratic candidate Woody Houser.

Kristi Noem says she feels relieved to have won South Dakota\u2019s competitive governor\u2019s race after working hard to share her vision for the state.\n\nNoem, who beat Democrat Billie Sutton in Tuesday\u2019s election, says she\u2019s grateful to the people of South Dakota for putting their trust in her. Noem will become the first female governor in state history.\n\nShe says it\u2019s \u201cpretty humbling,\u201d but wasn\u2019t a big focus of the campaign. Noem says her experience helped her win, and now her priorities are focusing on education, filling workforce needs and dealing with public safety issues.\n\nSutton, a state senator and former professional rodeo rider, cultivated a moderate image to make the race unusually close in the conservative state.\n\n___\n\n12:12 a.m.\n\nRepublican Steve Barnett has beaten Democrat Alexandra Frederick in the race for South Dakota secretary of state.\n\nBarnett won Tuesday\u2019s election to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Shantel Krebs. Barnett has served two terms as state auditor since first getting elected in 2010.\n\nFrederick is a rancher in Todd County.\n\nThe secretary of state has duties including serving as is South Dakota\u2019s chief elections official.\n\n___\n\n12:10 a.m.\n\nSouth Dakota voters have rejected an effort to raise tobacco taxes to make state technical schools more affordable.\n\nVoters dismissed the measure Tuesday after the tobacco industry spent millions of dollars opposing it. The measure would have increased taxes on different tobacco products. The tax on a 20-cigarette pack would have increased by $1 to $2.53.\n\nCritics argued it hurt small businesses. State officials estimated it would have raised about $25 million.\n\nThe measure\u2019s goal was to create a fund to lower tuition and fees, offer scholarships and provide financial support for the state\u2019s four technical institutes.\n\nA report last year to a legislative panel found South Dakota\u2019s tech institutes charge the highest average resident fees and tuition regionally.\n\nState voters last approved a tobacco tax hike in 2006.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nSouth Dakota voters have approved a ban on out-of-state fundraising for citizens\u2019 initiatives.\n\nThe measure passed Tuesday imposes a major new restriction that experts say is unlikely to survive legal challenge.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mark Mickelson sponsored the initiative. He\u2019s said it\u2019s necessary to preserve the ballot measure process for state residents. The measure passed without major campaigns supporting or opposing it.\n\nBills capping out-of-state contributions failed in the Legislature for the past two years. Critics argued they were unconstitutional.\n\nThe measure prohibits contributions to ballot question committees from nonresidents, out-of-state political committees and entities that haven\u2019t filed with the secretary of state\u2019s office for the preceding four years.\n\n___\n\n12 a.m.\n\nSouth Dakota voters have rejected a government ethics constitutional amendment put on the ballot to replace a similar measure that lawmakers cast aside last year.\n\nThe amendment\u2019s failure Tuesday comes two years after voters approved a similar anti-corruption law in 2016. Lawmakers repealed it just months later, citing constitutional concerns.\n\nSupporters\u2019 sweeping response would have imposed stricter lobbying and campaign finance rules, established a new government watchdog panel and stopped lawmakers from changing voter laws without returning to the ballot.\n\nCritics focused on the amendment\u2019s out-of-state funding. They argued it would undermine the constitution, making the ethics board a new branch of government with unchecked power.\n\nBackers said the measure was meant to put power back in the hands of the people.\n\n___\n\n11:55 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kristi Noem will become South Dakota\u2019s first female governor after triumphing over Democratic state Sen. Billie Sutton.\n\nSutton cultivated a moderate image to make the race unusually close in a conservative state that hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic governor in more than 40 years. But Noem carried major advantages heading into Tuesday, including a massive GOP voter advantage and much more experience running statewide.\n\nNoem didn\u2019t emphasize her gender in the campaign. She promised to protect state residents from tax increases and more government regulations, improve state transparency and fight federal intrusion.\n\nSutton is a former professional rodeo rider. Noem successfully cast him as a liberal and significantly outraised him.\n\nNoem will succeed Gov. Dennis Daugaard, who couldn\u2019t run again due to term limits.\n\n__\n\n11:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican lawyer and Army Reserve officer Jason Ravnsborg will be South Dakota\u2019s next attorney general.\n\nRavnsborg will be the latest in a long line of Republicans to be the state\u2019s chief lawyer and law enforcement officer. Ravnsborg on Tuesday overcame former U.S. Attorney Randy Seiler, who touted his prosecutorial experience.\n\nRavnsborg, a partner at a Yankton law firm, campaigned as the candidate favored by the law enforcement community. He\u2019s proposed expanding programs allowing lower-level prisoners to work and establishing a meth-specific prison and mental health facility in the central or western part of the state.\n\nRavnsborg succeeds outgoing Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley. The high-profile office has served as a frequent springboard for gubernatorial hopefuls and takes on the state\u2019s top legal cases.\n\n__\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican Kristie Fiegen has been elected to another term on the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission.\n\nFiegen beat Democrat Wayne Frederick on Tuesday to win re-election to serve a six-year term on the panel. The commission regulates utilities and has permitting authority over pipelines and wind and solar energy projects.\n\nFiegen was appointed to the commission in 2011 to fill a vacancy and then elected in 2012. Frederick is a former Rosebud Sioux Tribal Council member.\n\n___\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\nVoters have approved a ballot question requiring that South Dakota constitutional amendments encompass only one subject.\n\nSouth Dakota lawmakers voted earlier this year to put the measure on the ballot. There was little campaign activity around the measure ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nHouse Speaker Mark Mickelson sponsored the measure in the Legislature. He\u2019s said supporters want to make sure that voters understand what they\u2019re voting for at the polls. Critics have questioned how the proposal would work.\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nEarly results have Democrat Billie Sutton and Republican Kristi Noem close in the race for South Dakota governor.\n\nThe race remained tight with the vote tally more than a third complete. It was a major feat for Democrats to make this race competitive in heavily conservative South Dakota.\n\nSutton, a state senator and former professional rodeo cowboy, would be the first Democratic governor elected in over 40 years. Noem would be the state\u2019s first female governor.\n\nWith a cowboy\u2019s appeal, Sutton has ridden a compelling life story \u2014 a 2007 rodeo accident left him unable to walk \u2014 and a moderate image to make the campaign competitive.\n\nThe winner will succeed outgoing Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard.\n\n___\n\n8:42 p.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s incoming U.S. representative, Republican Dusty Johnson, says his top priority in Washington will be getting a farm bill done.\n\nJohnson, a former public utilities commissioner, triumphed Tuesday over Democrat Tim Bjorkman to win South Dakota\u2019s lone U.S. House seat. He was the front-runner.\n\nJohnson says he will work hard to get on the House Committee on Agriculture and get a finished farm bill. Johnson says the people of South Dakota have hired him, and he\u2019s \u201cnot going to disappoint them.\u201d\n\nJohnson focused during the race on fiscal discipline, proposing changes such as increasing the age for Medicare and Social Security eligibility for younger people. He will replace Republican Rep. Kristi Noem.\n\nBjorkman, a former judge, had pledged not to take special interest donations and said health care is the nation\u2019s most pressing problem.\n\n___\n\n8:25 p.m.\n\nRepublican Dusty Johnson has beaten Democrat Tim Bjorkman to win South Dakota\u2019s U.S. House seat.\n\nJohnson was the favorite throughout the race. The former public utilities commissioner and past gubernatorial chief of staff ran an energetic and well-funded campaign as a traditional conservative.\n\nJohnson focused on fiscal discipline, proposing changes such as increasing the age for Medicare and Social Security eligibility for younger people. He will replace Republican Rep. Kristi Noem, who ran for governor.\n\nBjorkman, a former judge, had pledged not to take donations from special interests and said health care is the nation\u2019s most pressing problem.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nPolls have closed across South Dakota, where the governor\u2019s race between Republican Kristi Noem and Democrat Billie Sutton was the top contest.\n\nPolling places were open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time. Recent polls found the governor\u2019s race to be close despite South Dakota\u2019s heavy conservative tilt.\n\nOn top of choosing the state\u2019s next chief executive, voters were also picking their next U.S. representative and a host of other statewide officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans were hoping to keep their supermajorities in the state Legislature.\n\nVoters also settled five ballot questions, among them measures that would reshape the state\u2019s citizen initiative system and raise tobacco taxes for the first time in more than a decade.\n\n___\n\n4:15 p.m.\n\nMinnehaha County Auditor Bob Litz says voting is running smoothly in South Dakota\u2019s most populated county.\n\nLitz says the weather is a little cool, but hasn\u2019t stopped voters from going to the polls in the county that includes the city of Sioux Falls. He says lines ebbed and flowed throughout the day.\n\nElection superintendent Judy Martin oversees polls at Avera Prince of Peace Retirement Community. She tells the Argus Leader that voters came out in higher numbers than normal and people were eager to vote.\n\nLitz tells The Associated Press the county\u2019s 13,500 to 14,000 absentee ballots were being tallied Tuesday afternoon, and his office is also working on getting supplies out to precincts that are running low. So far, he says, he has no reports of anything unusual.\n\n___\n\n12:40 p.m.\n\nSouth Dakotans are deciding whether a conservative or a moderate will be in the governor\u2019s office for the next four years.\n\nSioux Falls Republican Sam Tyrell says he voted in favor of four-term GOP congresswoman Kristi Noem because he likes her conservative platform.\n\nDemocrat Billie Sutton has downplayed his party and offered a moderate message. Sioux Falls resident James Livermont says he was attracted to a candidate who could reach across the aisle.\n\nNoem was the immediate favorite after surviving a GOP summer primary. But Sutton rode his compelling backstory \u2014 a former rodeo cowboy who turned to politics after he was paralyzed in a 2007 accident \u2014 to a tight race.\n\nSutton would be the first Democratic governor in 40 years. Noem would be the state\u2019s first female governor.\n\n___\n\n7 a.m.\n\nIt\u2019s a cool and in some areas a blustery Election Day in South Dakota.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast says highs across the state will be in the 20s and 30s. There\u2019s a wind advisory in effect for the northwest through the evening, with gusts up to 45 mph. And there\u2019s a chance for afternoon snow in the northeast.\n\nPolls are beginning to open across the state. They\u2019ll stay open until 7 p.m. local time.\n\n___\n\n12:05 a.m.\n\nVoters in South Dakota are choosing between making Republican Kristi Noem the state\u2019s first female governor or making Billie Sutton the first Democrat in the office in 40 years.\n\nNoem was the immediate favorite after surviving a Republican summer primary. But Sutton has made it a surprisingly tight race. He\u2019s downplayed his party and ridden a compelling backstory as a former rodeo cowboy who turned to politics after being paralyzed in a 2007 accident.\n\nAlso on the ballot Tuesday are measures that could dramatically reshape the state\u2019s citizen initiative powers. One proposal would block the Legislature from changing voter laws \u2014 or the ballot question system \u2014 without a public vote. Other measures would make the constitution harder to change and ban out-of-state fundraising for ballot questions.", "Lt.

Louisiana is one of only two states allowing convictions by jury votes of 10-2 or 11-1. The amendment that would change that is on the Nov. 6 ballot. (AP Photo/Kevin McGill)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A constitutional amendment to end non-unanimous jury verdicts in Louisiana was approved Tuesday by the state\u2019s voters \u2014 a victory for a rare alliance of conservative and progressive organizations that got behind the measure to end a practice with roots in post-Civil War racism.\n\nThe amendment takes effect Jan. 1 and will leave Oregon as the only other state allowing split verdicts. It reverses a Jim Crow-era practice that made it easier to imprison non-whites by allowing as few as 10 members of a 12-member jury to convict defendants in felony cases not involving death sentences.\n\nThe amendment was pushed through the Louisiana Legislature by Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat. It received more than the necessary two-thirds approval in the House and Senate and drew strong support from factions rarely on the same page: On the right, supporters included the Christian conservative Louisiana Family Forum and the Koch Brother\u2019s political organization Americans for Prosperity; On the left, supporters included the American Civil Liberties Union and Innocence Project New Orleans.\n\nSupporters of the change noted the wide-ranging support the measure received as they celebrated their victory Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have shown the nation that the people they are used to seeing fight against each other will come together for the common cause of freedom. That we will fight side by side for the liberty of our neighbors,\u201d said Norris Henderson, state director of the Unanimous Jury Coalition.\n\nSome district attorneys and their supporters in the Legislature opposed the measure, not wanting to make prosecutors\u2019 jobs more challenging.\n\nNot convinced by arguments that current law could result in the conviction of innocent people, Ed Burkett, the district attorney in rural Sabine Parish, said the amendment would enable a single juror to prevent conviction in a case where evidence proves guilt. \u201cJustice is also not served when guilty people are not convicted,\u201d Burkett said in an interview.\n\nBut Anne Ferris, a 43-year-old New Orleans resident who voted for the amendment Tuesday, said that wasn\u2019t a good enough reason to allow non-unanimous verdicts to continue. She said she hadn\u2019t realized until recently that felony juries didn\u2019t have to be unanimous.\n\n\u201cThere should be a unanimous verdict whenever there\u2019s a jury trial. If there\u2019s not a unanimous verdict then it\u2019s a hung jury,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it makes it harder, sorry. The prosecution needs to do a little bit better I guess.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana District Attorneys Association stayed neutral, and district attorneys supporting the measure included Hillar Moore III in Baton Rouge, James Stewart in Caddo Parish, Keith Stutes in Lafayette and Paul Connick of Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans. New Orleans\u2019 district attorney Leon Cannizzaro is staying neutral.\n\nEd Tarpley, former district attorney in Grant Parish, championed the amendment.\n\n\u201cOnce you know the history of this law, then you have to vote to repeal it,\u201d Tarpley told The Press Club of Baton Rouge in July. \u201cThis is something that is a stain on the legacy of our state.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the split-jury policy\u2019s post-Civil War roots in white supremacy.\n\nBut a racist legacy wasn\u2019t the only reason supporters sought to overturn non-unanimous verdicts. There was also a view shared by those across the political spectrum that government doesn\u2019t always get things right.\n\nIt was an attitude summed up in words flashing across computer screens in a 30-second online add by AFP. \u201cImagine your child is charged with a crime she didn\u2019t commit,\u201d the ad said. \u201cMultiple jurors agree she is innocent but the government sends her to prison anyway.

CVS Health Corp. reports earnings Tuesday, Nov. 6. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)\n\nMore prescriptions and lower taxes pushed CVS Health past third-quarter expectations as the pharmacy giant closed in on a deal it will use to change how millions of people manage their health.\n\nCVS Health said Tuesday that it expects to complete its $69 billion acquisition of the nation\u2019s third-largest health insurer, Aetna, before Thanksgiving.\n\nThe companies announced their proposed combination late last year, with plans to dive deeper into providing care and to capitalize on a growing push from employers and insurers to control medical spending, in part by keeping people healthy.\n\nCVS Health will expand the care it provides through many of its nearly 10,000 stores, converting them into places where customers can do anything from tracking blood sugar to keeping chronic conditions in check. CVS operates more than 1,000 clinics in its stores, which is marketed as a better option to deal with low-grade problems like sinus infections, rather than paying higher fees at the doctor\u2019s office or emergency room.\n\nCVS also wants to use its tie up with Aetna and its more than 22 million customers to monitor prescription use and to help people stay on their medications.\n\nCVS CEO Larry Merlo told analysts Tuesday that both CVS and Aetna, which reported better-than-expected results last week, have created a solid financial foundation \u201con which we will build our revolutionary new model\u201d for care.\n\nIn the third quarter, CVS Health\u2019s prescription volume in stores open at least a year jumped 9 percent. That pushed revenue from its retail-long-term care business up more than 6 percent to about $20.9 billion.\n\nCVS Health also recorded a $268-million drop in income taxes due to federal tax cuts.\n\nOverall, net income climbed 8 percent to $1.39 billion, while adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.73. Revenue rose 2 percent to $47.27 billion.\n\nAnalysts expected, on average, third-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on $47.2 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nCVS Health Corp., based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, is the nation\u2019s second-largest drugstore chain. It also runs prescription drug plans for customers like insurers and employers, processing more than a billion prescriptions annually.\n\nThe company also reaffirmed on Tuesday its forecast for 2018 adjusted earnings of between $6.98 and $7.08 per share. CVS Health has been conservative with its forecast this year as it focuses on the Aetna deal.\n\nAnalysts predict earnings of $7.04 per share on average.\n\nShares of CVS Health advanced 3 percent, or $2.23, to $75.92, as broader indexes edged up slightly after markets opened Tuesday. The stock had already climbed about 2 percent so far this year.\n\n___\n\nFollow Tom Murphy on Twitter: @thpmurphy", "FILE - This combination of file photos shows Missouri U.S. Senate candidates in the November 2018 election from left, Democratic incumbent Sen.

It was among several ballot issues facing Missouri voters.\n\nThe Missouri Constitution currently requires two years of membership in an organization for someone to run that organization\u2019s bingo game. The experience necessary will drop to six months.\n\nThe amendment also removes constitutional language prohibiting advertising of bingo games.\n\n___\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Nicole Galloway will continue to be the only Democrat elected to a statewide office in state government, after defeating Republican Saundra McDowell in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nGalloway was appointed auditor by then-Gov. Jay Nixon in 2015 after the death of Tom Schweich. Before that she served as Boone County treasurer. Galloway said audits during her tenure have identified more than $300 million in waste and abuses, and resulted in nearly three dozen criminal charges.\n\nMcDowell, an attorney who previously worked for two state offices, faced concerns about whether she lived in Missouri long enough to hold statewide office. News reports said she had a Kansas address when a furniture company sued her over a payment in 2013. The Missouri Constitution requires 10 years of residency at the time of election.\n\n______\n\n11:15 p.m.\n\nIncumbent U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill has conceded to Republican Josh Hawley in their tight race for the U.S. Senate but she promised she would continue fighting for the principles she and her supporters believe in.\n\nMcCaskill thanked Missourians for allowing her to serve in a long political career and said she felt good about her service. She urged her supporters to \u201ckeep the fire burning, justice is around the corner.\u201d\n\nShe joked that her mouth has sometimes caused her trouble but said she has actually tried to be careful about what she said.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI will be out here fighting with you.

Ann Wagner has won re-election, fighting off a strong challenge from a political newcomer the national Democratic Party thought had a chance to flip the seat.\n\nRepublican Wagner defeated 30-year-old Cort VanOstran to win her fourth term representing a suburban St. Louis district. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee added the race to its \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list, putting it among Republican-held House seats targeted for takeover, because of Wagner\u2019s strong support for President Donald Trump.\n\nVanOstran is a Harvard-educated lawyer who campaigned on defending the Affordable Care Act. His mother, who died of breast cancer in 2016, was covered by the act. VanOstran said Republican efforts to overturn the act prompted his run for Congress.\n\nWagner\u2019s campaign featured ads highlighting her efforts to battle sex trafficking.\n\n___\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nRepublican Josh Hawley has unseated Missouri\u2019s Democratic U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill in a national victory for the GOP.\n\nVoters on Tuesday elected the 38-year-old attorney general to the U.S. Senate.\n\nRepublicans have long hoped to flip McCaskill\u2019s seat in the increasingly Republican state. Missouri was once considered a bellwether known for picking the successful presidential candidate, but it\u2019s since lost that status and trended right.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won the state by nearly 19 percentage points. Hawley pinned his campaign to his support for the president.\n\nMcCaskill was one of 10 Democratic Senate incumbents up for re-election in states Trump won.\n\nVoters first elected McCaskill to the Senate in 2006. She won re-election in 2012 after Republican candidate Todd Akin said women\u2019s bodies can prevent pregnancy in cases of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nMissouri voters have turned down a proposal that would have raised the state\u2019s gas tax to help pay for road and bridge improvements.\n\nProposition D, voted down on Tuesday, would have increased the state\u2019s 17-cent-per-gallon tax, which is among the lowest in the nation, by 10 cents a gallon. In addition to road and bridge repairs, the money would have helped fund the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Parson campaigned in support of the tax increase, saying the state\u2019s infrastructure needs are long overdue. SaferMO.com, the group advocating for the gas tax, paid for Parson\u2019s tour.\n\nThe Republican-led Legislature referred the measure to the ballot this year.\n\nMissouri voters have a long history of saying no to tax increases. Since voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1996 requiring all tax increases over a certain amount to go to a statewide vote, not a single general tax increase has passed.\n\n___\n\n10:30 p.m.\n\nMinimum wage workers in Missouri will soon get a boost in pay after voters on Tuesday approved a plan to gradually raise the wage to $12 an hour.\n\nThe current minimum wage in Missouri is $7.85 an hour. Proposition B will require the wage to rise to $8.60 an hour in 2019 and gradually increase to $12 an hour by 2023. The organization Raise Up Missouri turned in more than 120,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot.\n\nThe effort got a boost in September when a Washington, D.C.-based dark money nonprofit, The Sixteen Thirty Fund, donated $3 million to Raise Up Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported it was the largest single contribution in the state in the last two years.\n\n___\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nA ballot measure allowing the use of medical marijuana with an emphasis on helping veterans has passed, but two other medical marijuana measures were turned down.\n\nMissouri voters on Tuesday approved Amendment 2, a ballot measure backed by a coalition of patients, doctors and veterans called New Approach Missouri. It was one of three unrelated medical marijuana measures on the ballot.\n\nUnder Amendment 2, post-traumatic stress disorder is among the conditions that qualify for use of medical marijuana, along with cancer and other serious illnesses. A 4 percent sales tax will go to a newly-created fund for health and care services for veterans. The sales tax revenue also will be used to administer licensing of medical marijuana businesses.\n\nVoters turned down Amendment 3, which would have included a 15 percent tax to create a new state institute to research \u201cpresently incurable diseases.\u201d The effort was largely self-funded by Springfield doctor and attorney Brad Bradshaw.\n\nAlso defeated was Proposition C, which would have imposed a 2 percent tax on the sale of medical marijuana.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nRepublican Billy Long will once again represent southwestern Missouri in Congress.\n\nLong was elected to a fifth term in office representing Missouri\u2019s 7th District on Tuesday, defeating Democratic challenger Jamie Schoolcraft.\n\nLong, who is 62 and lives in Springfield, was elected in 2010 and has never been seriously challenged in subsequent elections. The district is among the most conservative in Missouri. Long is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nSchoolcraft is a physician assistant, Army National Guardsman and former mayor of Willard.

The bill also establishes a system for storage and disposal of unused opioid prescriptions.\n\nEllis is a psychotherapist and addiction counselor from Jefferson County. The first-time candidate has said she was \u201csaddened and angry\u201d about the election of Trump.\n\n_____\n\n9:50 p.m.\n\nMissouri voters have approved a state constitutional amendment that will create a new position of nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate boundaries.\n\nAmendment 1, the so-called \u201cClean Missouri\u201d measure, requires the demographer to draw legislative boundaries based on the 2020 Census using criteria intended to achieve partisan fairness. Maps will be submitted for approval to bipartisan commissions, which will have less leeway than in the past to draft their own plans.\n\nThe measure also limits lobbyist gifts to lawmakers, makes legislative records open to the public, lowers campaign contribution limits for legislative candidates and lengthens the time lawmakers must wait after leaving office before becoming lobbyists.\n\n___\n\n9:35 p.m.\n\nIncumbent Republican Vicky Hartzler has won re-election in Missouri\u2019s 4th Congressional District.\n\nHartzler defeated Democrat Renee Hoagenson on Tuesday to with a fifth term in the House.

Cleaver has won all seven.\n\nThe district covers Kansas City and part of the surrounding area.\n\nTheir previous matchups have ranged from close to blow-out wins for the 73-year-old Cleaver. The closest races were in 2010, when Cleaver won by a 53-44 percent margin, and in 2014, when Cleaver won with 52 percent of the vote to Turk\u2019s 45 percent.\n\nTurk\u2019s campaign focused on making the border more secure.\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep.

Claire McCaskill and her Republican challenger, Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, are in a tight race for a seat that could help decide control of the Senate. Republicans entered Tuesday with a slim 51-49 advantage.\n\nDemocratic Auditor Nicole Galloway is being challenged by Republican Saundra McDowell. McCaskill and Galloway are Missouri\u2019s only statewide elected Democrats.\n\nVoters also are considering three separate medical marijuana issues, whether to raise the state minimum wage, whether to increase the state gas tax to pay for road and bridge improvements, and whether to approve a plan that would alter how legislative districts are drawn.\n\n___\n\n7: 10 p.m.\n\nVoters at one polling site in Callaway County cast their ballots in a Catholic Church\u2019s gymnasium that was displaying anti-abortion posters.\n\nAt least two voters complained to the Callaway County Clerk\u2019s office and the Secretary of State\u2019s office about the posters at St. Andrews Church in Holt\u2019s Summit.\n\nMissouri law prohibits electioneering within 25 feet of a polling location.\n\nSecretary of State spokeswoman Maura Browning said the law applies to candidates or issues that are on the ballot. Because there was no abortion-related question on the Callaway County or state ballot, the signs are not considered electioneering and did not have to be removed.\n\nCallaway County Clerk Denise Hubbard said she contacted the Secretary of State\u2019s office after receiving a complaint.\n\n_____\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nA voter in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson calls it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that a ballot delivery mistake forced lengthy waits for some voters, and others gave up and left.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Michael Kelly arrived early Tuesday to vote at Lee Hamilton Elementary School in the town that became famous after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. He was told there were no paper ballots, so Kelly says he waited nearly 45 minutes for an electronic ballot.\n\nKelly says some would-be voters didn\u2019t wait and left.\n\nThe St. Louis County Election Board\u2019s Democratic director, Eric Fey, says paper ballots were taken to the polling place before doors opened.

The Missouri Secretary of State\u2019s office has a formula for what happens if more than one pass, but experts believe that if that happens, it could still end up in court.\n\nMary Wartick, a 71-year-old retiree in Chesterfield, voted for Amendment 2 but against the other two medical marijuana proposals. Several voters in Chesterfield say they\u2019ve personally seen relatives with cancer, glaucoma and other medical problems benefit from marijuana.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nSome voters in west St. Louis County are making it clear that for them, the midterm election is a referendum on the performance of President Donald Trump.\n\nTurnout appeared to be strong throughout the St. Louis area on Tuesday, with people lined up out the door at many polling places.\n\nAt Chesterfield City Hall, 59-year-old Stacy Neuman said she was raised Republican but switched two years ago, after Trump was elected.\n\nFor this election, Neuman says she voted a straight Democratic ticket. She figures incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill will be more of a watchdog of Trump than the Republican candidate, Josh Hawley, who has frequently campaigned with the president.\n\nAnother voter, 57-year-old Stacy Carey of Chesterfield, also voted for McCaskill with Trump in mind. She\u2019s opposed to his harsh stance on immigration.\n\n___\n\n1:45 p.m.\n\nMarian Velder, a 59-year-old woman from Liberty, Missouri, voted for Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley because she is \u201cdone\u201d with Democrats.\n\n\u201cI have had it up to here,\u201d said Velder, while putting her hand above her head. \u201cI am never voting for a Democrat again.\u201d\n\nVelder said she once voted for Democrats but President Donald Trump has her eyes to an \u201cundercurrent of liberalism\u201d across the country. She said Democrats no longer stand for the idealism she believed in past decades.\n\nNicholas Bowers, of Liberty, said he voted for Democrat U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill in part because he was disappointed with how Hawley conducted himself since being elected state attorney general in 2016.\n\nBowers, 28, a worker for Ford Motor Co., said he was upset with the attorney general\u2019s support of a right-to-work law and his \u201cridiculous\u201d investigation into former Gov.

Brian Fitzpatrick\u2019s bid for a second term in the Philadelphia suburbs remained too close to call.\n\n___\n\n11:25 p.m.\n\nIt\u2019s too close to call for two Republican House members from Pennsylvania.\n\nReps. Scott Perry and Brian Fitzpatrick are in tight battles for re-election.\n\nPerry is facing a challenge from Democrat George Scott in a conservative district in central Pennsylvania. Democrat Scott Wallace is challenging Fitzpatrick in a swing district in Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs.\n\nDemocrats have already picked up three seats in Pennsylvania.\n\n___\n\n11:00 p.m.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania is thanking the man he beat, Republican Lou Barletta, for what he said was a \u201cvery gracious\u201d phone call to congratulate him.\n\nCasey won a third term on Tuesday.\n\nHe praised Barletta, a Republican congressman and staunch backer of President Donald Trump, for phoning him at a time of stark political division. He says, \u201cTo have a phone call like that between two people running against each other is something, I guess, we don\u2019t see enough of in American politics.\u201d\n\nCasey grew nostalgic as he recalled that his father, the late Pennsylvania governor, mounted his first statewide campaign 50 years ago. He recalled his father\u2019s \u201clife of service and his life of commitment to our commonwealth.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:50 p.m.\n\nPennsylvania voters are sending a record four women to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nAll four victors are Democrats who won open seats in the Philadelphia suburbs and the Lehigh Valley. Three of them won in districts that had been under Republican control before the state Supreme Court redrew their boundaries in a bid to make them more competitive.\n\nPennsylvania had never sent more than two women to the House at any one time.\n\nMadeleine Dean beat Republican Dan David in the 4th District. Mary Gay Scanlon prevailed over Republican Pearl Kim in the 5th District. Chrissy Houlahan beat Republican Greg McCauley in the 6th District. And Susan Wild beat Republican Marty Nothstein in the 7th District.\n\n___\n\n10:35 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Susan Wild has won an open congressional seat in eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Lehigh Valley that had been under Republican control for two decades.\n\nWild beat Republican Marty Nothstein on Tuesday in the Allentown-based 7th District, giving Democrats another pickup in their quest to retake the U.S. House majority. Wild is a long-time Allentown lawyer and was briefly the city solicitor.\n\nThe area had been represented by centrist Republican Charlie Dent since 2005. He announced last year that he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election before he faced a potentially hostile electorate. He resigned in May.\n\nThe newly redrawn district became friendlier to Democrats after the state Supreme Court ruled the boundaries of Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered by Republicans in 2011.\n\n___\n\n10:25 p.m.\n\nGOP gubernatorial candidate Scott Wagner says in his concession speech that \u201cit\u2019s been a great journey and I have no regrets.\u201d\n\nWagner lost his bid Tuesday to deny incumbent Democrat Tom Wolf a second term as Pennsylvania\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThe brash Republican did not congratulate Wolf on his victory. Instead he implored Wolf to \u201cdo something for the seniors of this state,\u201d saying they are losing their homes because they can\u2019t afford to pay the property taxes.\n\nWagner, a 63-year-old former state senator who made millions from his garbage-hauling business, mostly self-financed his campaign. He says he\u2019s going to take a vacation but \u201cI\u2019m not going away.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10:10 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Mary Gay Scanlon has won an open congressional seat in a southeastern Pennsylvania district that had been under Republican control for eight years but was redrawn by the state Supreme Court.\n\nScanlon beat Republican Pearl Kim on Tuesday in the Delaware County-based 5th District, giving Democrats a pickup in their quest to retake the U.S. House majority.\n\nRepublican Pat Meehan had held the Delaware County-based since 2011. Meehan resigned in April while under an ethics investigation for using taxpayer money to settle a former aide\u2019s sexual harassment complaint.\n\nThe district it largely replaced had such a contorted shape that it was nicknamed \u201cGoofy kicking Donald Duck\u201d and became a national poster child for gerrymandering. The state Supreme Court redrew it after ruling Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered by Republicans in 2011.\n\n___\n\n10:05 p.m.\n\nRepublican Lou Barletta says he\u2019s called Democrat Bob Casey to congratulate him on his re-election to the U.S. Senate.\n\nCasey downed Barletta on Tuesday to win his third term.\n\nBarletta says he hopes Casey will \u201cbe able to work with President Trump for the good of the American people. I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d He adds that Casey will \u201cserve the people of Pennsylvania as he always has.\u201d\n\nBarletta, a congressman, was one of Trump\u2019s earliest backers. Casey has been a staunch critic of the president.\n\nBarletta touted Trump\u2019s record and said he wanted to thank the president for his friendship, adding: \u201cThis is a caring man.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9:55 p.m.\n\nFreshman Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb has ousted three-term Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus in the nation\u2019s only U.S. House race pitting two incumbents against each other.\n\nLamb beat Rothfus on Tuesday in the 17th District, in suburban Pittsburgh. The district was dramatically redrawn by the Supreme Court after it ruled Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional boundaries were unconstitutionally gerrymandered by Republicans in 2011.\n\nThe court eliminated a Republican advantage that Rothfus, a three-term congressman, once enjoyed in a district that had stretched some 100 miles from the Ohio border past Johnstown. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette once likened its shape to \u201ca malnourished hammerhead shark winding through six counties.\u201d\n\nLamb won a special election in March to succeed resigned Republican Rep. Tim Murphy.\n\n___\n\n9:15 p.m.\n\nTom Wolf has taken the stage with his running mate after winning a second term as Pennsylvania governor.\n\nSpeaking at his election night headquarters in York, Wolf said Pennsylvanians voted for better schools, quality and accessible health care and a strong economy. He says it was also a vote for \u201ca public service that actually has integrity, that you can trust.\u201d\n\nWolf downed GOP challenger Scott Wagner on Tuesday.\n\nHe was joined on stage by John Fetterman, the long-time mayor of Braddock. Fetterman won election as lieutenant governor.\n\nWolf says, in his words, \u201cWe are going to do some great things for Pennsylvania.\u201d He says Pennsylvania \u201chas a really bright future.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Tom Wolf has won a second term as Pennsylvania governor, beating brash Republican challenger Scott Wagner.\n\nWolf\u2019s victory in Tuesday\u2019s election sends him back to Harrisburg to share power with a Republican-controlled Legislature that fought him in two extended budget battles.\n\nWolf has said he\u2019ll continue advancing his first-term priorities, among them trying to fix funding inequities in public schools. Joining him as lieutenant governor will be John Fetterman, who drew national attention for his efforts to improve the impoverished town of Braddock over 13 years as mayor.\n\nWagner, a former state senator and waste-hauling millionaire, mostly self-financed his campaign.\n\nHe didn\u2019t help himself with a penchant for eyebrow-raising off-the-cuff comments. He told Wolf to put on a catcher\u2019s mask because, he said, he was \u201cgoing to stomp all over\u201d the incumbent\u2019s face with golf spikes.\n\n___\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Bob Casey has won a third U.S. Senate term from Pennsylvania, beating Republican Rep. Lou Barletta.\n\nBarletta was an early supporter of Donald Trump, who returned the favor by stumping for the former Hazleton mayor. The president narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016, but Casey easily won re-election Tuesday in a place that has now given the son of the late former governor six statewide election victories.\n\nCasey is a staunch critic of Trump\u2019s tax-cutting law, calling it a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations while middle-class wages stagnate. Casey also voted against Trump\u2019s nominees for Supreme Court.\n\nBarletta is one of Trump\u2019s biggest allies on Capitol Hill. He campaigned on Trump\u2019s policies, but he never gained traction and was heavily outspent by Casey.\n\n___\n\n8:45 p.m.\n\nTwo Democratic congressmen from Philadelphia have won re-election.\n\nRep. Brendan Boyle won re-election to a third term. Boyle beat Republican David Torres on Tuesday.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dwight Evans was given a second term. He downed GOP challenger Bryan Leib.\n\n___\n\n8 p.m.\n\nThe polls are closed in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe top of the ballot featured contests for governor and U.S. Senate. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf faced a challenge from GOP nominee Scott Wagner, and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey sought a third term against Lou Barletta, a Republican congressman and early backer of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe state\u2019s 18 congressional seats were also up for grabs in a midterm election that will determine which party controls Congress for the next two years. Voters had a large number of open seats to fill, with district boundaries redrawn under court order this year to make them more competitive.\n\nOne incumbent, Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pittsburgh, ran unopposed.\n\n___\n\n7 p.m.\n\nFormer Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell is urging Philadelphians to ignore rainy weather and vote before the polls close.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer says the Democrat was broadcasting that message from a megaphone mounted on top of a car late Tuesday.\n\nRendell, who is also a former mayor of Philadelphia, is telling city residents they have \u201cone thing to do,\u201d and rain can\u2019t stop them.\n\nHe says they should \u201cget out and vote.\u201d\n\nRendell was stumping for a Democrat running in a newly redrawn congressional district.\n\n___\n\n6:45 p.m.\n\nOfficials in a suburban Philadelphia county say nearly 100 voters were given the wrong ballot in a state legislative race and they\u2019re trying to figure out what to do about it.\n\nA Chester County spokeswoman says the mix-up occurred early Tuesday at a senior center in Phoenixville that\u2019s split between two state House districts.\n\nThe county spokeswoman says the first 108 voters were all given ballots for a race that pits incumbent Republican Rep. Becky Corbin against Democratic challenger Danielle Otten.\n\nThe problem is that 93 of those voters should have been given ballots for the race between incumbent Republican Rep. Warren Kampf and Democrat Melissa Shusterman.\n\nOfficials say it\u2019s likely a county judge will be involved in determining what to do about the ballot confusion.\n\n___\n\n6:20 p.m.\n\nAuthorities say a woman was struck and killed outside an eastern Pennsylvania polling place where she had just voted.\n\nOfficials in Lehigh County say the accident happened about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday outside the Forks Township municipal building.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office says that 83-year-old Marlene Raub was pronounced dead at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital due to blunt-force trauma to the head. Her death was ruled accidental.\n\nWitnesses say Raub had just voted and was walking outside when she was struck by a minivan. Police say the driver stopped at the scene and was released without being charged.\n\nDozens of voters continued to walk in and out of the polling place as police investigated outside.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot, but he\u2019s influencing the vote in Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublican Rosanne Palmieri voted for Trump in 2016, and she cast a party-line ticket on Tuesday as voters made their choices in races for governor, a U.S. senate seat and several contested House races. She gives him mixed reviews so far and wishes he would \u201ckeep his mouth shut,\u201d but also hopes Republicans keep control of Congress.\n\nDemocrat Jeremy Kastrup also voted along party lines, saying Republicans are trying a \u201cDo It Yourself\u201d style of government that\u2019s not working. Kastrup \u2014 who didn\u2019t vote for Trump \u2014 says his administration has been \u201cjust straight up sloppy\u201d in running the country.\n\nBoth Palmieri and Kastrup say the volume and vitriol of politics today makes it hard to follow the issues.\n\n___\n\n7 a.m.\n\nElection Day in Pennsylvania is underway amid expectations for relatively high midterm election turnout.\n\nPolls opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday and will close at 8 p.m.\n\nPennsylvania voters will decide who occupies the governor\u2019s office for four years and help determine control of Congress the next two years under Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThis year, 8.6 million people are registered to vote, a record midterm election high for Pennsylvania.\n\nTopping the ballot are Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Republican challenger Scott Wagner, and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Lou Barletta, a congressman.\n\nMeanwhile, Pennsylvania voters fill a wave of open U.S. House seats and settle contests in districts with boundaries newly redrawn under court order.\n\n____\n\n12:20 a.m.\n\nPennsylvania voters will decide who occupies the governor\u2019s office for four years and help determine control of Congress the next two years under President Donald Trump.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election comes amid expectations for relatively high midterm election turnout.
