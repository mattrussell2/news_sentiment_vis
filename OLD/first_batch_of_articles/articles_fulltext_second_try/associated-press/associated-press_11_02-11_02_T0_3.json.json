Junqueras stayed in Spain and was jailed preventively exactly one year ago.\n\nThe banned vote caused Spain\u2019s gravest political crisis in four decades of democracy, prompting an unprecedented 7-month-long suspension of Catalonia\u2019s self-government.\n\nA new Catalan separatist administration has kept up a defiant pro-independence rhetoric but hasn\u2019t broken the law.\n\nThe regional president, Quim Torra, on Friday said his predecessors didn\u2019t commit crimes and were being prosecuted for their ideas. He also accused the prime minister of being an \u201caccomplice in the repression.\u201d\n\nSanchez\u2019s government, Torra said in a live address from the Catalan parliament, \u201chas lost a golden opportunity to take the conflict in Catalonia out of the courts and return it to the political (arena), which is where it should be.\u201d\n\nThe events in Catalonia last year are expected to be revisited in two trials set to start in January.

(Eileen Meslar/Telegraph Herald via AP, File)\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 White, working-class voters fueled President Donald Trump\u2019s rise to the White House. If his party loses the House majority on Tuesday, it will be, at least in part, because those same voters abandoned the GOP.\n\nWhile Democrats\u2019 suburban offensive is well-known, an often-overlooked battle is underway across rural and working-class districts in states including Maine, Iowa and Minnesota. Trump\u2019s coalition of blue-collar voters here may offer Democrats an alternate route to the House majority.\n\nSpecifically, Democrats are targeting 21 House districts carried by former President Barack Obama in 2012 that shifted to Trump in 2016 \u2014 districts now testing the strength of a Trump-era political realignment shaped by education, race and gender.\n\nWith the election days away , Democrats have cause for optimism. Public and private polling suggest Democrats are poised to capture at least two-thirds of the Obama-Trump districts, according to operatives in both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely before Election Day.\n\nWhile Republicans privately blame an underwhelming slate of GOP incumbents, the Democrats\u2019 prospective success is a reflection of a strong class of first-time candidates, extraordinary fundraising and a message focused on health care and the economy \u2014 not Trump.\n\nIn northeastern Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, where the cornfields outnumber the Whole Foods supermarkets, 29-year-old Democratic upstart Abby Finkenauer reflected on her blue-collar roots at a rally this week alongside the Democratic Party\u2019s strongest liaison to working-class voters, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cHe shares the belief that every kid who grows up in a working-class family like mine has a right to a bright future,\u201d Finkenauer said as she introduced Biden.\n\nObama won the district by nearly 14 points in 2012. Trump scored a 3-point victory here four years later.\n\nThe 29-year-old state representative, whose father and grandfather were union workers, has made her working-class roots central to the campaign in a district once dominated by union manufacturing and meatpacking jobs. She made a name for herself last year blasting a Republican-backed bill that dismantled public-employee unions, shouting against it near tears on the Iowa House floor in Des Moines.\n\n\u201cThis is personal,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nShe is facing off against two-term Republican incumbent Rep. Rod Blum, a wealthy businessman.\n\nIn working-class southern New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Democrat Andy Kim is laser-focused on health care and the Republican tax cuts in his bid to defeat two-term incumbent Rep. Tom MacArthur.\n\nObama twice won the district, which Trump carried by 6 points in 2016.\n\nKim, a national security official in the Obama administration, told The AP that he doesn\u2019t want to impeach Trump. He condemned the increasingly divisive tone in politics, which he said was a problem long before Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe first-time Democratic candidate is eager to bring up MacArthur\u2019s votes for the Trump tax cuts and a GOP health care plan that would have replaced the nation\u2019s system with one that wouldn\u2019t guarantee coverage of pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t politics. It\u2019s personal,\u201d said Kim, the father of two young sons, noting that his father survived polio and his mother has other pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Republican MacArthur said he was simply working to improve both bills for his constituents. He also recognizes his political challenge in a district that has swung from one party to the other in recent presidential elections.\n\n\u201cA member, to represent this district, can\u2019t just be a Trump opposition person,\u201d MacArthur said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019ll offend half of his constituents. You have to work with the president when you can. You have to have the backbone to push back when you need to.\u201d\n\nCollege-educated voters, particularly women, turned against the GOP long ago. But polling indicates that Democrats\u2019 comeback in the Obama-Trump districts, if there is one, will be born of a more subtle shift among non-college-educated white women, according to Jesse Ferguson, who previously led the House Democrats campaign arm.\n\n\u201cIf we take the majority, it won\u2019t only be built on suburban, Clinton-voting districts alone,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats are winning congressional districts that voted for Donald Trump as people who work for a living see that the Republican majority sold them out.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all good news for Democrats.\n\nIn the fight for the Senate majority, Trump\u2019s standing remains strong among rural voters in states like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri where the GOP is on offense.\n\nRepublicans have far fewer pickup opportunities in their quest to preserve the House majority. The GOP is on offense, however, in Minnesota\u2019s 8th Congressional District, a 27,000 square mile-swath of northern Minnesota where Republican Pete Stauber, a retired policeman, is poised to win a seat left open by a Democratic retirement.\n\nNo current district swung more from Obama to Trump. Stauber said the 20-point shift between 2012 and 2016 reflected a political realignment a decade in the making.\n\n\u201cThis congressional district is blue-collar common-sense conservative,\u201d he said in an interview, noting the presence of a strong mining industry, forestry jobs and the military.\n\nStauber said he opposed Republican efforts to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law and vowed to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions. He also railed against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s recent suggestion that Republicans would cut Medicare and Social Security to help balance the budget.\n\n\u201cThose are benefits that our seniors were promised and paid into their entire lives,\u201d the Republican congressional candidate said. \u201cThat\u2019s a promise our government made. That\u2019s a promise our government will keep.\u201d\n\nPolling suggests that Democrats are winning the fight over health care and the economy in other Obama-Trump districts.\n\nThey include Maine\u2019s 2nd, where Democratic-aligned outside groups have poured money into an advertising campaign railing against incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin\u2019s health care positions since October 2017.\n\nTrump won the rural Maine district by 10 points in 2016, while Obama carried it by more than 8 points four years earlier.\n\nDemocratic candidate Jared Golden, an Iraq war veteran, seized on health care in his closing message.\n\n\u201cWhen I came home from Iraq, I was diagnosed with a pre-existing condition,\u201d the 36-year-old Democrat said in a recent ad.

A federal judge in Boston is scheduled to hear closing arguments Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in a highly publicized lawsuit alleging that elite Harvard discriminates against Asian-Americans. Much of the spotlight has been on affluent Chinese-Americans with stellar academic scores who say the college rejects Asians in favor of lesser-qualified applicants. They say factoring in race hurts Asian-Americans. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 A trial alleging racial bias in Harvard University\u2019s admissions system has presented two starkly different images of the elite Ivy League school.\n\nOne side depicts a Harvard that plays racial favorites, lowering the admission bar for certain races and raising it for others, to the detriment of Asian-Americans. The other side paints a Harvard that gives a slight edge to some minorities in the pursuit of diversity, but only those who would likely be admitted anyway.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to a judge to decide which is closer to the truth. Both sides clashed Friday in the closing arguments of a trial that has been four years in the making and sits at the center of a reignited debate over affirmative action. Its outcome carries weighty implications for other colleges that also consider race when selecting students.\n\nThe group behind the suit, Students for Fair Admissions, says Harvard\u2019s gatekeepers hold Asian-American applicants to a higher standard and discriminate against them using a subjective \u201cpersonal rating\u201d that measures traits such as courage and likability.\n\nUsing six years of school admissions data, the group found that Harvard officials consistently gave Asian-Americans the lowest scores in the personal rating, while scoring black and Hispanic students the highest. Asians fared well in other categories including academics, yet they were admitted at the lowest rate.\n\n\u201cWe think this is strong evidence that race is being used in the personal score for all of these ethnicities, and it is evidence of an Asian penalty,\u201d John Hughes, a lawyer for the group, said in his closing argument.\n\nHarvard insists that the group\u2019s statistical analysis, done by a Duke University economist, is flawed, and presented a dueling analysis from a University of California, Berkeley, economist who found no evidence of bias.\n\nThe school\u2019s lawyers emphasized that race is only one of many factors considered in its \u201cholistic\u201d review of applicants, and that race can only help, never hurt, a student\u2019s chances of getting in.\n\n\u201cHarvard has worked over the years tirelessly to create a vibrant educational environment that includes students from all walks of life. We do not admit simply GPAs and board scores, we admit people,\u201d said William Lee, a lawyer for Harvard.\n\nThe trial lasted three weeks and featured testimony from more than a dozen current and former Harvard employees, along with scholars and policy experts. Yet no student ever took the stand claiming discrimination.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit based in Arlington, Virginia, says its 20,000 members include some Asian-Americans who were unfairly rejected from Harvard, but it did not call on any to testify.\n\nHarvard\u2019s lawyers jumped on that omission while noting the \u201cpowerful\u201d testimony from several students who testified in support of the school.\n\n\u201cIf there was an application filed after all of this that showed discrimination, wouldn\u2019t we have seen it?\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe trial has revealed new and sometimes uncomfortable details about the process Harvard uses to pick about 2,000 students a year out of more than 40,000 applicants.\n\nDuring testimony, William Fitzsimmons, the longtime admission dean, explained how each student is given a rating in four areas: academics, extracurriculars, athletics and the personal rating, along with an overall score.\n\nStudents can choose to provide their race, which may offer a \u201ctip\u201d toward admission, as can other factors like family income or geography. Final decisions are made by a panel of 40 Harvard officials.\n\nYet there are other ways into Harvard, too. Students for Fair Admissions revealed email exchanges in which Harvard officials openly discussed the family ties or wealth of certain applicants as they decided whether to admit them. It also cast light on a \u201cdean\u2019s list\u201d used to track students of special interest, including the children of donors.\n\nThe group says such preferences work against racial minorities, while Harvard says it admits the children of donors only if they are otherwise qualified.\n\nThe case is being weighed by U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who may take weeks or months to issue a ruling. Either way, it is likely to be appealed.\n\nThe founder of Students for Fair Admissions, Edward Blum, previously orchestrated a similar lawsuit alleging that the University of Texas discriminated against white applicants. That case was appealed and eventually heard by the Supreme Court, which narrowly ruled in favor of Texas in 2016.\n\n___\n\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley", "British-based firm to open plant in Danville\n\nRICHMOND, Va.

Prosecutors announced a three-count indictment against Low in the first charges arising from the epic corruption scandal at the now-insolvent state investment fund.\n\nA Malaysian-Chinese born on the island of Penang whose grandfather was born in southern China\u2019s Guangdong, Low describes himself on his website Jho-Low.com as a \u201cglobal investor and philanthropist\u201d with experience in many companies, financings and projects in media, entertainment, retailing, hospitality and real estate. The website mentions his support of the Gabrielle\u2019s Angel Foundation, which funds research into cancer treatment and prevention.\n\nEducated at Harrow, an elite British prep school, and later at Wharton, his family is said to have made its fortune in mining, trading and garment manufacturing.\n\nLow has chafed over criticism of his partying and playboy lifestyle and vehemently objected to the recently published book \u201cBillion Dollar Whale,\u201d which says it tells the inside story of Low and 1MDB.\n\nIn a video to promote his family\u2019s company, Jynwel, Low said he early on wanted to be a brain surgeon but gradually grew more interested in business and politics while attending meetings with his father.\n\nHe said he \u201cfinally landed on business because it was a good combination between the ability to influence change and also the ability to help people.\u201d His company, he said, was interested both in sustainable development and social development.\n\nIn its LinkedIn profile, Jynwel Capital describes itself as an international private equity investment and advisory firm with 10-50 employees.

The U.S. Justice Department says he had considerable influence over its dealings.\n\nAt Harrow he became friends with Riza Aziz, stepson of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who set up 1MDB to support the country\u2019s economic development. Najib was ousted in an election upset in May after former leader Mahathir Mohamad, outraged by the scandal, came out of political retirement. The 93-year-old Mahathir is now prime minister and reopened the probe into the 1MDB fund, and Najib is facing criminal charges.\n\nWhile his lawyers fight to have the charges against him dismissed, Low\u2019s whereabouts are unknown.\n\nIn earlier statements, Low said he would not \u201csubmit to any jurisdiction\u201d where he could not get a fair trial, especially Malaysia.\n\nMahathir has urged Low to return to Malaysia to sort out the legal issues. His government has put his luxury yacht, the Equanimity, on auction to help recoup some of the huge debts created by 1MDB.\n\n\u201cThey would like to get Jho Low to put him on trial but he is nowhere to be seen,\u201d Mahathir said Friday, referring to U.S. authorities. \u201cWe would like to get Jho Low; we have several charges against him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore, he was a man of the world, flitting around the world in jet planes and the Equanimity and living a great life, but now he has to hide like a mouse,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Department documents cite multiple instances in which Low allegedly siphoned funds from bond offerings for kickbacks and bribes to Malaysian officials. They say many of the transactions were done through shell companies, which often are used to obscure origins and destinations of illicit activities.\n\nBut the documents emphasize that the charges are allegations and that Low and a former banker arrested this week in connection with the case, Ng Chong Hwa, \u201care presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\u201d\n\nSingapore has fined eight banks for failing to carry out proper anti-money laundering measures in relation to 1MDB and ordered prison sentences for several bankers.

New Caledonia, a French archipelago in the South Pacific, is preparing for an independence referendum upcoming Sunday Nov. 4, 2018, the last step in a three-decades-long decolonization effort. (AP Photo/Theo Rouby, File)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 New Caledonia, a French archipelago in the South Pacific, is preparing for an independence referendum \u2014 the last step in a three-decades-long decolonization effort.\n\nSunday\u2019s vote is key to settling tensions between the native Kanaks, who once suffered from strict segregation policies, and descendants of European colonizers. It is also a test of the depth of the links between France and the territory, which lies east of Australia and has about 270,000 inhabitants.\n\nVoters have to answer the question \u201cDo you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\u201d Observers say that, based on past electoral results and polls, voters are likely to back remaining in France.\n\nThe territory enjoys a large degree of autonomy, but relies on the French state for its defense, police, foreign affairs, justice and education.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago after years of violence that pitched pro-independence Kanak activists against those willing to remain in France.\n\nIn 1988, 19 Kanak tribesmen died after they took French police hostage in a cave on the New Caledonian island of Ouvea. Four soldiers were also killed.\n\nThe violence represented a \u201ctremendous shock\u201d and a \u201ckey moment\u201d for France, French historian Isabelle Merle said. \u201cThis is the first time a carefully thought-through peaceful decolonization process has been considered,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Ouvea events prompted a peace deal that year between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions that laid the ground for the referendum.\n\nVisiting the territory in May, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged the \u201cpain of colonization\u201d and paid tribute to the courage of those involved in the peace process.\n\nHe also handed the Caledonian government a document that stated the archipelago became a French possession in 1853 \u2014 a gesture intended to symbolize the final chapter in the period of colonization.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer in a time of possession, but a time of choice\u201d, he said.\n\nUnder French colonial rule, the Kanaks were forced to live on reserves in remote areas, pay specific taxes and do mandatory work for very low wages. They had to respect curfews and were not allowed into some places reserved for European settlers.\n\nMerle, whose researches focus on France\u2019s decolonization process, said this led to \u201ca big gap between the local communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the whole French colonial emprise, the Kanaks have probably been those who have been despised the most, in the sense that they were seen as savages,\u201d she said.\n\nToday the Kanaks represent about 40 percent of New Caledonia\u2019s population, while people of European descent make up about 27 percent. Others include those who emigrated from Asia and other Pacific islands.\n\nLong used as a prison colony, New Caledonia remains an important part of France\u2019s overseas holdings that stretch from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean and the northeast coast of Canada.\n\nTogether, they enable France to lay claim to the world\u2019s second largest maritime domain \u2014 the area within 200 nautical miles from the coast in which each country is sovereign and can exploit natural resources \u2014 almost equivalent to that of the United States.\n\nNew Caledonia\u2019s turquoise lagoons are a tourism magnet, and its mines contain a quarter of the world\u2019s known nickel supplies, a metal used in electronics manufacturing and many other industries.\n\nBut like other French overseas territories, the territory suffers from much higher unemployment and poverty than in the mainland, and many residents share a feeling of being neglected by Paris.\n\nFrench overseas economies are largely dependent on the French state. France\u2019s global budget for overseas amounts to 17 billion euros ($19,3 billion) this year, including 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) for New Caledonia, according to a Senate report.\n\nOnce the second largest colonial empire in the world after Britain, French power had extended to west and north Africa, southeast Asia and islands in the Caribbean, Indian and Pacific Ocean, reaching its height between the World Wars. In 1939, five percent of the world\u2019s population was living under French rule.\n\nMost of France\u2019s African and Asian colonies broke free in the 1950s and 1960s.

(AP) \u2014 Two down, two to go.\n\nNo. 5 Michigan is on a revenge tour, according to defensive end Chase Winovich . The Wolverines have beaten two of the four Big Ten teams they lost to last season, leaving No. 14 Penn State and No. 8 Ohio State on their list.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re halfway there,\u201d Winovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just beating certain teams. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a grittiness. We\u2019re done playing around.\u201d\n\nMichigan (7-0, 5-0 Big Ten, No. 5 CFP) gets its shot at the Nittany Lions (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten, No. 14 CFP) on Saturday at home and will have to wait until Nov. 24 for its last tour stop against the Buckeyes.\n\nPenn State beat the Wolverines 42-13 last year and tried to score even more points in the final seconds, a fact that has bothered Michigan for more than a year.\n\nDefensive coordinator Don Brown insisted he has thought about that game every day since the humiliating setback. The points and yards (502) given up in that game were the most allowed in Brown\u2019s two-plus years at Michigan. And just in case Brown\u2019s defensive players were not still stung by the rout, he showed them how the end of the game unfolded, with Miles Sanders taking a handoff from the Wolverines 6 in the closing seconds and getting stopped for a loss.\n\n\u201cWanted them to be reminded of that feeling,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI think the point was made.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch at the Big House:\n\nGOOD TO GO\n\nPenn State quarterback Trace McSorley is expected to start after missing part of last week\u2019s 30-24 win over No. 18 Iowa.\n\n\u201cObviously, everybody knows he got dinged up in the game, so I\u2019m not keeping that a secret,\u201d coach James Franklin said. \u201cWell, literally by 7 a.m., he\u2019s done more than most people do all day to give him the best chance to be healthy, to practice at a very, very high level, and then also to make sure that he can go and be present and dominate in the classroom.\u201d\n\nMcSorley has 28 career wins, one short of the school record for a quarterback shared by Todd Blackledge and Tony Sacca.\n\n\u201cThey have one of the best playmakers, besides (Michigan QB) Shea Patterson, in college football with Trace,\u201d Winovich said. \u201cThe dude knows how to win.\u201d\n\nGARY WATCH\n\nMichigan might get defensive end Rashan Gary back in the lineup. He has missed three games with a shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s very, very close,\u201d Brown said.\n\nGary\u2019s teammates have bristled at speculation he will not return to play in college and instead choose to focus on getting prepared for the NFL draft as former Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa decided to do last month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get in the game,\u201d said Kwity Paye, who has started in Gary\u2019s place. \u201cI feel for him on that.\u201d\n\nNOT SO SPECIAL\n\nPenn State has made numerous miscues lately on special teams. The Nittany Lions allowed two safeties on punts last week, giving up four points with a blocked kick and a poor snap. They also failed to recover an onside kick against Indiana and gave up a first down on a fake punt against Michigan State. First-year kicker Jake Pinegar has made all five of his field goal attempts over the last two games, but he has missed two of four field goals on the road.\n\nWANT TO FIGHT?\n\nBrown raved about Patterson\u2019s competitive spirit, recalling how fired up he was after Michigan lost a fumble at Michigan State.\n\n\u201cI kind of like guys like that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll fight you in the alley.\u201d\n\nC-WEBB COMES BACK\n\nChris Webber is coming back to Michigan as an honorary captain, accepting an invitation extended by Harbaugh. More than five years ago, the reunion with the Fab Five star would not have been possible. The NCAA forced the university to dissociate itself from Webber from 2003-13 for his role in one of the biggest scandals in NCAA history. A federal investigation revealed now-deceased booster Ed Martin gave Webber and two other players more than $600,000 when they were student athletes.\n\nMichigan basketball coach John Beilein said there have been discussions about reuniting Webber with the basketball program while he\u2019s in town.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much Chris wants me to say, but we hope we can get together this weekend,\u201d Beilein said.\n\nWebber has not returned messages seeking comment this week from The Associated Press.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter at www.twitter.com/larrylage", "FILE - In this Oct. 5, 2018, file photo, So Yeon Ryu of South Korea watches her shot on the 5th hole during the second round of the LPGA's UL International Crown golf tournament at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea in Incheon, South Korea.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 After years of being a late-season afterthought, Texas coach Tom Herman wanted the Longhorns to be competing for a Big 12 title in November.\n\nTexas is right where he wanted, with a key matchup against West Virginia up next.\n\nThe No. 12 Mountaineers (6-1, 4-1 Big 12, No. 13 CFP) and No. 15 Longhorns (6-1, 4-1, No. 17 CFP) play Saturday in a game both need to win to keep a share of the conference lead with an eye toward the conference title game in December.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time since Texas played meaningful football after Halloween. For three seasons under Charlie Strong and Herman\u2019s first season in 2017, November was about trying to avoid losing seasons. This season, the Longhorns were rolling on a six-game win streak until losing last week at Oklahoma State to drop out of sole possession of first place in the Big 12.\n\n\u201cThat game in Stillwater will only define our season if we let it,\u201d Herman said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to define our season by how we respond to it, as well.\u201d\n\nHerman said almost exactly the same thing after Texas lost its opener to Maryland. The Longhorns responded with their longest win streak in five years.\n\nThe Mountaineers haven\u2019t won a league title since joining the Big 12 in 2012. West Virginia rallied after its only loss by whipping Baylor last week. Quarterback Will Grier, who broke his finger in the first quarter against Texas last year, lit up Baylor with three touchdown passes in a game the Mountaineers led 41-0 by halftime.\n\nThose are scary numbers for a Texas secondary that was shredded by Oklahoma State and gave up 31 points in the first half.\n\n\u201cTheir energy level was high and they were striking like a firing squad,\u201d Texas senior defensive end Charles Omenihu said of the loss.\n\nThe road team has been a good bet in this series. West Virginia has won two of three meetings in Austin since 2012. Texas has said Saturday\u2019s game is sold out. The 2012 Longhorns-Mountaineers game drew a then-school record crowd of 101,851, which is still the third-largest in school history.\n\n\u201cA lot of guys in our locker room have been to Austin, been on that field,\u201d West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be surprised by any of the excitement that they have surrounding their program at this point.\u201d\n\nHolgorsen has never been one to be intimidated. A referee\u2019s open mic in 2016 caught Holgorsen mockingly telling game officials his players were tougher than Texas.\n\n\u201cOur guys are going to be excited about going to Austin,\u201d he said. \u201cI know we\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d\n\nINTERCEPTIONS\n\nGrier has one of the biggest and best arms in college football but he\u2019s been sloppy at times. Despite its troubles last week against Oklahoma State, the Texas secondary has been solid and able to force turnovers. Freshman safeties Caden Sterns and B.J. Foster have five interceptions between them. Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger has 210 consecutive pass attempts without a turnover, a school record.\n\nGETTING TO GRIER\n\nOmenihu has six sacks and 9.5 total tackles for loss in the last four games. His job is to harass Grier or least force the quarterback to think about him on every play.\n\n\u201cHe sits in the pocket. He\u2019s confident. I feel like we\u2019re going to get after him,\u201d Texas senior nose tackle Chris Nelson said of Grier.\n\nFIRST DRIVE\n\nWest Virginia has outscored opponents 83-27 in the first quarter, shutting out opponents four times in the opening period. Texas opponents have scored on their opening drives in six of eight games, reaching the end zone five times.\n\nTEXAS CHEMISTRY\n\nThe Longhorns started the game last week with several defensive starters or regulars sitting out because of rules violations and ended the game with senior defensive end Breckyn Hager drawing an personal foul penalty that was criticized by teammate. Texas players insist there\u2019s no problem in the locker room, but that could be tested early if West Virginia jumps out big.\n\n\u201cWhen you ground your kid, it doesn\u2019t mean you love them any less,\u201d said Herman, who didn\u2019t second-guess the suspensions. \u201cOur culture needs to be reinforced on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nEHLINGER ON THE RUN\n\nEhlinger\u2019s sprained throwing shoulder seemed fully recovered last week against Oklahoma State and he even ran 10 times for 47 yards and two touchdowns. Texas needs his legs. Ehlinger had at least one run on every scoring drive last week, and punted every time he didn\u2019t.", "Kansas running back Khalil Herbert (10) stiff arms TCU linebacker Jawuan Johnson, right, during the second half of an NCAA college football game in Lawrence, Kan., Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018. (AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas coach David Purdy was downright stunned that Brock Purdy was still available when he gave the promising quarterback from an Arizona high school a scholarship offer.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he was quietly heralded. He was a guy that won a lot of awards,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cYou turn on the tape and you saw a lot of ability in terms of spinning it. He can flat throw it, great release, compact. You could tell he commanded the offense. The other thing is he can move. In this day and age, there\u2019s so many freaks playing on the other side of the ball you\u2019d better be able to move.\u201d\n\nAll of which presented Beaty with a pair of problems: The first is that Purdy decided not to play for the Jayhawks, and the second is that he ultimately chose Big 12 rival Iowa State.\n\nNow, the true freshman will be leading the Cyclones (4-3, 3-2) into Memorial Stadium on Saturday to face the Jayhawks (3-5, 1-4), who are coming off a rare conference win over TCU.\n\n\u201cWhen Brock came in, you could see a spark, production go up. You couple that with Matt Campbell and his staff, I mean, it spells trouble,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done as good a job as I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Cyclones\u2019 winning streak has hardly come against the dregs of the Big 12. They beat Oklahoma State on the road, thumped then-unbeaten West Virginia and won a close game with Texas Tech. Two of those teams were ranked when they played.\n\nThe challenge for Campbell\u2019s team is to keep the momentum from their second consecutive perfect October going into November. And the Cyclones\u2019 coach thinks it\u2019s entirely possible.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot more capable bodies and capable young men that are helping and impacting our team than there was a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a credit to the multitude of guys who have stepped up.\u201d\n\nAs for Kansas, the challenge is to turn one conference win into two.\n\nThe Jayhawks relied on turnovers and a big game from freshman running back Pooka Williams to beat the Horned Frogs last week. But they haven\u2019t won more than one Big 12 game in a season since 2008, when Mark Mangino led them to an 8-5 record and their most recent bowl game.\n\n\u201cWe still have a chance to go to a bowl game and we\u2019re not going to quit, and I love that about this football team,\u201d Jayhawks linebacker Keith Loneker Jr. said. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be a part of a group of guys that believe in that.\u201d\n\nSTOPPING POOKA\n\nWilliams averages 93 yards per carry, and his 175 all-purpose yards and two TDs against TCU helped the Jayhawks spring an upset win last week. \u201cHe\u2019s just dynamic when he has the ball in his hands,\u201d Cyclones linebacker Willie Harvey said. \u201cYou have to focus on him.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING OF STARS\n\nCyclones running back David Montgomery has four straight 100-yard rushing games, including 189 yards against the Mountaineers and 125 against the Red Raiders. He is at his best after first contact, too, and that\u2019s a big reason why he leads the Big 12 in yards rushing.\n\nTURNOVER TIME\n\nAfter ranking near the bottom nationally in turnovers last season, the Jayhawks are No. 1 this season. They\u2019re also second in turnover margin. \u201cThat confidence in what they\u2019re doing allows them to be very aggressive and make plays on the ball,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nGETTING DEFENSIVE\n\nThe Cyclones\u2019 defense ranks in the top 10 nationally in yards per carry and yards rushing, and linebacker Marcel Spears Jr. is coming off a game in which he picked off two passes and returned one for a touchdown against the Red Raiders.\n\nPEYTON\u2019S PLACE\n\nJayhawks quarterback Peyton Bender had the best game of his career against TCU, not only with his arm but with his grit. He lowered his head for a key first down late, and the Jayhawks rallied around the senior when the outcome was hanging in the balance. \u201cThere\u2019s still some stuff we need to improve on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back and look at the film, diagnose it and get ready to go.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The final U.S. jobs report before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections is expected to show that employers are still hiring at a healthy pace. Whether it will make much difference to voters at this point is another matter.\n\nEconomists have forecast that the government will report Friday that the economy added a solid 190,000 jobs in October and that the unemployment rate remained at a 49-year low of 3.7 percent, according to a survey by data provider FactSet.\n\nThat gain would be only slightly below the monthly average of 208,000 so far this year but would mark a rebound from the 134,000 jobs added in September. The September gain, though, was depressed by the impact of Hurricane Florence. Economists think Hurricane Michael, which tore through Florida and Georgia last month, had a much weaker impact.\n\nConsumers are generally confident, spending freely and propelling brisk economic growth. The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there\u2019s no sign of that happening yet. The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record. October will also mark 100 straight months of hiring, a record streak.\n\nStill, another month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy\u2019s performance, that sentiment hasn\u2019t necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or Republican congressional candidates.\n\nIn October, consumer confidence reached its highest point in 18 years, propelled by optimism about the job market. Last month\u2019s plunge in stock prices didn\u2019t dampen Americans\u2019 enthusiasm, though the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the full market decline had occurred.\n\nIn the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years.\n\nManufacturing output and hiring remain healthy, according to a survey by a private trade association, although increased tariffs have raised factory costs.\n\nBy contrast, housing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains.\n\nThere are signs that pay growth is picking up. A measure of wage and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, the best such showing in a decade.\n\nAlthough pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy\u2019s growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation.\n\nSo far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August.", "1 of 2 FILE - In this Oct. 27, 2018, file photo, Purdue quarterback David Blough throws a pass during an NCAA college football game against Michigan State, in East Lansing, Mich. Blough had been about the hottest thing going in the Big Ten before throwing three interceptions last week against Michigan State. It won\u2019t get any easier for Blough at home against Iowa. (AP Photo/Al Goldis, File)\n\nFans of No. 19 Iowa and Purdue are closely tracking the Big Ten West title chase.\n\nThey know the Hawkeyes and Boilermakers must rebound quickly from last week\u2019s road losses and the reward for Saturday\u2019s winner will be staying in contention for the conference championship game.\n\nThe coaches, meanwhile, spent this week downplaying the possibilities by focusing on this key, under-the-radar game while going silent on the long-term scenarios.\n\n\u201cWasting time on that stuff, it\u2019s great for fans, it\u2019s great for the media, but it\u2019s not really productive for players and coaches to focus on because it\u2019s going to change anyway,\u201d Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nIt could matter to Iowa (6-2, 3-2, No. 16 CFP). A win Saturday at Purdue sets up a crucial home game against division leader Northwestern next weekend and potentially puts the Hawkeyes back on track to make their second trip to Indianapolis.\n\nThe Boilermakers\u2019 road is more complicated because of their opening-night loss to Northwestern. But a victory over Iowa would give Purdue (4-4, 3-2) an outside shot with winnable road games at Minnesota and Indiana still on tap along with a home date against Wisconsin.\n\nSecond-year coach Jeff Brohm figures if the Boilermakers make the proper corrections, everything else eventually will fall into place.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to raise our level of play individually and as a unit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to have to do the small things right in order to win against good opponents and that\u2019s just football. I think when you get to the next level and it\u2019s good teams every week, the team that executes and plays the hardest is going to win.\u201d\n\nAnd both coaches are starting at quarterback.\n\nWhile the solid, steady play of Iowa\u2019s Nate Stanley and Purdue\u2019s David Blough kept their respective teams in the title talk, sub-par performances last week left their teams in this plight.\n\nStanley completed 36.7 percent of his passes and was picked off twice in a 30-24 loss at Penn State. Blough was intercepted three times and only got Purdue into the end zone once at Michigan State, a week after the Boilermakers hung 49 points on then-No. 2 Ohio State.\n\nWhoever plays better this week could put his team on the right track Saturday \u2014 and perhaps for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cI think as long as we play the game the way it\u2019s supposed to, which we intend on doing, we\u2019ll live with the results,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cBut I like the makeup of our team.\u201d\n\nLOOKING FOR MOORE\n\nEach week it seems Purdue receiver Rondale Moore makes a stronger case for being named the league\u2019s top newcomer. He leads the conference in receptions (68) and all-purpose yards (181.1 per game) and is second in yards receiving per game (100.3). And opponents have noticed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s awfully impressive,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cThat (the Ohio State game) in itself was enough to impress anybody, not only playing the way he played but playing against that type of competition. It\u2019s pretty unusual for a guy that\u2019s a senior it would be really impressive. To consider him being just out of high school, it\u2019s awfully impressive.\u201d\n\nTHREE FOR THE ROAD\n\nIowa has pulled off a rare triple over the last month. After Tavon Young produced a career-high 96 yards rushing at Indiana, Ivory Kelly-Martin achieved the same feat with a 98-yard game against Maryland. Last week, Mekhi Sargent joined the club with a career-best 91 yards against the Nittany Lions. Could it happen again?\n\n\u201cI thought he looked his most comfortable out there. He blew a couple plays, but that\u2019s to be expected at this point of his career. But his attitude is great. He\u2019s really into it,\u201d Ferentz said, referring to Sargent. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to do what on Saturday, but all three of those guys, we\u2019re counting on all three of them to play well for us.\u201d\n\nLATE SEASON SURGE\n\nBrohm had a propensity for winning late season games before joining the Boilermakers last season, and that hasn\u2019t changed in West Lafayette. In 2017, the Boilermakers won three of their last four regular-season games to become bowl-eligible and then won the Foster Farms Bowl, giving Brohm a 3-1 mark during the final two months of the season. Brohm struggles to explain the secret to his success, but he\u2019s won three straight in November and December.\n\n\u201cI think that we try to improve as the year goes on,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe try to work hard at our weaknesses try to improve the weak before and be critical of ourselves and find ways to fix mistakes.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The final U.S. jobs report before Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections is expected to show that employers are still hiring at a healthy pace.

(Alexandra Minor/U.S. Air Force via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has left no doubt that his top priority as leader of the military is making it more \u201clethal\u201d \u2014 better at war and more prepared for it \u2014 and yet nothing about the military\u2019s new mission at the U.S.-Mexico border advances that goal. Some argue it detracts from it.\n\nThe troops going to the border areas of Texas, Arizona and California are a small fraction of the military\u2019s roughly 1.3 million active-duty members, and the mission is set to last only 45 days. But many question the wisdom of drawing even several thousand away from training for their key purpose: to win wars.\n\nJames Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral and former head of the U.S. Southern Command, said the troops should be preparing for combat and other missions, \u201cnot monitoring a peaceful border\u201d for the arrival of a migrant caravan of several thousand people on foot, still about 900 miles (1,450 kilometers) away.\n\n\u201cIt sends a terrible signal to Latin America and the Caribbean as we unnecessarily militarize our border,\u201d Stavridis, who also served as the top NATO commander, said Thursday. \u201cIt places U.S. troops who are fundamentally untrained for the mission of border security and border enforcement into an area of operations, which could cause incidents of a negative character. If we need more border patrol agents, hire them.\u201d\n\nThe first 100 or so active duty troops arrived at the border on Thursday, making initial assessment at the McAllen, Texas, crossing. Overall, there are about 2,600 troops at staging bases in the region.\n\nDavid Lapan, a retired Marine colonel who is a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Department of Homeland Security, said that taking troops away from training and from their families to play a supporting role in border security is unwise.\n\n\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d said Lapan, now a vice president of communications at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cThis caravan, this group of poor people, including a lot of women and children, doesn\u2019t pose a threat \u2014 not a national security threat.\u201d\n\nIn line with the Pentagon\u2019s national security strategy, Mattis has been focused on improving the combat readiness of a military worn down by the recent years of congressionally imposed budget cuts and the grind of 17 years of war in Afghanistan. This includes reorienting training from that required for the smaller wars the U.S. has fought since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to a \u201cgreat power\u201d struggle with Russia and China.\n\nThat context may explain why the Pentagon itself seemed caught off-guard by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt order to dispatch active-duty troops; the Customs and Border Protection, which requested Pentagon help, has struggled to define details of the mission and explain its scope.\n\n\u201cThat this is a security threat is preposterous and not supported by the evidence,\u201d said Derek Chollet, former senior policy adviser at the Pentagon. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in the Pentagon and worried about implementation of the national defense strategy and worried about the threats from China and Russia, this is not at the top of your list.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is another version of the parade,\u201d Chollet said, referring to Trump\u2019s demand earlier this year \u2014 eventually withdrawn \u2014 that the military spend millions to stage a parade in Washington D.C. \u201cThis is not a good use of U.S. military resources at this moment. Trump was frustrated in his effort to build a physical wall on the border, now he\u2019s trying to build a human wall by using the U.S. military.\u201d\n\nMattis has rejected assertions that the military is being leveraged by the White House as a political stunt in advance of the midterm elections. \u201cWe don\u2019t do stunts,\u201d he said Wednesday, but neither has he argued that sending thousands of active-duty soldiers to help secure the border is his preference.\n\nGen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, who as head of U.S. Northern Command is commanding the military operation, dubbed \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot,\u201d has argued that the caravan is a potential threat, although he has not fully defined that.\n\n\u201cI think what we have seen is we\u2019ve seen clearly an organization at a higher level than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen violence coming out of the caravan and we\u2019ve seen as they\u2019ve passed other international borders, we\u2019ve seen them behave in a nature that has not been what we\u2019ve seen in the past.\u201d\n\nOne concern raised by other defense officials is that the caravans are largely male-dominated, and that one of them used violence when crossing the border into Mexico. But Associated Press journalists traveling with the largest group say it includes many families, including hundreds of children, and it has been orderly and peaceful, with no sign of any danger.\n\nThe military says it is deploying 7,000 troops to Texas, Arizona and California, and while it has left open the possibility that the number could grow by another thousand under current plans, the scope of the mission has grown in recent days. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would send as many as 15,000 troops.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a letter to Trump on Thursday that his administration has given the committee no evidence that migrant caravans pose a direct security threat to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis is not a military problem; it does not warrant a military solution,\u201d Reed wrote. He said the administration should disclose the cost of the military\u2019s border mission \u201cand what impacts it will have on military readiness and the overall budget.\u201d\n\nWith his eyes squarely on Tuesday\u2019s election contests, Trump has rushed a series of immigration declarations, promises and actions as he tries to mobilize supporters to retain Republican control of Congress. His own campaign in 2016 concentrated on border fears, and that\u2019s his focus in the final days of the midterm fight.\n\nTrump has railed against illegal immigration, focusing on the migrant caravans that have been going on for several years but received little attention until now. The largest at the moment consists of about 4,000, down from a high of about 7,000, and is still in southern Mexico. Several smaller groups, estimated at a combined 1,200 people, are farther away.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the agency name in 9th paragraph is Customs and Border Protection, not Border Patrol.", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The president\u2019s re-election campaign released a new ad Friday that borrows liberally from an expletive-filled, anti-immigration video that was denounced as racist.\n\nThe new ad, tweeted by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, warns ominously that a caravan of migrants that has been traveling toward the U.S. must be stopped. And it includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers.\n\n\u201cDangerous illegal criminals like cop-killer Luis Bracamontes don\u2019t care about our laws,\u201d the narrator says against footage of the caravan, which remains hundreds of miles from the southern border. \u201cAmerica cannot allow this invasion. The migrant caravan must be stopped.\u201d\n\nThe decision to use the footage in an official campaign ad is the latest of Trump\u2019s election-week efforts to stoke fear and anti-immigrant sentiment in hopes of motivating Republicans to vote Tuesday. And it comes amid a frenzy of hardline immigration proposals he has pushed in the final stages of the campaign, including sending troops to the border and revoking birthright citizenship.\n\nBracamontes was also featured in an ad Trump tweeted Wednesday that was widely seen as reminiscent of the infamous 1988 \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and condemned as racist.\n\nPresident Donald Trumps tweeted a video likening Central American immigrants to dangerous criminals. It has been roundly criticized as racist and reminiscent of the infamous \"Willie Horton\" ad used in the 1988 presidential campaign. (Nov. 1)\n\nTrump had said earlier Friday the video was tough \u201cbut correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view it as the Willie Horton ad at all,\u201d the president told The Washington Times in an interview published Friday. \u201cI think it\u2019s just an ad where somebody is a bad guy, came in illegally, twice, and we can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nParscale said the new ad would start running nationally Friday night and the campaign had purchased $1.5 million in airtime to run it.\n\nIt stands in stark contrast to an ad released by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life. That ad was part of a blitz by Trump\u2019s campaign, and Parscale did several interviews to promote it.\n\nThe conservative Breitbart News chronicled Bracamontes\u2019 conviction and death sentence.\n\nBracamontes\u2019 snarling, expletive-filled courtroom rant about killing police officers appeared in a little-noticed January 2018 Trump campaign ad. Bracamontes sports a shaved head and long chin hair in the video. He speaks in accented English, and his words are clear: He\u2019s killed cops and he\u2019s \u201cgonna kill more cops soon.\u201d\n\nThe original video alleges without evidence that Democrats were responsible for allowing Bracamontes into the U.S. Bracamontes was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings.\n\n\u201cIllegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!\u201d the video states, adding, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay.\u201d It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., asks, \u201cWho else would Democrats let in?\u201d and suggests that more violence would soon penetrate the border.\n\nWhile the first video did not appear be running on television, it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday afternoon, it had received 3.51 million views in less than 24 hours and was the \u201cpinned\u201d tweet atop Trump\u2019s profile, making it the first thing any visitor to his Twitter page would see.\n\nThe White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThis is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it,\u201d said Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a frequent Trump critic. And Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., seeking re-election in a Democratic-leaning South Florida district, said he\u2019d not seen the video but criticized Trump\u2019s use of it.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that it\u2019s definitely part of a divide-and-conquer strategy that a lot of politicians, including the president, have used successfully in the past,\u201d Curbelo said Thursday on CNN. \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the \u201cdog whistle of all dog whistles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\u201d Perez said on CNN. \u201cThis is fearmongering.\u201d\n\nBut the Trump campaign was behind the January 2018 video, released on its YouTube page, that featured Bracamontes\u2019 courtroom appearance. That video was timed to the one-year anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration and meant to promote his immigration agenda.\n\nThe previous year, Jessica Davis and Susan Oliver, the widows of Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, were invited to Trump\u2019s address to Congress. Bracamontes\u2019 case \u2014 he was sentenced to death in March \u2014 also received steady coverage on Breitbart and other right-wing news sites.\n\nTrump has long promoted the alleged danger presented by those living in the country illegally, although statistics show they do not commit crimes at a higher rate than citizens. During his 2016 campaign, he frequently appeared with so-called \u201cangel families\u201d \u2014 those who lost loved ones at the hands of immigrants in the nation illegally.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire and Miller at http://twitter.com/@zekejmiller\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "In this Monday, Oct. 29, 2018, file photo, a wallet belonging to a victim of the Lion Air passenger jet that crashed is seen in the waters of Ujung Karawang, West Java, Indonesia.

Prescott uses the memory of his late mother to steady himself through the team's ups and downs. Prescott's sudden success gave him a platform to share the story of Peggy Prescott's death from colon cancer five years ago. The Cowboys missed the playoffs in Prescott's encore after a remarkable rookie season carried them to the postseason. Now that Dallas is struggling again, Prescott figures his football-loving mom would have an opinion, and words of encouragement.(AP Photo/Stephen Brashear, File)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Through every interception, fumble and loss, Dak Prescott\u2019s mind is on the next throw, the next scramble, the next game for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe quarterback of America\u2019s Team thinks of where he\u2019s been: almost exactly five years removed from his mom, Peggy Prescott, dying of colon cancer when her son was a 20-year-old sophomore at Mississippi State. That makes it easier for him to move on in his football world.\n\n\u201cWhen you lose your mom, it\u2019s not that easy,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to wake up every day, looking yourself in the face and knowing that you\u2019ve got an angel. You\u2019ve got an angel that has expectations for you to do and you\u2019ve got to go out there and do them each and every day.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the expectations of others won\u2019t faze Prescott with the losses almost as frequent as the victories since he led a franchise-record 11-game winning streak that helped him earn NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors in 2016.\n\nThe struggling Dallas offense, more specifically the passing game , appears to be the biggest obstacle for the Cowboys as they try to return to the playoffs after falling short during Prescott\u2019s less-than-stellar encore last year. He figures his football-loving mom would be right there with the rest of the critics, with a caveat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d let me know how she felt about our struggles and about the mistakes and those type of things,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cSimply on the other hand of having the confidence in me of fixing them and in our team of fixing them and getting back to playing the type of ball we want to play as a team.\u201d\n\nPrescott paused in the middle of the season during the Cowboys\u2019 open week for a cause that will endure for him regardless of which direction his career goes.\n\nHis role in Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s \u201cReady. Raise. Rise.\u201d campaign is one of his cancer awareness initiatives from a platform Prescott\u2019s mom envisioned after she was diagnosed.\n\nWhether she could have seen it coming through her son\u2019s sudden stardom as quarterback of one of the world\u2019s most visible pro sports franchises is another question.\n\n\u201cI think she definitely did,\u201d said Prescott, who has been part of a campaign that led to a $250,000 donation to cancer advocacy groups. \u201cAnd she had plans and she had dreams for me.\u201d\n\nPrescott remembers watching with his mom when Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre played a night after his father died and threw for 399 yards and four touchdowns in Green Bay\u2019s 41-7 win over Oakland in 2003.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I want you to play if that ever happens,\u2019\u201d Prescott said.\n\nHis mom died on a Sunday \u2014 the day after he threw three interceptions in a loss to South Carolina when he knew something was wrong because his mom hadn\u2019t texted or called him back before the game. The funeral was on a Wednesday \u2014 three days before a loss to Texas A&M.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get back. My mom would be mad that I even missed that practice that I missed yesterday,\u2019\u201d Prescott recalled. \u201cI could say that\u2019s the moment that I started allowing my mom to be my story, doing the things that she told me and she taught me.\u201d\n\nHis Mississippi State teammates saw it when Prescott led the Bulldogs to the first No. 1 ranking in school history a year later, before a loss to Nick Saban and Alabama.\n\nHis Dallas teammates saw it when he showed up as the forgotten fourth-round pick and third-stringer behind franchise passing leader Tony Romo. After backup Kellen Moore broke an ankle in training camp and Romo injured his back in a preseason game, Prescott got his chance. Romo never got his job back.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had the same qualities from Day One, as a rookie to now,\u201d receiver Cole Beasley said. \u201cHasn\u2019t changed at all. I don\u2019t know if he had many bad games in 2016. But I know he has always been the same guy whether good or bad since I\u2019ve known him.\u201d\n\nThose qualities have been tested, with a 14-13 record since his remarkable 11-1 start and more interceptions, fumbles and sacks. While owner and general manager Jerry Jones keeps using stronger language to suggest he\u2019s settled on his quarterback of the future, doubters are numerous outside Cowboys headquarters.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a guy that\u2019s a winner, boy, hard to pass up on guys that are winners,\u201d said Florida coach Dan Mullen, who was Prescott\u2019s coach at Mississippi State. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of different quarterbacks. A winner\u2019s a winner. That\u2019s the first thing I look for in quarterbacks.\u201d\n\nAsk Prescott how he thinks he needs to improve, and he\u2019ll say in everything. A Cowboys fan as a kid growing up near the Texas state line in Louisiana, Prescott longs to end a Super Bowl drought that\u2019s approaching 25 years.\n\nBut there\u2019s a small part of Prescott that would concede he\u2019s already a winner, looking back over five years since his mom died, and 25 months since he was the opening day quarterback with Dallas fans wondering if another season was lost because of another Romo injury.\n\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s definitely an emotional woman,\u201d Prescott said, slipping into the present tense.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019d be tears, it\u2019d be a lot of tears in the last 25 months. She asked me when she initially got sick to allow her to be my story. She said all greats have a story. So for my mom to say that back in 2013 to where we are now, I think she\u2019d be proud.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Roh Tae-kang, right, South Korea's vice minister of culture and sports, shakes hands with his North Korean counterpart Won Kil U while posing for a photo during a meeting at the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

The narrative being built around why he wouldn\u2019t go to Duke is they already had two elite small forwards.\u201d\n\nThe early returns suggest they\u2019ll make it work just fine. The trio is part of a loaded Duke freshman class that also includes guard Tre Jones, ranked 15th in the 247Sports Composite.\n\nWilliamson, Barrett and Reddish averaged a combined 70 points, 16 rebounds and 11.5 assists in the fourth-ranked Blue Devils\u2019 two preseason exhibition victories. Meyer is interested in seeing if Duke experiments with any lineups featuring four freshmen in which the 6-foot-7 Williamson defends the opposing team\u2019s center.\n\n\u201cIt would be kind of like the Golden State Warriors thing where you go small and play without a center sometimes, very similar to what Golden State does with Draymond Green,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some freshmen who should make a major impact this season. For the purposes of this list, we decided to limit ourselves to just one of the Duke newcomers.\n\nRJ BARRETT, DUKE\n\nPosition: Forward. Height: 6-7.\n\nBarrett was the lone freshman included in the Associated Press preseason All-America team . He\u2019s the nation\u2019s No. 1 overall prospect in his class according to the 247Sports Composite. He also was the Gatorade national high school player of the year. Barrett was born in Toronto and helped Canada win a gold medal at the FIBA U19 Men\u2019s Basketball World Cup this year, but he played high school basketball at Montverde (Florida) Academy. Barrett has averaged 27.5 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists in two exhibition games.\n\n\u201cHe has a great feel for the game,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cHe can finish a play, can start a play, can make the assist pass, can make the hockey assist pass, get you rebounds. The key for him is outside shooting, and evidently that\u2019s improving.\u201d\n\nCHARLES BASSEY, WESTERN KENTUCKY\n\nPosition: Center. Height: 6-11.\n\nBassey was the No. 7 prospect in the 247Sports Composite and the only college-bound player in the top 18 who chose a non-Power Five school. He averaged 19.4 points, 12.8 rebounds, 3.4 blocks, 2.9 assists and 1.7 steals last season at Aspire Academy in Louisville, Kentucky. Bassey had 12 points, 11 rebounds and three blocks in a preseason exhibition victory over Campbellsville.\n\n\u201cHe can be a dominant inside scorer and rebounder at any level,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nBOL BOL, OREGON\n\nPosition: Center. Height: 7-2.\n\nBol, the son of former NBA center Manute Bol, was ranked fourth in the 247Sports Composite. He\u2019s from Olathe, Kansas, but played high school basketball at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada. Bol averaged 20.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.4 blocks his senior year at Findlay Prep.\n\n\u201cHe can score from all three levels, and for someone that size, he really represents a lot of problems. He\u2019s got a soft touch. We\u2019ve got to move him around a little bit because physically he\u2019s not real strong. You just can\u2019t put him in the block and let him bang around,\u201d Oregon coach Dana Altman said. \u201cBut he does move in there very well. He catches the ball well. I\u2019ve been really pleased with his instincts and his ability to pass the ball.\u201d\n\nDARIUS GARLAND, VANDERBILT\n\nPosition: Guard. Height: 6-2.\n\nGarland and teammate Simi Shittu are the first two McDonald\u2019s All-Americans ever to sign with Vanderbilt. Shittu was ranked 11th and Garland 14th in the 247Sports Composite, but Garland could make the bigger impact as a point guard who should have the ball in his hands often. Garland helped Brentwood (Tennessee) Academy win four straight state titles. He averaged 27.6 points his senior year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quick, can handle the ball. He can do everything you want a guard to do. He can get to the rim. He can be a distributor. He\u2019s an outstanding shooter, has a pull-up game. He can defend,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI think the question for him as a college freshman will be strength and physicality.\u201d\n\nROMEO LANGFORD, INDIANA\n\nPosition: Guard. Height: 6-6\n\nLangford was ranked seventh in the 247Sports Composite and was one of three finalists for the Gatorade national high school player of the year award. He scored 3,002 career points at New Albany High School to rank fourth in Indiana boys basketball history. Langford followed that up by scoring 19 points in the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very polished player with the ball in his hands, can score any way you want,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cHe has the physical tools to do everything as a shooting guard.\u201d\n\nNASSIR LITTLE, NORTH CAROLINA\n\nPosition: Forward. Height: 6-6.\n\nRanked third in the 247Sports Composite, Little helped Orlando (Florida) Christian win state titles each of his last two years in high school. He also was salutatorian of his senior class. Little was most valuable player of the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game and the co-MVP of the Jordan Brand Classic. He scored 28 points in the McDonald\u2019s game and 24 in the Jordan Brand Classic.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the full package for a combo forward,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s a physical athlete, powerful and dominant inside around the basket but also can shoot the 3 and can stretch the defense some. He has a complete skill set.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee", "Rep.

(AP Photo/John Locher)\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Dean Heller made a final push on opposite ends of Nevada Friday to mobilize voters on the last day of early voting in their razor-thin contest for U.S. Senate\n\nThe race could help Democrats find a narrow path to taking power, and Heller is considered uniquely vulnerable this year.\n\nThe Republican has held the Nevada Senate seat since 2011 and is the only GOP senator seeking re-election this year in a state that Democrat Hillary Clinton carried two years ago.\n\nHeller was rallying with the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., in northern Nevada, while Rosen planned a day of events with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, capped off by an evening rally in downtown Las Vegas with talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and singer Brandon Flowers of the Las Vegas-based band The Killers.\n\n\u201cThe future of our health care, the dignity and the decency of our democracy, the kindness and caring of who we are; all of it, every single bit of it is on the line right now right here tonight and on Tuesday,\u201d Rosen said at the Friday night rally.\n\nShe spent the morning with Harris speaking to heavily female audiences, starting with a breakfast in west Las Vegas where she delivered a woman-focused message and declared that \u201cthe future is female.\u201d\n\nIn Reno, Heller touted a rosy jobs report released earlier in the day by the U.S. Labor Department showing that employers lifted wages at the fastest pace since 2009.\n\nThe senator called it a \u201cbad day\u201d for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey want this economy to tank ... for you to lose your jobs,\u201d Heller said.\n\nHe told the crowd of about 200 supporters at a Reno cabinet warehouse that Tuesday\u2019s election presents clear choices: \u201cA good economy or a bad economy. Open borders, or closed borders.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s son said the nation is enjoying tremendous economic growth, but that his father can\u2019t continue to lead the country without key Republicans like Heller and Adam Laxalt, the state\u2019s Republican attorney general who is running for governor.\n\nTrump Jr. said the only political platform Democrats have is \u201coutrage.\u201d\n\nRegarding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, he said if the Democrats can \u201cdestroy his life, they can try to do that to any one of you.\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. rallied earlier in the day with Heller in Carson City and planned stops later with Laxalt and other GOP candidates in Pahrump and Las Vegas.\n\nIn the Democratic stronghold of Las Vegas, Rosen and Harris fired up a room of women at breakfast before touring and speaking at a cosmetology school north of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nAt breakfast, Rosen warned that like issues like women\u2019s rights, health care and retirement security are at stake in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nShe and Harris also worked the room, shaking hands and posing for pictures with members of the Links volunteer service organization and local chapters of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\n\nRosen and Democrats have focused the campaign against Heller on his support for GOP plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act despite his initial opposition to some repeal efforts in Congress.\n\nKimmel, who grew up in Las Vegas and has used his show to speak out against congressional attempts to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, praised Rosen while roasting Trump and Heller, declaring that \u201cDean Heller is a pre-existing condition that Nevada can no longer afford.\u201d\n\nHe urged the crowd to vote for Rosen, telling them that \u201cthe wealthiest, most influential people in this town \u2014 Steve Wynn, Sheldon Adelson, George Maloof, even Siegfried and Roy, with all their tigers and magic powers \u2014 get the same amount of votes as you do.\u201d\n\nHarris, throughout the day, told crowds that what happens in Nevada will have national implications and urged people to think about the election as a pivotal, historical moment that their children and grandchildren will ask them about someday.\n\n\u201cThis is an inflection moment in our country. There is so much at stake,\u201d Harris said at the cosmetology school. \u201cYears from now, people are going to look at each of us. They\u2019re going to look each one of you in your eyes and they\u2019re going to ask you, \u2018Where were you at that inflection moment?\u2019 \u201d\n\n___\n\nSonner reported from Reno.

Now living in a camp for the displaced, he is running out of ways to feed his other four children.\n\nJobless, he has no way to afford food, and he says he hasn\u2019t received international aid for several months. His wife gives their children moldy bread crumbs mixed with water and salt. Some days she feeds them a paste made of boiled leaves from a vine called \u201chalas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe left everything behind. We walked for hours on foot, carrying nothing, not even one rial, no food or water,\u201d he told The Associated Press at the camp in the northern province of Hajjah.\n\nThey are among millions of Yemenis who lost everything \u2014 homes, jobs, loved ones \u2014 in nearly four years of civil war. The conflict has pushed the country of 29 million people to the brink of famine. At least 8 million have no food other than what aid agencies provide.\n\nThe figure is likely to rise to 11.5 million as more people become unable to afford food because the worsening economic crisis caused by the war, U.N. agencies warn. The currency is crumbling in value, sending prices soaring.\n\nThe humanitarian disaster has come as the U.S.-backed Saudi-led coalition since 2015 has waged a relentless campaign of airstrikes and imposed a blockade, aiming to uproot Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who took over northern and central Yemen.\n\nBesides airstrikes, northern Yemen has also seen heavy barrages back and forth across the border with Saudi Arabia as Saudi forces battle rebels.\n\nHussein and his family had to flee their border village of al-Shada because of non-stop strikes and shelling. As they fled, the 5-month-old died in his mother\u2019s arms. Hussein is not sure if it was from dehydration or malnutrition.\n\nFor the past four months, they have lived in a shack made of sticks, blankets and plastic sheets in a camp in Aslam district near the city of Abs.\n\nThe 46-year-old Hussein once grew grapes and pomegranates and thrived off trade in markets across the border in Saudi Arabia. He lost his livelihood, sold all his goats but one and cut down on meals to one a day.\n\nThe numbers of displaced are only growing.\n\nIn August-September, 20,000 people fleeing the border town of Bani Hassan flowed into Abs, Doctors Without Borders reported. The aid organization, which operates in the main hospital in Abs, said it treated more than 300 people wounded the fighting. A number of women and children in late stages of malnutrition or cholera or with complications from giving birth have died, the group said, without giving figures.\n\nDoctors Without Borders said it is ready to deploy mobile medical teams around the area every day but has only received permission from Houthi authorities for seven days the past month.\n\nHere is a series of photographs from AP photographer Hani Mohammed of the desperation faced by so many in Yemen.\n\n___\n\nFollow Associated Press photographers and photo editors on Twitter: http://apne.ws/15Oo6jo .", "", "No. 1 Alabama at No. 4 LSU should change playoff picture\n\nThe initial College Football Playoff rankings were released this week, with Alabama, Clemson, LSU and Notre Dame holding down the top four spots.\n\nThe playoff picture could change drastically the first post-rankings weekend.\n\nThe schedule is full of huge games, including top-ranked Alabama at LSU, No. 5 Michigan against No. 14 Penn State and No. 6 Georgia at No. 11 Kentucky.\n\nIt\u2019s about to get real interesting in a hurry.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some things to know heading into the season\u2019s 10th weekend:\n\nBEST GAME\n\nNo. 1 Alabama (8-0, 5-0 SEC) at No. 4 LSU (7-1, 4-1)\n\nThis isn\u2019t just the biggest game of the week, it could be the biggest of the season so far.\n\nThe champion Crimson Tide have yet to be challenged in defense of their national title, winning their first eight games by an average of nearly 40 points.\n\nThat could change this week in Baton Rouge.\n\nLSU leads the nation with 14 interceptions and is fifth in pass defense efficiency, so the Tigers may have the right components to at least slow Tua Tagovailoa and the nation\u2019s top-scoring offense.\n\nRegardless how it plays out, this is a must-watch game.\n\nHEISMAN WATCH\n\nTagovailoa has been the front-runner to win the Heisman Trophy, but don\u2019t count out Kyler Murray.

(Iranian Labor News Agency via AP, File)\n\nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran is bracing for the restoration of U.S. sanctions on its vital oil industry next week, as it grapples with an economic crisis that has sparked sporadic protests over rising prices, corruption and unemployment.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday announced the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, ramping up economic pressure on the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe oil sanctions, set to take effect on Monday, will target the country\u2019s largest source of revenue in the most punishing action taken since the Trump administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement in May, and will also affect Iranian shipping and financial transactions.\n\nTehran state TV reported on the sanctions Friday, citing international media outlets and highlighting the U.S. decision to allow eight nations to maintain imports of crude oil from Tehran, calling it a sign of the U.S.\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to reduce Iran\u2019s oil exports to nil.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the exemption for eight nations on Friday, saying they would be announced on Monday and will include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan and South Korea which had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday.\n\nThe governor of Iran\u2019s central bank, Valiollah Seif, posted on his Instagram account: \u201cToday it is clear for all that the U.S. has failed in full sanction and bringing Iran\u2019s oil (export) to zero.\u201d\n\nEconomic analyst Sasan Shahveisi told state TV that based past experiences of crude oil sanctions, Iran\u2019s oil exports will not be heavily damaged since there will be a consequent hike in oil prices. He said regional oil exporters like rival Saudi Arabia cannot quickly increase their oil production since \u201cit will damage their capacity.\u201d\n\nThe United States has already restored sanctions on Iran targeting financial transactions involving U.S. dollars, Iran\u2019s automotive sector and the purchase of commercial airplanes and metals, including gold.\n\nThe White House insists the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the Islamic Republic, but at forcing Iran to dramatically alter its policies in the region, including its support for militant groups across the Mideast and its development of ballistic missiles. The U.N. nuclear agency says Iran is complying with the nuclear deal.\n\nThe renewed sanctions have already taken a heavy toll, with the rial losing half its value since April and the prices of fruit, poultry, eggs and milk skyrocketing. Protests erupted across the country in December, with some demonstrators chanting against the government and clashing with police. Sporadic demonstrations have been held in recent months, including strikes by workers, teachers and truck drivers.\n\nThe nuclear accord struck under the Obama administration - and also signed by Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - lifted crippling international sanctions in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. Western countries had long suspected Iran\u2019s nuclear program masked the covert pursuit of atomic weapons, allegations denied by Iran, which has always insisted its nuclear activities are for energy and other peaceful purposes.\n\nAfter the agreement took effect in 2016, Iran began exporting its oil more freely and signed billion-dollar agreements with Airbus, Boeing and other Western firms. But the legacy of decades of sanctions and economic mismanagement remained, and the nuclear deal\u2019s future was thrown into uncertainty with the election of President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly vowed to exit the deal and finally withdrew in May.\n\nStarting Monday, the Trump administration has promised that companies that fail to comply with the sanctions will be barred from doing business in the U.S.\n\nAlthough Washington might grant waivers to countries like China and India, which are among the biggest importers of Iranian crude, the expectation is that the U.S. will demand substantial curbs on how much is imported.\n\nIn recent weeks, Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani had tried to reassure the public, saying the worst has already come to pass and that the government is working on ways to evade the new sanctions. But in a televised Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he acknowledged that \u201cthe situation was hard for people in recent months, and it may be hard in the next several months, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government will utilize its entire capabilities to alleviate the problems,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an effort to circumvent the sanctions, Iran began selling some of its oil in an energy stock exchange on Sunday. Iran\u2019s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said 280,000 barrels were sold on the IRENEX exchange as of Wednesday and that 720,000 barrels will be provided later.\n\nBut the 1 million barrels a day Iran intends to sell in the exchange - which foreign dealers can access - is a fraction of the peak 2.5 million barrels a day that Iran sold before the Trump administration announced the re-imposition of sanctions.\n\nEuropean countries, which remain committed to the nuclear deal, have discussed taking measures that would shield European companies from the U.S. sanctions and allow them to keep doing business in Iran. But thus far they have been unable to prevent an exodus of major firms, including Boeing and Airbus, which suspended the aircraft purchases. General Electric, Maersk, Peugeot, Renault, Siemens, and Total have also cancelled business deals in Iran, according to the Washington-based Atlantic Council.\n\nDespite the unraveling of the nuclear deal, Iran is still complying with it, and appears to be waiting out Trump, hoping his successor rejoins the agreement.\n\nIn the meantime, the renewed sanctions risk further undermining Rouhani, a relative moderate, and strengthening hard-liners distrustful of the West, the International Crisis Group said in a report this week.\n\n\u201cThe alternative to both sides taking a step back from the escalatory path is a sanctions regime that penalizes Iran and the Iranian people, but does not enhance peace and security in the region and could well lead to war.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBatrawy reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.", "ODESSA, Fla.

The elections chief for the Arizona county that includes Phoenix is pledging that voters won\u2019t face the same difficulties they experienced in August\u2019s primary when dozens of polling locations opened late. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said this week elections county employees instead of contracted workers will set up the voter check-in machines that were not put in place on time on Aug 28. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s the week before the general election and poll workers for the Arizona county with 2.2 million of the state\u2019s 3.7 million registered voters gathered to train for their mission: Making sure Maricopa County\u2019s August primary nightmare doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nThat\u2019s when dozens of polling stations for the sprawling area that includes Phoenix and its suburbs opened late and people who showed up early to vote couldn\u2019t cast ballots.\n\nA group of about 15 mostly older workers at first appeared dazed and confounded as they received their initial instructions from a county elections trainer on how to work the voter check-in machines, printers and ballot tabulators used at all polling stations. But most quickly got the hang of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d declared Ruthie Jones, who never set up the machines during her previous stint as a temporary elections worker.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Democratic county elections chief, Adrian Fontes, hopes will be the case for the beefed-up roster of 4,000 people he\u2019s assigned to midterm election polling precincts \u2014 to fulfill his pledge that there won\u2019t be a repeat of the primary voting problems.\n\nHe received most of the criticism following the primary debacle, when 62 of the county\u2019s approximately 500 polling stations opened late. It happened two years after Fontes\u2019 predecessor, a Republican, was ousted over her decision to drastically reduce presidential primary polling locations, resulting in extremely long lines.\n\nFontes took heat from the county\u2019s Board of Supervisors for not warning voters ahead of time that some locations might not open on time, and they chided his contingency plan of using 40 vote centers as backup locations for voters whose normal precincts were not operational.\n\nThe polling station troubles served as a reminder that at a time when Russian hacking is a major concern in elections, human or technological errors often lead to voting problems.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, about 120,000 voters were left off the printed voting rolls in June because of a software error. That same month in South Dakota, officials could not get their equipment to connect to the internet, and voters had to cast provisional ballots.\n\nFontes, a former Marine and criminal lawyer, says the criticism of the polling station late openings doesn\u2019t concern him because voter turnout in Maricopa County hit a record high of 31 percent in the primaries and is expected to reach at least 55 percent Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not so worried about the politics of it, because once you look at what actually happened, and you look at the numbers, we\u2019re doing a darned good job over here,\u201d he said.\n\nSome polling stations will be set up Sunday, although most will be on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got multiple layers of redundancy that we\u2019re deploying this time around,\u201d Fontes said.\n\nAn internal audit of the primary election faulted Fontes for not having an efficient system for setting up voting machines and a good enough backup plan for what to do if polling stations did not open. It also said workers did not properly track the lengths of the lines of voters.\n\nAn independent analysis released Friday said there isn\u2019t a high risk that check-in machines will fail. The analysis focused on the county recorder\u2019s office progress on the recommendations made by the internal auditor.\n\nFontes blames himself for hiring a contractor to set up the machines in August that checked in voters at the polls. He has said the contractor did not send enough workers in time for the poll openings, delaying them. The contractor has said it sent more technicians than were required.\n\nFontes said he is not taking any chances by having about 4,000 county workers setting up machines and working at the precincts. The county had roughly 2,400 poll workers in August, although primaries typically have lower turnout than general elections.\n\n\u201cWe may have a little bit of overkill in our staffing. I\u2019d rather have a couple of people standing around for an hour or two than have a contractor not show up at all,\u201d Fontes said.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE- In this Dec. 9, 2017, file photo, Army's Ahmad Bradshaw holds up the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy after Army defeated Navy in an NCAA college football game in Philadelphia.

Army finally broke through for the seventh time last year, first stunning Air Force 21-0 at Falcon Stadium, an embarrassing home loss that snapped a school-record, 306-game scoring streak dating to 1992. The Black Knights then beat Navy by one point to win the trophy for the first time since 1996.\n\nToday, the hardware rests inside the Kimsey Athletic Center at West Point alongside statues of four of the academy\u2019s most renowned football figures: Hall of Fame coach Earl \u201cRed\u201d Blaik and his three Heisman Trophy winners \u2014 Glenn Davis, Felix \u201cDoc\u201d Blanchard and Pete Dawkins.\n\nAir Force (3-5) visits on Saturday, and the Black Knights (6-2) are intent on keeping the trophy right where it is.\n\n??

However it plays out is how it plays out.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons sit on a precarious perch as the season winds down. They need to win three of their final four games to qualify for the postseason, and Michie Stadium has become a difficult place to play \u2014 Army has won 10 straight at home , the last a double-overtime victory over Miami of Ohio two weeks ago. At least the Falcons can take solace in knowing that not only were they the last visitor to win at Michie (31-12 two years ago), they\u2019ve also won 18 of the past 21 games between the teams and are 14-10 on Army\u2019s home turf.\n\n\u201cThis is a championship game for us,\u201d Air Force senior linebacker Brody Bagnall said. \u201cIt kind of brings some life to the meeting rooms.

Hammond has played in five games with two starts but has missed the past two games with an injury. His first career start was against Navy, and he led Air Force to a 35-7 victory a month ago, rushing for three TDs and throwing for 142 yards and another score, so a victory over Army will again give the Falcons possession of the Commander in Chief\u2019s Trophy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the No. 1 priority,\u201d Air Force wide receiver Marcus Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than us.\u201d\n\nNO TURNOVERS, PLEASE\n\nAir Force has lost seven fumbles and suffered two interceptions while Army hasn\u2019t lost a fumble since having two in the season-opener at Duke and has thrown three interceptions. In the last three years, the Black Knights are 12-0 under coach Jeff Monken when they don\u2019t lose the football.\n\n\u201cCoach preaches to us to take care of the ball, keep the offense on the field and the defense off as much as possible,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nDEFENSE RULES\n\nSince both offenses use variations of the option, both defenses are all-too-familiar with the nuances of the ground-oriented attack. Army ranks eighth nationally in rushing defense (96.9 yards per game and 3.97 per carry) while Air Force sits at No. 16 (108.4 and 3.36).\n\nGO FOR IT\n\nArmy leads the nation in converting fourth-down plays, having failed only three times in 29 tries (89.7 percent).

Seth Jones also scored.\n\n\u201cI felt like a part of the team and I did my thing,\u201d Bobrovsky said. \u201cI didn\u2019t try to create too much and I didn\u2019t need that. So I just focused on my things, played my game and just enjoyed, had fun.\u201d\n\nIt was San Jose\u2019s first regulation loss since Oct. 14 at New Jersey. The Sharks were 4-0-2 in their last six games since dropping three of four during a road trip.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough to win the game,\u201d coach Peter DeBoer said. \u201cWe were doing enough to hope to win.

A lot of our offense comes from being above the puck and in transition we stop teams before they get to our blue line, because we have back pressure.\u201d\n\nDell made 23 saves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is spreading misleading rhetoric about the nature of Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border and grossly inflating the number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nIn a speech Thursday, he suggested without evidence that the migrant caravans are full of hardened criminals; in fact, they are mostly poor people with few belongings who are fleeing gang violence.\n\nIn stressing that his administration will not allow a \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy, Trump also claimed this week that 25 million to 30 million immigrants now live in the country illegally because previous administrations had \u201creleased\u201d immigrants in the U.S. after they had been caught crossing the border as they awaited immigration hearings.\n\nHe\u2019s wrong. Independent estimates put the number of people in the U.S. illegally at less than half that amount.\n\nA look at his various claims on immigration:\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He suggests without evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a fact sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, President Barack Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. The so-called zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s homeland security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAsylum is not a program for those living in poverty.\u201d \u2014 speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s largely right. Poverty may play a role in the complex decision process granting asylum, but the status is reserved for people who have a justifiable fear of persecution in their own country based on factors such as their race, religion or political views. According to the Homeland Security Department, about 20 percent of claimants are granted asylum. Currently, there is a backlog of about 700,000 cases, and it can take years for claims to get resolved.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases.

Both major parties are worrying about so-called \u201cspoilers\u201d as election day nears. In tight races, third party candidates can make the difference by drawing away voters who\u2019d otherwise support the Democrat or Republican. (AP Photo/Bob Christie)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Two congresswomen running for U.S Senate in Arizona are crisscrossing the state, raising millions of dollars and trying to exploit every possible advantage to eke out a win in what both sides expect to be a photo-finish race.\n\nThe wild card: Angela Green, a Green Party candidate who could win votes that might have gone to Democrat Krysten Sinema, clearing a path to victory for Republican Martha McSally.\n\nBut on Thursday, Green suddenly announced she would drop out of the race and endorsed Sinema.\n\n\u201cAfter watching the debates and seeing everything, Sinema\u2019s stance on a lot of things are very close to mine,\u201d Green said in an interview with Channel 12 news in Phoenix.\n\nThe about face demonstrates the significance third party candidates are playing as Election Day nears and key races tighten across the country. There\u2019s a fear that these candidates could become \u201cspoilers\u201d by peeling off just enough support to let the other major party win. Democrats are especially sensitive to the issue after Green Party and Libertarian presidential candidates drew about 5 percent of the popular vote in 2016, the year that Hillary Clinton narrowly lost the presidency to Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWhen a race is close everything matters -- every demographic group, the number of candidates on the ballot,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, a nonpartisan analyst for Inside Elections. But, he added, that doesn\u2019t mean third party candidates will inevitably tip a close race. \u201cWe have to be a bit more nuanced.\u201d\n\nThird party candidates tend to poll better than they actually perform on Election Day, when voters tend to revert to the two major parties. And some who cast ballots for third party candidates may not otherwise show up to the polls, so it\u2019s misleading to presume that every vote for an outside candidate is a vote stolen from a major party.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s a fear present on both sides of the aisle. The biggest impact this cycle may be in Kansas, where Democrats fear businessman and independent gubernatorial candidate Greg Orman, who has notched up to 10 percent support in polls.\n\nKansas Democrats worry Orman will help Republican Kris Kobach, the chair of Trump\u2019s disbanded voter fraud commission, win the governor\u2019s race. On Monday, Orman\u2019s treasurer, Republican Tim Owens, quit the campaign because he feared Orman was putting at risk the campaign of Democrat Laura Kelly.\n\n\u201cI wish Tim well, but have told him that my campaign is about the people of Kansas, not about establishment figures in Topeka,\u201d Orman said, referring to the state capitol.\n\nIn Georgia, a Libertarian candidate could force one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched governor\u2019s races into a December runoff.\n\nAnd in Montana, Sen. Jon Tester has repeatedly won campaigns with less than 50 percent of the vote with a Libertarian candidate on the ballot. This week, an anonymous mailer circulated attacking Tester\u2019s Republican challenger, Matt Rosendale, and urging a vote for Libertarian Rick Breckenridge.\n\nIn response, on Wednesday, Breckenridge said he was endorsing Rosendale. \u201cMatt has the character to combat this, not Jon Tester,\u201d Breckenridge said in an interview.\n\nThe Montana mailer and endorsement come after an anonymous donor earlier this year bankrolled a drive by a firm that normally works for Republicans to collect 5,000 signatures to place a Green Party candidate on the Senate ballot. Secretary of State Corey Stapleton, a Republican, put the candidate on the ballot but Montana Democrats successfully sued to overturn it.\n\nIn Indiana, similar mailers have circulated attacking Republican Mike Braun and promoting the candidacy of Libertarian Lucy Brenton, who openly says she wants to play the role of spoiler. She garnered 5 percent of the vote in a 2016 race and has been onstage in debates that also include Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly and Braun. It\u2019s unclear which of the two major party candidates is threatened more by her pro-gay rights, pro-marijuana legalization, anti-tax platform.\n\n\u201cDo I intend to spoil the election for them? Absolutely. And here\u2019s why: something doesn\u2019t spoil unless it\u2019s rotten,\u201d Brenton said Tuesday after a debate in Indianapolis. \u201cAnd the two-party system that has had a stranglehold on our country is absolutely rotten.\u201d\n\nNevada has another option \u2014 voters can select \u201cnone of these candidates.\u201d That helped Sen. Dean Heller win re-election in 2012. Even as then-President Barack Obama handily won the state, Heller was re-elected by an 11,000-vote margin \u2014 a total of 46 percent of the vote. That\u2019s because 44,000 voters chose \u201cnone of these candidates\u201d rather than Heller or his Democratic opponent Rep. Shelley Berkley, who faced a congressional ethics investigation during the race.\n\nHeller is trying to replicate that strategy as he faces another tough race this year against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Some Republicans think the none of the above option gives Heller a better chance than the Republican running for governor, Adam Laxalt. That\u2019s because there\u2019s an independent candidate in the race who could spoil it for Laxalt -- Ryan Bundy, the elder son of a rancher who became notorious for his armed standoff with federal agents in 2014.\n\nPolitical maneuverings also helped shape Arizona\u2019s ballot. In 2012, Republican Jeff Flake won a U.S. Senate election there by 3.5 percentage points while a Libertarian candidate garnered 4 percentage points. The Republican state legislature complained Libertarians were siphoning GOP votes and increased the number of signatures the party needed to qualify a candidate for the ballot. There was no similar requirement for the Green Party.\n\nGreen\u2019s announcement Thursday that she was suspending her campaign may have relatively little impact. More than 60 percent of expected voters have already cast their ballots early, as is traditional in the heavily vote-by-mail state, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s office. And Green\u2019s name will remain on the ballot for those who haven\u2019t made a decision.\n\nMcSally\u2019s campaign unsuccessfully pushed to have Green included in the Senate race debate, and some Republicans hold out hope she can chisel off enough supporters from Sinema to put their candidate over the edge. A recent poll from Marist-NBC News, for example, had Sinema leading McSally by 6 percentage points when Green was omitted but only by 3 points when the third party option was included.\n\nStill, others are skeptical Green will affect the race one way or the other. She raised less than $1500 and had little campaign presence while running a business selling organic goods and hemp clothing.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I think the real narrative here is who\u2019s able to appeal to independent, unaffiliated and Republican women,\u201d said Paul Bentz, a GOP strategist in Phoenix. \u201cThey\u2019ll make the difference here.\u201d\n\nAs recently as last week, Green said she while didn\u2019t support McSally or Trump, she didn\u2019t think she should be held responsible if her candidacy lost the election for Sinema.\n\n\u201cI will not be responsible for who wins this race,\u201d Green said in an interview then. \u201cSo I need to let people to know that is not why I came into this race. I came into it for the people, not the politics.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Slodysko in Indianapolis and Matt Volz in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Wayne Rooney was stopped on a shootout attempt in his MLS playoff debut, Nick DeLeon skied D.C.

But Trump offered few details on how exactly he planned to overhaul an asylum system he claimed was plagued by \u201cendemic abuse\u201d that he said \u201cmakes a mockery of our immigration system.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he told the U.S. military mobilizing at the Southwest border that if migrants try to throw rocks at them, the troops should act as though the rocks are \"firearms.\" (Nov. 1)\n\nU.S. immigration laws make clear that migrants seeking asylum may do so either at or between border crossings. But Trump said he would limit that to official crossing points. The U.S. also doesn\u2019t have space at the border to manage the large-scale detention of migrants, with most facilities at capacity. Trump said the government would erect \u201cmassive tents\u201d instead.\n\nHis announcement marked Trump\u2019s latest attempt to keep the issue of immigration front-and-center in the final stretch before next Tuesday\u2019s elections . Trump has spent the waning days of the campaign hammering the issue at every occasion as he tries to energize Republican voters using the same playbook that helped him win in 2016. In addition to deploying the military to the southern border to stave off the caravan, Trump announced plans to try to end the constitutionally-protected right of birthright citizenship for all children born in the U.S.\n\nHe brought up immigration issues several times during a political rally Thursday night in Columbia, Missouri. He railed against \u201cbirth tourism,\u201d where mothers from abroad travel to America to have babies so they will automatically be U.S. citizens. And he denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d where these new citizens then bring in their extended families into the country.\n\n\u201cYou come into the country \u2014 you\u2019re like two months old ... and you\u2019re gonna bring \u2019em all \u2014 your aunts and uncles and grandfathers and lots of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president announced Wednesday that he was considering deploying up to 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border in response to the caravans \u2014 roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission that has been criticized as unnecessary, considering the caravans remain hundreds of miles away.\n\nTrump said Thursday he was \u201cnot going to put up with\u201d any sort of violence directed at those U.S. forces, warning the military would fight back. \u201cWhen they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe exact rules for the use of force by military police and other soldiers who will be operating near the border have not been disclosed, but in all cases troops have the right of self-defense.\n\nStill, Mark Hertling, a retired Army general, wrote on Twitter after Trump\u2019s speech that no military officer would allow a soldier to shoot an individual throwing a rock. \u201cIt would be an unlawful order,\u201d he wrote, citing the Law of Land Warfare.\n\nTrump said Thursday that, under his order, any migrants who do enter the country would be housed in \u201cmassive tent cities\u201d he plans to build while their cases are processed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to catch, we\u2019re not going to release,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder current protocol, many asylum seekers are released while their cases make their way through backlogged courts \u2014 a process that can take years.\n\nCritics said the speech seemed mostly designed to scare, with no specifics on what mechanisms Trump intended to use to push through his desired changes. Administration officials have told The Associated Press that Trump intends to invoke the same authority he used to push through his travel ban, but it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s what he was doing with Thursday\u2019s speech.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really trying to scare the American public into thinking these are thousands of dangerous thugs,\u201d said Greg Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s a classic strategy that goes back to 19th century nativist thinking.\u201d\n\nTrump and other administration officials have long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged. Immigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people generally waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego\u2019s main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Administration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nThe U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nBut it remains unclear how many people currently en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border.\n\nThere are currently four caravans. The main group of about 4,000 migrants \u2014 down from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 \u2014 remains in southern Mexico, hundreds of miles from the border. A second, smaller group of 1,000 or so is more than 200 miles behind the first. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador has made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.\n\nSimilar caravans have gathered regularly over the years and have generally dwindled by the time they reach the southern border. And most have passed largely unnoticed.\n\nTrump has nonetheless mounted an enormous show of force in response to their movement \u2014 coinciding with elections that will determine which party controls Congress.\n\nThe first 100 active duty troops arrived at the border in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday \u2014 part of the \u201cmore than 7,000\u201d troops the Pentagon said were being sent to support Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\n\u201cThese illegal caravans will not be allowed into the United States and they should turn back now because they\u2019re wasting their time,\u201d Trump said Thursday.\n\nNotably, he said his executive order would come next week, which means it could be after Election Day.\n\nTrump has rejected the idea he has been \u201cfearmongering\u201d and using the issue for political purposes, but on Thursday he blamed Democrats for the \u201cincompetent, very, very stupid laws that we have.\u201d He noted at one point, \u201cWomen want security.\u201d\n\nTrump also tweeted a video Wednesday alleging, without evidence, that Democrats were responsible for allowing a homicidal immigrant into the U.S. The video was reminiscent of the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, and Zeke Miller and Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n__\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 A Washington state man has pleaded not guilty after he was arrested in connection to a shooting that left one person dead and three others injured at a nightclub in Lakewood.\n\nKOMO-TV reports 30-year-old Monroe Ezell appeared Thursday in Pierce County Superior Court, pleading not guilty to a second-degree murder charge.\n\nEzell was arrested Wednesday by the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force.\n\nEzell told the judge he didn\u2019t do it, saying he didn\u2019t know why he was in court Thursday.

Fortunately for them, it hasn\u2019t cost them the last two times.\n\nNew York gave up a late goal for the third straight game \u2014 this time to Rickard Rakell with 25.3 seconds remaining \u2014 but was able to beat the Anaheim Ducks 3-2 in a shootout Thursday night.\n\nIt was the second shootout victory in three days for the Rangers.\n\nTheir struggles in the last minute began Sunday at Los Angeles when they were unable to clear the puck and Alec Martinez scored with 55 seconds left to hand New York a 4-3 loss.

We did that tonight.\u201d\n\nMats Zuccarello and Mika Zibanejad scored in the shootout for the Rangers, who went 2-2 on a four-game road swing. Alexandar Georgiev made 22 saves and turned away both Ducks attempts in the tiebreaker.\n\nBrett Howden and Kevin Hayes scored in regulation for the Rangers, who improved to 3-0 in shootouts.\n\n\u201cThose are huge points. You look at the end of the year and if you have 13 or 14 losses in an overtime shootout, those are points you are giving up,\u201d said Marc Staal, who had an assist.\n\nJakob Silfverberg also scored for Anaheim, which is 0-5-2 in its last seven games. John Gibson made 28 saves. The Ducks are 1-2 in shootouts.\n\n\u201cThat was the best game we\u2019ve played defensively in a long time. Now it\u2019s a matter of getting the offense clicking and spending more time in the offensive zone,\u201d Silfverberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the result we wanted tonight, but we got a point.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers led most of the way but Rakell tied it with 25.3 seconds remaining in the third period after the Ducks pulled Gibson for an extra skater.\n\nIt marked the 13th time in franchise history that Anaheim has tied a game in the final 30 seconds.\n\nRakell, who has three goals this season, also had an assist. He has seven points in his last eight games (two goals, five assists).\n\nNew York got on the board first when Hayes scored a power-play goal less than two minutes into the second. Ryan Kesler blocked Howden\u2019s shot but Hayes was able to corral the deflection and fire it past Gibson for his third of the season.\n\nAnaheim tied it with its second power-play goal in its last six chances when Silfverberg scored on the rebound of a shot by Rakell that went off Georgiev\u2019s blocker. It was Silfverberg\u2019s fourth of the season, which tied him with Pontus Aberg for the team lead.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Howden was wide open in front and scored his third goal off a pass from Jimmy Vesey. The goal was set up when Staal had the puck near the blue line and found Vesey near the left faceoff circle in the Ducks zone.\n\nRyan Getzlaf had two assists for Anaheim to extend his point streak to four games. He has two goals and five assists during that span.\n\nNOTES: Anaheim right wing Patrick Eaves played for the first time this year following a health scare that cost him much of last season, when he played in only two games. He missed the first three games because of a lower-body injury and then the final 77 due to post-viral syndrome and a shoulder injury. He sat out the first 13 games this season as he was working his way back from shoulder surgery in early March. Eaves skated on the third line. ...

(AP) \u2014 For some biology students at Pittsburg State University, bats are not just a creature that emerges around Halloween time.\n\nIn fact, students under the instruction of assistant biology professor Andrew George have been monitoring bat activity a few times every week since last spring, the Joplin Globe reported.\n\n\u201cBats are amazing animals,\u201d George said. \u201cWe have a lot to learn from bats.\u201d\n\nWith help from a Kansas Department of Wildlife Parks & Tourism grant, George and his students are working to gather baseline data about the federally endangered gray bat population in Pittsburg, which can then be used in the future for further scientific studies.\n\nJosh Holloway, senior biology major at PSU, said he goes to the bats\u2019 roost a little before sunset one or two times a week and films the bat activity with an infrared video camera.\n\n\u201cWe record until we no longer see a significant amount of bat activity,\u201d he said, which usually happens an hour or so after sunset.\n\nThen the students take the film back to their lab in Heckert-Wells Hall, where they play the video in slow motion and count how many bats exit and re-enter the roost, Holloway said. This gives the students an idea of the estimated population at each site.\n\nThe students also use harp traps, which are made of fishing line, to trap the bats and gather further biometric data, said Michael Barnes, PSU graduate student in the biology program.\n\n\u201cWe want to get weights and sizes of the bats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also measure forearm lengths on bats because it can help identify the species. The more data we have, the more accurate we can be.\u201d\n\nTrapping the bats also allows the students to test for white-nose syndrome, Barnes said. A fungal disease that grows on bats while they hibernate, white-nose syndrome was first detected in New York in 2006 and has spread westward since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really devastating to some populations, wiping out entire colonies in the east,\u201d George said. \u201cConservation agencies have been really concerned about it.\u201d\n\nWhite-nose was detected in Kansas for the first time this year, George said. The disease affects bats during the winter when they hibernate, causing them to wake up during hibernation and exhaust their energy storage.\n\nBarnes said they may check bat wings for damage or inspect them under a black light to look for fungus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good information to have,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAny information we can get on endangered species like bats is great information.\u201d\n\nStudents taking part in the study said working with the bats offers hands-on experience that could help them as they go on to look for careers.\n\n\u201cYou have your own responsibilities to manage,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for a student, particularly those that are trying to develop skills later on for a job in the future. Hands-on experience is usually the best teacher.\u201d\n\nHolloway said his main area of interest is actually fish and aquatic biology, but being a part of this project has helped him expand his horizons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have new ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a good experience that an undergraduate could get to work with an endangered species.\u201d\n\nRyan McGinty, sophomore biology major, said he has enjoyed the chance to work on his own independent project within the larger project.\n\n\u201cJust working on projects semi-independently is something I haven\u2019t really done before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a lot of experience.\u201d\n\nFor his project, McGinty is monitoring the data from several temperature loggers he placed in the bats\u2019 roost.\n\n\u201cWe want to make a temperature map of the roost just so we can see if the bats are picking where they\u2019re roosting based on the temperature,\u201d he said.\n\nThis project is particularly beneficial to his students because they have the opportunity to work with professionals in the actual biology field, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is real science,\u201d George said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a canned lab activity or a simulated activity, they\u2019re actually working on real science.\u201d\n\nHaving contact with actual biologists in the field can help students in their search to find a future career, George said.\n\n\u201cSeveral of these students are biology majors and they want to be wildlife biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re out there meeting the people who are going to hire them and getting great hands-on experience.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Joplin (Mo.)

(AP) \u2014 Cat genome sequences don\u2019t just tell us about cats anymore. The work of University of Missouri researchers is unlocking cat genomes so they can help us better understand human diseases.\n\nResearchers from the MU College of Veterinary Medicine are looking at genetic causes for diseases common among cats and other animals, including humans. Finding the genetic root of afflictions such as allergies in cats could help researchers find treatments for allergies in humans, the Columbia Missourian reported.\n\nLeslie Lyons, the Gilbreath-McLorn endowed professor of comparative medicine at MU, has led the 99 Lives Cat Genome Sequencing Initiative since 2013.\n\nThe initiative has been building a database of cat genomes from veterinarians, researchers and cat owners who are curious about their cats\u2019 diseases. Other researchers use the database to look for genetic causes of the health problems.\n\nCats and humans share a lot of common diseases such as allergies, asthma, obesity and diabetes, according to Lyons.\n\nShe studies the polycystic kidney disease, which causes cysts in the kidney. It\u2019s not discussed often, Lyons said, but it\u2019s common in cats, and it\u2019s more common in humans than sickle cell, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy combined.\n\nThe similarity between cat and human genomes means a treatment that works for one could also work for the other. If research showed there was a diet that could be therapeutic for cats with polycystic kidney disease, Lyons said researchers would try the diet on humans.\n\nAlong with common diseases, researchers are also looking into rare genetic health problems.\n\nYoshihiko Yu, a visiting scholar at MU, works in the program researching epilepsy. The program sequenced four cats from the same colony and analyzed them for epilepsy.\n\nIn that colony, many cats from the same family had epilepsy, meaning it should be genetic, Yu said.\n\nGenome sequencing helped narrow down the region where researchers would find traits related to epilepsy, which will be helpful for further research.\n\nCats and larger animals are more useful for the study than smaller ones. It\u2019s difficult to see kidney cystic changes in mice or rats, Lyons said.\n\nThe program also accepts genomes of wild felids, including lions and tigers. 99 Lives works with zoo associations that work to conserve endangered species.\n\nThe Felid Taxon Advisory Group once alerted the program that black-footed cats in zoos around the country were going blind. Lyons and other researchers got involved and found the genetic cause. The first presenting cat was from the Kansas City Zoo \u2014 then other zoos in the U.S. sent in samples of their black-footed cats for screening.\n\nThe result helped prevent inbreeding between two cats, which would have been more likely to reproduce the genetic cause of blindness in their offspring, Lyons said.\n\nReuben Buckley, a postdoctoral fellow, works on storing and interpreting genomic data. Buckley looks for genetic differences between sick cats and healthy cats by studying their DNA sequence.\n\n\u201cBasically, I have to figure out the signal from the noise,\u201d Buckley said.\n\nInstead of skim sequencing, which is a low-resolution analysis of a cat\u2019s genome sequences, 99 Lives does deep sequencing, which requires repeatedly sequencing each cat\u2019s genome for a clearer picture.\n\n\u201cWhen you do deep sequencing, you are very certain that the variations you have identified are true and accurate,\u201d Lyons said.\n\nThe public has shown support for the program by donating through the Mizzou Give Direct crowdfunding portal. Initially, Lyons set $21,000 as the goal of online fundraising. As of October 2018, the program has brought in more than five times that amount.\n\nBecause of the improvement of technology and human medicine, those funds stretch further today than when the program started. In 2013, sequencing a whole genome would cost $7,000. The cost today is $3,000.\n\nFor future research, however, 99 Lives needs to continue raising funds. Lyons said donors can write in how they want the program to use their money.\n\nThe program\u2019s first goal was to sequence 100 cats. They\u2019ve sequenced close to 200, according to Lyons.\n\nThe program cooperates with nearly 40 institutions, comprising over 50 researchers from different countries, including the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Italy, Sweden and Germany.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the more a group can pull together and share their resources together, the more powerful your tools will be,\u201d Lyons said.\n\nAlong with improving treatment of diseases in humans, Lyons said there are two main reasons 99 Lives\u2019 work is important.\n\nThe program reminds people how important pets are in people\u2019s lives, Lyons said. They bring us love, joy and passion. They teach children responsibility. Service animals help people with disabilities.\n\nPlus, as their keepers, humans have responsibility for the animals\u2019 welfare, Lyons said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Columbia Missourian, http://www.columbiamissourian.com", "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 For years, Chelsea and Jacques Smith have been working on a way to achieve their dreams together.\n\nAnd with the purchase of the former Moods building, 816 N. Kansas Ave., they\u2019re doing just that.\n\nJacques Smith is a mixologist who has wanted to open her own bar since moving to Topeka. Her wife, Chelsea, is an artist who loves to paint and see the spark when a budding artist works on their first painting.\n\nTogether, they own and operate Studio 62, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported.\n\nLeaning over the marble bar top, Chelsea Smith explained their business as similar to a paint and sip \u2014 only she whispered the phrase with distaste.\n\n\u201cI hate that term, because we\u2019re so much more than that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted a space for everybody to be able to come in and feel welcome and do art and have fun. But not just painting \u2014 I want this space filled with other kinds of art and music and poetry, writing, and of course a bar so people can get a drink while they\u2019re having fun and listening to music.\u201d\n\nThe Smiths have coined the term \u201cart bar\u201d to better align with their ideas and dreams for the space.\n\nWhen the couple bought the building in August, Chelsea Smith said, she immediately fell in love with it. After closing the deal, they quickly scrambled to open for the First Friday Art Walk two days later.\n\nThe previous owners painted the inside white, with mirrors lining the walls and chandeliers hanging from high ceilings. It\u2019s eclectic and quirky, and it needed passionate people to bring the space back to life.\n\nChelsea and Jacques Smith modified the space to their tastes, adding a bright lime green door and a chalkboard wall along the south side of the room, which is often filled with alcohol suggestions and votes for customers\u2019 favorite drinks.\n\nJacques Smith jokingly called Studio 62 a \u201cbeerocracy,\u201d and said she is open to stocking whatever beverages will help bring in customers.\n\nBefore its current location, Studio 62 shared space with another studio in the arts district. Before that, it was in what is now Halo Room salon in Barrington Village. Chelsea Smith said that because of space confinements and rent changes, they started looking for a space of their own.\n\n\u201cWhen we first opened two years ago in the Barrington Village, we had a bar but didn\u2019t have our liquor license, so it was BYOB,\u201d Chelsea Smith said. \u201cBut we knew that NOTO is where it\u2019s at. The art is here, and since we\u2019ve been here, we\u2019ve been able to get more customers. At the other location we could only fit 10 people.\u201d\n\nThe art bar is different from other studios in that instead of paying for a pre-made design and allotted time slot, Chelsea wants her painters to bring their own ideas to the canvas and take as much time as they need. She is the primary instructor and has no minimum for a class size.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just one person and want to learn, come on in,\u201d she said. \u201cI like to do more of everyone paints what they want to paint and I help step by step. So even if you have no experience, I can still help you. I can draw it out and you can fill it in, and I can really tailor it to what you want.\u201d\n\nPricing is based per canvas and ranges from $8 to $25.\n\nStudio 62 also offers varying types of paint classes. In the warmer months, Jason Riedel, a Topeka graffiti artist, brings his equipment to the studio to teach different spray painting techniques.\n\nIn addition to classes, Chelsea Smith said the space is versatile \u2014 another reason she loved it. She said the space is available for meetings, receptions, anniversary parties and even product-selling parties.\n\nThe art bar is open from noon to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, for private reservations on Sundays and Mondays, and late on Friday nights when there are special events in NOTO.\n\nFor the first Friday in November, the Smiths will host a king and queen drag show party beginning at 9 p.m. Admission costs $5 for people 21 and older and $7 for ages 18 and older.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Topeka (Kan.)

(Alan Berner/The Seattle Times via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Google employees staged a global walkout Thursday to protest the company\u2019s treatment of women, they made themselves the most visible example of a surprising trend: high-paid engineers emerging from their comfortable bubbles to speak out.\n\nFor much of the past two years, elite technology employees have been stirring and in some cases organizing \u2014first in internal workplace meetings and messaging boards, then in signed protest letters and ultimately in company walkouts such as Thursday\u2019s street demonstrations.\n\nAmong the issues they\u2019ve championed: Better handling of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination, opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, and avoiding harmful uses of the products they\u2019re helping to build and sell.\n\n\u201cFor tech workers, I think the dreams about what it means to work in Silicon Valley \u2014 to disrupt, to innovate, to connect people and make the world a better place \u2014 have crashed up against a much bleaker reality,\u201d said Kade Crockford, who tracks how new technology affects civil rights for the ACLU of Massachusetts.\n\nWorker unrest helped scuttle Google\u2019s Maven project to help the U.S. military scan battlefields using drones and artificial intelligence. Workers have also protested Google\u2019s plans to launch a censored search engine in China, and work by Amazon and Microsoft to assist police agencies and federal immigration agents with facial recognition and other tools.\n\nIt is, in many ways, a Revolt of the Haves. One that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago at cheery corporate campuses best known for flexible work schedules, free meals and snacks, and Wi-Fi equipped shuttle buses, where software engineers can earn $125,000 or more right out of school.\n\n\u201cThese people are not easily replaceable and as a result they have a significant amount of power,\u201d Crockford said. Much of their \u201cpolitical awakening,\u201d she said, stems from President Donald Trump\u2019s election, including concerns that his administration will misuse tools built by the tech industry.\n\nMicrosoft executives, who have sought to position their company as a moral leader, have defended the company\u2019s immigration contract despite a protest letter that circulated through the company over the summer and tough questions for CEO Satya Nadella at an employee meeting. \u201cWe don\u2019t see unplugging government agencies in America from email as a step that\u2019s likely to make the country better,\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith said in an interview with the Associated Press earlier this fall.\n\nHundreds of Google workers marched on a mild Thursday in New York to a nearby park to hear speeches, hold signs and show solidarity, joining similar office walkouts from Tokyo to Europe to the San Francisco Bay Area. Signs reading \u201c90 million reasons for change\u201d expressed discontent about a New York Times report that executive Andy Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 after Google concluded that sexual misconduct allegations against him were credible.\n\nOrganizers noted that while many of the protesters are privileged, they walked out in solidarity with contract employees and others with less influence.\n\nWalkout co-organizer Meredith Whittaker, who researches artificial intelligence for Google, said in an interview that workers\u2019 demands for better treatment at the company are intertwined with their larger concerns about a \u201cgeneral abuse of power\u201d that includes how Google\u2019s business ventures affect society.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a pattern of unethical decision-making,\u201d she said.\n\nTom Kochan, professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the protests were a \u201csign of the times,\u201d pointing out that the walkout was globally coordinated.\n\n\u201cWorkers are saying they want a voice over this broad range of issues, not just wages and compensation, but protections against harassment and discrimination and getting rid of sham arbitration agreements they\u2019re forced to sign,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of the size of the protests, there is no way that Google management could have been anything but understanding, he said.\n\nWhile workers at companies from Amazon to Walmart protest all the time, usually over wages, the Google walkout was the \u201cbiggest, broadest and most encompassing of multiple issues that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Kochan said. Which is not to say that it will necessarily lead to lasting change such as unionization or an advisory body of Google employees.\n\nOne reason the protest was so big and well-coordinated, he said, is that Google largely employs white-collar technical and support workers. That\u2019s a more homogenous workforce than, say, Amazon, which employs both high-paid engineers and warehouse and grocery workers who earn much, much less.\n\n\u201cBut I think American management in particular is being sent a message that workers are ready to stand up for their rights and each other in a way we haven\u2019t seen in a long time in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n__\n\nO\u2019Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.", "Pakistani protesters burn a poster image of Christian woman Asia Bibi, who has spent eight-years on death row accused of blasphemy and acquitted by a Supreme Court, in Hyderabad, Pakistan, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018. Bibi plans to leave the country, her family said Thursday, as Islamists mounted rallies demanding Bibi be publicly hanged, and also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi. (AP Photo/Pervez Masih\n\nISLAMABAD (AP) \u2014 The release of a Christian woman in Pakistan, acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, was delayed Friday after authorities agreed to bar her from flying abroad following talks with radical Islamists who want her publicly hanged.\n\nThe agreement between the government and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik party was reached in the city of Lahore where Islamists have been rallying since Wednesday, when the Supreme Court overturned the 2010 conviction of Asia Bibi for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nPakistani authorities will now not allow Bibi to leave the country until the Supreme Court makes a final review of its verdict, said provincial minister Noorul Haq Qadri, according to the agreement.\n\nIt comes a day after Ghulam Mustafa, the lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Bibi, petitioned the Supreme Court requesting the judges review her acquittal. The court has not set a date to take up the petition.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions but court reviews typically take years. Bibi\u2019s ordeal will continue until the review is completed.\n\nThe latest development will likely irk rights groups calling for the release of Bibi, who has spent nine years in jail since her arrest in 2009.

Similar rallies were also held in the northwestern city of Peshawar; there were no reports of violence.\n\nOver 2,000 demonstrators blocked a key road linking Islamabad with the garrison city of Rawalpindi, causing traffic jams. Hundreds also blocked another key motorway, connecting Islamabad with other major cities. No violence was reported during the rallies.\n\nEarlier, Pakistan shut down schools and colleges after radical cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, announced that \u201ctalks\u201d between his deputies and the government about Bibi\u2019s fate had failed.\n\nBefore dawn Friday, Rizvi had told an emotionally charged rally in the eastern city of Lahore that one of the government negotiators threatened his deputies during the talks that security forces will ruthlessly kill them if they did not disperse peacefully. He asked his supporters to continue sit-ins as authorities summoned paramilitary troops to restore order.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to die to show our love for the prophet,\u201d he said.\n\nRizvi\u2019s envoys had demanded that Bibi be barred from leaving the country but Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry initially rejected the demand, saying the government will not accept any dictates.\n\nInterior Minister Sheharyar Afridi said Friday that officials were trying to persuade Islamists to disperse their rallies peacefully.\n\nAuthorities also stepped up security near an undisclosed detention facility where Bibi is being held for her safety.\n\nOn Thursday, prison officials said two inmates were arrested last month for planning to strangle Bibi to death. They said the men were still being questioned.\n\nBibi\u2019s family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they could fly out of Pakistan. Though the family has not disclosed the country of her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum.\n\nIslamabad authorities suspended mobile phone services in the city for ten hours on Friday, likely to prevent the crowds from swelling further in the Pakistani capital.\n\nBibi\u2019s acquittal has posed a challenge to the government of Pakistan\u2019s new prime minister, Imran Khan, who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda.\n\nKhan condemned the Islamists on Wednesday after cleric Afzal Qadri urged supporters to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi, revolt against army chief Gen.

Give credit to them, but we definitely had a hand in letting them come back,\u201d said Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, who was held off the scoresheet and ended up minus-3.\n\nTrailing 4-1 after two periods, Calgary began its comeback 47 seconds into the third on Lindholm\u2019s power-play goal, his team-leading ninth goal of the season.\n\nThe man advantage was the result of a charging major on Ian Cole late in the second period after his heavy hit crumpled Mark Jankowski as he was looking back for a pass. Shaken up, Jankowski went to the dressing room.\n\nHe returned to sit on the bench in the third, but did not play. After the game, he was deemed healthy.\n\nIt was the response to the hit from Sam Bennett, who immediately fought Cole, that players pointed to as the turning point.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a feisty little kid. He definitely knows how to throw them,\u201d Backlund said. \u201cThat gave the team some momentum and some energy. Great job by him stepping up for the team and for Janko. It brought a lot of energy into the room going into the third.\u201d\n\nThe Flames drew within one at 5:21 when Monahan deflected Noah Hanifin\u2019s point shot.\n\nThe Saddledome crowd then roared at 10:52 when Neal got the puck in the slot and ripped a shot past Varlamov for his third goal and a tie game.\n\n\u201cIt felt good, obviously, for me,\u201d said Neal, who had been off to a slow start with just two goals in his first 13 games. \u201cPersonally, I want to score goals, you want to help the team win.

The new caravan tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing. The Salvadorans expressed misgivings that they would be deported, so they turned around and waded across a shallow stretch of the river to enter Mexico. (AP Photo/Diana Ulloa)\n\nDONAJI, Mexico (AP) \u2014 After three grueling weeks walking along highways and hitching rides, thousands of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan through southern Mexico were told Friday that they would soon be leapfrogging ahead to the nation\u2019s capital in buses only to have their hopes dashed almost immediately when the offer was pulled.\n\nAs the caravan crossed into the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes announced that authorities there would be providing not only humanitarian assistance but also offering mass transportation for the migrants.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that they be able to move soon from Veracruz toward another place,\u201d Yunes said in a video message released in the evening. \u201cFor that reason, we also offered them transportation so that, if possible, tomorrow ... they may be able to go to Mexico City or to the place they wish.\u201d\n\nDuring an evening assembly, caravan organizers told the migrants that they would be leaving around 5 a.m. for the capital in dozens of buses, apparently enough to accommodate the several thousand people in the group.\n\n\u201cWe are all going!\u201d one the coordinators told the group.\n\nBut then Yunes released a second video saying that because Mexico City\u2019s water system was undergoing maintenance and much of the city would be without water over the weekend, it would not be correct to send the migrants there.\n\nJoel Eduardo Espinar is determined to continue the arduous trek with his family.\n\nInstead he offered to take the migrants to another city in Veracruz until the problem in Mexico City is resolved.\n\n\u201cI want to offer the migrants that while this problem is being resolved they accept my invitation to go to a city in Veracruz\u201d that has the conditions to host them, he said.\n\nMigrants expressed surprise and disappointment at the decision.\n\nThe offer of buses to Mexico City and the subsequent reversal came after the migrants\u2019 request for buses to the capital were ignored by the Mexican government days earlier when they were in Juchitan, Oaxaca state.\n\nEarlier in the day, a third caravan of migrants \u2014 this time from El Salvador \u2014 waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico on Friday, bringing another 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThe third caravan tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told those traveling in it they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nThe Salvadorans expressed misgivings that they would be deported, so they turned around and waded across a shallow stretch of the river to enter Mexico.\n\nAlthough police were present, they did not try to physically stop the migrants, who later walked along a highway toward the nearest large city, Tapachula.\n\nMexico is now faced with the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched out over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highways in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, with a total of about 6,000 migrants. The first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nThough the first caravan once numbered as many as 7,000, it has shrunk significantly. It has been hard to know their exact numbers as people scatter across highways and in small towns. Mexico\u2019s Interior Department estimated that, as of Friday, it numbered only 3,000 people. Other estimates had it around 4,000 or more.\n\nThe second caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Mapastepec, Chiapas. The second group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans. In addition, the government identified a fourth, smaller group of 300 Central American migrants walking further ahead, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.\n\nIt remained unclear how many migrants would make it; 20 days of scorching heat, constant walking, chills, rain and illness had taken their toll. Mexico\u2019s Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico; hundreds more have returned home.\n\nHonduran migrant Saul Guzman, 48, spent the night under a tin roof in the Oaxaca state town of Matias Romero with his son Dannys, 12, before setting out for the town of Donaji, 30 miles (47 kilometers) north.\n\n\u201cI have been through a lot,\u201d said Guzman. \u201cI want to spend my time differently, not in poverty.\u201d\n\nIn his hometown of Ocotepeque, Honduras, he left behind a coffin, either for his mother, who suffers dementia, \u201cor for me, if I don\u2019t make it,\u201d Guzman said.\n\nThe migrants made a grueling 40-mile (65-kilometer) trek from Juchitan, Oaxaca, on Thursday, after they failed to get the bus transportation they had hoped for. Hitching rides on Friday allowed them to arrive early at their destination for the day, Donaji, and some headed to a town even farther north, Sayula.\n\nAnother large caravan early this year passed through Veracruz but then veered back toward Mexico City and eventually tried to head to Tijuana in the far northwest. Few made it.\n\nImmigration agents and police have been nibbling at the edges of the first two caravans.\n\nA federal official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said 153 migrants in the second caravan were detained Wednesday during highway inspections in Chiapas, a short distance from the Guatemalan border.\n\nThere has also been pressure on the first caravan. Federal police began pulling freight trucks over and forcing migrants off, saying their habit of clinging to the tops or sides of the trucks was dangerous.\n\nAt other points along the route, police have forced overloaded pickups to drop off migrants. On previous days, they have ordered passenger vans to stop helping with transportation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans of migrants. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nTrump says has told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \u201crifles.\u201d He also plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\nThough some migrants clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, they have repeatedly denied coming with any ill intentions, saying they\u2019re fleeing poverty and violence.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t killers,\u201d said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the first caravan.\n\nSimilar caravans have occurred regularly over the years and passed largely unnoticed, but Trump has focused on the latest marchers seeking to make border security a hot-button issue in next week\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (AP) \u2014 On the 15th day of their journey, Joel Eduardo Espinar and his family were hurting.

A Guatemalan immigration official gave them an Ozark Trail tent to get out of the rain. It would become their home for the next two weeks when they would pitch it in the plazas of Mexican towns that welcomed a caravan that had grown to several thousand as they inched forward.\n\nThey tossed everything they had packed from home because the items were too wet to carry, but people along their route gave them new clothes, backpacks, strollers, plastic sandals and a green ball that Jason kicked as they walked.\n\nBut the walking was tough. Seven hours one day. Five hours the next. They slept only a few hours, rising well before dawn to beat the heat.\n\nOn Day 15, after missing most of the caravan, they set out on foot again along the moonlight route shortly after 3 a.m.\n\nBy 7 a.m., after four hours of walking, they reached a Mexican immigration checkpoint and stopped to rest. The temperature was already reaching 80 degrees. Hundreds of the migrants were lined up for bags of water and sandwiches being handed out by locals wanting to help.\n\nOthers were jumping on trucks that offered rides. Yamilet decided there was no way to make it on foot. She found a cargo truck where the migrants helped load the strollers \u2014 one with Eduardo still in it \u2014 and the two other children. They huddled in the back with more than hundred people. The driver left the back door open, so they wouldn\u2019t suffocate.\n\nAfter two hours, they were dropped off in the outskirts of Arriaga. And an hour later, they walked into the main plaza. They used their two strollers to stake out a tiny spot on the artificial turf of a playground to pitch their tent and collapsed in the 104-degree heat.

Yamilet\u2019s elder daughters, ages 16 and 18, had refused to join them. They were left with Espinar\u2019s parents.\n\nEspinar broke down crying when he hugged his mother goodbye. Three years before, he had confronted his alcoholism with her help; now he was leaving her behind.\n\nShe assured him he was doing the right thing.

His brother had paid a smuggler $6,500 to get to the U.S. border eight months ago and he knew he would never have that much money. Nor could he risk taking them alone.\n\nThe brother, Byron, now in Florida, urged him to take the rare opportunity.\n\nWithin hours of hearing the news, Espinar bought five bus tickets to Santa Rosa de Coapan.

Facing a blizzard of trade complaints, China is throwing an \"open for business\" import fair hosted by President Xi Jinping to rebrand itself as a welcoming market and positive global force. (Chinatopix via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Facing a blizzard of trade complaints, China is throwing an \u201copen for business\u201d import fair hosted by President Xi Jinping to rebrand itself as a welcoming market and positive global force.\n\nMore than 3,000 companies from 130 countries selling everything from Egyptian dates to factory machinery are attending the China International Import Expo, opening Monday in the commercial hub of Shanghai. Its VIP guest list includes prime ministers and other leaders from Russia, Pakistan and Vietnam.\n\nThe United States, fighting a tariff war with Beijing, has no plans to send a high-level envoy.\n\nXi\u2019s government is emphasizing the promise of China\u2019s growing consumer market to help defuse complaints Beijing abuses the global trading system by reneging on promises to open its industries.\n\n\u201cThis says, look, we\u2019re not a global parasite that is creating massive deficits, we are buying goods,\u201d said Kerry Brown, a Chinese politics specialist at King\u2019s College London.\n\nThe event also is part of efforts to develop a trading network centered on China and increase its influence in a Western-dominated global system.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his \u201cAmerican first\u201d trade policies that threaten to raise import barriers to the world\u2019s biggest consumer market loom in the background.\n\nExporters, especially developing countries, want closer relations with China to help \u201cinsulate themselves from what is happening with Trump and the U.S.,\u201d said Gareth Leather of Capital Economics.\n\nChina has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports, which rose 15.9 percent in 2017 to $1.8 trillion. But none address the U.S. complaints about its technology policy that prompted Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American imports.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields, ambitions that some American officials worry will undermine U.S. industrial leadership.\n\nTo keep the economy growing, China needs to nurture its consumer market and that requires more imports.\n\nBut foreign companies say regulators are still trying to squeeze them out of promising industries and that they face pressure to hand over technology.\n\nThe Shanghai expo \u201cwill be of little consequence to U.S. and other companies unless its pageantry is matched by meaningful and measurable changes in China trade practices,\u201d Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in an email.\n\nSome companies might get a brief sales boost, \u201cbut its long-run impact will be defined by China\u2019s willingness to end many of its unfair trade practices,\u201d said Jarrett.\n\nEurope, Japan and other trading partners have been leery of Trump\u2019s tactics but echo U.S. complaints.\n\nThey say Beijing improperly hampers access to finance, logistics and other service industries. European leaders are frustrated that Beijing bars foreign acquisitions of most assets while its own companies are on a global buying spree.\n\nWriting in a Chinese business magazine, the French and German ambassadors to Beijing appealed for changes including an end to requirements that foreign companies operate in joint ventures with state-owned partners. They called for an overhaul of rules they say hinder companies from profiting from and protecting their technology.\n\n\u201cWe encourage China to address these issues through concrete and systematic measures that go beyond tariff adjustments,\u201d Ambassadors Jean-Maurice Ripert of France and Clemens von Goetze of Germany wrote in the magazine Caixin.\n\nChina already is the No. 1 trading partner for all its Asian neighbors, though a big share of the iron ore, industrial components and other goods it buys are turned into smartphones, TV sets and other goods for export.\n\nTariff cuts announced over the past year were aimed at giving Chinese consumers better access to foreign goods. Chinese leaders emphasize those include anti-cancer drugs and other medical products. But many are specialty goods such as high-end baby strollers, avocados and mineral water that don\u2019t compete with Chinese suppliers.\n\nThe Shanghai expo also gives Beijing a chance to repair its image following complaints about its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe.\n\nGovernments including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have scrapped or scaled back projects due to high costs or complaints too little work goes to local companies. Sri Lanka, Kenya and other nations have run into trouble repaying Chinese loans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become too associated with debt and China getting what it wants,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThey are trying to get out this more positive message that China is open for business.\u201d\n\n___\n\nChina International Import Expo: https://www.ciie.org/zbh/en/", "$8 million to help workers, companies, affected by opioids\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio is spending $8 million over the next two years to help employers and unemployed workers overcome problems related to opioid addiction.\n\nThe Department of Job and Family Services says the agency will use federal Labor Department dollars to help companies that hire people recovering from addiction.\n\nThe grant will also create an addiction services apprenticeship at community colleges and provide job training and other services to help unemployed workers overcome addictions and find jobs.\n\nThe money goes to employers and unemployed workers in 16 counties: Adams, Brown, Butler, Clark, Clermont, Clinton, Fayette, Hamilton, Lawrence, Mahoning, Montgomery, Pike, Preble, Ross, Scioto and Trumbull counties.\n\nA record 4,854 people died last year in Ohio from unintended heroin, fentanyl and painkiller overdoses.

Not bad for a player whose previous NHL experience consisted of four games for the New York Islanders during the 2010-2011 season.\n\nAfter playing primarily in the KHL, Koskinen signed with Edmonton as a free agent this summer.

He hasn\u2019t played much, but he was able to stay confident. It\u2019s pretty impressive to see him come out with two performances like that.\u201d\n\nKoskinen said he always wanted to come back to the NHL and prove himself.\n\n\u201cIt was always on my mind,\u201d the 6-foot-7 goaltender said. \u201cI had opportunities, like, three, four years ago, but I always decided to stay.

Caggiula showed some deft hands in front, spinning around and then shoveling home his third of the season while being knocked to his knees from behind.\n\nKoskinen made some exceptional stops to keep Edmonton in front, denying Toews on a short-handed breakaway with six minutes left in the middle period, and then Alex DeBrincat in tight later on during the same sloppy Oilers power play.\n\nEdmonton went up 2-0 with 37 seconds left in the second. Garrison scored on the power play for his first goal with the Oilers.\n\nEdmonton added to its lead with a short-handed tally in the third. Jujhar Khaira did a good job to get it to Caggiula, who froze Ward on a deke before scoring at 6:49.\n\nEdmonton got another midway through the third when Chiasson scored his fifth goal in his last six games.\n\nNOTES: It was the second of three meetings between the teams this season.

(Thomas Peter/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Seeking to maintain equilibrium in a relationship that strongly affects Asian security, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday that China considers its neighbor a \u201cdiplomatic priority.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s growing fiscal crisis has raised questions about its ability to repay Chinese loans granted as part of Xi\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative.\n\nPakistan has taken out billions of dollars in loans from China in recent years for infrastructure projects, the terms of which remain largely undisclosed. China has pledged a total of more than $60 billion to Pakistan in the form of loans and investments for roads, ports, power plants and industrial parks.\n\nIn response to the debt crisis, Pakistan is seeking an emergency bailout loan of $8 billion from the International Monetary Fund, which plans to send a team to Pakistan to assess the situation. It is also seeking new loans from Saudi Arabia and China. Discussions of the new funding were expected to dominate Khan\u2019s visit.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the United States, which strongly influences the IMF, has said it will not finance the repayment of Pakistan\u2019s Chinese loans.\n\nPakistan\u2019s government has \u201cinherited a very difficult economic situation,\u201d Khan told Xi. \u201cUnfortunately our country is going through a low point at the moment with two very big deficits, a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit.\u201d\n\nXi sought to dispel concerns in his opening remarks, referring to the decades of warm ties between the two countries.\n\n\u201cChina has always placed Pakistan as a diplomatic priority for China, supported Pakistan\u2019s safeguarding of national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and supported the new Pakistani government\u2019s smooth running of the government and advancement of national construction,\u201d Xi said.\n\nKhan is scheduled to meet with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday, after which the two leaders will oversee the signing of a series of agreements, possibly including new loans.\n\nChina and Pakistan refer to themselves as \u201call-weather friends,\u201d united in their rivalry against mutual neighbor India and entwined in a web of military, political and economic links. Pakistan has been among the most enthusiastic supporters of the trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative, which seeks to re-establish China\u2019s former role as the Asian center of global trade by binding it to Europe, African, Southeast Asia and elsewhere through Chinese-financed projects.\n\nHowever, the fiscal crisis has put Khan\u2019s administration under early pressure, sparking public anger over the rising prices of basic goods. Khan had initially vowed to curb borrowing, but has proceeded with projects such as one to build 5 million public housing units and has predicted that Pakistan would soon overcome its economic woes.\n\nAs an opposition politician, the former cricket star had questioned whether the partnership with China benefited Pakistan and promised the contracts would be made public.\n\nWhile that has yet to happen, the two sides have begun reassessing some aspects of the Pakistan section of Belt and Road, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, including scaling back the development of Pakistan\u2019s Arabian Sea port of Gwadar. Agreements with Chinese power companies to supply much-needed electricity to energy-starved Pakistan have also been loudly criticized over the revolving debt costs to Pakistan.\n\nOther countries, including Malaysia, have also pulled back on Chinese-funded projects related to the Belt and Road initiative, and much concern has been raised over the case of Sri Lanka. That Indian Ocean island nation\u2019s government borrowed billions from China to build a port and airport, but when it was unable to make payments, signed an agreement giving a Chinese company an 80 percent stake and a 99-year lease on the failing port.\n\nSince taking office, Khan has softened his criticisms of the Chinese-backed projects and Finance Minister Asad Umar has said a review of contracts signed by the previous government has so far turned up no irregularities.\n\nPakistan has said the project isn\u2019t a major contributor to the country\u2019s\u2019 debt or a cause of the \u201cfinancial difficulties it faces currently faces,\u201d Lu said, adding that discussions will focus on \u201chow to better drive forward with the building of the project.\u201d", "FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2017, file photo, Chinese President Xi Jinping walks with U.S. President Donald Trump after attending a business event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

The second-year target\u2019s presence would be a boon for quarterback Jared Goff, who found Kupp for a team-leading 869 yards receiving last season. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Cooper Kupp returned to practice with the Los Angeles Rams on Thursday, less than three weeks after the receiver injured his knee.\n\nWhile Kupp is still uncertain whether he\u2019ll play Sunday, the second-year pro is grateful to be anywhere near the field this quickly, since he also incurred a concussion one week before he was carted off the turf in Denver with that knee injury.\n\n\u201cIt could have been worse,\u201d Kupp said. \u201cGuys in this league go through a lot worse. It\u2019s football. You know these things are going to happen. At some point, everyone goes through some kind of injury if you play this game long enough. Hopefully you\u2019ll just move through this thing and work through it and get back out there playing the game I love.\u201d\n\nKupp hopes to be in uniform when the Rams (8-0) visit the New Orleans Saints (6-1) in a tantalizing midseason NFC showdown, and coach Sean McVay expected to have LA\u2019s full complement of receivers at Jared Goff\u2019s disposal in what could be a high-scoring showdown with Drew Brees and coach Sean Payton.\n\nKupp was hurt by a horse-collar tackle from the Broncos\u2019 Darian Stewart. One week earlier, he left a game in Seattle after taking a head hit.\n\nThe dual experiences were a challenge for a receiver who never missed significant playing time in college at Eastern Washington or during his outstanding rookie season, when he led Los Angeles with 869 yards receiving and formed a tight bond with Goff.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that goes through my head as soon as it happens is, \u2018I\u2019m letting these guys down by not being able to be out there and compete,\u2019\u201d Kupp said. \u201cYou put so much time and effort into getting your body ready to play, and then when you\u2019re not able to because your body is not allowing you to, you feel like, \u2018What else could I have done to prevent this from happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nA receiver can\u2019t do much about a horse-collar tackle from behind, and the injury was alarming to his teammates.\n\n\u201cI think the knee one was definitely scary to see,\u201d Goff said. \u201cYou see those happen all the time, and usually they\u2019re not very good. Whenever someone gets carted off like that, usually it doesn\u2019t end up very good. I think he\u2019s recovered really quickly.\u201d\n\nKupp had 30 catches for 438 yards and five touchdowns in the Rams\u2019 first five games this season. During his absence from most of the past three games, Los Angeles relied on second-year pro Josh Reynolds to fill Kupp\u2019s usual spot in the Rams\u2019 wideout trio of Robert Woods, Brandin Cooks and Kupp.\n\nReynolds had only seven catches in the last four games, but two went for touchdowns in last week\u2019s 29-27 win over Green Bay. McVay loves to use his top three receivers in multiple roles with minimal substitutions, so Reynolds\u2019 ability to fill in for Kupp was vital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great group of three,\u201d McVay said. \u201cBut I think what\u2019s been great, if you\u2019re going to try to spin a positive on Cooper being out, is it\u2019s given us a chance to see what we believed in Josh Reynolds, and that he\u2019s a starting-caliber receiver, certainly isn\u2019t too big for him.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2019 passing balance has been a major asset in their unbeaten start. Woods (672 yards receiving) and Cooks (643 yards receiving) are both on pace for 1,000-yard seasons, while running back Todd Gurley is a major factor in the passing game again with 30 catches for 351 yards.\n\n\u201cThose three are very good receivers that can do everything,\u201d McVay said of Woods, Cooks and Kupp. \u201cI think their skill sets complement each other really well.\u201d\n\nNOTES: CB Sam Shields missed practice Thursday with an illness. ... LB Trevon Young returned to full participation in practice. ... Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips jokingly referred to this weekend\u2019s trip to New Orleans as \u201canother revenge game for me.\u201d Phillips was the Saints\u2019 38-year-old interim coach for four games in 1985, the first of his six stints as an NFL head coach. \u201cThen they shipped me out of there, so I\u2019m still mad at them,\u201d Phillips said laughingly. ... Dante Fowler said his first full practice with the Rams went well, and he is optimistic about being able to contribute Sunday if the Rams put him on the field.

A House controlled by Democrats might investigate Trump\u2019s North Korea policies and demand more information about the North\u2019s nuclear program and motivations.\n\nTrump is already showing signs of slowing the pace of his diplomacy with North Korea, and anything short of a huge Republican victory could force him to pivot closer to the party\u2019s mainstream on North Korea issues, said Du Hyeogn Cha, a visiting scholar at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy.\n\nWhile Trump continues to issue bullish predictions about his North Korea policy, he recently said he won\u2019t play a \u201ctime game\u201d with the North over a denuclearization deal, and his national security adviser, John Bolton, said a second summit with Kim would be pushed back to 2019.\n\n\u201cTrump seems to think that time is on his side as long as he maintains a firm hold on sanctions (against North Korea) and his new approach is more in sync with the Republican mainstream, which wants a tougher approach on the North,\u201d Cha said. \u201cThe midterms could force Trump to take things even slower.\u201d\n\nA tougher U.S. stance on North Korea could create complications for South Korea, which has been desperate to produce the impression that progress is being made toward denuclearization, despite growing doubts. Kim has yet to provide a convincing sign that he\u2019s willing to deal away a nuclear arsenal that he may see as the strongest guarantee of his survival.\n\nAida, the Japanese professor, said that heightened interest in the election is not just because of trade and North Korea, but also reflects a broader hope for a recovery of what he called \u201cU.S. moral leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not only matters related to or affecting ourselves, but also the prospects of the future of the U.S. with this unusual president that concerns us,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cWhat would the leadership of the U.S. in the world be like if he should keep behaving as he has been over the last two years?\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ken Moritsugu and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "OAKLAND, Calif.

Aaron Rodgers and the Packers head to New England to take on Tom Brady and the Patriots. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers vs. Tom Brady. Green Bay vs. New England. Talk about one spicy prime-time matchup.\n\nSure, the Packers are hovering around the .500 mark and the Patriots don\u2019t appear as invincible as they sometimes \u2014 well, often \u2014 are. But the matchup between these two quarterbacks features lots of wins, even more touchdown tosses \u2014 and plenty of mutual admiration.\n\n\u201cI love watching him play,\u201d Brady said of Rodgers. \u201cTo see him up close is great. I watch him play whenever he\u2019s out there. I study a lot of the Packers\u2019 offense, I study Aaron as a player and he just does an incredible job.\u201d\n\nThe two will meet for just the second time when the Packers (3-3-1) and Patriots (6-2) square off Sunday night.\n\nRodgers and the Packers won the only other showdown, 26-21 at Green Bay in 2014.\n\n\u201cI loved going to Lambeau Field and playing him four years ago,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to play him at home this time. I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe weekend began Thursday night with the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 34-3 victory over the Oakland Raiders in a lopsided Battle of the Bay. Nick Mullens threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns for the most productive NFL debut since the merger for the 49ers (2-7). The Raiders are 1-7.\n\nOff are: Indianapolis (3-5), Arizona (2-6), New York Giants (1-7), Jacksonville (3-5), Philadelphia (4-4), Cincinnati (5-3).\n\nFootball fans will have to wait until Sunday night for the Packers and Patriots to kick off, but they could be treated to plenty of passing.\n\nRodgers (24 of 38 for 368 yards, two touchdowns) and Brady (22 of 35 for 245 yards, two TDs) combined for 613 yards passing the last time they faced each other. Rodgers (103.6) and Brady (97.6) also rank first and third, respectively, in NFL history in career passer rating.\n\n\u201cI enjoy competing against great players,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201cand obviously Tom is right at the top.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES RAMS (8-0) at NEW ORLEANS (6-1)\n\nThe Rams put their undefeated mark \u2014 the only team in the NFL yet to lose \u2014 on the line in a game that features the squads with the NFC\u2019s best records.\n\nLos Angeles boasts the No. 2 overall offense with the top-ranked running game in the league, led by the versatile and electric Todd Gurley. But the Saints have the No. 1 run defense in the NFL, so something\u2019s got to give, right?\n\nOne thing the Rams have working in their favor: quarterback Jared Goff has won his past seven starts on the road with 13 touchdowns and five interceptions in that span.\n\nMeanwhile, Drew Brees has been sensational at home lately, with 1,045 yards passing with eight TDs and no INTs in his last three games at the Superdome.\n\nPITTSBURGH (4-2-1) at BALTIMORE (4-4)\n\nJoe Flacco and the Ravens won the first meeting this season, 26-14 on Sept. 30, and Baltimore will try to complete its first series sweep since 2015.\n\nThat game, by the way, was the last Ben Roethlisberger and the surging Steelers have lost.\n\nBig Ben & Co. are looking for their fourth straight victory, and that\u2019s despite all the drama \u2014 will he show up or not? \u2014 surrounding the still absent Le\u2019Veon Bell. James Conner has done just fine in his place, though, rushing for 599 yards and nine touchdowns this season.\n\nIt might be tougher sledding this week, though, as the Steelers face a Ravens defense that ranks No. 1 overall in the NFL and is allowing a league-low 17.1 points and 293.8 yards per game.\n\nKANSAS CITY (7-1) at CLEVELAND (2-5-1)\n\nJust what the struggling Browns need: a matchup against the team that has the best record in the AFC as well as the NFL\u2019s most potent offense.\n\nThe Chiefs average a league-high 36.3 points per game and Patrick Mahomes has been putting up eye-popping numbers. He has a league-leading 26 TD passes, just four shy of the franchise record set by Len Dawson in 1964, and has thrown for 300 yards or more in a Chiefs-record seven straight games. Mahomes also leads the NFL in yards passing (2,526) and TD-to-INT rate (plus-20).\n\nThe Browns are coming off another turbulent week following the firings of coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams will make his debut as the Browns\u2019 interim coach against Kansas City\u2019s Andy Reid, who is 6-0 in his career against Cleveland.\n\nLOS ANGELES CHARGERS (5-2) at SEATTLE (4-3)\n\nPhilip Rivers and the Chargers are well-rested after their bye-week break, looking to keep things going after a solid start to the season.\n\nRivers will start in his 200th straight game, becoming just the 10th player since the merger in 1970 with such a streak. And he has shown little signs of slowing. Rivers is tied for third in the NFL with 17 touchdown passes.\n\nHe\u2019ll face a Seahawks team that has won four of five and begins a stretch of six of nine games at home to close the regular season. Russell Wilson has 11 TD throws and no interceptions in his last five home games, and will look to build off last week\u2019s performance when he became the first player in franchise history to post a perfect quarterback rating.\n\nHOUSTON (5-3) at DENVER (3-5)\n\nHey, that guy looks familiar, huh?\n\nWide receiver Demaryius Thomas will face the team with which he spent his first eight-plus NFL seasons before being traded to the Texans on Tuesday. He\u2019ll be counted on by Houston right away to replace the injured Will Fuller and keep the DeShaun Watson-led offense humming.\n\nHouston is the fifth team since the 1970 merger to win five consecutive games following an 0-3 start.\n\nTAMPA BAY (3-4) at CAROLINA (5-2)\n\nFitzmagic is back. Again.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback for the Buccaneers \u2014 who rank No. 1 in the NFL in total offense \u2014 in place of the benched Jameis Winston. He\u2019ll look to recapture some of the success he had during his four-game stint as the starter at the beginning of the season. The 35-year-old Fitzpatrick threw for over 400 yards in each of the first three games, and had 11 touchdowns in that span with four interceptions before giving way to Winston.\n\nWhile the Buccaneers have instability at the quarterback spot, Cam Newton is firmly entrenched as the guy in Carolina and has the Panthers looking for their 10th straight home win with him under center. Newton has 17 combined touchdowns and just four interceptions this season.\n\nNEW YORK JETS (3-5) at MIAMI (4-4)\n\nSam Darnold faces the Dolphins for the second time, looking for a much better outing than the one he had in Week 2 when New York lost 20-12. The rookie threw for 334 yards \u2014 still a personal best \u2014 but also had two interceptions.\n\nThis also begins a three-game stretch in which New York takes on AFC East opponents.\n\nThe Jets will see a different face running the offense on the other side, with Brock Osweiler getting the start for the Dolphins in place of the injured Ryan Tannehill. Osweiler has played well with six touchdown throws and three interceptions in his three starts, during which Miami is 1-2.\n\nATLANTA (3-4) at WASHINGTON (5-2)\n\nThe ageless Adrian Peterson and the Redskins will try to go two games up on Philadelphia in the NFC East. They\u2019ll have to get past the Falcons first, though, and Atlanta has won each of the last five meetings.\n\nPeterson, by the way, rushed for 149 yards and a TD last week against the Giants. He has some past success when facing Atlanta, with 442 yards from scrimmage and three TDs in three games against the Falcons.\n\nDespite the Falcons\u2019 mediocre record, Matt Ryan is off to a solid start and leads the NFL with 333.6 yards passing a game. Julio Jones, his favorite target, needs 134 yards receiving in his 102nd game to become the fastest to 10,000 in a career.\n\nDETROIT (3-4) at MINNESOTA (4-3-1)\n\nAdam Thielen comes into this one with his sights set on the end zone \u2014 as usual.\n\nThe Vikings wide receiver is tied with former Lions star Calvin Johnson (2012) with eight straight games of 100 or more yards receiving, the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nTo get the record, he\u2019ll have to do it against Matt Patricia\u2019s fourth-ranked passing defense.\n\nSpeaking of Patricia, this is his first NFC North road test. The Lions have mostly fared well against division opponents overall, going 21-10 since the start of the 2013 season \u2014 the best of the NFC North teams.\n\nCHICAGO (4-3) at BUFFALO (2-6)\n\nThe Bears stopped a two-game skid last week by manhandling the Jets. Even more impressive was the way Mitchell Trubisky rebounded from a so-so first half in that game.\n\nThe second-year QB failed to throw for 300 or more yards after three straight while finishing with 222, but he had two touchdown passes and no interceptions. He has 13 TDs in his last four games, the most in that type of span for Chicago since Sid Luckman in 1947.\n\nThe Bills are turning back to turnover-prone Nathan Peterman, who\u2019s starting with rookie Josh Allen ruled out with a sprained elbow and Derek Anderson dealing with a concussion. Peterman, who lost his starting gig midway through the season opener, has thrown 10 interceptions in just 84 career attempts.\n\nTENNESSEE (3-4) at DALLAS (3-4)\n\nAmari Cooper makes his Cowboys debut after being acquired from Oakland on Tuesday, giving Dak Prescott a new No. 1 wide receiver.\n\nHe comes just in time to boost a passing game that ranks a lowly 29th in the NFL. Dallas made another change during its bye-week break by firing offensive line coach Paul Alexander and promoting former Cowboys lineman Marc Colombo.\n\nMaybe the shake-ups will help energize the Cowboys, who are looking to improve to 4-0 at home.\n\nThe Titans are looking to change their luck a bit, too. They have lost three in a row, but two of those defeats were by one point each.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "San Francisco 49ers quarterback Nick Mullens throws a pass against the Oakland Raiders during the first half of an NFL football game in Santa Clara, Calif., Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 Nick Mullens got several hundred congratulatory text messages, a phone call from Brett Favre and his Twitter account verified.\n\nDelivering the most productive game by a quarterback in his NFL debut since the merger leads to many accolades.\n\nMullens threw for 262 yards and three touchdowns and the San Francisco 49ers thoroughly dominated the Battle of the Bay, beating the Oakland Raiders 34-3 on Thursday night.\n\nThe former undrafted free agent out of Favre\u2019s alma mater Southern Mississippi finished 16 for 22 in place of the injured C.J. Beathard and had a 151.9 passer rating, the highest for a quarterback with at least 15 attempts in an NFL debut since the 1970 merger.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m here for a reason. This is my opportunity to prove that I can play,\u201d Mullens said. \u201cToday\u2019s thing was just attack your job and worry about what matters. What mattered most tonight was the team and how we played.\u201d\n\nThe Niners (2-7) couldn\u2019t have played much better in snapping a six-game losing streak and winning for just the second time in two years without Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback.\n\nMullens threw TD passes to Pierre Garcon and Kendrick Bourne on the opening two drives and connected on a 71-yard one-handed catch-and-run play to George Kittle to set up a third TD pass to Kittle. Raheem Mostert added a 52-yard TD run and the defense generated eight sacks for the first time since 2009.\n\nWHAT. A.

We\u2019ve seen him do it in practice. He plays with a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nWith Garoppolo out for the season and Beathard having lost nine of 10 career starts, the inevitable question will be whether Mullens will take over as starter for the next game Nov. 12 against the New York Giants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely consider it,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not thinking about it right now. Our whole team played very well. They definitely did.\u201d\n\nThe Raiders (1-7) clearly didn\u2019t, losing for the fourth straight time, getting outscored by 85 points during the skid.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not looking pretty right now,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of negativity over the last six, seven months and rightfully so. But we\u2019re going to build a championship football team here.\u201d\n\nIn what was perhaps the worst prime-time matchup in NFL history, only the Raiders played down to expectations. They provided little resistance on defense against an undrafted quarterback making his NFL debut, did nothing offensively after driving for as field goal on the opening drive and put together the most listless performance yet in Gruden\u2019s second stint as coach.\n\nCarr finished 16 for 22 for 171 yards and was sacked seven times before being replaced by AJ McCarron in the fourth quarter. McCarron was sacked once behind a banged-up offensive line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating thing to be sitting on the record you have, be going through some of the things we\u2019re going through as an offense and still not being able to put points on the board,\u201d tight end Jared Cook said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating because we know the talent we have in this room is way better than that and way better than what we portray on the field.\u201d\n\nUNDER PRESSURE\n\nCarr was sacked four times in the first half for the first time in his career as the Raiders struggled to provide much protection against a 49ers defense that has not generated much pressure all year. Dekoda Watson had 1 1/2 sacks in his first game of the season after getting activated from IR earlier in the day.\n\nRING CEREMONY\n\nFormer Niners receiver Terrell Owens was presented his Hall of Fame ring at a halftime ceremony. Owens was voted into the Hall of Fame earlier this year but skipped the induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio, to hold his own celebration at his college in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Owens said he was upset at the voters who made him wait three years for the honor, saying he believed they brought in off-field issues into their deliberations instead of focusing solely on what Owens did as a player.\n\n\u201cThis is awesome,\u201d Owens said before the game. \u201cThis is an opportunity to give something to the fans. Ever since I left in 2003 and went on and did some great things, but this is where it started my first eight years of my career.\u201d\n\nINJURIES\n\nRaiders left tackle Kolton Miller left with a knee injury. ...

Banned sunscreens will be confiscated from tourists who carry them into the country, and merchants selling the banned products will be fined up to $1,000.\n\nRemengesau said in a statement that the penalties find the right balance between \u201ceducating tourists and scaring them away.\u201d\n\nThe law defines reef-toxic sunscreen as containing any one of 10 chemicals, including oxybenzone, and states that other chemicals may also be banned.\n\nThe legislation also requires tour operators to start providing customers with reusable cups, straws and food containers.\n\nRemengesau said a big impetus for the ban was a 2017 report which found that sunscreen products were widespread in Palau\u2019s famed Jellyfish Lake, which was closed for more than a year due to declining jellyfish numbers before being recently reopened.\n\nThe president noted legislative findings that \u201cplastic waste, chemical pollution, resource overconsumption, and climate change all continue to threaten the health of our pristine paradise.\u201d\n\nPalau\u2019s ban comes after Hawaii in July banned the sale of sunscreen containing the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate from 2021 in an attempt to protect its reefs. In Hawaii, however, tourists will still be able to bring the banned sunscreen with them into the state or buy it there if they have a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nScientists have found that some chemicals in sunscreen can be toxic to coral reefs, which are a vital part of the ocean ecosystem as well as a popular draw for tourists. But some critics say there aren\u2019t enough independent scientific studies on the issue while others worry that people will suffer from too much sun exposure if they stop using the products.\n\nSome manufacturers, meanwhile, have already started selling \u201creef-friendly\u201d sunscreen.\n\nPalau, located east of the Philippines and north of Indonesia, is home to 21,000 people and has an economy that relies on tourism and fishing.

If Tennessee electrocutes Zagorski, it will be in an electric chair built by a self-taught execution expert who is no longer welcome in the prison system. (Tennessee Department of Corrections via AP, File)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 A Tennessee inmate grimaced and waved goodbye before saying \u201clet\u2019s rock,\u201d moments before he became the first man executed in the electric chair in that state since 2007, put to death Thursday for shooting two men and slitting their throats during a drug deal decades ago.\n\nEdmund Zagorski, 63, was pronounced dead at 7:26 p.m. Thursday at a Nashville maximum-security prison, officials said.\n\nAsked by the prison warden if he had any last words in the death chamber, Zagorski said, \u201cLet\u2019s rock,\u201d shortly before the execution was carried out.\n\nA reporter who witnessed the scene said at a post-execution news briefing that Zagorski could be seen smiling while strapped down. A large sea sponge that had been doused in salt water was soon placed on his head. While guards wiped his face clear of water dripping down his face, Zagorski quietly said there was still water under his nose and asked for it to be removed before his face was shrouded with a large black cloth.\n\nThe witnesses said the inmate\u2019s fists then clenched when the electricity was applied and his body tensed and appeared to rise during the two times the current went through him. He did not move afterward.\n\nFive media witnesses watched Zagorski\u2019s execution along with Zagorski\u2019s attorney, the prison\u2019s chaplain and a representative from the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nAnother reporter said Zagorski\u2019s attorney Kelly Henry was nodding, smiling and tapping her heart just before the execution got underway. When asked about her actions, Henry said afterward: \u201cI told him when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.\u201d\n\nShe said Zagorski told her the last thing he wanted to see was her smiling face, and so she made an effort to smile at him before the shroud was put over his face. After it was done, Henry quietly wiped away tears.\n\nLater, Henry said it appeared that Zagorski\u2019s pinkies had become dislocated. She said that can be common when the body undergoes such extreme blunt force trauma.\n\nA phone hung on the wall in the witness room, allowing Henry to have access to a telephone should anything have gone wrong. A federal judge had earlier this week ordered the state to have a phone accessible.\n\nIn opting for the electric chair over a lethal injection as Tennessee allowed him, Zagorski had argued it would be a quicker and less painful way to die. He became only the second person to die in the electric chair in Tennessee since 1960. Nationwide, only 14 other people have been put to death in the electric chair since 2000, including a Virginia inmate in 2013.\n\nThe execution was carried out minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday evening denied the inmate\u2019s request for a stay. Zagorski\u2019s attorneys had argued it was unconstitutional to force him to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection.\n\nThe state came close to administering an injection to Zagorski three weeks ago, a plan halted by Tennessee\u2019s governor when Zagorski exercised his right to request the electric chair.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s statement said Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the dissenting voice on Thursday, noting Zagorski\u2019s difficult decision to opt for the electric chair. In Tennessee, condemned inmates whose crimes occurred before 1999 can choose the electric chair \u2014 one of a handful of states that allow such a choice.\n\n\u201cHe did so not because he thought that it was a humane way to die, but because he thought that the three-drug cocktail that Tennessee had planned to use was even worse,\u201d Sotomayor said in the statement. \u201cGiven what most people think of the electric chair, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more striking testament \u2014 from a person with more at stake \u2014 to the legitimate fears raised by the lethal-injection drugs that Tennessee uses.\u201d\n\nZagorski was convicted of an April 1983 double slaying. Prosecutors said Zagorski shot John Dotson and Jimmy Porter and then slit their throats after robbing the two men after they came to him to buy marijuana.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether use of the electric chair violates the 8th Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but it came close about 20 years ago after a series of botched electrocutions in Florida. During two executions in the 1990s, smoke and flames shot from the condemned inmates\u2019 heads. In 1999, blood spilled from under an inmate\u2019s mask. Shortly afterward, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to the electric chair. But the case was dropped when Florida made lethal injection its primary execution method.\n\nRepublican Gov. Bill Haslam declined to intervene in Zagorski\u2019s case despite receiving pleas from correctional officers, Zagorski\u2019s priest and former jurors who convicted the inmate.\n\nAt the time of Zagorski\u2019s conviction, Tennessee juries were not given the option of considering life without parole.\n\nProtesters held vigils Thursday in Knoxville and Memphis, and outside the prison where Zagorski was executed. There some raised a banner with the words: \u201cA Free Tennessee is Execution-Free.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Travis Loller contributed to this report in Nashville.", "File- In this Aug. 30, 2015, file photo released by the Broward County Sheriff's office, Cesar Sayoc is seen in a booking photo, in Miami.

Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Packages were also mailed to CNN in New York and Atlanta.\n\nThe laptop also has a file with the address in Sunrise, Florida, of the office of U.S. Rep.

The computer file was labeled \u201cDebbie W.docx\u201d.\n\nBenjamin, however, said the prosecution letter does not prove anything yet. He noted that it refers to \u201cpossible\u201d DNA matches to Sayoc.\n\n\u201cThe word flimsy actually still applies,\u201d Benjamin told reporters. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything but speculate now.

He stopped practicing with the club\u2019s top team when contract negotiations intensified immediately before the A-League season started.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank the Central Coast Mariners\u2019 owners, management, staff, players and fans for making me feel so welcome during my time there,\u201d Bolt said in a statement released by the club. \u201cI wish the club success for the season ahead.\u201d\n\nBolt scored two goals in a trial game but wasn\u2019t included in the squad for the A-League season opener on Oct. 21, when Central Coast had a 1-1 draw in Brisbane. Mariners coach Mike Mulvey said after that match that he wasn\u2019t aware the club had made an offer to Bolt.\n\nThe 32-year-old Bolt retired from competitive track and field last year and has since explored options in Germany, South Africa, Norway, and Australia to gain a professional soccer contract.\n\nHis first game for the Mariners, an exhibition against a selection of amateur players, attracted a much larger than average crowd, and Bolt\u2019s bid to join the A-League has generated plenty of headlines. But critics questioned Bolt\u2019s ability to play at an elite level and others wrote it off a publicity stunt.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "In this Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, photo, school children gather around street vendors outside their school in Bangkok, Thailand. A report by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization released Friday, Nov. 2, says some 486 million people are malnourished in Asia and the Pacific, and progress in alleviating hunger has stalled. (AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe)\n\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Despite rapid economic growth, the Asia-Pacific region has nearly a half billion people who go hungry as progress stalls in improving food security and basic living conditions, a United Nations report said Friday.\n\nEven in relatively well-to-do cities like Bangkok and the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, poor families cannot afford enough good food for their children, often with devastating long-term consequences for their health and future productivity, says the report compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization and three other U.N. agencies.\n\nIn Bangkok, more than a third of children were not receiving an adequate diet as of 2017, the report said. In Pakistan only 4 percent of children were getting a \u201cminimally acceptable diet,\u201d it said, citing a government survey.\n\nTo be able to meet a goal of reaching zero hunger in the region by 2030, 110,000 people need to be lifted out of hunger and malnutrition every single day, said the FAO\u2019s regional director-general, Kundhavi Kadiresan.\n\n\u201cAfter all those years of gains in fighting hunger and malnutrition in Asia and the Pacific we now find ourselves at a virtual standstill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to pick up the pace.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the number of malnourished people in the region has begun to rise, especially in East and Southeast Asia, with almost no improvement in the past several years.\n\nIn the longer term, rates of malnutrition did fall from nearly 18 percent in 2005 to 11 percent in 2017, but hunger-related stunting that causes permanent impairment is worsening due to food insecurity and inadequate sanitation, with 79 million children younger than 5 across the region affected, the report said.\n\nThe high risks also are reflected in the prevalence in wasting among very young children, a dangerous rapid weight loss related to illness or a lack of food, it said. The condition is seen most often in India and other parts of South Asia but also in Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia, affecting almost one in 10 children in Southeast Asia and 15 percent of children in South Asia.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of wasting is above the threshold of public health concern in three of every four countries in the region,\u201d it said.\n\nConversely, even overweight children often are malnourished if their families rely on inexpensive street foods that are oily, starchy and sweet, but unhealthy and sometimes unsafe.\n\nThe report focused on two main factors that often contributed to food insecurity: climate-related disasters and inadequate access to clear water and sanitation.\n\nIts authors said that providing adequate clean drinking water and sanitation were crucial for preventing illnesses that further undermine health, especially among children. It also lauded efforts in some countries to ensure city dwellers have access to fresh food markets.\n\nIn Indonesia, for example, a study cited in the report found that the prevalence of stunting correlated very closely with access to improved latrines. Children whose families relied on untreated water were more than thrice as likely to be stunted if their homes lacked such latrines, it said.\n\nWhile access to drinking water is widespread it has stopped improving and actually decreased in urban areas, the report said.\n\nMany poor living in Southeast Asia rely on bottled water that claims to be suitable for drinking but often is contaminated. A study of samples in Cambodia found 80 percent of such water contained bacteria and nearly all had coliform, or fecal contamination.\n\nEnding the practice of open defecation, seen most widely in India, remains challenging, the report said, partly due to customary factors. In 2014, the country launched a campaign to end the practice by 2019, increasing the coverage of latrines to 65 percent.

Sununu, who is seeking a second term, said Kelly, a former state senator, failed to offer specific solutions on a range of issues.\n\n\u201cNot a single concrete answer. She was asked about fuel: Nothing. She was asked about the economy: Nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to hear a single idea about where we need to go and what we need to implement.

She said she would ensure that no child starts the school day hungry, and then said she would address the state\u2019s opioid crisis via an \u201cemergency plan\u201d to improve prevention, treatment and recovery programs, particularly those aimed at children affected by the crisis. Responding to Sununu\u2019s criticism, she pointed to her time in the Statehouse and a bill she sponsored to allow towns and businesses to get rebates for generating their own energy.\n\n\u201cI was a state senator for 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI got things done, and I know how to get things done.\u201d\n\nShe later suggested Sununu was getting \u201cdesperate\u201d by attacking her commitment to children when contrasted with an overhaul of the state\u2019s child protection system that began under his administration with budget cuts in that area while Kelly was in the Senate.\n\n\u201cMy opponent is wrong about slashing a budget. When those really deep cuts were taking place, I did not support the budget,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s always interesting when your opponent is nervous or getting desperate in a campaign to start to attack you about your strengths. I have been an advocate for children my entire life, and I have been an advocate for children every day in the state Senate.\u201d\n\nKelly also countered that Sununu is failing to protect children in schools because he doesn\u2019t support gun control measures, such as allowing communities to designate gun-free school zones, universal background checks or allowing family members to ask a judge to remove firearms from a relative who appears to pose a threat. She criticized him for visiting a gun manufacturer and tweeting that \u201cbusiness is booming\u201d on Monday, two days after 11 people were killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThe governor thinks our gun laws are fine and gun sales are booming. I believe we need common-sense gun safety,\u201d she said.\n\nSununu said designating gun-free zones won\u2019t stop shooters, and said adults have a constitutional right to carry concealed weapons into schools. A school safety task force he appointed earlier this year made no recommendations about guns but focused on mental health, planning, training and other areas.\n\n\u201cYou can talk about guns and that political argument all day long, but at the end of day are we really providing the services to the individual, to the person that would do harm?\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone has the will to shoot up a school or a synagogue, a sign isn\u2019t going to stop that.

Dorsey, was previously in Kansas City before taking over in Cleveland late last year. (AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 John Dorsey\u2019s roughest week running the Browns will close with a reunion.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were once his football family \u2014 before the feud.\n\nOn Sunday, Cleveland\u2019s first-year general manager will get an up-close look at the team he helped build into a Super Bowl contender playing against the one he\u2019s trying to revive after years of decay \u2014 and just days after another coaching clean-out.\n\nDorsey served as Kansas City\u2019s GM from 2013 to 2017, and was instrumental in the team drafting quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who leads the NFL with 26 touchdown passes, and in just his second year, has become the face of K.C\u2019s franchise.\n\nBefore he was fired by the Chiefs, Dorsey also selected running back Kareem Hunt, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 a trio of options who have sped up Mahomes\u2019 development.\n\n\u201cJohn picked \u2018em,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said this week. \u201cYeah. He picked \u2019em.\u201d\n\nIt was an honest admission from Reid, who arrived with Dorsey in 2013 and appeared to win a power struggle when the GM was surprisingly let go in 2017, not long after the Chiefs gave their coach a contract extension.\n\nThe team has never given a direct reason for Dorsey\u2019s firing.\n\nOn a conference call this week, Reid didn\u2019t want to get into specifics about his relationship with Dorsey or why Brett Veach was promoted to replace him.\n\n\u201cI am friends with John. I have been friends with John. I will leave it at that,\u201d Reid told Cleveland reporters. \u201cThings happen, and it happened. I have the utmost respect for him. You just watch how he gets that thing turned around right there.\u201d\n\nMahomes wasn\u2019t with Dorsey for very long, but got to know him during the pre-draft process.\n\n\u201cDorse is an awesome guy,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cHe is the guy who sent the pick in and got me. He is an awesome talent evaluator, as well as a guy. It was nice to get to know him for a little amount of time.\u201d\n\nIn the 10-plus months he\u2019s been on the job in Cleveland, Dorsey has disassembled the team\u2019s roster, added talent through free agency and the draft and maybe found the team\u2019s franchise QB in rookie Baker Mayfield.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of work ahead, but Reid believes the Browns have the right man in charge.\n\n\u201cI think John is going to do a phenomenal job for you guys,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has already done it. You have seen what he has done. You guys are in good hands.\u201d\n\nMAHOMES-MAYFIELD PART II\n\nThe previous time they squared off, Mahomes and Mayfield broke records and nearly the scoreboard.\n\nMayfield passed for 545 yards and seven touchdowns, Mahomes had five and they rolled up over 1,700 total yards in 2016. Mayfield led Oklahoma to a 66-59 win over Texas Tech.\n\n\u201cThat game was crazy, a lot of numbers, but I wish we\u2019d have come out with a win at the end,\u201d said Mahomes, who passed for 734 yards.\n\nMahomes also had another big number the Browns can\u2019t let him duplicate.\n\n\u201cThey were 20 of 25 on third down,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if we can keep them from completing 20 of 25 third downs, then we will have a better chance of winning.\u201d\n\nBUILT FORD TOUGH\n\nChiefs linebacker Dee Ford was the AFC defensive player of the week after sacking the Broncos\u2019 Case Keenum three times and stripping him twice of the ball. Ford has eight sacks this season and, perhaps more importantly, has remained healthy after a career marked by a series of nagging injuries in his first four seasons.\n\n\u201cJust to see him back enjoying the game and playing at the level he is, man, I\u2019m just happy for the kid,\u201d Reid said.\n\nSTRETCHING THE RULES\n\nThe Chiefs defended how they use downfield blocks on their run-pass options this week after the Broncos argued their offensive linemen are cheating. Broncos coach Vance Joseph said he noticed several instances in which they headed downfield early, setting up blocks against the Denver linebackers and helping turn short gains into big ones.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard that but I can tell you what we tell them. It\u2019s timing and we keep it as precise as we can,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI always ask officials beforehand if there\u2019s anything I need to tell my guys and that\u2019s never been an issue.\u201d\n\nBRAGGING RIGHTS\n\nBrowns interim coach Gregg Williams raised some eyebrows by boasting he\u2019s had other chances to coach since being fired in 2003 by Buffalo.\n\n\u201cI have had 11 letters sent in to interview for head coaching jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cFour of them I did not even have to show up. Just sign the contract and come.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear if Williams was joking, but he stood by his comments.\n\nThe next day, new Browns offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens took a playful jab at his colleague.\n\n\u201cI thought this was going to come up, but it didn\u2019t come up and I want to address it,\u201d Kitchens said to end his first news conference. \u201cI have not been offered any head coaching jobs.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Tennessee carries out its 1st execution by electric chair since 2007, putting man to death for a 1980s double murder", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A California man has been convicted of laundering ransom money for two dozen Mexican citizens who were held hostage by a kidnappers who posed as human smugglers.\n\nLuis Francisco Murillo Morfin of National City was convicted Wednesday of conspiracy to launder money.

King worked with Zimmerman at Sports Illustrated, and completed Zimmerman\u2019s autobiography, \u201cDr. Z: The Lost Memoirs of an Irreverent Football Writer.\u201d\n\nZimmerman had three strokes in 2008 that ended his writing career after 29 years as Sports Illustrated\u2019s lead pro football writer.\n\n\u201cWhen I started covering football in 1984, he was Peter Gammons and Bob Ryan and Tex Maule rolled into one,\u201d King said. \u201cHis football knowledge was peerless. He knew the technical side and loved it, and he loved the personal side, too.\u201d\n\nZimmerman briefly played college football at Stanford and Columbia, and covered the New York Jets for the New York Post for 13 years. He also worked for the Sacramento Bee, New York Journal-American and the New York World-Telegram & Sun before joining SI in 1979. His \u201cA Thinking Man\u2019s Guide to Pro Football\u201d was published in 1970, and revised in 1984 as \u201cThe New Thinking Man\u2019s Guide to Pro Football.\u201d\n\nZimmerman was president of the Pro Football Writers of America during the 1982 season. He received the PFWA\u2019s highest honor, the Dick McCann Award, in 1996 for a long and distinguished contribution through coverage. In 2014, the PFWA instituted the Paul \u201cDr. Z\u201d Zimmerman Award, given for lifetime achievement as an assistant coach in the NFL.", "FILE - In this Sept. 23, 2018, file photo, Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen (3) talks with quarterbacks coach Byron Leftwich during the second half of an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears in Glendale, Ariz. Leftwich was recently promoted to offensive coordinator, the fifth coordinator that Rosen has had in the past five seasons. (AP Photo/Ralph Freso, File)\n\nTEMPE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Halfway through Steve Wilks\u2019 initial season as head coach, the Arizona Cardinals have two victories.\n\nBoth have come against the lowly San Francisco 49ers. Things get tougher from here on out. After taking this weekend off, the Cardinals play at Kansas City. The schedule also features games at the Los Angeles Chargers, Green Bay and Atlanta. And there\u2019s that final home game against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSo wins are going to be hard to come by for a team that sputtered to a 2-6 start, topping 20 points in a game only once. So the main focus from this point forward is developing rookie quarterback Josh Rosen.\n\nTo offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich, Rosen is simply \u201cthe kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kid can really play,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cHis demeanor allows him to have success. Quarterbacking in this league is hard and when things go bad this kid tends to be fine. He\u2019s OK in those situations. Like I said, he can really play and it\u2019s just my job to get him in position that he\u2019s doing the right things.\u201d\n\nLeftwich knows Rosen well. He was the quarterbacks coach before being promoted to coordinator after Mike McCoy was fired seven games into the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get him better,\u201d Leftwich said. \u201cOur goal is to come out here and get this kid better every day in every form and fashion. There\u2019s not any specifics. I\u2019m working on this kid the whole way, the whole way we\u2019re just trying to install the things we need to install in him so this kid could be playing 15 or 20 years.\u201d\n\nRosen took over the worst offense in the league late in the third game of the season (a home loss to Chicago) and has held the job ever since. He didn\u2019t talk to reporters this week but praised Leftwich after Sunday\u2019s 18-15 come-from-behind win over the 49ers.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I think Byron is really good with is his demeanor,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cHe\u2019s played the game, he\u2019s been in a lot of big-time situations, so I think he has really good timing with a lot of his play calls, he\u2019s got really good poise. He\u2019s a steading force for us on offense.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona offense sputtered for three quarters before Rosen threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns, a 13-yarder to Larry Fitzgerald and the game-winner, a 9-yarder to the back of the end zone to fellow rookie Christian Kirk, with 34 seconds to play.\n\nThe Cardinals were able to get running back David Johnson into open space a little bit more than they had, and the defense shut down San Francisco\u2019s strong running game most of the afternoon.\n\nWilks, whose coaching experience is entirely on the defensive side of the ball, likes what he\u2019s seen from Leftwich, who played nine seasons at quarterback in the NFL but is a relative newcomer to coaching.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to continue to try to be creative in his approach and really try to put the guys in a position to be successful,\u201d Wilks said.\n\nRosen approaches the coming weeks with that even-keeled confidence even though Leftwich is his fifth coordinator in four years, counting his time at UCLA.\n\nThe Cardinals also try to move on from the distraction of three-time All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson\u2019s request to be traded. He backed off the request after a meeting with team president Michael Bidwill and has two years left on his contract.\n\nWilks called on Peterson to speak in the huddle after the San Francisco win.\n\n\u201cWhat was said and what was talked about last week is in the past,\u201d Wilks said. \u201cPatrick is a captain. He\u2019s a leader on this football team. Again, I want him to have a voice, and that\u2019s what he wanted to do, and I gave him that opportunity.\u201d\n\nNotes: Wilks said he expects DT Corey Peters (ankle) and RG Justin Pugh (hand) to be back next week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "President Donald Trump talks about immigration and gives an update on border security from the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018.

Ever since I left in 2003 and went on and did some great things, but this is where it started my first eight years of my career.\u201d\n\nOwens was voted into the Hall of Fame earlier this year but skipped the induction ceremony in Canton, Ohio, to hold his own celebration at his college in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOwens said he was upset at the voters who made him wait three years for the honor, saying he believed they brought in off-field issues into their deliberations instead of focusing solely on what Owens did as a player.\n\n\u201cNo regrets at all,\u201d Owens said about his decision to skip the ceremony. \u201cIf anybody knows who Terrell Owens is outside the media portrayal of me throughout the course of my career.

They spoke for themselves.\u201d\n\nOwens had a mostly sensational 15-year career playing for San Francisco, Philadelphia, Dallas, Buffalo and Cincinnati. He played eight years with the 49ers before bouncing around the league as he frequently wore out his welcome at all of his stops along the way.\n\nBut he always produced, ranking second all-time to Jerry Rice in yards receiving (15,934) and third to Rice and Randy Moss with 153 touchdown catches. He was a five-time All-Pro, a six-time Pro Bowl pick and one of the most entertaining players of his generation.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t look back and say I would have done anything differently,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to be a 49er for the rest of my career if that could happen, But not many people start and finish where they started. Look at Jerry (Rice), look at Joe Montana.\u201d\n\nOwens was part of eight playoff teams but only reached the Super Bowl once after joining the Eagles in 2004. He gave a heroic performance in Philadelphia\u2019s 24-21 loss to New England, catching nine passes for 122 yards after defying doctor\u2019s orders and returning to play on his surgically repaired ankle 6\u00bd weeks after an operation.\n\nOwens had many memorable moments in his career, but the one that stands out most for him from his time with the 49ers came in a playoff game Jan. 3, 1999, against Green Bay.\n\nAfter dropping several passes early in the game, Owens caught the game-winning 25-yard touchdown in the final seconds in a play dubbed \u201cThe Catch 2,\u201d as the sequel to Dwight Clark\u2019s game-winner in the 1981 NFC title game against Dallas.\n\nOwens then was selected an All-Pro for the first time the following season.\n\n\u201cThat was a big catalyst for my career,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me to come up with a big play at that particular time was monumental, very key for the development of me.

But the correspondence suggests that Stone wanted Bannon to see him as plugged in to WikiLeaks as it was planning to publish documents that would upend the campaign.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian agents were the source of information released by WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. And Mueller, who is investigating potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, has focused on Stone recently.\n\nMueller\u2019s team questioned Bannon last month about his exchanges with Stone, according to a person familiar with the interview. Bannon\u2019s interview was with prosecutors, though other people close to Stone have been called before a grand jury to discuss his ties to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe person familiar with Bannon\u2019s interview said Bannon and other top campaign officials were skeptical of Stone and his claims about having insight into WikiLeaks\u2019 efforts.

We can score touchdowns.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know with the Titans and Cowboys set for a Monday night showdown:\n\nSTILL IN THE HUNT\n\nBoth teams have been fortunate not to lose touch with the top of their divisions.\n\nThe Titans have been overtaken by Houston\u2019s five-game winning streak in the AFC South, but are just one loss behind the Texans (5-3) in the loss column. The Cowboys have the same number of losses as Super Bowl champion Philadelphia (4-4) and can pull back even with the idle Eagles in the NFC East. Washington has a shot at a two-game cushion in a visit to Atlanta.\n\nTHE RUNDOWN\n\nThe Titans are 19th in the NFL running the ball even with Derrick Henry, the 2015 Heisman Trophy winner, and Dion Lewis in the backfield.\n\nThe Titans signed fullback Jalston Fowler to the roster after returning from their bye, and coach Mike Vrabel made it clear they want to run the ball better. Dallas star Ezekiel Elliott is coming off the second-worst game of his career, a 33-yard showing in a 20-17 loss to the Redskins.\n\nDEFENSIVE SHOWDOWN\n\nDallas is giving up just 17.6 points per game, second in the NFL and one spot ahead of Tennessee at 18.1.
