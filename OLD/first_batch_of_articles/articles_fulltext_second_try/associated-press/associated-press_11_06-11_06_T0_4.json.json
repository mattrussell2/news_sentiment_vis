(AP) \u2014 Connecticut\u2019s battle for governor between Democrat Ned Lamont and Republican Bob Stefanowski remained close early Wednesday, as Republicans challenged the legality of newly registered voters and poll workers struggled to count ballots that became wet during a rainy Election Day.\n\nThe two major party candidates have jostled for months over who is better is positioned to fix Connecticut\u2019s fiscal ills. As of 1:30 a.m., the race remained too close to call, prompting Lamont\u2019s campaign manager to send home supporters who gathered at a post-election party in Hartford.\n\n\u201cOne thing that we\u2019re sure of, when the votes are counted, we are confident that Ned Lamont\u2019s going to be the next governor of the state of Connecticut,\u201d said Mark Bradley, noting that results from Democratic-friendly cities and towns were still being tallied.\n\nStefanowski\u2019s campaign manager sent supporters home from the GOP\u2019s party in Rocky Hill as well.\n\nThe scenario was reminiscent of 2010, another tight gubernatorial race that took poll workers several days to count the vote.\n\nStefanowski\u2019s campaign raised concerns Tuesday with a judge about some new voters in New Haven and the University of Connecticut being allowed to cast ballots. Some were still waiting in long lines when the polls closed at 8 p.m. and others swore as a group that they had never registered to vote before in the state. The new voters were taking advantage of the state\u2019s Election Day voter registration law.\n\n\u201cThose ballots that were cast by people who were not registered by 8 p.m. are going to be set aside and depending on the outcome of the election will determine if we need to go to court on Friday,\u201d said State Republican Party Chairman J.R. Romano.\n\nA court hearing was tentatively planned for Friday to determine whether the ballots cast in New Haven and the University of Connecticut should be included in the total tally. Gabe Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Secretary of the State\u2019s Office, said the registrars were advised to segregate the ballots but still count them Tuesday.\n\nVoter turnout was high for a midterm election in many communities, with more than 42 percent of the state\u2019s record 2.16 million registered voters casting ballots by 5 p.m. Tuesday, according to Secretary of the State Denise Merrill\u2019s office. Merrill said Election Day had gone relatively smoothly despite some long lines and some ballots getting dampened by rainwater from voters\u2019 jackets.\n\nThere were also reports of broken machines in some polling places.\n\nThe vote for governor headlines midterm balloting in Connecticut that includes contests for a Senate seat, the state\u2019s five U.S. House seats and other statewide and local races. Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy easily won his bid for a second term , as well as Democratic U.S. Reps. Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, John Larson and Joe Courtney. The Associated Press declared former national teacher of the year Jahana Hayes the winner in the 5th Congressional District race early Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats were also hoping to make gains in the General Assembly and continue control of the state\u2019s constitutional offices, such as attorney general. Meanwhile, voters approved two ballot questions that amended the state\u2019s constitution to protect state lands and transportation funding.\n\nStefanowski, of Madison, and Lamont, of Greenwich, led a pack of five men vying to succeed Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat who narrowly won the state\u2019s top office in 2010 and 2014. Oz Griebel, a former Republican and Hartford business advocate who was running as an independent, conceded the race by mid-evening.\n\n\u201cI obviously did a very poor job of convincing people that they should vote for the best ticket and not the lesser of two evils,\u201d he said.\n\nLamont and other Democratic candidates have made this election partly a referendum on President Donald Trump. Lamont has promised to be the state\u2019s firewall against the president\u2019s policies.\n\nBut the state\u2019s continued economic challenges, including projected budget deficits, have also been a key issue.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Doug Dubitsky, who greeted voters in a drizzling rain outside a polling place in Norwich, said he wasn\u2019t sure how much influence the president would ultimately have on the state\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell how the whole Trump situation is going to play out,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly there are angry people who hate Trump and will vote against anybody who is associated with Trump. And there are some who love Trump and will vote for anybody that\u2019s associated with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the people that I\u2019ve spoken to are really concerned about Connecticut\u2019s economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause really, everything flows from that: education health care, municipal issues.\u201d\n\nStefanowski has painted Lamont as a clone of the unpopular Malloy who would preside over tax increases, while Lamont has accused Stefanowski of proposing a reckless tax-cutting plan and being a threat to Connecticut\u2019s values, including the state\u2019s strong gun control laws and protections for women.\n\nA rare Republican voter in heavily Democratic Hartford, Ken Lerman said high taxes \u2014 not Trump \u2014 were foremost on his mind as he cast his ballot.\n\n\u201cOur taxes keep rising. We can\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Lerman, an attorney and chairman of the Hartford Republican Town Committee. \u201cWe need a change in government.\u201d\n\nLibertarian Rod Hanscomb and Mark Stewart Greenstein, co-founder of Americans for Minimal Government Party, were also on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Dave Collins in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "STANTON, Neb.

Elizabeth Warren, weighing a possible White House run, defeated two challengers Tuesday, while Republican Gov. Charlie Baker won a second term in Massachusetts.\n\nVoters in the state election also returned an all-Democratic House delegation to Washington, and approved a first-in-the-nation ballot question on transgender rights.\n\nAnother ballot initiative that would have mandated nurse staffing levels in hospitals was defeated.\n\nWarren, who turned aside Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl and independent candidate Shiva Ayyadurai, has seen her national profile soar as a leader of the liberal wing of Democratic Party, in part because of her frequent Twitter clashes with President Donald Trump.\n\nFor Warren, who won a second six-year term, attention will quickly turn to the 2020 election. She has promised to take \u201ca hard look\u201d at a presidential run.\n\nIn the race for governor, Democrat Jay Gonzalez lost to Baker, who remains popular in Massachusetts and maintained a lopsided fundraising edge.\n\nBaker said he would continue a bipartisan approach to government that appears to have met with approval in a Democratic-leaning state.\n\n\u201cYou told us to focus on the work, not the noise,\u201d Baker told supporters Tuesday night. \u201cTo work across the aisle. To chase the best ideas wherever they come from. And to find common ground.\u201d\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t on the ballot but has surfaced in debates.\n\nBaker has kept his distance from the Republican president and frequently criticized White House policies. He has said he probably won\u2019t vote for Trump if he\u2019s on the ballot in 2020.\n\nWarren tied Diehl to Trump. Diehl served as co-chairman of Trump\u2019s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.\n\nVoting Tuesday in Cambridge, Warren played down the Trump factor, telling reporters: \u201cI try to stay focused on the issues, not on division and hate.\u201d\n\nTrump appeared to be a motivating factor to some voters.\n\nJoe Robinson, a 62-year-old Episcopal priest from Cambridge, said he was driven to vote to combat the \u201cnegativity\u201d of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the country back at a place where conversation is respected and it\u2019s something that we work toward, we don\u2019t shush each other,\u201d he said.\n\nHe voted for Warren and Democratic Rep.

Michael Capuano in the primary, was elected without opposition on Tuesday. She will be the first black woman to serve in Congress from Massachusetts.\n\nIn the race for the state\u2019s only open House seat, Democrat Lori Trahan, of Lowell, defeated Republican Rick Green to take the seat now held by Democrat Niki Tsongas, who is retiring after more than a decade.\n\nSeven incumbent Democrats were re-elected: Jim McGovern, Katherine Clark, Seth Moulton and Bill Keating defeated Republican challengers, while Richard Neal, Joe Kennedy and Stephen Lynch were unopposed in Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s first ever statewide referendum on transgender rights , Massachusetts voters supported a 2016 law that bars discrimination against transgender people, including bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity.\n\nKasey Suffredini, a leader of the campaign, called the vote historic.\n\n\u201cWe have shattered broken stereotypes of what it means to be transgender and debunked the myth, once and for all, that protecting transgender people compromises the safety of others,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nVoters defeated a proposal that would have made Massachusetts the second state, after California, to require that hospitals put specific limits on the number of patients a single nurse can care for at one time. Hospitals that opposed the measure was too rigid and could add nearly $1 billion in health care costs.\n\nAnother ballot question, calling for creation of a citizens commission aimed at undoing the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling, was approved.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey was re-elected, as were Secretary of State William Galvin, Treasurer Deb Goldberg and Auditor Suzanne Bump, all Democrats.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "The Latest: Menendez wins, Dems flip 3 US House seats in NJ\n\nSen.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) \u2014 Rhode Island\u2019s top Democratic officeholders won re-election Tuesday by fending off Republican challengers and promising to continue work they started to help the state.\n\nAt the top of the ticket, Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, and Reps. James Langevin and David Cicilline all won re-election. Democratic Lt. Gov. Dan McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Treasurer Seth Magaziner also earned a second term. Democrat Peter Neronha, a former U.S. attorney, was elected Rhode Island attorney general, succeeding the term-limited Democratic incumbent.\n\nOne of Rhode Island\u2019s most powerful politicians, Democratic state House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, was narrowly re-elected in his Cranston district after an organized effort to oust him by the Rhode Island chapter of the National Organization for Women and the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence.\n\nThe traditionally Democrat-aligned groups felt Mattiello wasn\u2019t addressing issues important to them. Mattiello has also recently faced criticism over how he has handled sexual harassment claims at the state house.\n\nThe state Board of Elections added partial mail ballot results to their count late Tuesday night, putting Mattiello ahead of Republican Steven Frias by more than 300 votes. It was a rematch from 2016, when Frias lost by 85 votes.\n\nMore than 346,000 residents statewide voted out of nearly 790,000 registered voters, the elections board said. That\u2019s nearly 44 percent. In the 2014 election, 44 percent of voters cast ballots.\n\nSeveral voters chose Democrats because they were upset with Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nYaseen Nagib, 18, a senior at Providence\u2019s Classical High School, voted for the first time Tuesday just days after his birthday. Nagib said education, both locally and nationally, was the most important issue to him. He called Trump a \u201cracist, and a liar,\u201d and voted Democrat across the board, including for Raimondo over Republican Allan Fung, who supports Trump.\n\nSteven Reiff, 34, voted in Warwick, though he doesn\u2019t usually vote in midterms. Reiff, an independent, said he typically votes for politicians from both parties, but he supported Democrats this year.\n\n\u201cJust the general turmoil in the White House brought me out to vote. I feel like it\u2019s more important this year than other years,\u201d said Reiff, who works in health care.\n\nRaimondo, the state\u2019s first female governor, earned a second term with more than 50 percent of the vote. She beat back a challenge from Fung, the mayor of Cranston, and Joe Trillo, a former state lawmaker who left the Republican Party to run for governor as an independent.\n\nRaimondo told voters she could continue Rhode Island\u2019s economic momentum and Fung and Trillo would take the state backward. Raimondo and Fung were their parties\u2019 nominees in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe did it,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cThe stakes were very, very high in this election. The people of Rhode Island had a choice and they were crystal clear about the choice that they wanted tonight.\u201d\n\nWhitehouse was elected to a third term over Republican Bob Flanders. Langevin was elected to a 10th term over Republican Salvatore Caiozzo and Cicilline was elected to a fifth term over Republican Patrick Donovan. All three Democrats said they felt they had unfinished business in Washington.\n\nWhitehouse is known being one of the leading voices in the Senate to do more to address climate change. He wants to protect people\u2019s health care, get rid of anonymous \u201cdark money\u201d spending in political campaigns and pass a bill to charge a fee for carbon pollution.\n\nLangevin and Cicilline said they will work to make health care and prescription drugs more affordable, rebuild infrastructure and try to reduce gun violence.\n\nIn Cranston, Democrat Yinka Folami said she voted because she\u2019s not happy with the direction the country is heading. As a native of Nigeria who has lived in the U.S. for more than three decades, she said the immigration debate has been particularly troubling.\n\n\u201cMy vote is a vote against Trump, really,\u201d Folami said. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant and I\u2019ve been given an opportunity to make something of myself and that opportunity should be given to everyone else.\u201d\n\nRhode Island voters also approved a $250 million bond for the first phase of an ambitious plan to rebuild schools. Raimondo championed it, asking voters to make a \u201conce-in-a-generation investment to fix our schools\u201d after years of neglect.\n\nThe only problems reported by the state elections board were a malfunctioning voting machine on Prudence Island and an electrical issue at a polling place in Portsmouth. A new machine was ferried over to Prudence Island, and the board said the polling place was operating normally and all ballots have been counted. The polling place in Portsmouth was relocated and voting hours were extended.\n\nIn local races, Democratic Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza won a second term, fending off a challenge from independent Dee Dee Witman.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle R.

The same strategy helped Republican Troy Balderson win a key central Ohio U.S. House seat in August and again Tuesday.\n\nDeWine, 71, had to walk a careful line on both the governor and the president, instead relying on his long record of public service as a former lieutenant governor, congressman and U.S. senator.\n\nCordray, 59, emphasized his record as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a position to which he was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nHe also hammered DeWine on the issue of insurance protections for pre-existing conditions, in a year Democrats believed would be dominated by health care issues and a backlash against Trump.\n\nCordray expressed disappointment in his loss Tuesday, while thanking his supporters for a race well run.\n\n\u201cYou hosted us in your labor halls, you welcomed us into your churches and your classrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got in this fight for you, and we have fought for you all the way.\u201d\n\nCordray\u2019s style was called boring at times, and his defeat appeared to have a coattails effect on the entire statewide ticket.\n\nRepublican Auditor Dave Yost defeated former U.S. Attorney Steve Dettelbach for attorney general; Republican state Sen. Frank LaRose took secretary of state over Democratic state Rep. Kathleen Clyde; Republican state Rep. Keith Faber became auditor over former U.S. Rep. Zack Space; and GOP state Rep. Robert Sprague, of Findlay, defeated Democrat Rob Richardson, a Cincinnati attorney, for treasurer.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 were buoyed by three wins Tuesday. Incumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown defeated Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, and two Democratic candidates for Ohio Supreme Court \u2014 Michael Donnelly and Melody Stewart \u2014 won their races.\n\nIt was DeWine and Cordray\u2019s third career match-up. DeWine defeated Cordray in a close race for state attorney general in 2010. And Cordray lost a four-way Democratic primary in 2000 for the seat held by DeWine, who was in his first Senate term.\n\n___\n\nJulie Carr Smyth can be reached on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/jcarrsmyth.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "RICHMOND, Va.

Sherrod Brown won a third term in what was an otherwise third consecutive strong statewide election for Republicans.\n\nBrown, first elected to an Ohio office in 1974, defeated fourth-term U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci. DeWine, who began winning elections later in the 1970s, turned back Democrat Richard Cordray, President Barack Obama\u2019s appointee as federal consumer protection chief.\n\nDeWine won a rematch of the 2010 election when he narrowly ousted Cordray to become attorney general. DeWine is a former U.S. senator, congressman and lieutenant governor, among other positions.\n\nDeWine kept the governorship Republican with incumbent Gov. John Kasich term-limited, and Republicans also won statewide races to keep the secretary of state, attorney general, treasurer and auditor for the GOP.\n\nBrown called his victory proof that \u201cprogressives can win \u2014 and win decisively \u2014 in the heartland.\u201d Brown, criticized as voting like \u201ca Hollywood liberal\u201d by Renacci, has agreed on Trump\u2019s moves to toughen trade agreements. But his victory speech made clear that he disapproves of the president\u2019s rhetoric and other policies.\n\n\u201cWe do not appeal to some by pushing down others,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border.\u201d\n\nHe said populists aren\u2019t racists or anti-Semitic. Brown unseated DeWine in 2006.\n\nRepublican Donald Trump had a decisive 8-point victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Trump returned to the state Monday to try to lift DeWine and other Republicans.\n\nSome voters in Ohio said Trump was a factor when casting their Election Day ballots.\n\nKevin Benson, a 38-year-old graphic designer from Westerville in central Ohio, said he\u2019s registered a Republican, considers himself an independent, and voted all Democrat on his polling place on Tuesday, mostly because of Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated with the way he\u2019s acting, plus just Republicans in general ... I\u2019m just kind of dissatisfied across the board with them,\u201d he said.\n\nGrant Stitzlein, a 30-year-old registered Republican who works for FedEx Freight, said he did what Trump said when voting in the Columbus suburb of Dublin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make America great again, so I\u2019m out here voting for the Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s office says more than 1.3 million people voted ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, far outpacing the number of votes cast early statewide four years ago. Officials say that through Monday, nearly 885,000 absentee ballots had been received by mail statewide and that 430,000 people voted early in person. That compares with around 719,000 people mailing in ballots in 2014 and 146,000 people voting early in person, for a total of about 865,000.\n\nAround 8 million Ohioans are registered to vote.\n\nSam Rossi, a spokesman for the Ohio Secretary of State\u2019s Office, said there had been no major problems reported in the state.\n\nA woman who during the 2016 presidential election accused Donald Trump of sexually harassing her more than a decade ago lost her bid for a seat in Ohio\u2019s legislature. Democrat Rachel Crooks lost to incumbent Republican state Rep. Bill Reineke in her first attempt at a public office.\n\nRepublicans maintained the 12-4 U.S. House delegation lead they\u2019ve held since GOP-dominating redistricting for 2012.\n\nIn central Ohio\u2019s 12th district, Republican Troy Balderson won his rematch with Franklin County Recorder Danny O\u2019Connor after becoming congressman after an August special election. In southwest Ohio\u2019s 1st District, Democrat Aftab Pureval ran a well-funded, high-profile race against Republican Rep. Steve Chabot, but Chabot held him off to win his 12th term. Chabot got a late campaign boost from Trump\u2019s visit to the district Oct. 12.\n\nIn legislative races, Republicans retained their supermajority in the Ohio House, despite Democrats\u2019 hopes that strong candidates and national momentum would help them cut into GOP legislative majorities.\n\nVoters also handily rejected an Ohio constitutional amendment that would have made possession of all types of drugs misdemeanors in an effort to reduce the state prison population and divert savings to drug treatment.\n\nMost judicial and law enforcement groups opposed the measure known as Issue 1.\n\n___\n\nSewell reported from Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nFollow them at http://twitter.com/jcarrsmyth and http://www.twitter.com/dansewell\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kantele Franko in Columbus, Angie Wang in Columbus, Mark Gillispie in Cleveland and Lisa Cornwell in Cincinnati contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Oct. 17, 2018 file photo, a man works at his desk in front of monitors during a demonstration in the war room, where Facebook monitors election related content on the platform, in Menlo Park, Calif.

Facebook\u2019s purge is part of countermeasures to prevent abuses like those used by Russian groups two years ago to sway public opinion ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe company based in Menlo Park, California, has been somewhat regularly disclosing such purges in recent months, most recently in October. More are likely going forward since, even as its systems get better at detecting and removing malicious accounts, the bad actors are sharpening their attacks, too.\n\nGleicher said Facebook will provide an update once it learns more, including whether the blocked accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, or other foreign entities.\n\nAlmost all of the Facebook pages associated with the blocked accounts appeared to be in French or Russian. The Instagram accounts were mostly in English and were focused either on celebrities or political debate. No further details were given about the accounts or suspicious activity.\n\nAlso on Monday, Facebook acknowledged that it didn\u2019t do enough to prevent its services from being used to incite violence and spread hate in Myanmar. Alex Warofka, a product policy manager, said in a blog post that Facebook \u201ccan and should do more\u201d to protect human rights and ensure it isn\u2019t used to foment division and spread offline violence in the country.\n\nLast month, Facebook removed 82 pages, accounts and groups tied to Iran and aimed at stirring up strife in the U.S. and the U.K. It carried out an even broader sweep in August, removing 652 pages, groups and accounts linked to Russia and Iran.\n\nTwitter, meanwhile, has said it has identified more than 4,600 accounts and 10 million tweets, mostly affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, which was linked to foreign meddling in U.S. elections, including the presidential vote of 2016. The agency, a Russian troll farm, has been indicted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller for its actions during the 2016 vote.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and other companies have been fighting misinformation and election meddling on their services for the past two years . There are signs they\u2019re making headway, although they\u2019re still a very long way from winning the war.\n\nFacebook, in particular, has reversed its stance of late 2016, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed as \u201cpretty crazy\u201d the notion that fake news on his service could have swayed the presidential election.\n\nIn July, for instance, the company said that its spending on security and content moderation, coupled with other business shifts, would hinder its growth and profitability. Investors expressed their displeasure by knocking $119 billion off Facebook\u2019s market value.\n\nOne problem is that it\u2019s not just agents from Russia and other nations who are intent on sharing misinformation and propaganda. There is plenty of homegrown fake news too, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere.\n\nStill, Facebook is seeing some payoff, and not just with the accounts it has been able to find and take down. A recent research collaboration between New York University and Stanford found that user \u201cinteractions\u201d with fake news stories on Facebook, which rose substantially in 2016 during the presidential campaign, fell significantly between the end of 2016 and July 2018.

After all, if one nation had momentum after the first global war\u2019s four years of unprecedented slaughter, it was the United States.\n\nU.S. troops would push forward on several fronts in France until the minute a cease-fire took effect at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, six hours after it was negotiated. With more time, the Americans might even have entered Germany soon after, establishing themselves as the world\u2019s ascendant military power.\n\nVIDEO: Watch footage from the AP archives of the U.S. military contribution in World War I.\n\nWhen Pvt. Jose De La Luz Saenz was awoken along the front lines of the Meuse-Argonne offensive in northeastern France on Nov. 11, 1918, the pre-dawn instructions were not only about sealing the imminent cease-fire.\n\n\u201cThe orders called for continuing the artillery fire with the same intensity until eleven in the morning,\u201d Saenz noted in his published diary.\n\nAnd despite the promise of the armistice, \u201cthe day seemed like all others because the artillery duel appeared to be continuing with even greater intensity,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn addition to military reasons, there was also a political point to be made, said Nicolas Czubak, a French military historian specializing in northeastern France, where U.S. troops fought.\n\n\u201cFor the Americans, it really is to show that they have played as important a role in victory as the other armies,\u201d Czubak said.\n\nAfter the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, its standing army of 127,500 became an armed force of 2 million within 1\u00bd years. On Nov. 11, 1918, allies like Britain and France were exhausted, Germany was as good as defeated and Pershing had another 2 million troops ready to come over.\n\n\u201cIf war had continued into 1919, the No. 1 army in the world fighting at the front would have been the U.S. Army \u2014 without a doubt,\u201d Czubak said. \u201cIt is also why he wanted to continue even after Nov. 11.\u201d\n\nNear the place where Saenz heard bombshells explode a century ago now stands the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery at the French town of Romagne-sous-Montfaucon. American soldiers who died on that armistice day \u2014 100 of them \u2014 are buried there along with 14,146 fellow U.S. troops. The cemetery holds the largest number of U.S. military dead in Europe.\n\nBy the time World War I ended, Americans had been in enough battles that they were interred in a half-dozen cemeteries dotted across northern France. In a war where the dead would be counted in millions \u2014 1.4 million for France, 1.1 million for British imperial forces \u2014 the United States had 126,000 dead to mourn.\n\nWhen U.S. President Donald Trump joins other world leaders at World War I armistice events hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron this weekend, he plans to visit some of the burial sites.\n\nAnd standing among the white crosses, Trump will see that the pre-eminent military force he commands had its roots in French soil, where U.S. troops were instrumental in turning the tide after their nation shed its isolationism and stood by its European allies.\n\nIf the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery symbolizes America\u2019s coming-of-age in the war, the Aisne-Marne cemetery at the Belleau Wood battleground marks its beginning.\n\nWhen the war started in 1914, most Americans considered it \u201cEurope\u2019s war.\u201d A hit song in 1915 was titled \u201cI Didn\u2019t Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier\u201d and President Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 with the campaign slogan \u201cHe kept us out of war.\u201d\n\nGerman belligerence soon had Americans rethinking the wisdom of isolation, said Bruce Malone, a historian and superintendent of the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery.\n\n\u201cUnrestricted warfare, sinking ships with Americans on them or American ships\u201d and the infamous Zimmermann telegram in which Germany promised to give Mexico some American territory if it kept the U.S. engaged shifted the momentum, he said.\n\n\u201cEven President Wilson, who did not want to be in the war, had no choice,\u201d said Malone.\n\nOn April 6, 1917, the U.S. declared war, much to the relief of its European allies.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t going well in Europe at the time, and the Germans were actually gaining some momentum. The Allies were essentially running out of men to fight the war,\u201d Malone said.\n\nThere was one problem though, he added.\n\n\u201cWe join the war. We\u2019ve made promises, but we don\u2019t have an army. Certainly not of the European standard,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeed was of the essence. Russia left the war in March 1918 and Germany had sent its troops to the Western front for a final full onslaught. Just in time, U.S. soldiers started arriving en masse.\n\nPershing, disregarding British and French pleas to use U.S. troops to beef up depleted lines under British and French command, always wanted his men to fight as an independent American force. A major breakthrough came at Belleau Wood, when U.S. forces stopped a German advance on Paris against heavy odds. It proved their mettle to the enemy and allies alike.\n\nThe Americans kept building on their newly acknowledged grit through the end of the war. Saenz was there to record it.\n\n\u201cThe bloody fighting and our victory was the decisive blow that finished the Teutonic pride and dispelled forever the Germans\u2019 false dream of global conquest,\u201d he wrote after a Nov. 2 victory.\n\nInstead, the United States could start dreaming of making the next century its own.\n\n___\n\nVideojournalist Mark Carlson and photojournalist Virginia Mayo contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi, File)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Japan, South Korea and other major oil importers welcomed Tuesday the decision by the Trump administration to let them continue to import Iranian crude oil and other petroleum products despite the re-imposition of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nThe risk of excessive disruption to world markets was a key factor behind the decision to allow exemptions for some of the biggest, most oil-thirsty economies. It appeared to have paid off.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday oil prices had fallen moderately, with benchmark U.S. crude down 0.3 percent and Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, down nearly 0.4 percent. The fear was that the sanctions deadline would have pushed oil prices sharply higher.\n\nFive of the eight economies granted waivers as long as they work to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero are in Asia: China, India, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The others were Greece, Italy and Turkey.\n\nThe sanctions on Iran were lifted under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. President Donald Trump rejected that accord, and on Monday the U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions.\n\nThe new sanctions were particularly aimed at Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency.\n\nJapan said it was pleased to be temporarily spared from possible penalties for importing Iranian oil. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tokyo was analyzing the potential impact and was in close consultations with the U.S. on protecting Japanese companies from \u201cadverse consequences.\u201d\n\nThose would include penalties for breaking long-term oil purchasing agreements.\n\nStill, South Korean Trade Minister Kim Hyun-chong said Tuesday that the waiver had \u201copened breathing room\u201d for South Korea\u2019s oil refining industry, which relies on imports of a very light crude oil called condensate.\n\nThe waiver also is a relief for South Korean companies that export to Iran: The U.S. also agreed to uphold a special transaction system set up in October 2010 after discussions between Washington and Seoul that essentially allows South Korea to take Iranian oil as payments for its goods.\n\nWith the U.S. upholding the transaction system, South Korean companies will be able to continue exporting non-sanctioned items to Iran, officials said.\n\nIndia has a similar arrangement whereby Iran can use crude oil to pay for food and other necessities.\n\n\u201cThese countries currently take the lion\u2019s share of Iranian oil exports. It is therefore likely that Iranian oil exports will stabilize at their present level of a good 1 million barrels per day,\u201d analysts at Commerzbank said in a commentary.\n\nThey said Iran\u2019s exports could well recover somewhat since Japan and South Korea had sharply cut their imports in the past few months as they sought the waivers from the U.S.\n\nFor both Japan and China, Iran is a significant but not huge supplier. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Qatar and Kuwait export more crude oil to Japan than Iran.\n\nChina, which said it regretted the U.S. rejection of the deal with Iran, is the single-largest importer of crude oil, at about 9 million barrels a day, and also of Iranian oil, so cutting off all shipments could have jolted global markets.\n\nBut while its demand is huge, China has diversified and relies on Iran for less than 10 percent of its total crude oil imports, with Saudi Arabia, Angola, Russia, Oman and Iraq providing more than half, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nMajor European allies have opposed the U.S. decision to reject the nuclear deal with Iran. The 28-nation European Union reportedly is preparing a new financial mechanism to help its companies avoid U.S. sanctions, and that could help keep Iranian oil exports flowing.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street office said Tuesday that the U.K. will continue to expand trade relations despite the decision.\n\n\u201cWe regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S.,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman James Slack said. \u201cWe continue to fully support expanding our trade relationship with Iran and encourage U.K. businesses to take advantage of the commercial opportunities that arise.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Danica Kirka in London and Elaine Kurtenbach in Bangkok contributed.", "10 Things to Know for Today\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the IX Center, in Cleveland, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:\n\n1.

The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines.\n\nThe approvals came three months after Ivanka Trump announced she was dissolving her namesake brand to focus on government work.\n\nChina also granted provisional approval for two \u201cTrump\u201d trademarks to DTTM Operations LLC, headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. They cover branded restaurant, bar and hotel services, as well as clothing and shoes.\n\nThe marks will be finalized if there is no objection during a 90-day comment period.\n\nAll the trademarks were applied for in 2016.\n\n\u201cThese trademarks were sought to broadly protect Ms. Trump\u2019s name, and to prevent others from stealing her name and using it to sell their products,\u201d Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Ivanka Trump\u2019s ethics attorney, said in an email. \u201cThis is a common trademark practice, which is why the trademark applications were granted.\u201d\n\nBoth the president and his daughter have substantial intellectual property holdings in China. Critics worry that China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party, could exploit those valuable rights for political leverage.\n\nThere has also been concern that the Trump family\u2019s global intellectual property portfolio lays the groundwork for the president and his daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office.\n\n\u201cIvanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China.

However, health official Vicharn Pawan said Thailand imports measles vaccine products that do not contain porcine gelatin.\n\nThe recent cases in Buddhist-dominated Thailand\u2019s Muslim-majority southern provinces represent half the total for the whole country since the beginning of the year.\n\nMeasles cases nationwide have increased in recent years, Thailand\u2019s Health Ministry said. Last year, nearly 3,000 cases \u2014 with no deaths \u2014 were reported, compared to just over 1,000 in 2012.

Some said it is against their religion to receive vaccine shots, while others think it\u2019s not safe,\u201d said Anchanee Heemmina, a rights activist who lives in an affected area in the south.\n\nThe Indonesian Ulema Council, the religious body governing the world\u2019s largest Muslim population, had to deal with the same problem earlier this year when some local Muslim groups declared their opposition to the vaccine. It ruled that Muslims were allowed to use such vaccines out of necessity until other options were available. Its statement came after a measles outbreak in Indonesia\u2019s eastern province of Papua was believed responsible for the deaths of as many as 100 children.\n\nThe Indonesian controversy may be responsible for the concerns among Muslims in Thailand and other countries.\n\nAccording to the Thai Health Ministry\u2019s Prevention and Control office, the misunderstandings about vaccinations have resulted in some areas in which only 60 percent of the population receives immunizations.\n\nFor highly contagious diseases such as measles, the World Health Organization says at least 95 percent of the population must be vaccinated for a community to be considered immune to the spread of the disease.\n\nHealth authorities in Thailand have posted messages from local religious leaders on their websites urging people to accept vaccinations.\n\nOne video message from the Central Islamic Council of Thailand explains that even if vaccines contain religiously prohibited items, the medical benefit to a person and the community would take precedence.\n\nHealth workers meanwhile are visiting schools and homes in areas with measles outbreaks to target children under age 5 for free vaccinations, offering them also to others who are judged vulnerable. They are also trying to spread the word that Islamic religious bodies have given their approval for the use of such vaccines, said Vicharn Pawan, director of the Health Ministry\u2019s Bureau of Risk Communication and Health Behavior.\n\nResistance has not been overcome. Twenty families from three villages in Yala province refused vaccinations, with 10 of the families signing formal letters stating their intention to not receive any immunizations in the future, public broadcaster ThaiPBS reported Monday.\n\nYala\u2019s public health office said in a statement that its medical teams will continue to work in the communities to address their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe are still facing tough tasks,\u201d said Vicharn. \u201cBut health workers will continue to reach out to communities.

Muffet McGraw and Geno Auriemma aren\u2019t thrilled about that, either.\n\nA sport that used to start official practice around Oct. 15 and have its first games at Thanksgiving is now beginning nearly three weeks sooner. Add that to the summer and preseason workouts that are allowed, and it\u2019s nearly a year-round sport.\n\nTuesday will feature almost 100 women\u2019s games and 150 for the men.\n\n\u201cI think the season is way too long,\u201d said McGraw, the coach for defending women\u2019s national champion Notre Dame. \u201cBasketball has more practice before its first game than any other sport.\u201d\n\nWith the Final Four taking place on April 5 and the title game on April 7, the season is nearly 200 days long.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like anything about it,\u201d said Auriemma, who has won 11 national titles as the women\u2019s coach at UConn. \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of players you have. I remember the days when you couldn\u2019t talk to your players about basketball until Oct. 15. We had some pretty good teams back then.\u201d\n\nThis year the NCAA moved up the start date a few days to Tuesday to try and create more buzz for the beginning of the season. It gets the opening night of games away from college and pro football, which dominates weekends in the fall.\n\n\u201cSaturday and Sunday is football in this country. It\u2019s college football on Saturday and the NFL on Sunday,\u201d NCAA vice president of men\u2019s basketball Dan Gavitt said. \u201cYou start the season Friday and basically they are dark for two days until you start up again on Monday. Starting on Tuesday, we can hopefully get a few days before you get to the weekend where people talk about the season.\u201d\n\nThe only flaw in that this year is the new start date falls on Election Day, which will dominate news cycles. Gavitt said the NCAA might look at that in the future.\n\nThe midweek start date does help alleviate a few scheduling conflicts for gyms, because volleyball is still going on and many schools use the same building for both sports.\n\nWith the new opening date, practice could officially start the last week of September \u2014 the NCAA allowed women\u2019s teams to begin 42 days before their first game. The men have had that in place since 2013. Teams are still only permitted to have 30 practices during that stretch, just as it\u2019s been since 2010. Until this season, schools were allowed 40 days to get those practices in.\n\nWomen\u2019s basketball coaches weren\u2019t in favor of adding the extra two days.\n\n\u201cOur WBCA board voted against 42 going forward. We were all opposed,\u201d McGraw said. \u201cThe NCAA passed it anyway. The men are doing it and we have to have equality. We weren\u2019t in favor of moving the season up, either.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA also gave coaches more time with their players once school started. Teams are now allowed to use four hours a week for on-court basketball activities in the preseason \u2014 double what it previously had been.\n\nEach school is different in how it uses those days. A young team with many new players or a new coach could benefit from the earlier start date. A team expecting to go deep into the NCAA Tournament might wait a little longer to start so as to avoid burnout when the games matter most.\n\nMost coaches give their teams weekends off during September and October knowing that during the season they won\u2019t be able to do that.\n\nMcGraw started late with her top-ranked team knowing the ultimate goal was to play until early April. The Irish began on Oct. 4 and McGraw gave her players five days off for fall break.\n\nAuriemma had his team start even later, with its first practice coming in the second week of October.\n\nHe also took it a step further. Auriemma decided after last season that Huskies coaches wouldn\u2019t schedule offseason workouts during the spring and summer anymore. It was up to the players. If they wanted to work out, they\u2019d have to reach out to the coaches.\n\nAuriemma thought that would bring back the joy of playing and the anticipation of practice. He figured it also would help develop the upperclassmen into leaders, making them organize the workouts and take more ownership.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "RICHMOND, Va.

One man was taken from his production company\u2019s office, and another from his home, and both worked with foreign television news channels.\n\nThe rebels detained another journalist in Sanaa earlier this month, and have held other over the course of the war, some for years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Norwegian Refugee Council said millions of Yemenis are edging closer to famine and fatal disease as the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s blockade on sea, land and air routes in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country continued.\n\nThe coalition restricted access to Yemen in November last year, after a missile assault by rebels targeted the Saudi capital, Riyadh.\n\nJan Egeland of the NRC said \u201cthe past 12 months have been a never-ending nightmare for Yemeni civilians.\u201d\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which seeks to restore to power the internationally recognized Yemeni government, has been at war with the Houthis since March 2015; the stalemated conflict has generated the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nHodeida, the main portal for humanitarian aid to the suffering population, has become the epicenter of the conflict.\n\nThe United States has sold billions of dollars\u2019 worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the head of the U.N. children\u2019s agency warned that the Hodeida fighting \u201cis now dangerously close to Al Thawra hospital \u2014 putting the lives of 59 children, including 25 in the intensive care unit, at imminent risk of death.\u201d\n\nUNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement that medical staff and patients can hear heavy bombing and gunfire and that access to the hospital, \u201cthe only functioning one in the area, is now imperiled.\u201d\n\nHodeida and the neighboring governorates account for 40 per cent of the 400,000 children in the country who suffer from severe acute malnutrition, she said, and that \u201csome of the sickest are taken to the hospital for urgent care.\u201d\n\nFore added that UNICEF calls on the warring sides to cease hostilities near and around the hospital, and to ensure safe access to it. She also added that the agency is appealing on the combatants to \u201cabide by their legal obligations to stop attacks against civilian infrastructure \u2014 including the port of Hodeida.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Edith M.

Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or put to death in the gas chamber.\n\n\u201cAnyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives,\u201d Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen, a former SS Sturmmann \u2014 roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist \u2014 does not deny serving in the camp during the war, but has told investigators he was unaware of the killings and did not participate in them.\n\nNo pleas are entered in Germany and Andreas Tinkl, one of Rehbogen\u2019s attorneys, would not comment on his client\u2019s defense. He said Rehbogen would address the court at some point during the trial, which is scheduled into January.\n\nRehbogen lives in Borken, near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, on no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court and faces a maximum 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nSeventeen Stutthof survivors or relatives of victims have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, but Brendel said it was unclear whether any would testify in person due to their ages.\n\nIn one of several statements read by their attorneys, survivor Judy Meisel remembered being forced by the Germans into a ghetto at age 12, where she said she endured hunger, daily humiliation and terror.\n\n\u201cBut I was not prepared for what came next,\u201d said Meisel, who today lives in Minneapolis. \u201cNext came Stutthof and I experienced the unimaginable, the hell organized and executed by the SS.\u201d\n\nRehbogen, who was given headphones so he could clearly follow the testimony, showed no reaction as Meisel said the last time she saw her mother, they were both standing among a group of naked women about to be forced into the gas chamber, before she herself was able to break away.\n\n\u201cStutthof was organized mass murder through the SS, made possible through the help of the guards,\u201d she said.\n\nBen Cohen, Meisel\u2019s grandson who came from New York to attend the trial, said hearing her statement with one of her former captors in the same room was both important and moving.\n\n\u201cI know her story so well it is emotional every time I hear it, but it takes on more importance than my own emotions now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate Stutthof survivors for the case, stressed that even more than 70 years after the end of World War II it is not too late to pursue justice.\n\n\u201cThe passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\u201d said the center\u2019s head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor\u2019s office that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany\u2019s top criminal court on appeal.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first use of this reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and was initially used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from nearby Danzig.\n\nFrom about 1940, it was used as a so-called \u201cwork education camp\u201d where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks after a meeting with his Spanish counterpart Josep Borrell at the foreign ministry in Madrid, Spain, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

The committee is due to hold a meeting next week in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, an ally of Iran\u2019s regional rival Saudi Arabia.\n\nZanganeh\u2019s remarks were by Iran\u2019s official news agency IRNA on Tuesday. It\u2019s unlikely, however, that his letter to OPEC would lead to the dissolution of the committee.\n\n___\n\n8:10 p.m.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the decision of the United States to re-impose sanctions on Iran \u201cis not legitimate\u201d and that the rest of the parties in the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Washington are working to make economic cooperation with Tehran possible.\n\nLavrov spoke on Tuesday in Madrid, where he is holding talks with his Spanish counterpart. His remarks are Russia\u2019s first reaction to Washington\u2019s new list of sanctions against Iran\u2019s vital oil exports, banking and transport industries.\n\nThe Russian diplomat says the sanctions go against international law and practices, and that the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cpolicies of issuing an ultimatum and making unilateral moves are unacceptable these days.\u201d\n\nSpanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell has said that the U.S. move raised economic and security risk internationally and that the European Union would work to realize the 2015 nuclear deal struck with Iran.\n\n___\n\n5:45 p.m.\n\nA former Indian diplomat says his country earned a waiver from U.S. sanctions against Iran because of its reliance on Iranian oil and earlier moves to reduce imports.\n\nThe Indian government has yet to comment on its being granted a waiver, along with seven other countries. India\u2019s top oil supplier is Iraq, followed by Iran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe former diplomat, Pinak Chakravarty, said Tuesday that India reduced its oil imports from Iran during an earlier round of sanctions.\n\nHe says it was a \u201cquid pro quo that if you scale it down a bit, then the U.S. would arrange for this sanctions waiver.\u201d\n\nHe says imports cover almost 80 percent of India\u2019s energy needs, and that it must import from Iran in order to grow its economy.\n\nThe U.S. restored sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil industry this week that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear accord, which President Donald Trump withdrew from in May.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif says new American sanctions are an \u201cindiscriminate assault\u201d on his country.\n\nZarif made the comments Tuesday in an online video. He said the sanctions were aimed at forcing \u201cus to submit to (America\u2019s) will, no matter how absurd, unlawful or fundamentally flawed its demands are.\u201d\n\nZarif urged America to re-examine its \u201ccatastrophes\u201d in the Mideast. That includes its support of both Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\n___\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nDespite being granted a waiver, Turkey\u2019s president has criticized the resumption of sanctions on Iran calling it a destabilizing step.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Parliament on Tuesday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said the sanctions contravene international law and diplomacy, according to state-run Anadolu Agency.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration resumed sanctions on Iran on Monday, although Turkey is among eight major importers of Iranian oil who are spared temporarily from immediate penalties.\n\nAnadolu quoted Erdogan as saying: \u201cWe do not find sanctions to be right because to us, they are sanctions aimed at upsetting the global balance.\u201d\n\nAsked about Turkey\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d for when the temporary waiver is lifted, Erdogan recalled Turkey\u2019s dependence on oil and natural gas imports and said he cannot allow his citizens to \u201cfreeze in winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot abide by them (the sanctions), we cannot accept them,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\n___\n\n3:05 p.m.\n\nIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister holds out little hope for negotiations to ease tensions between Iran and the United States now that the Trump administration has re-imposed sanctions.\n\nAmbassador Seyed M.

Benjamin Watson used his touchdown catch to let everyone know that he and his wife are expecting \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be twins.\n\nThat was cause enough for celebration itself on a feel-good weekend for the NFL. So, too, was that bettors in Las Vegas and elsewhere finally turned the tables and took the bookies for millions of dollars.\n\nThey could have just as easily been popping champagne corks at NFL headquarters in New York. A season that began in turmoil has reached its midpoint and the league is riding a new high, with television ratings up and fans filling stadiums to cheer their favorite teams.\n\nSuddenly, the NFL is fun once again.\n\nIt showed Sunday in a shootout in New Orleans that was widely entertaining even without the touchdown props. Then, if any further evidence was needed, it was provided in prime time when Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers squared off in a showdown of quarterback greats.\n\nBrady and the New England Patriots won that one, and once again are treating another visit to the Super Bowl as their birthright. Out west, meanwhile, the Rams are trying to win fans again in Los Angeles with a team that could find its way to Atlanta, too.\n\nAnd a new group of exciting young quarterbacks are letting everyone know the future of the sport is in good hands.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Well, plenty, especially if President Trump takes an interest in the league once again.\n\nBut these are good times for a league that has taken blow after blow the last few years only to emerge with its position of America\u2019s favorite sport safely intact.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the best,\u201d Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said at last month\u2019s owner meetings. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s ironic since we\u2019ve had some criticism, too. But I think that\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nWhat is really healthy are offenses around the league, with scoring at record levels and 27 of 32 teams averaging more than 20 points a game. New rule changes designed to protect the quarterback and free up offenses have worked exactly as planned, despite some grumbling early by players upset they couldn\u2019t hit like they did in the past.\n\nHealthy indeed. Things are so good that even Roger Goodell couldn\u2019t mess it up.\n\nActually, maybe he can. Not many were paying attention, but there were still a few protests during the anthem over the weekend and the issue is one presidential tweet away from blowing up once again.\n\nMeanwhile, Colin Kaepernick remains unemployed, something everyone in the league should be ashamed about.\n\nFor now, though, the attention is on the game itself. And it can be argued that the game has never looked better.\n\nThere\u2019s no confusion anymore about when a catch is really a catch, and even Clay Matthews of the Packers seems to have figured out how and when to safely take down the opposing quarterback.\n\nThere are dominant teams on both coasts, and a few high scoring games that are reminiscent of the old American Football League. The concussion issue has subsided, though the disturbing fact remains players are still suffering from them \u2014 at great risk to their long term health.\n\nEven fans of the hapless Cleveland Browns have something to be happy about with a couple of wins and a couple coaches fired. They also have a franchise quarterback in Baker Mayfield and a potential upside that\u2019s the envy of better teams.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen exactly by design. A lot of the NFL\u2019s good fortune is due to good luck and an unwillingness of fans to let go of their favorite sport despite its many flaws.\n\nThere still is no real grand plan to end the protest debate, no long term solution to the fact football played at the highest level can shorten lives. The officiating continues to get in the way \u2014 often at just the wrong time \u2014 and there\u2019s a real chance games aren\u2019t played when the current collective bargaining agreement expires and players finally make a stand for guaranteed contracts.\n\nFor now, though, those are distant threats. The league remains the most popular in the country by far, and the addition of legalized betting around the country will boost it even more just like fantasy football has done in recent years.\n\nWhat once looked like a season lost is now looking like a season to remember.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Pat Graham, File)\n\nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Just the other day, the 6-foot-8 redshirt freshman quietly slipped on his Colorado basketball jersey for a photo shoot.\n\nInstant tears. A simple task he doesn\u2019t take for granted .\n\nLast December, Evan Battey was playing hoops with his buddies when his right leg went numb. Then, his right arm. He tried to speak but couldn\u2019t. Battey suffered a stroke that day along with two seizures.\n\nNearly 11 months later, the 20-year-old forward from California will make his Buffaloes debut \u2014 with feeling back and his speech constantly improving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful to be out here,\u201d said Battey, whose team opens the season next Tuesday against Drake. \u201cI\u2019m thankful just to be alive today.\u201d\n\nLooking back, there were signs for Battey, who redshirted last season due to NCAA eligibility requirements. Like how two months before his stroke he was unable to pronounce words following a weightlifting session. He texted his mom, Rosalind Lewis, that he felt funny.\n\nBut his speech soon returned. He pushed the episode from his mind, because \u201cI was in the best shape of my life at the time,\u201d Battey explained .\n\nThe day after Christmas, Battey and his buddies were playing basketball at a Los Angeles gym when he experienced numbness from head-to-toe. His friends called his mom, who happened to be a few minutes away and quickly drove over. By the time she arrived, he was walking on his own but his speech appeared weakened. She took him to the emergency room where doctors performed a scan and discovered a blood clot. He was given a drug to break up the clot and transported to another facility specializing in strokes. While in the ambulance, Battey suffered a seizure. At the facility, he had another.\n\nAfter four days in the hospital going through a battery of neurological and cardiology exams, the doctors had no explanation for what caused his stroke. It remains unknown.\n\n\u201cThe good news was the tests came back as, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s going to be long-term effects,\u2019\u201d Colorado coach Tad Boyle said.\n\nAt first, Battey\u2019s balance was off. He struggled to make a fist with his right hand. His smile was uneven. But everything gradually returned through physical therapy. His speech remains a work in progress.\n\nTwo weeks after his stroke, the Buffaloes were playing at Southern California and Battey attended morning practice. For the first time \u2014 and with his right arm still feeling weak \u2014 he shot a few 3-pointers.\n\nHe made one. Then another. And another.\n\n\u201cI was feeling it,\u201d he said. \u201cI was making them all from muscle memory. It was a good sign for my teammates to see that I\u2019m shooting again.\u201d\n\nBattey returned to Boulder in time for January classes, diligently going through physical rehab (he struggled to write) and speech therapy (he recited song lyrics to progress enunciation). He attended home games to cheer on his teammates.\n\n\u201cIt was hard, because I couldn\u2019t be that vocal guy on the sideline,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when you have a stroke, you know what you want to say, you just can\u2019t articulate it.\u201d\n\nBy early May, he had most of the feeling back on his right side and returned to practice. At first, he was a little hesitant: What if it happened again?\n\nTake his time. No rush. That was Boyle\u2019s message. It\u2019s been his message.\n\nBoyle had a conversation with Battey soon after his stroke: His scholarship was good even if he didn\u2019t play a minute with the Buffaloes. All he wanted was Battey to be healthy.\n\nBut his desire to play was burning. He hadn\u2019t played for a school team in quite a while.\n\nBattey missed his senior season at Villa Park High School in Orange County because of an eligibility rule stemming from him repeating the ninth grade. Instead, the affable Battey served as a coach for the big men and the team\u2019s JV squad that season.\n\nHis academic issues followed him to Boulder with the NCAA ruling him out since he did not meet the initial eligibility requirement of graduation from high school in four years.\n\nSteadily, he\u2019s getting back into a rhythm again.\n\n\u201cI sometimes think about my health when I\u2019m sitting in class or lying in bed, but not when I\u2019m on the floor,\u201d said Battey , who played 27 minutes and had seven points in an exhibition game against Colorado School of Mines over the weekend. \u201cI just love the game so much.\u201d\n\nAt practice, Battey wears a heart monitor (the entire team does). If his soars too high, he rests. He will be closely monitored in games by the Colorado training staff.\n\n\u201cWe know what\u2019s normal and when things become abnormal, we\u2019ll be quick to shut him down,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cUp to this point, he\u2019s been fine.\u201d\n\nThis summer went a long way toward alleviating any lingering doubt. He traveled with the USA East Coast team on a four-game trip to Italy. Along for the excursion were his mom and sister.\n\n\u201cI needed to be there,\u201d his mom said, \u201cto see how he was doing and see him in that environment. It was wonderful.\u201d\n\nLast week, Battey stayed after practice to hone the foot work on his jumper.\n\nOn the far end, Boyle just watched.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve had as much respect for a player I\u2019ve coached, in terms of what they\u2019ve been through off the court, as I have been for Evan Battey,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cMy expectation level of Evan is so high, because I think he has an opportunity to be such a good player.\u201d\n\nFor Battey, the excitement is already building for opening night. His mom will be there. Same with his dad, Earl.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to control my emotions,\u201d Battey said. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "A currency trader watches the computer monitors at the foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

Williams had served as defensive coordinator for several teams since his firing as head coach in Buffalo 15 years ago, but he said that was only because he had turned down multiple offers to be a head coach again.\n\nHe said he had \u201c11 letters sent in to interview for head coaching jobs\u201d and \u201cfour of them I didn\u2019t even have to show up, just sign the contract and come.\u201d\n\nThe NFL suspended Williams for the 2012 season after ruling that while the Saints defensive coordinator he orchestrated a program by which players were paid for knocking opponents from a game.\n\n\u201cThat thing was a long time ago,\u201d Williams said when asked if he ever imagined being a head coach again. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re talking about now.\u201d\n\nSERGEANT SIT-UP-STRAIGHT\n\nDetroit\u2019s rookie head coach had a terse exchange with a reporter while discussing the Lions\u2019 trade of leading receiver Golden Tate to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team they could be fighting in the NFL wild-card race, for a third-round pick, a move that could hurt in the short-term but pay dividends down the road.\n\nWhen the reporter asked why he thought this move makes the Lions better, Patricia snapped, \u201cDo me a favor and just kind of sit up, just like, have a little respect for the process.\u201d\n\nThis from a coach who wore sweatpants to meet the media during Super Bowl week last February.\n\nThe reporter promptly sat up straight, asked his question again, and Patricia politely answered.\n\nAfter the Lions\u2019 24-9 loss at Minnesota in which Matthew Stafford was sacked 10 times, the Detroit News trolled Patricia with this bold headline above a photo of the prone QB: \u201dPoor Posture .\u201d\n\nVEXED VANCE\n\nJoseph lost for the 17th time in 25 games Sunday when Brandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired, turning a potential 20-19 thriller into a crushing 19-17 loss to the Texans and former teammate Demaryius Thomas.\n\nJoseph was left to answer questions for two days about his questionable decisions at the end of both halves.\n\nMcManus also missed from 62 yards in the second quarter, leaving the Texans with the ball at the Broncos 48 and 18 seconds left, enough time for Deshaun Watson to get Houston into field goal range itself.\n\nThe six-point swing proved the difference when McManus missed consecutive field goals for the first time in his five-year NFL career, pushing his 51-yarder wide right as time expired in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThe one before half, that was totally on me.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Federal and state officials have been working for nearly two years to shore up the nation\u2019s election infrastructure from cyberattacks by Russians or others seeking to disrupt the voting process.\n\nIt turns out that many of the problems are closer to home.\n\nEarly voting leading up to Tuesday\u2019s midterm election revealed a wide variety of concerns with voting and registration systems around the country \u2014 from machines that changed voter selections to registration forms tossed out because of clerical errors.\n\nElection officials and voting rights groups fear that voter confidence in the results could be undermined if such problems become even more widespread on Election Day, as millions of Americans head to the polls to decide pivotal races for Congress and governor.\n\nAlready there is concern that last-minute court rulings on voter ID requirements, the handling of absentee ballots and other issues in a handful of states will sow confusion among voters and poll workers.\n\n\u201cWe expect poll workers will be overwhelmed, just as voters are overwhelmed, and there will be lots of provisional ballots,\u201d said Sara Henderson, head of Common Cause in Georgia, where voting-rights groups have been raising numerous concerns about election security and voter access.\n\nThe problems come amid a surge of interest, with registrations and early-voting turnout running well ahead of what is typically seen during a midterm election.\n\nThe election marks the first nationwide voting since Russia targeted state election systems in the 2016 presidential race. Federal, state and local officials have been working to make the nation\u2019s myriad election systems more secure. They have beefed up their cybersecurity protections and improved communications and intelligence-sharing.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FBI and other federal agencies have opened a command center to help state and local election offices with any major problems that arise.\n\n\u201cWe want them to be as informed as possible,\u201d said Matt Masterson, senior cybersecurity adviser with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThere have been no signs so far that Russia or any other foreign actor has tried to launch cyberattacks against voting systems in any state, according to federal authorities.\n\nBut early voting and voter registration has been problematic in a number of states. Problems include faulty machines in Texas and North Carolina, inaccurate mailers in Missouri and Montana, and voter registration problems in Georgia and Tennessee.\n\nIn other states, including Kansas, Election Day polling places have been closed or consolidated, leading to worries that voters will be disenfranchised if they can\u2019t find a way to get there and cast a ballot.\n\nQuestions about election integrity erupted in recent days in Georgia, where the governor\u2019s race is among the most closely watched elections in the country.\n\nOver the weekend, reports of security vulnerabilities within the state\u2019s online voter registration portal prompted a flurry of accusations from the Secretary of State\u2019s office, which is overseen by Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp. His office claimed without providing evidence that Democrats had tried to hack into the system. Democrats dismissed that as an effort to distract voters from a problem in a system Kemp oversees.\n\nDHS officials have boasted that the 2018 midterms will be the most secure election in U.S. history, pointing to federal intrusion-detection sensors that will protect \u201c90 percent of election infrastructure,\u201d as DHS Undersecretary Christopher Krebs tweeted in mid-October. Those sensors sniff for malicious traffic, and are installed on election systems in 45 states.\n\nBut similar sensors used at the federal level have performed quite badly. According to a Sept. 14 letter from the Office of Management and Budget, those sensors had a 99 percent failure rate from April 2017 onward, when they detected only 379 out of almost 40,000 \u201cincidents\u201d across federal civilian networks.\n\nNationally, some 6,500 poll watchers are being deployed by a coalition of civil rights and voting advocacy groups to assist people who encounter problems at the polls. That is more than double the number sent to polling places in 2016, while the number of federal election monitors has declined.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christina Almeida Cassidy at https://twitter.com/AP_Christina and Colleen Long at http://twitter.com/ctlong1\n\nhttps://twitter.com/\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "A home rests on its side Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, after a deadly tornado blew the house off its foundation in Christiana, Tenn.

At least three other twisters were confirmed, two in Alabama and another in Tennessee, the agency said, and teams were still assessing others sites.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center said nine possible tornado strikes were reported.\n\nTennessee Coordinator of Elections Mark Goins said the polling places that had electricity knocked out are operating on generators and have emergency ballots ready for voters. He said the paper ballots would be counted Tuesday. He said the largest area of power outages was in Knox County, where nearly 20,000 customers were without power Tuesday morning.\n\nIn West Virginia, storms caused two voting precincts to open a little late but didn\u2019t cause any lasting problems.\n\nWest Virginia Secretary of State\u2019s spokesman Michael Queen said 14 precincts were without power at 5 a.m., but the office worked with several state and local agencies to put generators into place or to move precinct locations. Polling places without power used generators until electricity was restored so no paper ballots were necessary, he said.\n\nCrews worked to restore power to thousands of residents from Louisiana to South Carolina.\n\nParts of Tupelo, Mississippi, were closed off late Monday as debris, downed trees and power lines blocked roadways, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported . Tupelo Communications Director Leesha Faulkner said there also was a gas leak in a residential area.\n\nIn Rutherford County, Fire and Rescue spokeswoman Lisa Sloan said crews responded to a house blaze early Tuesday that appeared to have started from a lightning strike.

He says the county clerk will reconvene the absentee precinct board later Wednesday to complete the count.\n\nThe move comes as Republican Yvette Herrell and Democrat Xochitl Torres Small remain locked in a closely watched race for U.S. House seat in southern New Mexico.

The four Democrats who won seats Tuesday include District Judge Briana Zamora and attorneys Megan Duffy, Kristina Bogardus and Jacqueline Medina.\n\nThe 10-member Court of Appeals is the first and often final appellate court for most type of cases in the state.\n\n___\n\n10:57 p.m.\n\nDemocratic state lawmaker Stephanie Garcia Richard has been elected as New Mexico\u2019s next state land commissioner, making her the first woman to hold the office in the state\u2019s history.\n\nGarcia Richard finished ahead of Republican Patrick Lyons and Libertarian Michael Lucero to fill the open seat. Current Land Commissioner Aubrey Dunn did not seek re-election, setting up the three-way contest.\n\nGarcia Richard is three-term state lawmaker from the Los Alamos area. She\u2019s the chair of the House Education Committee and works as an administrator with the Pojoaque Valley School District.\n\nSome have criticized her for a lack of experience when it comes to land issues. She argues that her knowledge about the classroom would provide an important perspective for the State Land Office because its top priority is raising money for education.\n\n___\n\n10:12 p.m.\n\nNew Mexico voters have approved a constitutional amendment that seeks to bring the state court system one step closer toward streamlining the appeals process for some low-level cases.\n\nThe measure also had the support of members of the state judiciary.\n\nWhile it seeks to change an obscure segment of state law, supporters say it could result in notable savings in both cost and time for busy courthouses, like those in Bernalillo County, which includes Albuquerque.\n\nThe amendment proposes allowing lawmakers to begin reviewing the appeals court process for cases that originate in probate and magistrate courts, as well as the Metropolitan Court in Bernalillo County.\n\nAfter hearings, debate and analysis, lawmakers could then vote to decide whether the requests for the lower-level cases to be overturned or retried should be allowed to proceed directly to the New Mexico Court of Appeals.\n\n___\n\n10 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Brian Colon has been elected to serve as New Mexico\u2019s next state auditor.\n\nThe Albuquerque attorney defeated Republican Wayne Johnson, who has served as auditor since 2017 when he was appointed to the post by Gov. Susana Martinez. Colon was able to significantly out-fundraise Johnson over the course of the campaign.\n\nNo stranger to politics, Colon once served as Democratic Party chairman.

She announced her bid for re-election in 2017, saying she wanted to continue implementing reforms of the state\u2019s campaign finance rules as well as increasing voter education in rural and Native American communities.\n\nToulouse Oliver made waves earlier this year when she tried to include the option of straight-party voting on this year\u2019s ballots. The New Mexico Supreme Court ended up blocking the move, but she vowed to continue looking for ways to increase voter registration and turnout.\n\n___\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan has won a sixth term representing northern New Mexico\u2019s 3rd District.\n\nHe defeated Republican Jerald Steve McFall and Libertarian Chris Manning on Tuesday. Lujan campaigned on efforts to advance immigration reform, expand Medicaid and address climate change.\n\nLujan has spearheaded efforts since 2014 to cut short Republican control of Congress as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. He has long pushed for congressional candidates from diverse backgrounds.\n\nMcFall is an Angel Fire, New Mexico, farmer and political newcomer who waged an uphill battle in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-1. He ran on supporting immigration restrictions, opposing abortion and protecting young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\n\nManning is a businessman who ran on controlling spending.\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Hector Balderas has been re-elected to a second term as New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor in a three-way race against a Republican immigration attorney and an Albuquerque land and water rights attorney.\n\nBalderas finished ahead of Michael Hendricks and A.

He\u2019s a former state lawmaker, former state auditor and a graduate of the University of New Mexico School of Law.\n\nBalderas was first elected attorney general in 2014 after serving two terms as state auditor.

Phil Griego.\n\n___\n\n8:51 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham has won election as governor of New Mexico to succeed a two-term Republican amid simmering conflicts over struggling public schools and high poverty rates.\n\nThe reins of state government will pass from one Latina to another as termed-out Gov. Susana Martinez leaves office.\n\nLujan Grisham has been a leading critic in Congress of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies on immigration.\n\nThe 59-year-old former state health secretary defeated Republican Rep. Steve Pearce in a campaign focused on expanding preschool education, lowering crime rates and reducing poverty.\n\nLujan Grisham is embracing new investment in solar and wind energy and has pledged to comply with a court order to help poor and minority students.\n\n___\n\n8:50 p.m.\n\nNew Mexico voters have approved a constitutional amendment that clears the way for the creation of an independent ethics commission.\n\nThe proposal was on the ballot this year after many years of debate in the Legislature over establishing such a panel to address complaints involving elected officials, public employees and others.\n\nThe state has had a string of public corruption scandals going back more than a decade, with two state treasurers, two state senators, a secretary of state and a deputy insurance superintendent going to prison on criminal charges.\n\nMost recently, a former state taxation and revenue secretary is facing felony charges of embezzlement and using a position in government for personal gain.\n\nThe number of states with ethics commissions has steadily increased in recent years, leaving New Mexico as one of six without one, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n___\n\n8:36 p.m.\n\nDemocrat Debra Haaland has defeated Republican Janice E.

Martin Heinrich has been re-elected in a three-way race against a Republican political newcomer and a Libertarian former governor.\n\nThe 47-year-old engineer and former Congressman won a second term, finishing ahead of construction contractor Mick Rich and former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. Heinrich\u2019s victory further solidifies Democratic control over the state\u2019s Senate delegation.\n\nHeinrich cast himself as a vigorous adversary of President Donald Trump\u2019s policies in the Senate, and campaigned on promises to defend federal health care and retirement programs.\n\nHeinrich recently became an advocate for decriminalizing marijuana, co-opting one of Johnson\u2019s signature Libertarian issues against government interference. He derided Johnson\u2019s proposals to slash federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid and the military.\n\nRich ran on his reputation as a businessman while embracing Trump and voicing anti-abortion sentiments.\n\n___\n\n5:50 p.m.\n\nCandidates for governor of New Mexico are making last-minute appeals for support at polling places and restaurants in Albuquerque.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate and Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham stopped at a coffee house in the Barelas neighborhood Tuesday to eat and shake hands.\n\nCampaign spokesman James Hallinan says Lujan Grisham voted in the afternoon along with family members at a middle school in a North Valley neighborhood.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep and gubernatorial candidate Steve Pearce visited the polls in Albuquerque and stopped at a Vietnamese restaurant.

Kate Brown makes a heart-shape with her hands as she addresses the crowd after winning re-election in Portland, Ore., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (AP Photo/Steve Dykes)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown was re-elected Tuesday, saying she won her first full term as leader of the Pacific Northwest state in a \u201cslam-dunk.\u201d\n\nBrown noted that several female candidates had won governorships in the Tuesday elections, and that Oregon voters had rejected a ballot measure to repeal the state\u2019s sanctuary status for immigrants.\n\n\u201cWith this election cycle we tripled the number of Democratic women governors serving in this country,\u201d Brown told a cheering crowd at another Portland hotel. \u201cTonight, we can say we fought to keep Oregon a welcoming and inclusive place for all.\u201d\n\nWith 61 percent of the vote counted, Brown had 50 percent of the vote and her opponent Republican Knute Buehler with 44 percent. Polls had predicted a tighter race.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a tossup. It\u2019s not even a close call,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slam dunk!\u201d\n\nKnute Buehler, a Republican member of the Oregon House whose term expires around the end of the year, conceded defeat before a group of dejected supporters at a Portland hotel.\n\n\u201cTonight I lost an election, but I do think this competitive governor\u2019s race has made all of us better, that democracy has won,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition is good for all of us - and we offered voters a choice.\u201d\n\nThe orthopedic surgeon said he\u2019d go on vacation while he figures out what to do next.\n\nBrown was first appointed governor in February 2015 after Gov. John Kitzhaber resigned. She easily was elected in her own right in 2016 to finish out the term of Kitzhaber, who resigned amid accusations of influence peddling involving his fiancee.\n\nThe 58-year-old Brown was a long-time state lawmaker before becoming secretary of state in 2009.\n\nThe last Republican elected governor in Oregon was Victor Atiyeh, who served from 1979 to 1987.\n\nBuehler sought middle ground on issues like immigration and criticized the Trump administration for pursuing rule changes that could hurt health care for immigrants.\n\nBuehler had been criticized by immigration advocates upset at his support for Measure 105. That initiative would repeal Oregon\u2019s three-decade old sanctuary law, which limits state and local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\nBrown used the immigration issue to try to tie Buehler to the right wing of his party and criticized Buehler for supporting the measure, which she argues could lead to racial profiling and discourage immigrants from reporting crimes to the police.\n\nDuring debates and the campaign, the candidates also returned repeatedly to the state\u2019s public pension crisis, the state\u2019s biggest fiscal issue. Buehler said he wants to transition state employees to a private-sector style, 401(k) retirement plan and accused the governor of \u201cpandering\u201d to public employee unions by raising pay before instituting broad pension reform.\n\nBrown said public employees \u201cneed to have some skin in the game,\u201d and pay some of their own pension costs, but didn\u2019t offer specifics.\n\nThe governor resisted the notion of wholesale cuts, attacking Buehler at one debate directly: \u201cI think it\u2019s easy for a millionaire to say he\u2019s going to cut the retirements of hard-working Oregonians. I\u2019m not willing to do that.\u201d\n\nGrayson Dempsey, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, said of Brown\u2019s win: \u201cI will say that the stakes right now in America are too high to have anything less than a true champion (of abortion rights) in the governor\u2019s office.

Cathy McMorris Rodgers was re-elected to her eighth term in Congress Tuesday, dashing the hopes of Democrats to topple the highest ranking GOP woman in the House.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, who ranks fourth in House leadership, captured more than 55 percent of the vote over her Democratic challenger, Lisa Brown, a former state Senate leader.\n\nThe 5th Congressional District is centered in Spokane and has not elected a Democrat since former House Speaker Tom Foley last won in 1992. McMorris Rodgers won an open seat in 2004 and has generally cruised to easy victories since.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, speaking to cheering supporters in a downtown Spokane hotel on Tuesday night, called the election \u201ca battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep listening,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep learning and keep getting results on the issues that matter most.\u201d\n\nBrown, a former chancellor of Washington State University who previously served as majority leader in the state Senate, gave her concession speech to supporters in Spokane during which she repeated many of the themes of her campaign.\n\n\u201cWe put this race on the national map,\u201d she said, noting that she decided to run because of concerns over runaway health care costs.\n\nWhile Democrats were on track to take control of the U.S. House, they will have to wait a few more days on the remaining two competitive races in the state.\n\nWashington is a vote-by-mail state, and voters had a deadline of 8 p.m. to have their ballot postmarked or placed in a drop box, which leaves about half of the vote outstanding at the end of the night. In some of the more competitive races, results may not be known for days as most counties will update vote counts only once a day.\n\nOne of the most expensive races in the country is the 8th District, which became a key battleground after Republican Rep. Dave Reichert announced he was retiring at the end of the year.\n\nThe race between Dr. Kim Schrier, a Democrat and pediatrician, and Republican Dino Rossi, a former state senator who had previous unsuccessful runs for governor and the U.S. Senate, drew more $25 million, with most coming from outside groups.\n\nSchrier had captured about 53 percent of the vote in early returns.\n\nIn a written statement, Schrier said that Tuesday\u2019s numbers \u201cprove that voters in the 8th District want a new voice in Congress.\u201d Andrew Bell, Rossi\u2019s campaign manager, said the campaign was encouraged by Rossi\u2019s lead in one of the counties \u2014 Pierce \u2014 but were waiting to see what the next day\u2019s ballot drop looked like.\n\nIn the 3rd Congressional District in southwest Washington, Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler was leading Democrat Carolyn Long, a political science professor at Washington State University\u2019s campus in Vancouver. When Herrera Beutler was elected in 2010, Republicans claimed a seat the GOP hadn\u2019t held since 1994. The district became even more conservative after redistricting took effect with the 2012 elections.\n\nAt the end of the evening, Herrera Beutler had about 52 percent of the vote.\n\nIn a written statement, Long said she was proud of her campaign and said she was \u201ccommitted to making sure every vote is counted and the voice of every voter in Southwest Washington is heard.\u201d\n\nHerrera Beutler said she was \u201cconfident that the lead we have tonight will hold.\u201d\n\nCurrently there are six Democrats and four Republicans in the state\u2019s House delegation. The other seven incumbents were all easily re-elected: Democratic Reps. Suzan DelBene, Rick Larsen, Derek Kilmer, Pramila Jayapal, Adam Smith, Denny Heck and Republican Rep.

Dubbed Idaho\u2019s \u201cgap population,\u201d they were often left with no way to access basic medical treatment, instead relying on expensive emergency room visits as untreated health problems became health crises.\n\nGroups such as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network celebrated the passing of Proposition 2, saying it would allow more Idaho residents to access basic preventative care like cancer screenings.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the biggest determining factor whether someone survives after a cancer diagnosis is whether they have health insurance,\u201d Luke Cavener with ACS CAN wrote in a prepared statement. \u201cWith the passage of Proposition 2, we take a big leap in the fight against this devastating disease.\u201d\n\nThe Medicaid expansion citizen initiative took shape after Idaho lawmakers for years refused to expand Medicaid or take other steps to significantly increase access to health care.\n\nOpponents \u2014 including many lawmakers elected on Tuesday like Russ Fulcher, who will represent Idaho\u2019s 1st Congressional District, and Janice McGeachin, who will be the state\u2019s first female lieutenant governor \u2014 have said that expanding Medicaid coverage would force the state to pull money from other needs like education and infrastructure. Opponents have also argued that allowing able-bodied low-income adults to access Medicaid would serve as a financial shortcut for some rather than expecting them to come up with ways to cover their own healthcare costs.\n\nBut proponents of Medicaid expansion say the move will ultimately drive down state health care costs by reducing the costs of indigent care borne by local governments and health care facilities. The expansion will be primarily covered by federal tax dollars, although the state will have to kick in a portion of funding.\n\nStill, proponents say the state would also save money because it would allow working low-income Idahoans to be healthier, able to contribute to the economy and care for their families.\n\nProposition 1 was also a contentious campaign, with proponents of the \u201chistorical horse racing terminals\u201d saying they would bring badly needed revenue to Idaho\u2019s struggling horse racing industry. The slot-like betting machines allow gamblers to watch a video of a historical horse race \u2014 with all identifying information removed \u2014 and bet on the winners. Players can also choose to ignore the race video and instead let the machine make automatic bets, watching a display of traditional slot-machine images such as diamonds, cherries or other symbols to learn if they won.\n\nLawmakers first approved the instant horse racing machines in 2013 but repealed the law two years later over concerns that they looked too much like casino-style machines. That\u2019s when proponents of horse racing and the instant racing terminals launched the effort to bring them back through the ballot initiative.\n\nOpponents criticized the effort as disingenuous, saying the state shouldn\u2019t give special exemptions to gambling rules to prop up struggling private businesses.\n\nKen Andrus and Ernie Stensgar, both with Idaho United Against Prop 1, said in a joint prepared statement early Wednesday morning that the vote showed the initiative was \u201ca bad bet for Idahoans.\u201d", "Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi won re-election Tuesday, and a special election for the state\u2019s other Senate seat is headed to a runoff.\n\nMississippi voters will either elect a woman to the Senate for the first time ever or will send a black man to the Senate for the first time since Reconstruction.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy advanced Tuesday from a field of four candidates. The winner of the Nov. 27 runoff will serve the final two years of a term started by Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired in April.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith, who was state agriculture commissioner, to temporarily succeed Cochran until the special election is decided. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in either chamber of Congress, but no woman has been elected to the job from the state. She is endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nWith Bryant by her side Tuesday night, Hyde-Smith told supporters that she needs them and their friends and family to turn out again in three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight like nobody\u2019s business,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring all the conservatives in this state together.\u201d\n\nAt his own party in Jackson, Espy asked supporters if they will continue to stand with him in a runoff: \u201cWill you vote with me to make sure everyone deserves a chance in Mississippi, irrespective of age or race or sexual orientation or party? Will you stand with me to make sure that happens?\u201d\n\nThe crowd responded: \u201cYeah!\u201d\n\nEspy continued: \u201cAnd would you make sure you stand with me and vote to make sure everyone knows that Mississippi is moving forward?\u201d\n\nWicker on Tuesday defeated Democratic state Rep. David Baria and two candidates who ran low-budget campaigns. Wicker was appointed to Senate in 2007 and elected in 2008 and 2012. He is a fiscal and social conservative who serves on the Armed Forces Committee and led the Republicans\u2019 senatorial campaign committee in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue building our military strength,\u201d Wicker told The Associated Press on Tuesday night. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working on broadband for rural states like Mississippi. We\u2019re going to continue doing constituent service, and we\u2019re going to make sure health insurance coverage is more competitive and the cost of premiums doesn\u2019t continue to expand.\u201d\n\nBaria said he ran on a vision of \u201ca Mississippi that is welcoming to everyone.\u201d\n\nEspy was elected to the U.S. House from the Mississippi Delta in 1986, becoming the first African-American member of Congress from the state in the 20th Century. In 1993 and 1994, Espy was U.S. agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton. Democrats are pinning hopes on Espy to become the first in their party since 1982 to win one of Mississippi\u2019s Senate seats. He would be the first African-American in the U.S. Senate from Mississippi since Reconstruction, and he\u2019s campaigning as someone who could unify people across lines of race and party.\n\nHyde-Smith gave her first speech on the Senate floor in support of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who was facing accusations of sexual misconduct that he strongly denied. Hyde-Smith was one of two female senators who sat behind Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine as Collins announced her own support for Kavanaugh, and Hyde-Smith voted with the Republican majority to confirm him.\n\nAlthough party labels did not appear the special election ballot, candidates let voters know their party affiliation. The candidates eliminated from the race Tuesday were Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who nearly unseated Cochran in a bitter 2014 primary; and Democrat Tobey Bernard Bartee, a former military intelligence officer who ran a low-budget campaign.\n\nMcDaniel campaigned as a conservative in the mold of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, saying he frequently disagrees with the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nMcDaniel never conceded to Cochran in 2014, saying it was wrong that Democrats voted in a Republican runoff. Mississippi voters don\u2019t register by party, and the only people restricted from voting in a Republican primary runoff are those who voted in the Democratic primary that same election cycle. McDaniel conceded Tuesday night, saying at his party in Laurel: \u201cThey won this one fair and square. It\u2019s not like it was in 2014.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel also called on Republicans to unite behind Hyde-Smith. \u201cMr. Espy cannot be allowed to win this seat,\u201d he said.\n\nCorey Thomas, 47, of Jackson, a self-employed T-shirt maker, said he was voting for Democrats in both Senate races. Thomas said he was especially displeased with Hyde-Smith\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cHer whole ticket is, \u2018I\u2019m with Trump. ... We\u2019re going to get this wall up for the illegals and we\u2019re going to do this and we\u2019re going to do that,\u2019\u201d Thomas said. \u201cEverything she\u2019s saying has nothing to do with Mississippi. ... I just really don\u2019t want to hear about the high jinx and shenanigans that we see daily. And you support that? If you\u2019re supportive of that, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s intelligent at all. And I really don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re for the common person that lives in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nCarolyn Myers, 85, of Ridgeland, is retired from working in administrative offices for insurance companies. Myers said she voted for Republicans in both of Mississippi\u2019s U.S. Senate races. Myers described herself as a strong supporter of Trump.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a terrific job, and he needs help. ... We should send people to help him,\u201d Myers said.\n\nSpeaking of Hyde-Smith, Myers said: \u201cI\u2019ve seen her on TV and she seems like a very nice person and she\u2019s backing Trump.

The Republican has dispatched 23 opponents in his congressional career, which has spanned presidencies from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump.\n\nHe said his experience is key to getting things done for Alaska in Congress and that Galvin, if she had been elected, would start at the bottom of the seniority list.\n\nGalvin, making her first run for political office, says Young was once an effective representative but those days are gone. The state was ready for new leadership, she said.\n\nThe race turned ornery at times, with Young accusing Galvin of being nasty toward him and Galvin accusing him of hurting her hand with a post-debate handshake.\n\nShe called that a \u201ccheap bullying\u201d trick. He claims she staged it to make him appear too aggressive.\n\nAfter a subsequent debate, Young walked out of the TV studio without speaking to her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t acknowledge her because very frankly, I don\u2019t believe she can do the job, and why should I acknowledge somebody who tried to stage something for publicity?\u201d he said.\n\nGalvin says people are tired of Young\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks.\n\n\u201cAlaskans really want to get out of that business of name calling,\u201d she said.

Henry McMaster secured his first full term in office Tuesday, achieving the office he\u2019s held for two years but long sought to win on his own merit.\n\nThis is the first election in which South Carolina has elected its governor and lieutenant governor on a ticket. With the win, McMaster\u2019s running mate, businesswoman Pamela Evette, becomes the second woman elected to the state\u2019s second-highest office and the first Republican woman to do so.\n\nIn defeating Democratic state Rep. James Smith in Tuesday\u2019s general election, Republican McMaster\u2019s victory also was a win for President Donald Trump, who had endorsed him and made several visits to South Carolina on the governor\u2019s behalf.\n\nMcMaster\u2019s ties to Trump are older than either man\u2019s administration. In early 2016, then-Lt. Gov. McMaster threw his support behind Trump\u2019s presidential bid, becoming the first statewide-elected official in the country to do so.\n\nThe move surprised many allies and friends of the longtime member of South Carolina\u2019s establishment GOP circles. But McMaster\u2019s wager paid dividends a year later, when Trump picked Nikki Haley as his U.N. ambassador, allowing McMaster to ascend to the governor\u2019s office.\n\nMcMaster, 71, served two terms as South Carolina\u2019s attorney general and previously led the state\u2019s Republican Party. He lost a previous gubernatorial bid, coming in third in a four-way GOP primary in 2010 to Haley.\n\nAlthough his position allowed him the mantle of running as an incumbent, McMaster drew four Republican challengers for this year\u2019s primary election. Forced into a runoff, McMaster ultimately defeated businessman John Warren.\n\nAP VoteCast found that, for 42 percent of South Carolina voters, Trump was not a factor they considered while casting their votes. By comparison, 29 percent said a reason for their vote was to express support for Trump, and 29 percent said they voted to express opposition to Trump.\n\nVoters in South Carolina had mixed views of Trump: 54 percent said they approve of how he is handling his job as president, while 46 percent said they disapprove of Trump.\n\nAP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of about 138,000 voters and nonvoters \u2014 including 3,800 voters and 664 nonvoters in the state of New Jersey \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nSmith, 51, has represented the Columbia area in the state Legislature for more than 20 years.

(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Resigned to the loss of one-party control over Washington in Tuesday\u2019s elections, President Donald Trump stared down the prospect of endless House investigations, stymied policy efforts and fresh questions about the resilience of his unorthodox political coalition. He celebrated GOP success hanging on to the Senate and distanced himself from any blame.\n\nTrump stayed quiet for much of election night as Republicans maintained their hold on the Senate and Democrats captured control of the House \u2014 a shift all but certain to redefine his presidency. Late in the evening, he offered a brief tweet that simply read: \u201cTremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!\u201d\n\nEarly Wednesday, Trump declared on Twitter: \u201cNow we can all get back to work and get things done!\u201d The president was expected to further address the results and his role in the outcome at a White House news conference later Wednesday.\n\nTrump called House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, a conversation that her office said included congratulations and a nod to her pitch for bipartisanship.\n\nWidely viewed as a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency, Tuesday\u2019s results offered a split decision that revealed deep tensions in the American electorate \u2014 distances that could easily widen during two years of divided control. Trump\u2019s aggressive campaign blitz, which paid off in some key victories, suggests he is likely to continue leaning into the fray.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is urging Republicans in Ohio to turn out for the midterm elections in order to keep his \"political movement going.\" (Nov. 5)\n\nControl of the House gives Democrats the ability to launch investigations into the president and stifle his agenda. But White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders minimized the magnitude of Democratic gains.\n\n\u201cMaybe you get a ripple, but I certainly don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a blue wave,\u201d she told reporters, pointing to several early Republican wins.\n\nAs for Republicans retaining control of the Senate, she called it \u201ca huge moment and victory for the president.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides called on Democrats to work with Republicans in the next Congress.\n\nSaid White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, \u201cI don\u2019t know that there will be much of an appetite for Democrat lawmakers to spend all of their time, or most of their time or even a fraction of their time investigating, instigating, trying to impeach and subpoena people.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his conversation with Pelosi, Trump called Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as a number of candidates he backed during the race, the White House said.\n\nTrump had aggressively campaigned in the closing days of the race, his focus on boosting Republicans in states that he carried in 2016. In the three races he targeted in the final day, Trump\u2019s picks all won Tuesday night, with Republican Mike Braun defeating Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Republican Josh Hawley defeating Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine defeating Democrat Richard Cordray in the race for Ohio governor\n\nThe White House for days has been stressing the historical headwinds it faced: In the last three decades, 2002 was the only midterm election when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats. And only twice in the past eight decades has the president\u2019s party picked up House seats in the midterms.\n\nTrump spent election night watching returns with family and friends at the White House, his shadow looming large over the results.\n\nNearly 40 percent of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate, while about 25 percent said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\nAnticipating the possibility of keeping the Senate but losing the House, aides in recent days had laid out the political reality to Trump, who could face an onslaught of Democratic-run investigations. In turn, Trump began trying out defensive arguments ahead of Election Day, noting that midterm losses are typical for the party in the White House, pointing out a high number of GOP retirements and stressing that he had kept his focus on the Senate.\n\nAides set up televisions in the White House residence for Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their guests to watch election results come in, with the sets tuned to different cable news channels. Among those expected were Trump\u2019s adult children, White House aides, Republican officials and presidential friends.\n\nThe election served as a referendum of sorts on Trump\u2019s racially charged appeals and the strength of the coalition that powered him to the White House \u2014 a group he will need again in just two years.\n\nOverall, more voters disapproved of Trump\u2019s job performance than approved \u2014 a finding that is largely consistent with recent polling. Voters scored Trump positively on the economy and for standing up \u201cfor what he believes in.\u201d But the president received negative marks from voters on temperament and trustworthiness.\n\nStill, about one-third of voters said Trump was not a factor in their votes.\n\nTrump\u2019s scorched-earth campaigning came to define the 2018 campaign.

(AP) \u2014 Incredibly close races down the ballot in Georgia left several races still hanging a day after the polls closed, with several statewide seats and two congressional races too tight to declare a winner.\n\nDemocrats, shut out of holding any statewide office in Georgia since 2010, put up fierce challenges Tuesday beyond the showdown for governor between Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams.\n\nAt least one race \u2014 the contest for Kemp\u2019s current job as secretary of state \u2014 will require a runoff Dec. 4 to determine a winner.\n\nElections for Georgia\u2019s open seat for insurance commissioner and two seats on the Public Service Commission could also go into a month of overtime. Those races remained too close to call Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, two Republican members of Congress were still waiting to learn their fates after facing strong Democratic challengers in metro Atlanta districts long considered safe for the GOP.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the high-profile contests beyond the gubernatorial battle.\n\nOPEN SEATS\n\nThe campaign to replace Kemp as Georga\u2019s top election official won\u2019t be settled until next month.\n\nFormer Democratic congressman John Barrow, who lost his House seat in 2014, advanced to a runoff with Republican state Rep. Brad Raffensperger. Libertarian Smythe Duval\u2019s presence in the race prevented any candidate from surpassing 50 percent of the vote as required to win.\n\nThe race to succeed Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens, who opted not to run again, remained too close to call. Republican Jim Beck, Hudgens\u2019 former chief of staff, led Democratic insurance agent Janice Laws in unofficial returns. But Beck was hovering near the threshold that could trigger a runoff in the three-way race with Libertarian Donnie Foster.\n\nSTATEWIDE VICTORIES\n\nRepublican Geoff Duncan will succeed Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who gave up his office to run unsuccessfully for governor.\n\nDuncan, a former state lawmaker, defeated Democratic businesswoman Sarah Riggs Amico in the race for the No. 2 statewide office. Duncan will be only the second Republican to hold the job since it debuted on the ballot in 1946. Democrats last won the office in 2002.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Chris Carr won his first election test since the governor appointed him two years ago to fill the unexpired term of his predecessor, Sam Olens. Unofficial returns showed Carr defeated Democrat Charlie Bailey, a former Fulton County prosecutor who has argued Carr lacks the legal experience the job demands.\n\nGOP state School Superintendent Richard Woods won a second term against Democrat Otha Thornton Jr., who was the first black man to serve as president of the National PTA.\n\nRepublican Labor Commissioner Mark Butler defeated Democrat Richard Keatley, a former professor of French and Italian. And Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black won re-election over Democratic software developer Fred Swann.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL CHALLENGES\n\nTwo congressional seats in metro Atlanta remained too close to declare winners Wednesday. Extremely thin vote margins separated Democratic challengers from Republican incumbents in suburban districts once considered safe for the GOP.\n\nIn the 6th District north of Atlanta, Republican Rep. Karen Handel faced Democratic gun-control activist Lucy McBath, whose teenage son was fatally shot six years ago in Florida. Last year Handel won the House seat in a grueling special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff, who spent $30 million on the race.\n\nIn the neighboring 7th District, GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faced Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux, a college professor at Georgia State University who outpaced the incumbent congressman in fundraising. Bourdeaux raised more than $1.9 million, nearly double Woodall\u2019s total. However, the four-term Republican congressman has won each of his prior elections with no less than 60 percent of the vote.\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION\n\nTwo Republican members of Georgia\u2019s utility-regulating Public Service Commission were struggling to avoid runoffs in campaigns run amid criticism over escalating costs for building two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta.\n\nGOP incumbent Chuck Eaton faced Democrat Lindy Miller and Libertarian Ryan Graham for the commission\u2019s District 3 seat in metro Atlanta. And Republican commissioner Tricia Pridemore was being challenged by Democrat Dawn Randolph and Libertarian John Turpish for the PSC\u2019s District 5 seat in western Georgia.\n\nUnofficial returns showed both Republican incumbents leading but close to finishing with less than 50 percent of the vote, which would send their races to runoffs.\n\nThe PSC has come under fire for its December vote authorizing construction to continue at Plant Vogtle, a decision made before Pridemore was appointed in February. The project is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, raising concerns that ratepayers will get saddled with the added cost.\n\nELSEWHERE IN THE U.S. HOUSE\n\nGOP Rep. Tom Graves easily won re-election in his congressional district that strongly favors Republican candidates. This year, his Democratic opponent was further handicapped by having to spend much of the campaign in jail.\n\nGraves defeated Democrat Steve Foster, who was sentenced by a judge in August to six months in jail for drunken driving. Foster\u2019s attorney, Richard Murray, confirmed the incarcerated candidate was released Tuesday. Foster refused to quit the 14th District race in northwest Georgia. The misdemeanor DUI conviction didn\u2019t disqualify him from the ballot.\n\nSix other GOP congressmen \u2014 Reps. Buddy Carter, Jody Hice, Rick Allen, Doug Collins, Barry Loudermilk and Drew Ferguson \u2014 all overcame Democratic challengers.\n\nThree Democratic congressmen \u2014 Reps. Sanford Bishop, Hank Johnson and David Scott \u2014 also defeated opponents.\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Lewis and GOP Rep.

(Josh Galemore/The Casper Star-Tribune via AP)\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) \u2014 State Treasurer Mark Gordon defeated energy industry attorney Mary Throne to keep the office of Wyoming governor in Republican hands for the longest stretch in over a generation.\n\nGordon\u2019s win means Wyoming state government will continue much as it has under outgoing Republican Gov. Matt Mead, who after two terms is term-limited.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans switched off in the governor\u2019s office every eight years for three decades. Despite promising a fiscally cautious state government friendly to the fossil-fuels industries, Throne failed to overcome steadily eroding Democratic voter registration to keep the back-and-forth going.\n\nLike Mead, Gordon hasn\u2019t advocated major changes to Wyoming system of taxes and revenue despite a recent downturn in coal, oil and natural gas industries that supply 70 percent of the state\u2019s revenue.\n\nA recent state revenue report lent support to that approach, showing that rising revenue from oil and gas should alleviate the threat of deficits in Wyoming in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cVoters across the state expressed a lot of concerns but most of them have a great view for the future of Wyoming. They want to be able to grow businesses. They want to have a governor in charge who has good, strong conservative values,\u201d Gordon said after winning.\n\nUnlike Mead, Gordon doesn\u2019t support expanding the federal Medicaid program in Wyoming, putting him in line with the Republicans who control the Wyoming Legislature and who\u2019ve kept it from happening. Throne argued for Medicaid expansion, saying doing so would have provided health coverage for 20,000 Wyomingites at no cost to the state.\n\nStill, Gordon and Throne were similar in many ways, Cheyenne voter Trudy Soland said. Gordon got the edge on issues important to her.\n\n\u201cGrowth. And keeping kids in the state of Wyoming, you know, when they graduate from UW,\u201d Soland said.\n\nGordon, 61, was a businessman, rancher and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City board member before being appointed treasurer by Mead after the death of Joe Meyer 2012.\n\nHe beat five others, including nationally known Republican mega-donor Foster Friess, to win the Republican nomination in August. Gordon got 33 percent of the vote to runner-up Friess\u2019 26 percent in the primary.\n\nVoter registration figures showed especially tough odds for Democrats in Wyoming this year, with Republicans outnumbering Democrats by well over 4-1 heading into the election. Democratic registration is down to just 16 percent compared to 26 percent a decade ago.\n\nWidespread support for low-tax, reduced-regulation and fossil-fuel-friendly policies, meanwhile, left Democrats including Throne with little room to make a case for significant change.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t run if you\u2019re not willing to risk losing. You go into these things knowing you might not win, but you go in because you\u2019re passionate about what you believe,\u201d Throne said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of presenting the voters with a choice.\u201d\n\nThrone, 58, served as a state representative from Cheyenne from 2007-2017, including two years as minority leader of the Wyoming House. The Democratic caucus dwindled from 19 to 9 while during her time in the 60-member chamber.\n\nThe last Democrat to hold the governor\u2019s office was Dave Freudenthal, who served from 2003-2011. Republican Jim Geringer served from 1995-2003 and Democrat Mike Sullivan from 1987-1995.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mead Gruver at https://twitter.com/meadgruver\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Los Angeles Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell, left, and Minnesota Timberwolves guard Derrick Rose argue during the second half of an NBA basketball game, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Democrat Gavin Newsom was elected California governor Tuesday and used his victory speech to punch at President Donald Trump and extoll California as a beacon for all Americans who oppose \u201cagents of anger.\u201d\n\nNewsom\u2019s victory ensures one opponent of Trump, outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown, will be replaced by another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying unmistakably and in unison that it\u2019s time to roll the credits on the politics of chaos and the politics of cruelty,\u201d Newsom told supporters at a nightclub in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cNow is the time for decency, for facts, for trust, and now is the time for truth. Now is time for leaders to lead.\u201d\n\nHe did not mention Trump by name, but his remarks were aimed squarely at the president.\n\nNewsom presented California as \u201cAmerica\u2019s coming attraction,\u201d extolled the state\u2019s diversity, innovative businesses and thriving economy, and urged Americans dispirited with political polarization to look toward the Golden State.\n\n\u201cThis, in every way, shape or form is California\u2019s moment,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nNewsom defeated Republican John Cox with a pledge to spur a rapid bump in housing construction, bring about universal health care and help impoverished children. He\u2019ll replace Gov. Jerry Brown, one of Trump\u2019s chief antagonists.\n\nNewsom led Cox 57 percent to 43 percent with about 4.2 million votes counted.\n\nFor the past eight years Newsom has been lieutenant governor, a position with almost no power. Before that, as San Francisco mayor, he rocketed into the global spotlight when he ordered the issuing of marriage licenses to same-sex couples when it wasn\u2019t legal.\n\nNewsom, 51, promised similarly bold moves on the priorities of his party\u2019s liberal base.\n\nFor Newsom, the pivotal moment in the campaign came in June, when Cox finished second in a crowded primary field where the top two advance regardless of party affiliation.\n\nFacing a Republican provided a huge advantage in the state where the GOP has 3.8 million fewer registered voters than the Democratic Party.\n\nNewsom spent much of the campaign raising money and holding rallies for Democrats running for seats in Congress and the Legislature, building goodwill with lawmakers with whom he\u2019ll be working.\n\nCox, 63, a lawyer and investor living in the San Diego area, hammered relentlessly on California\u2019s high cost of living, for which he blamed Newsom and the Democrats who control the Legislature and every statewide office. He pledged to cut taxes and roll back environmental laws that he says obstruct housing construction.\n\nHe downplayed his conservative stances on social issues \u2014 he opposes abortion and made inflammatory comments about gay marriage a decade ago \u2014 but was unable to persuade voters to give him a shot. He also was hurt by support from Trump, who is very unpopular in the state.\n\n\u201cI consider myself very proud that we highlighted the incredible struggle that the people of this state have had for years,\u201d Cox told supporters as he conceded defeat in San Diego.\n\nHe blamed his loss on the enormous cost of running a campaign in California, home to nearly 40 million people and some of the nation\u2019s most expensive television markets. He raised more than $11 million this year \u2014 much of it his own \u2014 but still did not have enough money to run ads on broadcast television in the crucial final weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said at the close of his speech. \u201cI love this state and I\u2019m going to stay involved.\u201d\n\nNewsom has made himself a foil for Trump in California, a state that has passed laws and filed lawsuits aimed at thwarting the president\u2019s agenda on health care, immigration and climate change. He\u2019s drawn the ire of Trump, who has mocked Newsom\u2019s policies and at one rally called him \u201cthis clown in California who\u2019s running for governor.\u201d\n\nOnly about a quarter of California voters said the country is on the right track, compared with roughly seven of 10 who said it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.\n\nA majority of voters \u2014 some seven in 10 \u2014 had negative views of Trump, and about five in 10 said they voted to express opposition to the president. Fewer than one in five said they went to the polls to show their support for Trump.\n\nNewsom will take over Jan. 7 from Brown, California\u2019s longest-serving governor. Brown has twice served back-to-back terms, the first from 1975-1983 and then again starting in 2011. California now has term limits only allowing a candidate to serve eight years as governor.\n\nWhen he assumes control, Newsom will find a Democratic Legislature antsy to boost spending for the social safety net and higher education after eight years of Brown holding the line on such spending. He\u2019ll inherit strong state finances with billions in budget reserves and a surplus, but also the ever-present threat that an economic downturn will once again force cuts in a state that disproportionately relies on income taxes paid by the wealthy.\n\nBefore he was a politician, Newsom in his early 20s opened a wine store in San Francisco, the start of a business empire that\u2019s grown to include about two dozen bars, restaurants, liquor stores, wineries and hotels. The PlumpJack Group, as it\u2019s known, is now led by his sister, but will present an ethics challenge for him as governor.\n\nHe\u2019s been adamant that he won\u2019t sell his interests, so he\u2019ll have to avoid creating conflicts or the appearance that his position is helping him profit in the highly regulated industries where he operates.\n\nNewsom got his start in politics when San Francisco\u2019s legendary mayor, Willie Brown, appointed him to the city parking commission and later to a vacant seat on the Board of Supervisors, San Francisco\u2019s city council. He was considered a centrist candidate for mayor in a the famously liberal city and won, making national headlines for defying the law on gay marriage and extending health care benefits to everyone in the city.\n\nHe considered running for governor in 2010 but stepped aside when Brown made clear he\u2019d be on the ballot. Newsom ran for lieutenant governor instead.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Republican Senate candidate Rick Scott speaks with his wife Ann by his side at an election watch party, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018, in Naples, Fla.

If the margin remains under 0.5 percent at that point, then Secretary of State Ken Detzner is required to order the recount.\n\nAn attorney for Nelson said late Wednesday that he intends to aggressively examine and address reports of ballot problems. The Nelson campaign believes the results of the election are still unknown since there are ballots yet to be counted, Marc Elias said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this not just because it\u2019s automatic, but we\u2019re doing it to win,\u201d Elias said.\n\nFlorida was the scene of a monumental recount battle in 2000 that pitted scores of lawyers against each other in the presidential race. George W. Bush won the presidency by 537 Florida votes over Al Gore after the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately declared an end to the counting.\n\nThe stakes aren\u2019t as high this time, but a Scott win would end the political career of the 76-year-old Nelson, who is seeking a fourth Senate term.\n\nScott had declared victory during an election party in his home town of Naples late Tuesday when near-total results showed a thin lead, saying the campaign had been \u201cdivisive and tough\u201d but that he vowed to change the direction of Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cChange is never popular. I tried to use every effort to change the state of Florida and together we did,\u201d Scott said.\n\nAs the night wore on Nelson did not address his supporters in Orlando. Instead he had an aide say shortly after midnight that while many news reports were declaring Scott the victor, Nelson would have no statement until later Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis obviously is not the result Sen. Nelson and his campaign had worked so hard for,\u201d aide Pete Mitchell said.\n\nThe two candidates are heavyweights within each party: Nelson has withstood years of GOP dominance to remain the only Democrat elected statewide, while Scott is a two-term governor urged by President Donald Trump to take Nelson on.\n\nNelson was been viewed as one of the more vulnerable Democrats thanks to the formidable challenge from Scott, a former hospital chain CEO who has poured more than $60 million of his own fortune into his campaign.\n\nWhen Scott first jumped in last April, the contest was seen as one of the marquee races in the nation. It was soon overshadowed by the governor\u2019s race: a vitriolic competition between Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum that became a proxy battle between Trump and his Democratic opponents. DeSantis had trailed in almost every poll leading up to Election Day, but he parlayed Trump\u2019s strong endorsements in the Republican primary and general election to pull off an upset. Gillum would have been the first Democrat elected to the office since 1994, and the state\u2019s first-ever African-American governor.\n\nScott spent nearly two weeks off the campaign trail to respond to Hurricane Michael, which pummeled several counties in the Florida Panhandle and was responsible for dozens of deaths.\n\nThe two candidates disagreed on issues ranging from gun control to environmental policy to health care. Nelson was a strong supporter of the federal health care overhaul pushed into law by President Barack Obama, while Scott had called for the law to be repealed and replaced.\n\nScott, however, was forced to air a television ad in which he promised to retain the current plan\u2019s consumer protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Florida is among the states that are part of a lawsuit challenging the overhaul. The lawsuit was handled by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Scott maintained that he was not consulted about it before it was filed. But after he was aware of it, he remained largely silent until it became an issue in the campaign.\n\nDifferences between Scott and Nelson took a back seat to mutual disparagement and personal attacks, as well as Scott\u2019s links to Trump. At first Scott distanced himself from the president, but in the final week of the race he showed up at two political rallies Trump held in Florida.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Colorado Governor-elect Jared Polis, right, lifts the hand of Lt. Governor-elect Dianne Primavera during his acceptance speech at the watch party for Colorado Democrats at the Westin Hotel in downtown Denver, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (Jerilee Bennett/The Gazette via AP)\n\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Polis handily defeated Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton in the Colorado governor\u2019s race Tuesday, becoming the first openly gay man to be elected governor in the United States.\n\nPolis will succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is term-limited. He briefly acknowledged his landmark election in a victory speech, though he never campaigned on the issue of his sexual orientation, and later embraced his partner, Marlon Reis.\n\nPolis, who is also the state\u2019s first Jewish governor, quickly turned to health care, children\u2019s education, protecting public lands and immigration \u2014 key themes of his campaign.\n\n\u201cAll too often people see (the election) falsely as a zero-sum game\u201d of winners and losers, Polis said Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to show that we can all win together, and tonight is the beginning of that incredible journey for our state.\u201d\n\nPolis, 43, invested a record $22 million of his own wealth in the campaign. He is a five-term congressman and technology entrepreneur who promised to fight for universal health care, renewable energy standards and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nPolis beat the two-term state treasurer who had defended Colorado\u2019s constitutional restrictions on taxing and spending. Stapleton, 44, insisted Polis\u2019 ideas for funding education, roads and energy would bankrupt the state.\n\n\u201cThough this has been a tough campaign, now is the time for all of us to come together in Colorado,\u201d Stapleton said in his concession speech.\n\nThe vote for governor also amounted to a referendum on Trump. The president endorsed Stapleton, who embraced the administration\u2019s antipathy toward so-called sanctuary cities that don\u2019t closely cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nCarly Everett, 24, an independent voter from Littleton, said Trump\u2019s attitude toward immigrants and racial rhetoric was the reason she voted a mostly Democratic ticket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Donald Trump, and a lot of bad things going on right now are about him,\u201d Everett said after voting in Morrison. \u201cI voted mostly Democrat to oppose the direction the country is headed.\u201d\n\nAs Democrats led Republicans in turnout before the polls closed, state Republican Party chairman Jeff Hays urged GOP members to \u201ceither close that gap or surrender our state to the most radical Democrats their party has ever nominated.\u201d\n\nColorado has not had a Republican governor since 2007. Republicans hold offices that were competitive Tuesday as Democrats won secretary of state and sought to take attorney general and state treasurer.\n\nDemocrats also fought for control of the state Senate, which the GOP holds by a one-vote margin. Democrats have a comfortable majority in the state House.\n\nColorado has one of the nation\u2019s lowest unemployment rates and highest rates of economic growth, largely fueled by the tech, aerospace and oil and gas industries.\n\nCiting the threat of climate change to Colorado\u2019s outdoors industry, Polis proposed a 100 percent renewable energy standard for Colorado by 2040. Stapleton attacked the goal, saying it would harm Colorado\u2019s $31 billion oil and gas industry.\n\nPolis, who raised the ire of the fossil fuels industry by once supporting limits on drilling, insisted the green standard was a goal, not a mandate.\n\nHe also unapologetically called for universal health care coverage as a long-term goal and suggested a first step might be to create a regional market with neighboring states.\n\nStapleton praised Trump\u2019s elimination of tax penalties for those without health insurance but, like many other Republicans this election cycle, insisted he would defend an expanded Medicaid program that covers one in four Colorado residents.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "The Latest: McSally-Sinema Senate race too close to call\n\nRepublican Arizona Gov.

Doug Ducey, his Democratic opponent David Garcia and a bipartisan array of interest groups.\n\nThey argued putting the ban in the state Constitution would handcuff future Legislatures and governors who may need to make adjustments to the state sales tax.\n\nThey pointed to the decreasing percentage of the economy that is subject to current sales taxes.\n\n___\n\n8:44 p.m.\n\nArizona voters have rejected a measure requiring regulated utilities to obtain 50 percent of their electricity from renewable energy sources like solar or wind power by 2030.\n\nProposition 127 was fiercely opposed by the state\u2019s largest utility, Arizona Public Service.\n\nThe utility\u2019s parent company spent more than $25 million to oppose the measure, arguing it would raise consumer costs by as much as $1,000 a year per customer annually and hurt the reliability of the state\u2019s electrical grid.\n\nThe Clean Energy for a Healthy Arizona proposal was backed by solar advocates in Arizona with funding from San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer.\n\nInitiative supporters say Arizona hasn\u2019t taken advantage of its role as the sunniest state in U.S. to develop more solar energy.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Democrat Mike Levin on Wednesday captured the Southern California U.S. House seat held for years by retiring Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, while GOP Rep. Steve Knight conceded his Los Angeles-area seat to a Democratic newcomer, 31-year-old Katie Hill.\n\nIn San Diego County, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter survived the election despite facing corruption charges. A 60-count federal grand jury indictment against him and his wife alleges the couple illegally used $250,000 in campaign funds for vacations, meals and other personal expenses.\n\nLevin\u2019s victory carries symbolic weight because of Issa\u2019s nearly two-decade tenure, during which he was a chief antagonist of President Barack Obama. The 49th District is partly in the one-time GOP stronghold of Orange County. The rest is in San Diego County.\n\nLevin, an environmental attorney, had about 54 percent of nearly 177,000 votes counted so far.\n\nHe sparred with Republican rival Diane Harkey over President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, global warming and immigration. Harkey, a former state lawmaker, had been endorsed by the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the traditional Orange County Republican embraces Trumpism,\u201d Levin told The Associated Press. He said voters in the district are concerned with coastal protection and climate change.\n\nIssa\u2019s district was among seven in the state that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats saw all as potential pickups this November.\n\nThe battlegrounds range from Central Valley farmland to legendary surfing spots in Orange County and Knight\u2019s 25th District, which cuts through suburbs, horse ranches and high desert in northern Los Angeles County and a small slice of Ventura County.\n\nKnight trailed Hill by 2.5 points with about 163,000 votes counted and thousands more left to be tallied. The Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nKnight, a former police officer, offered Hill his congratulations and said he was proud of his work on veterans\u2019 health care, small business development and defense issues.\n\n\u201cOur electoral process is integral to our identity as a free and fair society, and the voters have spoken,\u201d he said.\n\nHill stressed her centrist politics: She\u2019s a gun owner and her Republican father is a police officer who had never voted for a Democrat before her primary. Her mother, a Democrat, is a nurse.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working on behalf of everyone in this district to ensure we all have access to quality health care, housing we can afford, and a representative and transparent government which truly serves the people,\u201d she said.\n\nRepublican Reps. Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher were fighting for their political lives in two Orange County districts they easily won two years ago.\n\nIn the 45th District, which has a 7-point GOP registration edge, Walters was leading law professor Katie Porter, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, by about 3 points with 184,000 votes counted.\n\nPorter had campaigned on overturning Trump\u2019s tax reform package and her support for universal health care.\n\nRohrabacher, known as Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill, was in a tough race with Republican-turned-Democrat Harley Rouda in the 48th District, where the GOP has a 10-point registration edge.\n\nRouda, a real estate executive, has depicted the 15-term congressman as the face of Washington gridlock. He was leading with 51 percent of the vote, with about 181,000 counted.\n\nIn retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce\u2019s 39th District that includes part of Orange County, Republican Young Kim held a 3-point edge over Democrat Gil Cisneros, with about 150,000 votes counted. If elected, Kim would become the first Korean-American immigrant woman elected to the House.\n\nThe former state legislator worked for Royce for years and has positioned herself as a Trump supporter with an independent streak.\n\nCisneros, a first-time candidate who won a $266 million lottery jackpot, was looking for a big turnout from Hispanics who make up about a third of the population.\n\nTwo other targeted Republicans, Reps. David Valadao and Jeff Denham, represent farm-belt districts where Democrats have more registered voters but are more moderate than in urban areas.\n\nValadao\u2019s 21st District includes parts of Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties. He won by a wide margin in 2016 and on Tuesday held off a challenge by Democrat T.J. Cox.\n\nCox tried to make the race a referendum on Valadao\u2019s support for President Donald Trump. In a tip to the district\u2019s heavy Hispanic population, Valadao touted his support for a way to keep in the country people who came as children when their parents illegally entered.\n\nIn the 10th District, anchored in Modesto, Denham was leading Democrat Josh Harder by about 1,300 votes point with 112,000 votes counted.\n\nHarder argued that Republican policies in Washington have hurt many residents. He emphasized that Denham voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Harder supports.\n\nDenham, known for his involvement in water issues vital to agriculture, has proven tough to beat, despite the Democratic registration edge. He won by 3 percentage points in 2016.\n\nRepresenting a district with a large Hispanic population, Denham has pushed for Congress to consider a pathway for citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and stayed here illegally.", "Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry, left, celebrates a score with Kevin Durant on the bench during the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Memphis Grizzlies, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Oakland, Calif. (AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors delivered one of those high-flying third quarters that were a signature last season.\n\nStephen Curry capped it with a rare but dazzling block.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to start calling him a rim protector now,\u201d Kevin Durant quipped.\n\nKlay Thompson scored 27 points, Durant added 22 points, six rebounds and six assists, and the Warriors pulled away after halftime to run their winning streak to eight games with a 117-101 win against the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday night.\n\nCurry overcame a slow start to score 19 points, and the Warriors used a 34-15 third quarter to pull away. That marked a season-low scoring total for any quarter by the Grizzlies.\n\nAt 10-1, the Warriors are off to the second-best start in franchise history behind the team of three years ago that began 24-0. The 1960-61 Philadelphia Warriors were 9-0 before losing four straight.\n\nThompson\u2019s contested 3 moments before the halftime buzzer sent the teams into intermission tied at 58, then the Warriors took off the way they do resemblant of their signature third quarters last season.\n\n\u201cI think the second half we picked the pace up, got out in transition and that opens up the floor for everybody,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nCurry\u2019s 3-pointer with 3:14 left in the third put the Warriors up by 10, 81-71, before Durant followed with back-to-back jumpers. Curry swatted a shot by Wayne Selden to end the third, sending the two-time defending champions into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cThat was impressive,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI was hoping for the (Dikembe) Mutombo finger wag. Didn\u2019t quite get it.\u201d\n\nCurry shot 1 of 7 in the opening quarter with a single 3 accounting for his point total.\n\nDraymond Green was limited to just fewer than 14 minutes because of a bruised right foot. X-rays were negative, Kerr said.\n\nDillon Brooks came off the bench to score 11 of his 18 points in the first quarter to help the Grizzlies take a 31-29 lead. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Shelvin Mack scored 15 apiece for Memphis.\n\nMarc Gasol had eight points with just a pair of field goals to go with 10 rebounds and nine assists for Memphis in its first set of 13 back-to-backs this season.\n\nAlfonzo McKinnie scored 14 points off the bench for the Warriors, who have won 13 of the last 17 meetings with Memphis and four straight at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect of things,\u201d Memphis guard Mike Conley said. \u201cWhen they get a couple good looks, a couple easy shots to fall, it\u2019s contagious and everybody else kind of feeds off it.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nGrizzlies: Memphis shot 45.8 percent.

He wasn\u2019t on the playoff roster.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really thankful for the class act by the Warriors,\u201d Casspi said. \u201cWe all know how grateful I am for that. I\u2019m happy to be a part of that, I\u2019m happy to be a part of the team that won the championship. Obviously I missed the playoffs. I wanted to be there so bad.

It was a celebration that proved a bit premature.\n\nOn this Monday night, the Cowboys didn\u2019t defend their star in a 28-14 loss \u2014 except for Byron Jones shoving Kevin Byard when the Tennessee Titans safety did his best imitation of Terrell Owens\u2019 infamous taunting on the midfield logo 18 years ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re all having fun, but I think when you go and try to go on the star ... everyone knows what going on the star means.\u201d\n\nByrad\u2019s interception in the end zone of Dak Prescott\u2019s pass came right after Jaylon Smith recovered the second fumble by Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota and the Cowboys (3-5) looking to build on their early 7-0 lead.\n\n\u201cThat was a big play in the ballgame not to be able to cash in there,\u201d coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cThat was big in the game.\u201d\n\nJust two plays later, it looked like Smith had another recovery after what would have been Tennessee\u2019s third lost fumble in a five-minute span. The defense had already posed for another group photo, like it had after two fumbles by Mariota, before the play was overturned on a replay review.\n\nAfter keeping the ball, Mariota and the Titans (4-4) went on to finish a 15-play drive that tied the game. They didn\u2019t have any more turnovers and never trailed again.\n\n\u201cOne thing that defensively that we try to uphold is creating turnovers,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do it in the first quarter and expect the game to go your way. You have to do it throughout the entire game.\u201d\n\nAmari Cooper had a 4-yard TD catch in his first game for the Cowboys, who sent a first-round pick to Oakland for the fourth-year receiver.\n\nAll three Dallas drives in the first quarter got into the red zone. There was a missed field goal before Cooper\u2019s TD, and Prescott\u2019s interception after that in their first home loss this season.\n\n\u201cI think the main thing is we had two no-scores in the red zone,\u201d running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win a game in the NFL when you have two no-scores.\u201d\n\nCooper finished by catching five of the eight passes thrown his way for 58 yards \u2014 the interception was intended for him. Elliott had 17 carries for 61 yards.\n\nAlong with Cooper\u2019s debut, this was the first game for the Cowboys since offensive line coach Paul Alexander was fired less than halfway into his first season with the team. Former Dallas offensive lineman Marc Colombo, who had served as assistant offensive line coach since 2016, was promoted to take over as offensive line coach.\n\nIt was the first time Garrett has made an in-season change to his coaching staff, but there was no immediate turnaround.\n\nPrescott was sacked five times, losing a fumble when he tried to escape being tackled on one of them, and the Cowboys had only 72 yards rushing.\n\nWith the five sacks, Prescott has already been sacked 28 times halfway through this season. That is three more than his rookie season in 2016, and just short of the 32 sacks last season.\n\n\u201cI know that we had breakdowns,\u201d owner Jerry Jones said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I expected the change to create a situation here you just didn\u2019t have breakdowns. I didn\u2019t think there would be enough to impact the game the way it did, and the way it did with Dak.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein won re-election Tuesday to the seat she has represented for more than a quarter century, demonstrating her might in California Democratic politics even as she faced a challenge from her left.\n\nShe called for a return to more bipartisan and civil politics as she highlighted her pioneering role as one of the first women in the U.S. Senate and as a member of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, where she is now the top Democrat.\n\n\u201cThis is such a great country and it\u2019s been factionalized and it\u2019s been trivialized with rhetoric,\u201d she said to supporters in San Francisco. \u201cWe must stop that.\u201d\n\nFeinstein\u2019s rival, state Sen. Kevin de Leon, had called for a more aggressive style of representation. Even under President Donald Trump, Feinstein has shown her preference for decorum over bomb-throwing, preferring to work across the aisle when she can.\n\nPerhaps reflecting her comfort in the face of de Leon\u2019s challenge, Feinstein told reporters after an October debate she considered herself at the center of the political spectrum and hoped Republican voters would give her a chance.\n\nAt 85, Feinstein is the oldest U.S. senator. De Leon, 51, never directly made Feinstein\u2019s age an issue but frequently referenced the need for a \u201cnew voice.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to his supporters in Los Angeles Tuesday night, he said the campaign offered a choice between \u201cnew ideas and the same old, same old\u201d and \u201cprogressivism and privilege.\u201d\n\nStill, it was Feinstein\u2019s message of proven experience and competence that won over California voters in deep-blue California. She held 54 percent of the vote with 4.6 million counted.\n\nWith no Republican in the race, many voters simply took a pass at the contest. At least half a million people who voted in the governor\u2019s race did not cast ballots for U.S. Senate.\n\nFeinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 after serving as San Francisco\u2019s first woman mayor.\n\nUnlike other challenges to incumbents from the left, de Leon\u2019s bid against Feinstein failed to generate much attention and energy, perhaps because the seat was a lock for Democrats regardless. California\u2019s primary system allows two members of the same party to face off in a general election, and Republicans fielded no serious candidates.\n\nIt was California\u2019s second U.S. Senate contest in which two Democrats faced off. U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris defeated U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez for California\u2019s other seat in 2016.\n\nEven though de Leon criticized Feinstein for being too soft against Trump, she drew the president\u2019s ire this fall during the fiery confirmation battle over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. A California woman, Christine Blasey Ford, sent Feinstein a letter during the summer accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in high school, which he denies.\n\nFeinstein kept the letter confidential for weeks but later turned it over to the FBI. Trump and Republicans accused her of leaking the letter to the press in an attempt to derail Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nTrump supporters even chanted \u201clock her up!\u201d about Feinstein during a rally. Feinstein denies leaking the letter and has defended her handling of the situation.\n\nWith Republicans maintaining control of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday night, Feinstein will remain minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee. During the campaign, she lamented the challenges of operating in Washington in the minority party. When de Leon called for a stronger resistance, Feinstein declared that marching and protesting only goes so far.\n\n\u201cWhat changes things are elections,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the campaign, Feinstein focused on her accomplishments in Washington to argue she\u2019s been an effective voice for California, citing passage of the California Desert Protection Act and the now-expired federal assault weapons ban, both of which happened more than 20 years ago during her first years in Washington.\n\nShe\u2019s faced pressure from immigrant groups that argue she hasn\u2019t done enough to fight for comprehensive reform and a path to citizenship. She said immigration reform would be her top priority if she were re-elected.\n\nAs she thanked her supporters Tuesday, Feinstein said she was surprised to see how many people had come out.\n\n\u201cHow lucky I am to have a constituency like this,\u201d she said.", "Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale talks with supporters Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 at the Delta Hotel in Helena, Mont., as he and his supporters wait for the poll results. (AP Photo/ Eliza Wiley)\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Republican Matt Rosendale are locked in a Montana U.S. Senate race that was too close to call Tuesday night with votes still being counted, following a campaign dominated by President Donald Trump\u2019s personal push to vanquish Tester.\n\nHe is seeking a third term and faced a stiff challenge after Rosendale\u2019s campaign got a boost from Trump\u2019s repeated trips to the state. The president vowed last spring that Tester would pay at the polls for sinking his first nominee for Veterans Affairs secretary, White House physician Ronny Jackson.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Montana voters said Trump was a factor for them as they cast their ballots, according to an Associated Press survey. During the campaign, Rosendale sought to capitalize on the interest by aligning himself closely with the president\u2019s policies, while Tester was careful not to offend Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe Montana seat was one of 10 held by Senate Democrats seeking re-election in states Trump won in 2016. With control of the Senate potentially in play, Republican and Democratic groups spent tens of millions of dollars in an attempt to influence the race. Combined with spending by the campaigns, the total price tag topped $67 million, a state record.\n\nTester appeared before supporters at his election party before 11 p.m. and told them to go home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the clerks around the state do their job, we\u2019ll let the folks in Gallatin County finish voting and tomorrow, tomorrow \u2014 what are we going to do tomorrow?\u201d he asked the crowd.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re damn right we\u2019re going to celebrate!\u201d he yelled into the microphone.\n\nRosendale was in Helena, where spokesman Shane Scanlon said he was thanking supporters for their work and telling them it was going to be a long night.\n\nRepublican voter Megan Salo said she took notice of Trump\u2019s interest in the race and heeded his call to vote for Rosendale. The 27-year-old, who works in real estate in Billings, Montana\u2019s largest city, said Democrats were too focused on the negative while the economy improves.\n\n\u201cHe (Trump) was here because this is a big, big issue,\u201d Salo said. \u201cWe needed to get Tester out and bring in someone new for Montana.\u201d\n\nAbout 15 miles (24 kilometers) away, in the railroad town of Laurel, Theresa Van Tine said the nation needs a division of power in Washington, so that Republicans and Democrats are forced to work together. Van Tine, 50, is a Democrat who relies on a government disability check to pay for groceries and rent. She voted for Tester.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI know we need change, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s the right person for that change. When it\u2019s all more balanced out, better things get done.\u201d\n\nTester has never won a U.S. Senate election with a majority of the vote, and he said he knew it would be close again this time. He sought to capitalize on a Democratic base outraged by Trump\u2019s election and energized by the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.\n\nAt the same time, Tester tried to appeal to the Trump supporters he needed to win.

The state\u2019s dominant electric utility, NV Energy, says it already has a 24 percent clean-energy portfolio.\n\nProponents have been underwritten by California billionaire Democratic activist Tom Steyer, founder of the group NextGen Climate Action.\n\nOpponents say free-market forces and the Legislature should set the state standard.\n\n___\n\n12:18 a.m.\n\nDemocrat Jacky Rosen has defeated incumbent Republican Dean Heller in a hard-fought battle for a U.S. Senate seat in Nevada, giving Democrats a key pickup in the chamber.\n\nRosen on Tuesday ousted Heller, who has been in office since he was appointed to fill a vacancy in 2011.\n\nHeller was considered the most vulnerable Republican running for re-election to the U.S. Senate this year as the only one seeking another term in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016.

United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, and more than 200 people and ships.\n\nHowever, scattered among the list are surprising entries, like the crude oil tanker Sanchi. That vessel collided with a bulk freighter and caught fire off China\u2019s east coast in January, killing all 32 sailors aboard.\n\nAnother entry was Iran\u2019s Tat Bank, which closed in 2012.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif took to Twitter to mock some of the targets of the sanctions, describing it as a \u201cdesperate\u201d psychological ploy.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. designated a bank that was closed 6 years ago, and a ship that sank . in a widely televised saga,\u201d he wrote, ending the tweet with \u201d(hashtag)USisIsolated.\u201d\n\nBut for the first time, the United States targeted Iran Air. It also sanctioned the state carrier\u2019s mothballed fleet of Boeing 747s, which were manufactured in the 1970s.\n\nIt also appeared that the U.S., in another first, was directly sanctioning the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the government agency that oversees Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Prior sanctions targeted specific subsidiaries of the organization.\n\nEshaq Jahangiri, President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s senior vice president, also criticized the sanctions.\n\n\u201cAmericans think their list is more effective if it is longer,\u201d Jahangiri said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. He said he had discussed the list with other officials, with many saying it was \u201cless than what we expected.\u201d\n\nStill, Jahangiri warned that \u201cAmericans intend to damage economy of the country\u201d through psychological warfare.\n\nZarif later issued an online video criticizing America\u2019s \u201cindiscriminate assault\u201d on his country.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. administration appears to believe that imposing illegal draconian sanctions on Iran will bring about such pain to our nation that it will force us to submit to its will, no matter how absurd, unlawful or fundamentally flawed its demands are.\u201d\n\nZarif urged America to re-examine its \u201ccatastrophes\u201d in the Mideast, including its support for Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis. Its national currency, the rial, now trades at 150,000 to one U.S. dollar; a year ago, it was about 40,500. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year, resulting in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed.\n\nSporadic smaller demonstrations still reportedly erupt from time to time.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. The price of benchmark Brent crude has dropped from over $80 a barrel in recent days.\n\nDuring a visit to Madrid on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d and that the rest of the parties to the 2015 nuclear deal abandoned by Washington are working to make economic cooperation with Tehran possible.\n\nLavrov\u2019s remarks were Russia\u2019s first reaction to Washington\u2019s new list of sanctions against Iran.

WIth Dunleavy are from left, his wife Rose and daughters Ceil and Maggie. (AP Photo/Michael Dinneen)\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Republican Mike Dunleavy held an edge over Democrat Mark Begich in early returns in the Alaska governor\u2019s race late Tuesday.\n\nDunleavy, a conservative former state senator, had been the presumed front-runner for much of the race, which, until mid-October, included Gov. Bill Walker.\n\nWalker, an independent, ended his campaign days after Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott resigned over what Walker described as an inappropriate overture to a woman. Walker, who was elected with Democratic support in 2014, said he voted for Begich. Walker said he worried that Dunleavy would unravel some of his major policies, such as expanding Medicaid to cover more lower-income Alaskans.\n\nBegich is a former Anchorage mayor and one-term U.S. senator. For much of the campaign, there was angst among some Democrats and independents who feared Walker and Begich would split the vote and hand the race to Dunleavy.\n\nBegich said he had momentum heading into Tuesday\u2019s election but worried voters might be confused since Walker\u2019s name remained on the ballot. Walker quit the campaign after the deadline to withdraw had passed.\n\nBegich said those votes could make the difference. Early results showed Walker receiving a small percentage of the votes so far tallied.\n\nDunleavy cast himself as tough on crime, saying public safety would be a top priority. He called for reduced spending and limiting the growth of government, though he was criticized for not offering many details on what he would cut.\n\nHe also said he supported a full payout of the check Alaskans receive from the state\u2019s oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and paying Alaskans the amount they missed out on when checks were capped. Preliminary budget estimates suggest that could cost $4.3 billion. The payout has been limited since 2016 amid a state budget deficit.\n\nBegich called Dunleavy\u2019s dividend proposal a ploy for votes that could threaten the long-term future of the program. Walker called it irresponsible. But Dunleavy countered his proposal was a way to help restore Alaskans\u2019 trust in state government.\n\nOil prices, which were in freefall when Walker took office in 2014 and hit as low at $26 a barrel in early 2016, have moderated, jumping above $80 a barrel at points this fall. But paying a full dividend at current prices would leave a budget gap and could limit the state\u2019s ability to repay the billions of dollars in reserves the Legislature went through to help plug the deficit, said David Teal, a legislative fiscal analyst.\n\nDunleavy argues that Alaskans should get a say via vote before any changes to the dividend program are made.\n\nDividend checks are paid using permanent fund earnings, which lawmakers this year also began using for government expenses, setting the stage for a political fight over the checks.\n\nBegich and Dunleavy differed on a ballot initiative that supporters said would protect salmon habitat but opponents said could hamper development. Begich supported the initiative; Dunleavy opposed it.\n\nLibertarian Billy Toien also ran in the race.\n\nThird-party independent expenditure groups helped boost Dunleavy, with two groups reporting combined contributions of $4.7 million to support his run.\n\nJuly Leslie, who voted at an Anchorage elementary school, said she voted Republican across the board, including for Dunleavy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily like him but he\u2019s the better of the options,\u201d she said.\n\nRyan Hansen, of Anchorage, said he trusts Dunleavy. Hansen\u2019s top concerns are crime and natural resource development.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re too dependent on oil and we need to diversity a little bit and I think he might be able to do that,\u201d said Hansen, who voted for Walker in 2014.\n\nTherese Thibodeau of Juneau said Medicaid expansion and the state\u2019s fiscal situation were important issues for her in the governor\u2019s race. She backed Begich, saying voting for Dunleavy was not an option for her.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - In this Aug. 23, 2018, file photo, Republican U.S. Rep.

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)\n\nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 Embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter held an 8-point lead Wednesday in a race that tested the strength of partisanship as the GOP incumbent tried to overcome the stigma of facing federal corruption charges.\n\nHunter had 54 percent of the vote over Democratic newcomer Ammar Campa-Najjar with nearly than 120,000 votes counted - and thousands remaining - in the deeply red San Diego-area district.\n\nCampa-Najjar, a former Obama White House aide, was largely unknown in the district east of San Diego until Hunter and his wife were charged in August with illegally spending more than $250,000 in campaign funds on personal expenses ranging from family trips to shots of tequila.\n\nCampa-Najjar, 29, grabbed attention because of the charges and Hunter responded by fueling a bitter campaign that some say exploits racial prejudice and xenophobia.\n\nHunter, 41, who first won the seat 10 years ago after his father stepped down, has called the charges a political witch hunt. He and his wife have pleaded not guilty.\n\nHunter is one of two Republican congressmen seeking to win re-election while under indictment, a rare feat in U.S. history. The other is Rep. Chris Collins of New York, who is charged with insider trading. Both representatives ran low-key campaigns that largely avoided the media and relied on attack ads.\n\nThe campaigns of both lawmakers, who were early supporters of President Donald Trump, are considered a fresh test of partisanship in the Trump era and whether voters will overlook the taint of suspicion to help the GOP remain in power.\n\nJanet Wallace, a nurse \u201cover 60\u201d from Santee, said she couldn\u2019t believe Hunter had the audacity to run after being indicted. Campa-Najjar got her vote, but she said she would have voted for anyone but Hunter.\n\n\u201cI would have voted for my dog over that man,\u201d said Wallace, who didn\u2019t disclose her political party affiliation.\n\nRobert Knapp, 59, a Santee Republican, who services trucks and buses, said he voted for Hunter in the past, but struggled with whether to continue that support after the charges. Ultimately, he decided to stick with the incumbent.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of regrets about deciding to go with Duncan Hunter, but I was also more concerned about the border and things like that, which overtook my decision,\u201d Knapp said.\n\nThe region east of San Diego was not among the California districts Democrats targeted to pick up 23 seats nationwide to win control of the House. Registered Republicans have a nearly 15-point edge over Democrats in the inland district that went double digits for Trump in 2016.\n\nIn the June primary - before the indictment - Hunter received 47 percent to Campa-Najjar\u2019s 17 percent.\n\nBut in the last month, polls suggested the race was tightening and Campa-Najjar\u2019s campaign contributions nearly doubled after the indictment.\n\nHunter, a Marine veteran, stepped up his attacks, raising questions about Campa-Najjar\u2019s Palestinian father who served in the Palestine Liberation Organization, and his grandfather who was involved in the 1972 attack on the Munich Olympics that killed 11 Israeli athletes.\n\nCampa-Najjar was raised by his Mexican-American mother in San Diego and said he had little to do with his Palestinian father. His grandfather was killed by Israeli commandos before he was born.\n\nHunter\u2019s campaign ad claimed his rival, who was given security clearances to work in the Obama administration, is a \u201csecurity risk.\u201d\n\nDozens of national security experts assailed the Hunter ad as racist.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how effective the attacks have been in the district that abuts Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base and has a large veteran population.\n\nCampa-Najjar has tried to appeal to voters by emphasizing he wants to work with the Trump administration on job creation and infrastructure improvements.\n\nHis campaign ads call Hunter an embarrassment and ask voters to \u201cput country over party.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of the election, Campa-Najjar sent to voters what he called a \u201cfarewell letter\u201d to Hunter that criticized the congressman for not attending numerous town hall and debate events and for sending his father, Duncan Hunter Sr., as a proxy to confront him at a press conference.\n\n\u201cNeither of our fathers are running for Congress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor this reason and so many others, I believe you are unfit to serve.\u201d\n\nHunter spent the last day of the campaign walking the 50th District, waving signs and meeting people in person to talk about his support of Trump\u2019s border wall plans, rebuilding the military, cutting taxes, and defending the Second Amendment, among other issues.\n\nHis spokesman Michael Harrison said in response to Campa-Najjar\u2019s letter, \u201cit\u2019s amateur hour over there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Sydney Crawford, 84, left, of New York City, and JoAnn Loulan, 70, of Portola Valley, Calif., watch election returns during a Democratic party election night event at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Washington.

But the GOP gained ground in the Senate and preserved key governorships, beating back a \u201cblue wave\u201d that never fully materialized.\n\nThe mixed verdict in the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency underscored the limits of his hardline immigration rhetoric in America\u2019s evolving political landscape, where college-educated voters in the nation\u2019s suburbs rejected his warnings of a migrant \u201cinvasion.\u201d But blue-collar voters and rural America embraced his aggressive talk and stances.\n\nThe new Democratic House majority will end the Republican Party\u2019s dominance in Washington for the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term with major questions looming about health care, immigration and government spending.\n\n\u201cTomorrow will be a new day in America,\u201d declared House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who would be in line to become the next House speaker.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 edge is narrow. With 218 seats needed for a majority, Democrats have won 219 and the Republicans 193, with winners undetermined in 23 races.\n\nTrump was expected to address the results at a post-election news conference scheduled for midday Wednesday.\n\nThe president\u2019s party will maintain control of the executive branch of the government, in addition to the Senate, but Democrats suddenly have a foothold that gives them subpoena power to probe deep into Trump\u2019s personal and professional missteps \u2014 and his long-withheld tax returns.\n\nYour browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

Democrats relied more upon women, people of color, young people and college graduates.\n\nRecord diversity on the ballot may have helped drive turnout.\n\nVoters were on track to send at least 99 women to the House, shattering the record of 84 now. The House was also getting its first two Muslim women, Massachusetts elected its first black congresswoman, and Tennessee got its first female senator.\n\nThree candidates had hoped to become their states\u2019 first African-American governors, although just one \u2014 Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams \u2014 was still in the running.\n\nOverall, women voted considerably more in favor of congressional Democratic candidates \u2014 with fewer than 4 in 10 voting for Republicans, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters and about 20,000 nonvoters \u2014 conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn suburban areas where key House races were decided, female voters skewed significantly toward Democrats by a nearly 10-point margin.\n\nDemocrats celebrated a handful of victories in their \u201cblue wall\u201d Midwestern states, electing or re-electing governors in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and in Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was defeated by state education chief Tony Evers.\n\nThe road to a House majority ran through two dozen suburban districts Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Democrats flipped seats in suburban districts outside of Washington, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago and Denver. Democrats also reclaimed a handful of blue-collar districts carried by both former President Barack Obama and Trump.\n\nThe results were more mixed deeper into Trump country.\n\nIn Kansas, Democrat Sharice Davids beat a GOP incumbent to become the first gay Native American woman elected to the House. But in Kentucky, one of the top Democratic recruits, retired Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, lost her bid to oust to three-term Rep. Andy Barr.\n\nTrump sought to take credit for retaining the GOP\u2019s Senate majority, even as the party lost control of the House. In a tweet Wednesday, he referred to the election results as a \u201cBig Victory.\u201d\n\nHistory was working against the president in both the House and the Senate: The president\u2019s party has traditionally suffered deep losses in his first midterm election, and 2002 was the only midterm election in the past three decades when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 dreams of the Senate majority, always unlikely, were shattered after losses in top Senate battlegrounds: Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee, North Dakota and Texas.\n\nSome hurt worse than others.\n\nIn Texas, Sen Ted Cruz staved off a tough challenge from Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose record-smashing fundraising and celebrity have set off buzz he could be a credible 2020 White House contender.\n\nTrump encouraged voters to view the 2018 midterms as a referendum on his leadership, pointing proudly to the surging economy at his recent rallies.\n\nNearly 40 percent of voters cast their ballots to express opposition to the president, according to VoteCast, while one-in-four said they voted to express support for Trump.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag.

Twenty-five percent described health care and immigration as the most important issues in the election.\n\nNearly two-thirds said Trump was a reason for their vote.\n\nThe president bet big on a xenophobic closing message, warning of an immigrant \u201cinvasion\u201d that promised to spread violent crime and drugs across the nation. Several television networks, including the president\u2019s favorite Fox News Channel, yanked a Trump campaign advertisement off the air on the eve of the election, determining that its portrayal of a murderous immigrant went too far.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s most vocal defenders on immigration, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, lost his bid for governor.\n\nKobach had built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration policies and strict voter photo ID laws. He served as vice chairman of Trump\u2019s now-defunct commission on voter fraud.\n\nThe president found partial success despite his current job approval, set at 40 percent by Gallup, the lowest at this point of any first-term president in the modern era. Both Barack Obama\u2019s and Bill Clinton\u2019s numbers were 5 points higher, and both suffered major midterm losses of 63 and 54 House seats respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the close of the 2018 midterm season marked the unofficial opening of the next presidential contest.\n\nSeveral ambitious Democrats easily won re-election, including presidential prospects Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Trump\u2019s campaign had billed Hannity as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the rally, but Fox had said that wasn\u2019t so. Hannity himself had tweeted: \u201cTo be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president.

It\u2019s dangerous for democracy and a threat to a free press.\u201d\n\nHannity has been rebuked by Fox in the past. In 2016, he was part of a Trump political video, which Fox said it had not known about in advance and told Hannity not to do so again. When Fox found out in 2010 that the Tea Party had advertised that Hannity would be appearing at one of his fundraising rallies, Fox said it had not approved the arrangement and ordered him back to New York.\n\nMonday\u2019s rally appearance was not shown on Fox News Channel, but was aired on C-SPAN.\n\nIt came after Hannity\u2019s prime-time show aired from the rally site. He played the role of cheerleader from the side as the crowd waited for Trump\u2019s appearance. He pleaded with viewers to vote Republican on Tuesday to support Trump, and his opening monologue echoed a campaign slogan seen on signs at the arena: \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d\n\nHe moved backstage, and with six minutes before the end of his show, Trump appeared for a billed interview that was largely bereft of questions.

Guest seeks to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) \u2014 Mississippi saw its highest federal midterm voter turnout ever on Tuesday.\n\nMore than 880,000 Mississippians cast ballots in the special U.S. Senate election that resulted in a Nov. 27 runoff between Democrat Mike Espy and Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith, according to unofficial results compiled by The Associated Press. Thousands of provisional ballots are likely to be added to totals before counties certify elections to the Secretary of State next week.\n\nAbout 43 percent of all Mississippians who are registered participated.\n\nMississippians in the 3rd District elected a Republican district attorney as the state\u2019s newest member of Congress on Tuesday, choosing Michael Guest of Brandon over Democratic state Rep. Michael Ted Evans of Preston.\n\nThe state\u2019s other three congressional incumbents held their seats easily, with Republicans Trent Kelly and Steven Palazzo and Democrat Bennie Thompson winning additional two-year terms.\n\nThe voting isn\u2019t done yet, with two Court of Appeals judges and two state representatives also headed for Nov. 27 runoffs.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 3rd DISTRICT\n\nA Republican prosecutor won an open seat representing Mississippi in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nMichael Guest, a longtime district attorney in suburban Jackson, defeated Democrat Michael Ted Evans of Preston and Reform Party member Matthew Holland in the 3rd Congressional District.\n\nWinning a competitive Republican primary, Guest supported higher infrastructure spending, immigration changes, and more consumer choice in health care.\n\nEvans ran as a populist-but-conservative Democrat who opposes abortion and voiced distaste for Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. He opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies and supported broader health coverage.\n\nThe district has been represented for the last 10 years by the retiring Gregg Harper. Like Guest, he\u2019s a Rankin County Republican. The district runs diagonally across 24 counties from Natchez through the Jackson suburbs and farther northeast to Starkville.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 1st DISTRICT\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly won a second full term in a north Mississippi congressional seat, defeating Democratic challenger Randy Wadkins.\n\nKelly, a former district attorney, first won election to Congress from the 1st District in 2015 after U.S. Rep. Alan Nunnelee died. Kelly heavily outraised Wadkins, a University of Mississippi chemistry professor.\n\nKelly, a Mississippi National Guard general, emphasized support for higher military spending. He also called for continued decreases in regulations and supports President Donald Trump on trade.\n\nWadkins entered the race citing disagreements with Kelly and Trump, especially over health care. Wadkins supported plans for government-funded health insurance for all Americans.\n\nThe 22-county district stretches from suburbs of Memphis, Tennessee, to Tupelo and Columbus. Also running was Reform Party member Tracella Lou O\u2019Hara Hill.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 2nd DISTRICT\n\nDemocrat Bennie Thompson of Mississippi cruised to his 13th full term in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThompson won the race in the 2nd District, which spans 26 counties including the Mississippi Delta and parts of the Jackson area, overcoming independent Troy Ray and Reform Party candidate Irving Harris.\n\nA Hinds County supervisor before he was first elected in 1993, the 70-year-old Thompson is in line to become chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee if Democrats retake the majority in Congress.\n\nU.S. HOUSE 4th DISTRICT\n\nU.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo has won a fifth term in the U.S. House.\n\nThe Republican Palazzo defeated Democratic state Rep. Jeramey Anderson and Reform Party member Lajena Sheets on Tuesday.\n\nFirst elected in 2010, Palazzo touted support for military spending in a district where the largest employer is military shipbuilder Ingalls Shipbuilding. He urged voters to re-elect him as a show of support to President Donald Trump.\n\nAnderson had called for broader health coverage, an increased minimum wage, and less punitive criminal sentencing.\n\nThe district covers 14 counties from Laurel to the Gulf Coast.\n\nCOURT OF APPEALS\n\nVoters in two Court of Appeals districts in the western half of the state appear likely to return to the polls on Nov. 27 to settle judicial races.\n\nReturns Wednesday showed Deborah McDonald of Fayette was leading but just short of a majority in the 2nd District, with Eric Hawkins of Greenville in second. Former Court of Appeals Judge Ceola James finished third. The district includes the Mississippi Delta and parts of Jackson.\n\nMcDonald raised more than $30,000, the most of the three. She cites experience as a municipal court judge and lawyer for government agencies in southwest Mississippi. Hawkins has been Washington County prosecutor and Greenville city prosecutor.\n\nSimilarly, David McCarty of Jackson was leading but just short of a majority in the 4th District, with Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill in second. Byron Carter of Byram was third. The district includes Jackson and much of southwest Mississippi, stretching to Laurel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still awaiting final tallies from some counties but we\u2019re prepared and excited for a runoff,\u201d McCarty said.\n\nMcCarty raised more than $125,000. Endorsed by some Democrats, McCarty says he has more experience arguing cases before Mississippi\u2019s appellate courts. Weill, previously a Republican member of the Jackson City Council, raised nearly $150,000. Although technically running without a party label, Weill was endorsed by the state GOP.\n\nSTATE HOUSE ELECTIONS\n\nVoters in state House districts in southwest Mississippi and the Mississippi Delta were choosing replacements for representatives who resigned.\n\nIn House District 85, Jeffery Harness and JoAnn Collins Smith moved to a runoff, placing first and second among four candidates. The seat, which covers parts of Claiborne, Franklin, Jefferson and Warren counties, was left vacant by the resignation of Democrat America \u201cChuck\u201d Middleton.\n\nIn House District 31, Otis Anthony and Shannon Brown advanced to a Nov. 27 runoff after leading among eight candidates. They are competing for a seat left open when Democrat Sara Richardson Thomas resigned. The district covers parts of Bolivar, Humphreys, Sunflower and Washington counties.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "EL PASO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz fended off a spirited underdog challenge from Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke to win re-election on Tuesday in a Texas race that once seemed like a cakewalk but needed a late boost from President Donald Trump to help push the incumbent over the top.\n\nCruz began as the prohibitive favorite after his surprisingly successful 2016 presidential run, but he suddenly found himself in a tough contest against O\u2019Rourke, a little-known El Paso congressman and one-time punk rocker who became a national political sensation and shattered fundraising records despite shunning donations from outside political groups and pollster advice.\n\nCruz turned back O\u2019Rourke with the help of Trump, his bitter rival in 2016. Trump took the unexpected step of traveling to reliably Republican Texas during crunch time, staging a Houston rally to energize his base for Cruz just two weeks before Election Day. The president praised the senator as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and smart, a far cry from two years ago when he repeatedly mocked Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d made fun of his wife\u2019s appearance and suggested that Cruz\u2019s Cuban-born father had a hand in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nWith the win, Cruz kept alive his hopes of mounting a second presidential run once Trump leaves the White House.\n\nRepublican Senator Ted Cruz fended off rising-star Democrat Beto O'Rourke to win re-election in a much-watched Texas race that began as a cakewalk but needed a visit from President Donald Trump to help push the incumbent over the top. (Nov. 7)\n\nIn his victory speech, Cruz said his win affirmed that he won the \u201cbattle of ideas\u201d against O\u2019Rourke over issues like low taxes, reduced regulation and jobs.\n\n\u201cAll the money in the world wasn\u2019t a match for the good people of Texas,\u201d he said, while also acknowledging that millions of people across the state were inspired by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign.\n\nO\u2019Rourke grabbed glowing national headlines by visiting all 254 Texas counties and often drawing large crowds \u2014 even in fiercely conservative areas other Democrats had long since written off. He raked in donations from across the country and even set a new record for Senate campaign fundraising by collecting more than $38 million in the three-month period from July through September alone. All told, he raised a whopping amount \u2014 more than $70 million.\n\nO\u2019Rourke even got an unexpected boost from Beyonce as the Houston native posted pictures of herself wearing a Beto baseball cap on Instantgram mere hours before the polls closed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. Thousands of supporters who attended O\u2019Rourke\u2019s election party at a minor-league stadium in his native El Paso chanted \u201cBeto, Beto, Beto,\u201d but the crowd got more anxious as word spread that their candidate wasn\u2019t going to prevail. Election returns that played briefly on the stadium scoreboard were pulled quickly and replaced with a local rock band on stage.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, his voice hoarse from the grind of the campaign, told supporters that the campaign would \u201clead to something far greater than today.\u201d He took a subtle jab at Trump\u2019s vow to build a border wall and at one point uttered an expletive that was captured on live television.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as inspired, I\u2019m as hopeful as I\u2019ve ever been and tonight\u2019s loss does nothing to diminish how I feel about Texas or this country\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nCruz had the support of outside groups but was still being outraised 3-to-1 by the end of the race \u2014 a discrepancy he dismissed by saying the \u201chard left\u201d was energized by outrage at Trump and \u201cTexas will not be bought.\u201d\n\nFor months, Cruz refused to entertain the notion that he\u2019d lose, saying there are more Republicans in Texas than Democrats, so all he had to do to win was avoid conservative complacency. He also said O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support for impeaching Trump, relaxing federal immigration policy, decriminalizing marijuana and implementing universal health care were too liberal for even many of the state\u2019s moderate Democrats and independents.\n\nStill, the race laid bare that many Texas conservatives never forgave Cruz for clashing with Trump at the end of the 2016 presidential primary and for refusing to endorse him at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland \u2014 a move many saw as putting personal ambitions over party. That\u2019s despite Cruz being one of the fiercest supporters of the president and the policies of the Republican-controlled Congress since then, despite getting to the Senate in 2012 as a tea party insurgent intent on enraging establishment leaders from both parties.\n\nCruz, 47, made no secret about wanting to run for president again once Trump leaves office. And though he was tested by O\u2019Rourke, avoiding what would have been a monumental upset means that remains a possibility. O\u2019Rourke himself had been mentioned as a possible 2020 White House contender \u2014 but that was dependent on him staying within striking distance of Cruz.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s defeat also dashed Democrats\u2019 decades-long hopes of a booming Texas Hispanic population flipping the country\u2019s largest red state blue, potentially transforming the national electoral maps and all-but blocking a Republican path to the presidency. Cruz has for years warned that a Democratic Texas would mean his party would never again win the White House.\n\nA Texas Democrat hasn\u2019t won any of the nearly 30 statewide offices since 1994, the country\u2019s longest losing streak.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "People stand in line to cast their vote at a public school in the Upper West Side neighborhood of New York, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Problem signs that arose during weeks of early voting carried into Election Day as some voters across the country faced hours-long lines, malfunctioning voting equipment and unexpectedly closed polling places.\n\nSome of the biggest backups were in Georgia , where the governor\u2019s race was among the nation\u2019s most-watched midterm contests and was generating heavy turnout.\n\nOne voter in Gwinnett County, Ontaria Woods, waited more than three hours and said she saw about two dozen people who had come to vote leave because of the lines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to tell them to wait, but people have children,\u201d Woods said. \u201cPeople are getting hungry. People are tired.\u201d\n\nThe good-government group Common Cause said high turnout combined with too few voting machines, ballots and workers was causing delays.\n\nFulton County elections director Richard Barron acknowledged that some precincts did have lines of voters but said that was due to the length of the ballots and voting machines taken from use because of an ongoing lawsuit, although plaintiffs in the case dispute that as a reason.\n\nBroken ballot scanners are leading to long lines at some polling sites in New York City. (Nov. 6)\n\nWhile voting went on without a hitch in many communities, voters from New York to California faced long lines and malfunctioning equipment. In Maryland, some precincts ran out of ballots and hundreds of voters lingered after hours.\n\nAt other polling places in Georgia, Texas and Arizona, hours were extended \u2014 in some cases by court order.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the nonpartisan Election Protection hotline had received more than 30,000 calls from voters reporting problems at their polling places. Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which helps run the hotline, said that number was well ahead of the last midterm election in 2014, when it had received about 17,000 calls by the same time.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election marked the first nationwide voting since Russia targeted state election systems in the 2016 presidential race. Federal, state and local officials have been working to make the nation\u2019s myriad election systems more secure.\n\nThere were no signs throughout the day that Russia or any other foreign actor had tried to launch cyberattacks against voting systems in any state, federal authorities said. There was also no indication that any systems have been compromised that would prevent voting, change vote counts or disrupt the ability to tally votes, U.S. officials said.\n\nThat was little comfort to voters who found themselves waiting in long lines or dealing with malfunctioning voting equipment.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, about 400 people waited in a line outside the registrar\u2019s office. Across New York City, reports of broken ballot scanners surfaced at several polling places. Turnout was so heavy at one packed precinct on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side that the line to scan ballots stretched around a junior high school gym. Poll workers there told voters that two of the roughly half-dozen scanners were malfunctioning and repairs were underway.\n\nVoters arriving at two polling stations discovered that most scanners had broken down, forcing some people to drop their ballots in emergency ballot boxes or vote using affidavit ballots.\n\n\u201cThere are broken scanners everywhere in Brooklyn,\u201d said Stefan Ringel, spokesman for Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams.\n\nRingel said Adams and his staff were being flooded with phone calls, emails and text messages reporting breakdowns in more than a dozen neighborhoods.\n\nCompared with the 2016 elections, he said, \u201canecdotally, it seems worse, and there\u2019s confusion among poll workers about what to do.\u201d\n\nMany voters nevertheless stuck it out, determined to cast their ballots.\n\n\u201cPeople are grumpy and frustrated but positive in a weird way, making jokes and talking to one another. I think it\u2019s because we all are in the \u2018no one will stop our vote today\u2019 mood,\u201d said Nikki Euell, an advertising producer who waited more than two hours to vote in Brooklyn\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood.\n\nThe local breakdowns are a symptom of a larger problem with the nation\u2019s voting infrastructure, said Lawrence Norden, a voting technology expert with the Brennan Center.\n\nForty-one states use computerized voting machines that are more than a decade old, and 43 states have machines that are no longer manufactured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s further evidence, if any was needed, that it\u2019s long past time to modernize our voting infrastructure,\u201d Norden said. \u201cVoters have a right to be frustrated by long lines. And they have a right to expect voting machines that work and have a paper backup.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, polling place confusion caused problems for voters and poll workers.\n\nIn Phoenix, a polling site was foreclosed on overnight, forcing poll workers to move it just in time for polls to open.\n\nFor about an hour after polls opened, a Sarasota County, Florida, precinct had to tell voters to come back later because their ballots were unavailable.\n\nIn one Indiana county, voting was snarled for hours because of what election officials said were computer problems checking in voters, while in another part of the state a judge ordered 12 polling places to stay open late after voting didn\u2019t start as scheduled.\n\nIn Texas, home of a hotly contested U.S. Senate race, delays were reported in Houston after apparent issues with registration check-in machines at some polling places. Later in the day, a judge ruled that nine Houston-area polling places would stay open beyond the usual closing time after advocacy groups complained that they didn\u2019t open on time and forced many voters to leave without casting ballots.\n\nAnd in El Paso, the U.S. Border Patrol canceled a crowd control exercise that was scheduled for Tuesday, following criticism from civil liberties groups that it could dissuade people from voting.\n\nBorder Patrol agent Fidel Baca confirmed Tuesday that the exercise, in a Latino neighborhood, was canceled but declined to say why. The Texas Civil Rights Project said the exercise, billed by the Border Patrol as a mobile field force demonstration, was to be held within a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) of a polling site.\n\n___\n\nLong and Balsamo reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Frank Bajak in Boston, Thomas Davies in Indianapolis, Jennifer Peltz and Verena Dobnik in New York, Ben Nadler in Atlanta, Jennifer Kay in Miami and Ryan Tarinelli in Dallas contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christina Almeida Cassidy at https://twitter.com/AP_Christina , Colleen Long at http://twitter.com/ctlong1 and Michael Balsamo at http://twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WHAT TO WATCH: After turbulent campaign, it\u2019s up to voters\n\nGeorgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams speaks to supporters at a rally, Monday, Nov., 5, 2018, in Richmond Hill, Ga.

Morton)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Tweetstorms and a trade war. Kanye in the Oval Office. Kavanaugh in the hearing room.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has been a wild, turbulent, two-year ride. Now it\u2019s time for voters to weigh in how much they\u2019re enjoying it.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 across-the-board control of Congress is at stake in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election, along with command of governors\u2019 offices and statehouses around the country.\n\nThe president has barnstormed the nation this fall, holding multiple rallies a week, mindful that his future will be shaped by Election Day. \u201cEven though I\u2019m not on the ballot, in a certain way I am on the ballot,\u201d Trump said Monday.\n\nA guide to what to watch as results come in Tuesday night. All times are EST.\n\n___\n\nTHE TIMELINE\n\nPolls start closing at 6 p.m. in Kentucky. But things will really get rolling at 7 p.m., when polls close in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina and Virginia. Another wave of numbers will begin coming in after 7:30 p.m. from North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. A big chunk of data will come after 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. when states such as Texas, New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania begin reporting. The 11 p.m. batch of states includes California, home to several competitive congressional races. Alaska, where polls close at 1 a.m. Wednesday, will end the night.\n\n___\n\nTHE EARLY VOTE\n\nMuch of America has already voted . Based on reports from 49 states, through Monday, at least 36.4 million people voted in the midterms before Election Day. And in a sign of the growing influence of early voting, 30 states reported exceeding their total number of mail and in-person votes cast ahead of the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nA big question: Does it mean a higher turnout?\n\nTurnout in midterm elections is typically near 40 percent, much lower than presidential elections, where turnout has hit around 60 percent in recent cycles. University of Florida professor Michael McDonald, who studies voting patterns, estimated recently that about 45 percent of eligible voters could cast ballots this year, a turnout level that hasn\u2019t been seen in nearly a half century.\n\n___\n\nEARLY TEA LEAVES\n\nFor an early read on how things are going, keep an eye on two congressional races in Virginia: a district in the Washington suburbs represented by Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock and another in the Richmond area held by Republican Rep. Dave Brat.\n\nTrump has struggled with college-educated women in the suburbs and Comstock\u2019s district could be among the first casualties as she faces Democrat Jennifer Wexton. Brat, meanwhile, won his seat by upsetting then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the 2014 GOP primary. But this time he is facing a serious threat from Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer.\n\nAnother district to watch is in Kentucky \u2014 the Lexington-area battle pitting third-term Republican Rep. Andy Barr against Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot. Trump won the 6th District by more than 15 percentage points in 2016. But McGrath has pushed Barr to the edge with the help of sharp campaign ads that went viral.\n\n___\n\nAP VOTECAST\n\nThe Associated Press will debut a new survey of the American electorate in Tuesday\u2019s elections that aims to more accurately capture the story of how Americans voted and why.\n\nThe launch of AP VoteCast is the largest change in the way final information about voters\u2019 choices is collected by media organizations since CBS News first conducted an exit poll in 1972.\n\nVoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for AP and Fox News. Both AP and Fox were members of the National Election Poll, which has for decades conducted the exit poll.\n\nThe remaining members of the pool \u2014 CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC \u2014 will again rely on an exit poll conducted by Edison Research. Several other major news organizations, such as the Los Angeles Times, will use VoteCast.\n\n___\n\nHOUSE STAKES\n\nRepublicans have had control of the House since the tea party helped sweep them into power in the 2010 midterms. Nearly a decade later, the GOP is trying to avoid a \u201cblue wave\u201d that returns Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats to the majority.\n\nControl of the House is expected to be determined by a few dozen districts , many of them in the nation\u2019s suburbs. Democrats need a net increase of 23 seats to win back control \u2014 a number that many GOP officials concede is a very possible outcome.\n\nThe House races will offer clues to where Americans stand in 2018 on immigration, guns, health care, gender equality in the #MeToo era \u2014 and determine who they want representing them in Washington during the next two years of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n___\n\nSENATE STAKES\n\nRepublicans hold a narrow Senate majority, 51-49, but have a huge advantage in these contests because the battle for control runs mostly through states that Trump won in 2016.\n\nTo put it simply: Democrats are on defense. Of the 35 Senate races, 10 involve Democratic incumbents seeking re-election in states won by Trump, often by large margins. Democrats\u2019 hopes of recapturing the Senate hinge on all their incumbents winning \u2014 a difficult task \u2014 and on flipping seats in Nevada, won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, and a few states that lean Republican, most notably Arizona, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nTrump has coveted seats held by several red-state Democrats, including Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. Strategists from both parties consider Heitkamp the most vulnerable Democrat but say the Senate makeup could be shaped by a number of narrowly contested races, including Arizona, Missouri, Indiana and Montana.\n\nAnother epic clash to watch: a race involving Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s one-time GOP presidential rival, against Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who hauled in a massive $70 million during the campaign. Cruz is still considered the favorite \u2014 Texas hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to the Senate in 30 years.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP\n\nAir Force One ferried Trump across the country on Monday for rallies in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, and the president didn\u2019t return to the White House until well after midnight. On Election Day, the president was appearing in local interviews around the country but wasn\u2019t expected to make any public appearances at the White House.\n\nBut any viewer should keep a second screen handy to watch Trump\u2019s Twitter feed. The president is known for offering his first take on many key events on Twitter \u2014 and that could certainly happen as the election results come into fuller view.\n\n___\n\nYEAR OF THE WOMAN?\n\nA record number of women are on the ballot \u2014 and could become the story of the 2018 election .\n\nTwo years after Clinton\u2019s defeat, more women than ever before won major party primaries for governor, the Senate and the House this year. The results could significantly increase the number of women in elected office.\n\nAbout 235 women won their primaries for the House, according to records kept by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. In the Senate, a record 22 women won their primaries. And a record 16 women were nominated for gubernatorial races.\n\nMany Democratic women, including first-time candidates, have said Trump\u2019s election motivated them to run for office. But the election is also following the emergence of the #MeToo movement, the massive women\u2019s march after Trump\u2019s inauguration and the pitched battle over the Supreme Court confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWomen currently account for one-fifth of the 535 House members and senators. By next January, that number could change.\n\n___\n\nMAKING HISTORY\n\nThe night could witness a generational change in Congress and herald in a number of barrier-breaking officeholders.\n\nIn New York City, 29-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is expected to become the youngest woman elected to Congress. In Georgia, Stacey Abrams is vying to become the first black woman to be elected governor in the nation. Andrew Gillum could become Florida\u2019s first black governor. And Ayanna Pressley is the favorite to become Massachusetts\u2019 first black woman elected to Congress.\n\nSouth Dakota Rep. Kristi Noem could become her state\u2019s first female governor. Vermont\u2019s Christine Hallquist could become the nation\u2019s first openly transgender governor. And Idaho\u2019s Paulette Jordan is trying to become the country\u2019s first Native American governor.\n\nNative American women could also win seats in Congress. In New Mexico, former state Democratic Party chairwoman Deb Haaland is trying to become the first Native American woman elected to Congress. She could be joined by Sharice Davids of Kansas, a Native American woman who is also attempting to become the state\u2019s first openly LGBT candidate to win a major office.\n\nIn Michigan, Rashida Tlaib could become first Muslim woman and first Palestinian-American in Congress.

Federal, state and local officials have sought to reassure the public that their voting systems are secure.\n\nSo far, there have been no signs that Russia or any other foreign actor has tried to launch cyberattacks against voting systems in any state, according to federal authorities.\n\nSome states have already dealt with voting problems. Voters casting ballots early have encountered faulty machines in Texas and North Carolina, inaccurate mailers in Missouri and Montana, and voter registration problems in Tennessee and Georgia. In other states, including Kansas, Election Day polling places have been closed or consolidated.\n\n___\n\nINDICTED, YET VICTORIOUS?\n\nTwo Republican members of Congress are trying to win another term while facing separate federal charges.\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., and his wife are accused of misspending more than $250,000 in campaign funds on everything from tequila shots to airfare for a family pet. Prosecutors say the couple tried to conceal the illegal spending as donations to charities, including groups for wounded veterans. Hunter faces Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar in a GOP-friendly district in the San Diego area.\n\nRep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., is accused of illegally leaking confidential information about a biopharmaceutical company to his son and the father of his son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e that allowed them to avoid hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock losses.\n\nCollins\u2019 most serious charge carries a potential prison term of up to 20 years. If Collins wins in the western New York district and is later convicted and forced to resign, a special election would be held.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton is still under indictment \u2014 he pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of securities fraud. But the Republican is favored to win a second term, helped by a positive assessment from Trump, who singled him out at a rally in Houston as doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/KThomasDC\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey speaks at Montgomery Airport before flying around the state on the final full day of her campaign in Montgomery, Ala., on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018. (Jake Crandall/The Montgomery Advertiser via AP)\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) \u2014 Kay Ivey, who became Alabama\u2019s governor last year when her predecessor resigned in a cloud of scandal, was elected Tuesday to a full term after fending off a challenge from Democratic rival Walt Maddox.\n\nThe Republican Ivey, who had been lieutenant governor, became governor 19 months ago when then-Gov. Robert Bentley suddenly resigned in the midst of an impeachment investigation partly centered on his relationship with an aide.\n\nIn her trademark drawl, Ivey, 74, had told voters throughout the campaign that she had restored trust to government. Her campaign ads emphasized the state\u2019s record low unemployment and growing economy, while highlighting the governor\u2019s folksy no-nonsense demeanor. She also emphasized her opposition to abortion and support of gun rights.\n\n\u201cThank you. Thank you. Together, we\u2019ve done it,\u201d Ivey said to cheers as she took the stage to cheers at her election night party.\n\n\u201cThe people of Alabama have spoken today loud and clear. They want to keep Alabama on the right track and keep Alabama working.\u201d\n\nIvey is the state\u2019s second female governor. She said her campaign made history as she became the first Republican woman elected to the position.\n\nAs the presumed front-runner in the red state, Ivey had refused to debate Maddox, as well as her GOP primary opponents, a move that was frequently criticized by her political challengers.\n\nIvey also faced indirect questions about her health as well as an accusation that she tried to cover up a health incident during a 2015 trip to Colorado and retaliated against the state trooper traveling with her for telling his superiors. Ivey denied the accusations and said she was hospitalized for altitude sickness and released a letter from her doctor saying she was a low risk for a cardiovascular event.\n\nIvey took a slight jab at her opponents in her victory speech, noting that some claimed she would never make it across the finish line or was \u201con her last breath.\u201d\n\nIvey said she not only finished, but \u201cfinished very strong and I am just now getting started.\u201d\n\nAfter years of holding no statewide offices, Democrats had hoped to build on last year\u2019s election of Doug Jones to the U.S. Senate. But they faced an uphill battle in a state dominated by Republicans.\n\nMaddox ran on a campaign on establishing a state lottery to fund college scholarships as well as expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMaddox pitched the race as a choice between politicians who are content with the state\u2019s low rankings in education, health care and other indicators and those who think it could be better.\n\nThe Tuscaloosa mayor in his concession speech offered his support to Ivey.\n\nHe told supporters they started a conversation about the state\u2019s future that he hoped would continue.\n\n\u201cWe have started a discussion that is not going to end with the results tonight. That is our victory,\u201d Maddox said.\n\n\u201cYou have talked about things in this state that have dared not been spoken, whether it was about race, whether it was about hospitals closing, whether it was about addressing poverty, whether it was trying to figure out what we do to address our schools that are not performing,\u201d Maddox said.\n\nMary Anne Martin, 73, voted for Ivey. Martin, who has worked in children\u2019s advocacy, said she liked that Ivey has had a scandal-free administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had so many scandals in this state,\u201d Martin said. \u201cShe is very hard-working.

Republicans defending their majority and Democrats looking to gain 23 seats they would need to win control.\n\nAfter the first polls close in the Eastern United States, the tallies will start revealing clues to where Americans stand in 2018 on immigration, guns, health care, gender equality in the #MeToo era \u2014 and who they want representing them in Washington during the next two years of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nSome races to watch for those keeping score, listed in order of poll-closing times:\n\n___\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nThe ruby-red state known for the Derby and sweet bourbon is hosting one of the most competitive and expensive races in the country. The Lexington-area battle pits third-term Republican Rep. Andy Barr against Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot. Trump won the 6th District by more than 15 percentage points in 2016. But with the help of carefully shaped campaign ads that went viral, McGrath holds the edge on campaign fundraising.\n\nPolls in the district close at 6 p.m. EST\n\n__\n\nGEORGIA\n\nRed-hot Georgia is home to a House race that turns on issues of race and gun laws. Republican Rep. Karen Handel narrowly won her seat in a special election last year that set a record for spending. Now her Democratic challenger is Lucy McBath, a former flight attendant turned gun control activist. McBath\u2019s 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was killed by a white man at a gas station in 2012 when the black teenager refused to lower the volume on the rap music in his car. The district north of Atlanta leans Republican, but Trump won it by only 1 percentage point.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. EST.\n\n___\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nRep. Dave Brat won his seat after upsetting House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the 2014 Republican primary. Now, it\u2019s Brat\u2019s turn to fight for re-election to the Richmond-area district against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer who is one of a record number of women running for Congress this year.\n\nPolls close at 7 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s 9th District became a key election bellwether when the Rev. Mark Harris narrowly ousted three-term Rep. Robert Pittenger in the GOP primary, giving Democrats a wider opening in solidly red territory. Democrats answered with Dan McCready, an Iraq War veteran, solar energy company founder and Harvard Business School graduate. Trump won the district by 12 points and a Democrat hasn\u2019t been elected to represent it since John F. Kennedy was president.\n\nPolls close at 7:30 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nOHIO\n\nIt\u2019s a rematch in central Ohio\u2019s 12th District between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor. Balderson won short-term control of the seat in August during a special election after Republican Pat Tiberi retired. Republicans in the district appear divided over the president, making the seat vulnerable to a Democrat who, like O\u2019Connor, has supported some Republican ideas. He\u2019s engaged to a Republican who calls herself a \u201cDannycrat.\u201d\n\nPolls close at 7:30 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nFLORIDA\n\nNational Republicans and Democrats are pouring major resources into the Miami-area 27th District seat, held since 1989 by retiring Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Democratic nominee , former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, has ramped up her Spanish-language advertising and Hillary Clinton campaigned for her. But she\u2019s facing a stiff challenge from her Republican opponent, Maria Elvira Salazar, a Cuban-American and former broadcast journalist who, unlike Shalala, speaks Spanish. Though Trump won Florida in 2016, Clinton won this congressional district by nearly 20 points.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nAlong with California and Pennsylvania, suburb-filled New Jersey is a key battleground for House control. Two seats are open, vacated by veteran Republican Reps. Frank LoBiondo and Rodney Frelinghuysen , and could fall to the Democrats.\n\nKeep a close eye on the 3rd District south of Trenton, which twice voted for President Barack Obama but went for Trump by about 6 percentage points. Fighting for re-election is Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur, who helped strike a deal that pushed the GOP\u2019s \u201cObamacare\u201d repeal bill to House passage (it failed in the Senate). His Democratic opponent is political newcomer Andy Kim, a National Security Council staffer under Obama who has worked in Afghanistan.\n\nPolls close 8 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nDemocrats have particular reason to believe they can flip as many as six seats in the Keystone state. A state Supreme Court decision in January threw out 6-year-old congressional district boundaries as unconstitutionally drawn to benefit Republicans. The replacement districts approved by the court\u2019s Democratic majority have created more competitive contests.\n\nOne key race is playing out in the Philadelphia suburbs. Freshman Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a former FBI agent, has a centrist voting record and has explicitly tried to put distance between himself and Trump. He\u2019s facing Scott Wallace, a longtime Democratic Party donor who was co-chairman of the Wallace Global Fund, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that supports liberal social movements.

That\u2019s where Democrat Paul Davis, the former state House minority leader, and Republican Steve Watkins, an Army veteran and engineer, are battling for the seat vacated by retiring Democratic Rep. Lynn Jenkins. Davis has said he would not support Pelosi for speaker if Democrats win the House. And Republicans were hoping that Trump\u2019s visit to Topeka last month would boost Republican Steve Watkins, who has faced questions over claims he made about his qualifications and background.\n\nPolls close 9 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nMINNESOTA\n\nFour House seats could flip from one party to the other in this traditionally Democratic stronghold.\n\nFor evidence of Democratic gains, look to the state\u2019s booming suburbs. Clinton won Minnesota\u2019s 3rd District west of Minneapolis by 9 percentage points. GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen is under heavy pressure from Democrat Dean Phillips there. Paulsen avoided Trump\u2019s recent rally in Rochester and his rally this summer in Duluth, and he has said he wrote in Marco Rubio\u2019s name in the 2016 election. Still, Trump endorsed Paulsen last month.\n\nPolls close 9 p.m. EST\n\n____\n\nNEW MEXICO\n\nThe open 2nd District seat left open by Republican Rep. Steve Pearce, who is running for governor, offers a look at how the parties fare along the border with Mexico, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans. Pearce attracted support from Hispanics and the region\u2019s oil and gas interests. But the race between Democrat Xochitl Torres Small and GOP opponent Yyvette Herrell has focused on hot-button issues such as immigration and guns. Torres Small has raised more than five times the campaign cash drawn by Herrell.\n\nPolls close 9 p.m. EST.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThis deep-blue state offers a look at how race and Trump\u2019s clout are playing out in the president\u2019s home state.\n\nNorth of New York City in the 19th District, an ad released last month by the Republican National Congressional Committee showed clips of Democrat Antonio Delgado performing songs from his 2006 rap album under his stage name, A.D. The Voice. Delgado, a Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School graduate, said his opponent, Rep. John Faso, was using racial attacks to alienate him, a black first-time candidate in a district that is more than 90 percent white. Voters there are evenly split among Democrats, Republicans and independents, and went twice for Obama but favored Trump.\n\nAnd in the Buffalo-area\u2019s 22nd District, first-term Rep. Claudia Tenney, an early Trump supporter, is drawing comparisons to the president by brashly suggesting some people who commit mass murders are Democrats and promoting a petition to lock up Clinton. But in a close race against Democrat Anthony Brindisi, she\u2019s shifted to a softer tone of bipartisanship. Brindisi, a state assemblyman, argues that Tenney\u2019s hyper-partisan approach undermines her claim of working across the aisle. Trump beat Clinton by nearly 16 percentage points here.\n\nPolls close 9 p.m. EST.\n\n___\n\nIOWA\n\nOne Iowa race offers a test of whether a Trump-style advocate for immigration limits can win.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve King is keeping a low profile in his bid for a ninth House term, his success suddenly in question after he was engulfed in controversy for his support of white nationalists. But Democrats, already hoping to flip two other seats among Iowa\u2019s four-person delegation, have a tough road to success in the 4th District that voted for Trump by 27 percentage points. In an unusual move, the GOP\u2019s campaign chief condemned King the week before the election, but it\u2019s unclear whether the criticism will boost his Democratic opponent, J.D.

Fallout from Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings and fights over health care and immigration have produced a tossup race where Democrats count a slender registration edge. Denham, a centrist who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, won re-election by 3 percentage points in 2016, while Clinton won the district with about 49 percent of the vote.\n\nIn another test of GOP clout in a rapidly diversifying district, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s re-election is in question for the first time in 30 years. A wave of new and more diverse residents and divisions over Trump and the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct have produced a strong challenge from Democrat Harley Rouda.

Nelson has stressed that he favors a ban on military-style assault weapons and implementing a comprehensive system of background checks. Scott signed legislation in Florida that requires anyone wanting to buy a gun to be 21 years old, but the bill didn\u2019t include a ban on assault weapons.\n\nThe two have also differed on health care, with Nelson calling for strengthening the Affordable Care Act, but Scott calling the law deeply flawed and costly.\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. EST\n\n___\n\nMISSOURI\n\nDemocratic Sen.

Human rights issues and whittling down corporate influence were major concerns for the retired office worker.\n\n\u201cWe are living in the foothills of the preposterous,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m fighting for these things 30 years later.\u201d\n\n___\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n\u201cDark times,\u201d exclaimed Caitlin Craven, a 36-year-old writer from San Francisco. The registered Democrat said she was so horrified by the Trump administration policies that she has started volunteering with immigrant rights groups.\n\n\u201cIt goes against everything that this country is supposed to be. We\u2019re supposed to be a refuge for people who want a better life, and to welcome them. We\u2019re all immigrants. And it goes against all of that,\u201d she said.\n\nGreg Vargas, 39, a real estate agent from Costa Mesa, dislikes Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Latino immigrants. Originally from Colombia, Vargas became a U.S. citizen in 2013.\n\n\u201cDefinitely Trump motivated me to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s always using us as a scapegoat.\u201d\n\nVargas, a Democrat, also feels strongly as a black Latino.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always throwing hints to the white supremacists that he\u2019s supporting them and he\u2019s backing them,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cIt\u2019s really obvious for them that Donald Trump is their guy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE ECONOMY\n\nRichard and Aleshia Murphy took their 7-month-old daughter to the poll. Both Trump supporters, they moved from Reno, Nevada, to Lakewood just south of Los Angeles seven months ago.\n\nMurphy, a train operations manager, said the economy motivated the couple to vote.\n\n\u201cI want to keep things going,\u201d he said. \u201cMy work feels the booming economy. We\u2019re hiring more people, all positions, from the bottom to the top.\u201d\n\nThe Murphys voted yes on Proposition 6 to repeal a 12-cent gas tax hike approved by lawmakers last year. The money was intended for road works and transit programs. But the Murphys already are coping with California\u2019s higher fuel costs, sky-high home prices and general cost of living.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s been a sticker shock,\u201d Richard Murphy said. \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\nEnrique Alonzo, a 46-year-old civil engineer and \u201chard-core conservative\u201d from Anaheim Hills, also cited the economy as he voted for Republican John Cox for governor.\n\n\u201cAnything that affects my pocketbook I vote against, and normally that is a Democrat,\u201d he said.\n\nAlonzo opposes any efforts to increase taxes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much mismanagement\u201d in government, he said.\n\n____\n\nONE-PARTY STATE?\n\nRichard Sindt said he voted only for Democrats, feeling he couldn\u2019t trust Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey have a grip on the businesses and the financial industry and the economic situation has been taking us into the ground,\u201d said Sindt, a 71-year-old retired mapmaker from Garden Grove.\n\nBut Steve Bridge, a 68-year-old store manager from nearby Orange, thinks Democrats are the danger. That\u2019s why he voted for Mimi Walters, the GOP U.S. House incumbent for the 45th District.\n\n\u201cI do not want a Democratic takeover of the Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cOur country is doing good now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at California \u2014 it\u2019s almost a one-party state,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no tax that Democrats don\u2019t like. They just tax you to death.\u201d\n\nRepublican Monte Neal\u2019s dissatisfaction with Democrats running California also drove him to the ballot box.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t voted in years, so I figure if I want my voice heard I should come out and vote,\u201d he said.\n\nHe chose John Cox for governor over Democrat Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cNewsom is going to walk right into (former Gov. Jerry) Brown\u2019s shoes and keep doing what Brown\u2019s doing right now and that\u2019s running California into the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cI want a change here in California.\u201d\n\n___\n\nHOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS\n\nAt the same time, Neal voted in favor of two bond measures that would provide a combined $6 billion for housing. The 53-year-old construction worker spent three years living on the streets before a Sacramento housing program gave him a place to live. He now runs a house in Sacramento that provides housing for other formerly homeless people and says he sees firsthand how critical funding is to help homeless people, particularly ones with mental illness.\n\nHomelessness also was a key issue for Carol Hawkins, 67, a retired nurse from Alameda.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big thing for our state. It\u2019s sad,\u201d said Hawkins, a Democrat. \u201cThere are women who get up and get dressed to go to work in the morning and they\u2019re homeless because they can\u2019t afford rent.\u201d\n\nScott Soykin, an independent from Sacramento, works for the state maintaining voter rolls. He is a renter and favored Proposition 10, which would let cities and counties regulate rental fees in buildings that state law currently shields from such control.\n\n\u201cIf that passes, it would then allow local cities to be able to have that ability to enact rent controls, which I think are sorely needed, especially in our state,\u201d said Soykin, 34. \u201cThe housing crisis is insane. My wife and I make $110,000 a year and can\u2019t afford a house. It\u2019s out of control.\u201d\n\nBeth Henderson of Roseville, a conservative Republican, also supports the measure. The 43-year-old lives with her parents because she does not make enough money through disability payments to afford her own apartment. She faults \u201cgreedy companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are homeless because the rent is out of control,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nGAS TAX\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Democrat-controlled Legislature passed the gas tax that Proposition 6 would repeal but that doesn\u2019t mean rank-and-file Democrats are necessarily in favor of it.\n\nLesette Pate, a 52-year-old Inglewood resident, certainly wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking from certain things to fund other things,\u201d said Pate, a medical biller and coder. \u201cI feel they could come up with a better solution around the board. I mean, you go to work and if gas is already $3.87 a lot of places, it\u2019s very, very expensive and if you\u2019re not making a lot, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the roads need repairing and all of that but you need to find money for that someplace else,\u201d Janice Nears, a 63-year-old retired U.S. postal worker living in Los Angeles who voted Democratic. \u201cGas is too expensive. It was already expensive in this state. It\u2019s ridiculous. We just have to find that money someplace else.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTHE TONE OF THE TIMES\n\nTrump\u2019s policies translated into poll decisions for some. But his rhetoric got mixed reviews.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the president of the United States of America, and \u2018united\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to be part of his vocabulary,\u201d said Bill Lewis, a 61-year-old solar energy marketer from Costa Mesa, who voted Democratic.\n\nErin Murray, a 44-year-old homemaker and Republican voter from North Tustin, said she doesn\u2019t always agree with everything the president says.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes he has a loose tongue, but I think in general he\u2019s benefiting this country,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he listens to us ... he listens to Americans.\u201d\n\nMurray said overall, she likes the direction in which he\u2019s taking the country. That\u2019s why she decided to keep Walters, the GOP incumbent for her Orange County area.\n\nThings were exactly the opposite for Harriet Leavitt, a 76-year-old Democratic retiree from neighboring Tustin.\n\n\u201cI very, very, very, very much dislike Trump and all his policies. I think the Republicans don\u2019t have a backbone and do whatever he says,\u201d she said. \u201cAnybody who is related to Republicans and Trump, I don\u2019t want them in.\u201d\n\nAleshia Murphy, the stay-at-home mom from Lakewood, said she\u2019d like to see more civility in Washington and among regular Americans.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all acting like a bunch of children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt literally reminds me of my 3-year-old throwing a fit.\u201d\n\nMurphy wasn\u2019t bothered by the president\u2019s remarks about women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have somebody who\u2019s going to come off as a complete jerk but you know exactly what they\u2019re thinking because they have no filter, than a slick-haired politician that literally tells you anything you want to hear just so that you support them,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nContributing to this story were AP journalists Sophia Bollag, Jocelyn Gecker, Janie Har, Amanda Lee Myers, Kathleen Ronayne, Amy Taxin, and Julie Watson.", "Sen.

(AP) \u2014 Virginia voters reproached President Donald Trump for the second year in row as Democrats flipped three congressional races and scored a convincing victory in a U.S. Senate race.\n\nDemocrats won GOP-held districts in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and the Richmond area, boosted by suburban voters unhappy with the president. The Virginia victories helped put Democrats on track to take control of the U.S. House.\n\nAll three Democratic congressional victories were by women, two of whom are new to politics.\n\n\u201cWe succeeded at the polls tonight because voters rejected the politics of hate, the politics of division and the politics of ideology,\u201d said Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer.\n\nShe knocked off Republican Dave Brat in a Richmond-area district. Brat was a tea party favorite who scored a major upset four years ago when he defeated then-U.S. Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a GOP primary.\n\nIn Hampton Roads, Elaine Luria defeated Republican Rep. Scott Taylor. Luria, a former Navy commander, had never run for office before, like Spanberger.\n\nA former Navy SEAL, Taylor was viewed by many as up and comer in the GOP who had potential for future statewide run.\n\nRepublican Rep. Barbara Comstock, another rising star in the GOP, lost her Northern Virginia seat to state Sen. Jennifer Wexton.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying that change is coming. ... That change came tonight,\u201d Wexton told hundreds of cheering supporters after she won.\n\nSpanberger and Luria notched narrow victories. Wexton and Sen. Tim Kaine, who defeated Republican Corey Stewart to secure a second term, won easily.\n\nDemocrats controlled only four out of 11 congressional seats in Virginia prior to Tuesday. Now they are set to control seven seats to the GOP\u2019s four.\n\nThe strong showing by Democrats highlights Virginia\u2019s continued dislike of the president, particularly among suburban voters. Virginia served as an early indicator for anti-Trump energy during its 2017 race for governor. Democrats trounced Republicans in all three statewide races and won more seats in the state House than virtually anyone expected.\n\nHealth care and immigration were top issues in voters\u2019 mind in this election, according to a wide-ranging survey of the electorate. And nearly 7 in 10 voters said Trump was a reason for their vote.\n\nRoss Noe, 55, a financial underwriter from Goochland, said he voted for Democrats as a way of sending a message of discontent with how Trump is governing.\n\n\u201cI am just very afraid of some of the decisions being made in Washington,\u201d said Noe.\n\nRepublicans tried in varying degrees to separate themselves from Trump and focus on a growing economy.\n\nRichard Milner, 66, who inspects private boats for insurance companies along Virginia\u2019s coast, voted for U.S. Rep Scott Taylor and Stewart, and credits Trump and Republicans in Congress for the booming economy. He said business for him has been \u201crocking and rolling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had a Democrat in there, they would be totally against whatever (Trump) wanted to do, which is more of a roadblock for the government getting things done,\u201d said Milner, who lives in Norfolk.\n\nOne bright spot for Republicans was Denver Riggleman, who won an open seat in central Virginia against Democrat Leslie Cockburn in a district that Trump won by 11 percentage points.\n\nRiggleman, in a phone interview, acknowledged he was surprised by comfortable his margin of victory. He said he thinks he was able to connect with voters in the district by speaking plainly and directly with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a conservative ... but I don\u2019t think we have to be so polarized to get things done,\u201d he said.\n\nA Republican also won a special election in a Roanoke-area state House district, allowing the GOP to hold on to a narrow majority in the House of Delegates.\n\n___\n\nBarakat reported from Chantilly, Virginia.

Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Bismarck, N.D. (AP Photo/Bruce Crummy)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 Republican Kevin Cramer ousted Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp on Tuesday, persuading North Dakota voters that his emphatic conservatism would serve them better than her occasional independence from her own party.\n\nCramer won the race, helping Republicans retain their Senate majority, just nine months after it took a personal appeal from President Donald Trump to get him into the race. Once he got in, the three-term congressman made his support for Trump a pillar of his campaign.\n\nCramer, in his victory speech at Bismarck State College, said Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called to congratulate him.\n\nCramer called the victory \u201cthe honor of my life.\u201d\n\nHeitkamp, who relied on an everywoman charm to help win her first term, worked hard the next six years to avoid alienating North Dakota\u2019s right-leaning electorate. But the state\u2019s makeup had Heitkamp atop everyone\u2019s list of endangered Senate incumbents throughout the campaign.\n\nBefore Cramer had stepped forward to take on Heitkamp, a charismatic and popular figure known to many in her small state as simply \u201cHeidi,\u201d the only Republican to challenge her was a little-known potato farmer and state lawmaker.\n\nHeitkamp, a former state attorney general and gas company executive, won her first term in 2012 by fewer than 3,000 votes. With Democrats badly needing to keep her seat for any shot at a Senate majority, she raised more than $27 million for her re-election. That was almost five times as much as Cramer.\n\n\u201cWe were outspent 5-to-1,\u201d Cramer said during his victory speech. \u201cWhen you put up a bunch of money to push a bad message, it only makes it worse, not better.\u201d\n\nTrump, who carried the state by 36 points in 2016 and remains popular in North Dakota, loomed large over the race. Heitkamp spent much of the campaign playing up her independence from her own party, reminding voters she had largely backed North Dakota\u2019s corporate interests on energy and that she had voted to confirm most of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and judicial nominees.\n\nDespite a personal appeal from Trump, Cramer announced in January he wouldn\u2019t run for Senate, citing family considerations and his House seniority.\n\nCramer said Tuesday that a second plea from Trump and the party faithful in February made him change his mind.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to run for the Senate and never once looked back,\u201d he told a cheering crowd.\n\nHeitkamp attacked Cramer as an unthinking yes man for Trump, and sought to raise questions about the administration\u2019s trade strategy, which she argued put North Dakota\u2019s agricultural economy at high risk. She said Cramer didn\u2019t belong in the Senate unless he was willing to \u201cprotect and defend the people of this state against bad administration policies.\u201d\n\nCramer struck back by arguing that Heitkamp wasn\u2019t the bipartisan senator she claimed to be.\n\nHe often cited her past support of Hillary Clinton and her vote against the tax cuts that Trump championed. He pointed out her votes against several other Republican-sponsored bills, including allowing states to deny federal funds for abortion providers, banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and a repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on high-cost health insurance plans.\n\nAnd above all, he went after Heitkamp for her vote against Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, a risky decision given Trump\u2019s popularity. Heitkamp cited Kavanaugh\u2019s temperament, and sought to cast it as further evidence of her independence.\n\nBut Cramer said it went against the grain of conservative North Dakota.\n\n\u201cBeing an independent isn\u2019t an excuse for being wrong,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nConnor Gref, 18, a Bismarck retail store worker preparing for college, said he did \u201ca lot of digging and research\u201d before settling on Cramer.\n\n\u201cHow each ran their campaign \u2014 I feel his was more credible, more believable,\u201d Gref said. \u201cCross-checking information, some of Heidi\u2019s stuff didn\u2019t add up. Cramer\u2019s (campaign) was more steady throughout, more consistent, truthful.\u201d\n\nHeidi Wahl-McDonald, 43, a Bismarck banker, said she thought Heitkamp was more likely to put the state\u2019s interests ahead of her party\u2019s.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a lot for North Dakota. She\u2019s a good leader. I think she\u2019s done a lot of things for our farmers. I think she\u2019s done a lot for businesses in North Dakota,\u201d Wahl-McDonald said after voting Tuesday. \u201cAnd not necessarily always voting on party lines \u2014 just making decisions based on what she thinks is best.\u201d\n\nCampaign cash flooded in for Heitkamp during and after the Kavanaugh period \u2014 an astounding $12 million in 17 days \u2014 but polls also showed a widening lead for Cramer.\n\nThe Kavanaugh issue also was at the heart of a damaging error by Heitkamp\u2019s campaign just weeks before the election, when she ran a newspaper ad attacking Cramer that improperly identified some survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Heitkamp repeatedly apologized for the ad after several women complained that they either weren\u2019t victims of abuse or hadn\u2019t consented to having their names used.\n\nHealth care was another prominent issue, with Heitkamp arguing that Cramer would support Republican policies that would undermine care for many, particularly people with pre-existing conditions. Cramer argued the current health care system is broken and promised not to support any legislation that would cut coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "WANAQUE, N.J.

Ted Budd, R-NC, celebrates with his supporters at his election party in Bermuda Run, N.C. on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, after defeating Kathy Manning for North Carolina's 13th Congressional District. (AP Photo/Woody Marshall)\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and fellow Democrats gained influence Tuesday at the currently Republican-dominated legislature for the next two years, breaking the GOP\u2019s veto-proof majority in the House and making inroads in the Senate.\n\nDemocrats gained at least eight additional House seats \u2014 well over the four needed to end the Republicans\u2019 complete control of the chamber. A Democrat also led in a very close House race, while Republicans led in two more. In the Senate, Democrats gained at least three additional seats and were leading in three others. They would break veto-proof control in the Senate if they ended up winning the remaining three.\n\nDemocratic gains mean the Republicans\u2019 run of dominance at the Legislative Building this decade will be curbed. Cooper now has more chances to implement his favored programs and policies before his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nVoters also handed defeats to Republican lawmakers by rejecting two constitutional amendments they put on the ballot that would have swung authority over filling judicial vacancies and the elections board from the governor and toward the legislature. Both failed after being opposed by all living governors, both Republican and Democrat. The other four amendments on the ballots were approved, including one to mandate photo identification to vote in person.\n\nBut Democrats had a harder time in U.S. House races, as GOP Reps. Ted Budd in the 13th District and George Holding in the 2nd District successfully fought off strong Democratic candidates. And nearly complete results showed Republican Mark Harris with a razor-thin lead over Democrat Dan McCready in the 9th District. A recount was possible. Should Harris win, Republicans would continue to hold 10 of the state\u2019s 13 House seats.\n\nWith no high-profile statewide races this fall, the electoral battle for control of the General Assembly became the climax of a two-year, headline-grabbing power struggle between Cooper and legislative leaders. Although North Carolina has come to be seen as a swing state nationally, its state legislature has been deeply Republican for nearly a decade, aided by favorable redistricting. Voters narrowly elected Cooper in 2016 while also choosing Republican Donald Trump for president.\n\nCooper had a lot to do with the political offensive that resulted in additional legislative seats. He helped raise over $7 million for the state Democratic Party to assist legislative candidates in the \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d effort. He also raised hundreds of thousands of additional dollars for individual candidates.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s veto-proof control essentially rendered Cooper ineffective on his legislative priorities since becoming governor. He\u2019s sought redress in the courts through several lawsuits challenging laws that eroded his power, leading to some judicial victories.\n\nCooper will now have more negotiating power to press for covering another 500,000 working people who lack health insurance through Medicaid, which has been one of his top priorities. He\u2019ll also be in a better position to press for raising teacher pay to the national average.\n\nDemocrats fell short of winning the 16 additional House seats and 11 more Senate seats overall to retake majorities for the first time since 2010.\n\nBut state Democratic Party Chair Wayne Goodwin said in a release the party still reached its goal of \u201cbreaking the Republican supermajority and electing a legislature that will work with Gov. Cooper to invest more in education, expand access to affordable health care and support working families.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the photo ID requirement, a majority of voters approved constitutional referendums on hunting and fishing rights, expanding crime victims\u2019 rights and lowering the current income tax rate cap from 10 percent to 7 percent.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger gave their own take on Tuesday\u2019s outcomes, saying that with continued GOP majorities, voters \u201cissued a clear mandate to continue Republican policies that are benefiting the workforce, improving schools, and delivering a pro-jobs agenda for families.\u201d\n\nPaul Seaton, 37, an unaffiliated voter from Raleigh, said he voted Tuesday for all Democrats to serve as a counterweight to Republicans in the federal and state government.\n\n\u201cI guess my only reason that I voted for all Democrats was just a balance, that there needed to be a little more balance to the extreme on the other side in some cases,\u201d said Seaton, a community college student.\n\nSeaton said Republicans also didn\u2019t get his votes because they put on the ballot a constitutional amendment that if approved would mandate voters having to show a photo identification to vote in person.\n\nAnne Jenkins, 61, a Raleigh nurse, said Tuesday she voted for Republicans as well as the amendments.\n\n\u201cI feel like the Republicans supported them and the Democrats didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t have any problem with the amendments,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI saw nothing wrong with any of them.\u201d\n\nIn other races, Anita Earls was elected to unseat Justice Barbara Jackson.

Heidi Heitkamp and her Republican challenger Kevin Cramer. (AP Photo/Bruce Crummy, File)\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 The biggest prize in North Dakota on Tuesday was the state\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, where Republican Kevin Cramer derailed the re-election bid of Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp to give the GOP wins in both congressional races.\n\nThe state ballot had plenty of other items worth voters\u2019 attention. Just two years after voters said yes to medicinal marijuana, they rejected the idea of extending that right to recreational pot. Here\u2019s a rundown on the election:\n\nMARIJUANA\n\nNorth Dakota voters aren\u2019t ready to take the next step with marijuana, soundly rejecting a proposal to legalize it broadly just two years after they OK\u2019d medicinal marijuana.\n\nLaw enforcement lined up solidly against legalization, arguing it would lead to more violent crime, driving accidents and workplace issues. The state also estimated it would be expensive, in part because of a provision in the proposed law that would wipe past marijuana-related convictions off people\u2019s records.\n\nNorth Dakota State University student Lindsey Pouliot, a senior majoring in English, said she favors decriminalizing marijuana, but didn\u2019t like the way the bill was written.\n\nBackers argued the legalization would free up law enforcement to tackle more serious crimes. They were counting on a shoe-leather campaign to build support, raising little money for their effort and getting only token help from national legalization groups.\n\nBecky Eckdahl, 53, a server at a Bismarck deli, voted in favor of the legalization.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been smoking it since I was 11 years old.

Although the initiative is sponsored by a bi-partisan group, it\u2019s something Democrats have fought unsuccessfully for years to do.\n\nBackers say the measure will add transparency and accountability to government. They raised more than $400,000 to push it, with much of the money coming from left-leaning out-of-state groups.\n\nOpponents argued the state has no ethics problem. In the Republican-led Legislature, leaders said the measure isn\u2019t needed because lawmakers already follow high standards of conduct. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the measure, saying it restricts political speech and advocacy.\n\nJolene Vidal, 43, Bismarck, who works for the state Department of Transportation, voted in favor of the measure because she wants to know where \u201ccampaign funding is coming from.\u201d\n\nNONCITIZEN VOTING\n\nVoters passed a proposal to amend the North Dakota Constitution to explicitly bar non-U.S. citizens from voting. The document already defines a voter as a U.S. citizen, but supporters argue the wording is ambiguous and needs to be clarified.\n\nGary Emineth, a former state Republican Party chairman, acknowledged that one goal of his proposal was to attract conservative voters to balance liberal voters that might be drawn to the marijuana issue.\n\nDarren Schaefer, 45, who works unloading trucks in Bismarck, voted in favor of the proposal, noting: \u201cI can\u2019t go up to Canada and vote in their elections.\u201d\n\nRebecca Grey Bull, 32, a child welfare worker in Bismarck, voted against it, saying: \u201cYou can be here legally, working, paying taxes, without renouncing your citizenship to another country.\u201d\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nRepublican state Sen. Kelly Armstrong claimed North Dakota\u2019s open U.S. House seat after raising more than twice as much money as Democrat Mac Schneider, a former two-term state senator. In a campaign between two attorneys, the two agreed on fewer federal regulations and more control to local governments and disagreed on tax cuts and trade policies. Rob Bentz, 51, of Bismarck, an insurance claims adjuster, voted for Armstrong \u201cmostly because I didn\u2019t know much about the other candidate.\u201d\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE\n\nRepublican Al Jaeger\u2019s nearly three-decade run as secretary of state has been extended for another term, despite being snubbed by his own party at the state convention. The endorsed candidate, businessman Will Gardner, attacked Jaeger as behind the times. Gardner wound up quitting the race when an old conviction for a peeping-tom incident resurfaced \u2014 clearing the way for Jaeger to rise again as an independent. Democrat Josh Boschee, a state representative from Fargo, was looking to become the first Democrat to hold a statewide office since Roger Johnson resigned as agriculture commissioner in 2009.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nRepublicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature, and that wasn\u2019t likely to change Tuesday. Democrats were hoping to knock off a whale, longtime House Majority Leader Al Carlson, in his south Fargo district. Carlson was third in the race for two spots as final votes were being tallied.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "ANNAPOLIS, Md.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Former Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis was elected Florida governor Tuesday, riding the support of President Donald Trump to narrow victory in the battleground state.\n\nDeSantis, 40, was considered an underdog before Trump tweeted his support for DeSantis in December, a month before he got into the race. Trump campaigned to help push DeSantis to a primary victory in August and came to Florida two more times to propel him past Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the final days of the election.\n\nThe win maintained the grip Republicans have had on the governor\u2019s office since Jeb Bush was sworn in in 1999, and DeSantis will have a chance to return the favor for Trump in 2020, when Florida figures to play a pivotal role in the presidential election.\n\nDuring his victory speech, DeSantis noted the national attention focused on the race, saying the \u201cpolitical and media classes\u201d had been eager to write his political obituary.\n\n\u201cOn Election Day, it\u2019s the voice of the people that roars,\u201d DeSantis told supporters at his election party and called it \u201cthe one day the elites don\u2019t call the shots ... and they don\u2019t set the agenda.\u201d\n\nHe also thanked Trump for standing by him \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t necessarily the smart thing.\u201d\n\nGillum, who was trying to become the state\u2019s first black governor, told a crowd gathered on the campus of Florida A&M University, \u201cI sincerely regret I couldn\u2019t bring it home for you.\u201d\n\nBut Gillum, who is just 39, vowed to remain involved in politics.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee you this: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight; we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nAfter his concession speech, supporters hugged one another. Many cried.\n\nGillum trailed by about 1 percentage point and fewer than 80,000 votes when he conceded.\n\n\u201cIn four years, he\u2019ll be able to run again,\u201d said Cindy Martin, 50, of Pensacola. \u201cMaybe 80,000 people will wake up and say, \u2018OK, we didn\u2019t vote the last time.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlorida A&M student Jalen McClees said that regardless of the result, Gillum made him proud.\n\n\u201cThe polls might say the opposite, but Andrew Gillum really won. He set the tone for us as African-Americans to do certain things,\u201d said McClees, 18. \u201cHe inspired a lot of people, and he made a movement.\u201d\n\nDeSantis stumbled out of the gate after winning the Aug. 28 primary, telling Fox News that voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum, who was Florida\u2019s first black nominee for governor. Despite implications that DeSantis was racially insensitive \u2014 an idea he angrily disputed during a debate \u2014 he was able to win the state that Trump carried in 2016.\n\nDeSantis ran as a political outsider despite serving three terms in Congress and running for U.S. Senate in 2016 before dropping out of the race when Republican Sen. Marco Rubio decided to run for re-election. The race was the third office he\u2019s sought in two years: his re-election, Senate and governor.\n\nDeSantis is a former Navy officer who graduated from Yale University, where he was the school\u2019s baseball captain, before getting his law degree at Harvard University.\n\nHe gained name recognition during the primary with more than 100 appearances on Fox News, usually to defend the president, but didn\u2019t lay out a clear agenda on what he\u2019d do if elected until after the primary.\n\nDeSantis ran a largely negative campaign, calling Gillum a socialist and saying he oversaw one of the most corrupt and crime-ridden cities in the state. Trump joined in, tweeting similar messages. The corruption allegation stemmed from a continuing FBI investigation into City Hall that Gillum has said he is not a target of and is cooperating with; the charge that Tallahassee had the state\u2019s highest crime rate was false.\n\nDeSantis also criticized Gillum for signing a pledge for the civil rights group Dream Defenders. The pledge was a promise not to take money from private prisons or the National Rifle Association, but the group is also critical of the justice system, saying police and prisons are racist.\n\nGillum portrayed DeSantis as racially divisive, repeatedly pointing out his \u201cmonkey this up\u201d comment and noting that a major DeSantis contributor called former President Barack Obama the N-word on Twitter and DeSantis refused to return his money. Gillum even spelled out the slur during a debate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist,\u201d Gillum said.\n\nDeSantis tried to connect with working-class families by pointing out in campaign ads that his first job paid $6 an hour and that he later traded in his work boots for military boots, highlighting his service in Iraq. DeSantis also spent time at the Navy base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAlthough DeSantis heavily emphasized his support of Trump before the primary, he scrubbed his campaign website of most Trump references and toned down his association with the president through most of the general election. That changed in the final week, when Trump helped drive out Republican supporters.\n\nDeSantis on Tuesday night pledged to keep Florida\u2019s taxes low and protect its environment by standing up for clean water, stopping red tide and restoring the Everglades.\n\n\u201cI believe you have to turn a page on a campaign,\u201d DeSantis said, shortly before red and white confetti exploded at his election party.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jennifer Kay in Miami Beach contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Democratic Attorney General Janet Mills won the race to succeed firebrand GOP Gov.

Mills spent roughly $3 million and outside groups spent at least $7.7 million to boost her, while total spending on Moody\u2019s race was $5.8 million, according to the latest state campaign finance reports.\n\nOther than that, though, it was an unusually quiet campaign season that resulted in few fireworks and in little polling.\n\nThe entire field of candidates agreed the firebrand LePage steadied finances in an aging, rural, economically stagnant state.\n\nThe new governor will face key decisions on the future of Medicaid expansion and marijuana retail sales, which have been delayed since voters approved them in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nMills, a long-time LePage foe, said she\u2019d reverse LePage-era cutbacks to public food assistance. She said she\u2019ll quickly implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion that the governor has held up in court over his fiscal concerns.\n\nMills has called for more grants and loans to spur broadband projects and encourage Mainers to return to Maine and live and work remotely.\n\nShe opposed a ballot referendum that failed Tuesday to raise taxes for a universal home care program, but said she\u2019ll work to address the issue as governor.\n\nThe attorney general has also lambasted the governor for pulling out of off-shore wind projects.\n\nMills fought off attacks from LePage, who has lodged unsuccessful and ongoing lawsuits claiming she abused her power while in office. The attorney general says she\u2019s fought for Maine people as an independent constitutional officer with the legal authority to determine what\u2019s in the state\u2019s public interest.\n\nThe voting came against a backdrop of Democratic anger over the election of President Donald Trump. Democrats had an advantage over Republicans in the number of absentee ballots.\n\nIn Portland, Republican voter Josh Rent called Trump \u201cnasty\u201d and said \u201clife doesn\u2019t have to be this nasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m generally a fairly reliable Republican.

The system lets voters rank candidates on the ballot with provisions for candidate eliminations and additional tabulations.\n\nThe system comes into play only if no one wins a majority of first-place votes, and that looked like it could be the case in the 2nd District race, in which independents Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar were also running.\n\nA ranked-choice retabulation would make the Poliquin-Golden showdown the first time such a system was used to send someone to Congress, though a slim chance remained that either could secure enough votes to avoid that scenario.\n\nAlso on the ranked-choice ballot were re-election bids by Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent Sen. Angus King. Both incumbents won those races.\n\nThe 2nd District campaign saw saturation television ad blitzes and Poliquin and Golden calling each other liars.\n\nGolden, a state representative and Marine Corps veteran, highlighted his military service while accusing Poliquin of trying to take away Mainers\u2019 access to affordable health care, pledging to create jobs and promising to protect gun rights.\n\nPoliquin, elected in 2014, touted the state\u2019s low unemployment rate and his efforts to cut taxes and press for fair trade deals.\n\nHe called Golden \u201ca young radical with a socialist agenda\u201d in an attempt to portray him as too far left for the district, which handed an electoral vote to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFinancial disclosure reports showed that Golden raised five times more money than Poliquin in the quarter that ended three weeks before the election. It was the most expensive congressional race in the history of the state.\n\nGolden said the fundraising was evidence that \u201cvoters are ready for real change, and I\u2019m humbled to have the support of so many Mainers.\u201d Poliquin, who maintained a cash-on-hand advantage, insisted that he was \u201cin a strong position in the final weeks of the campaign.\u201d\n\nNo challenger has defeated an incumbent in the district in more than 100 years.\n\nVoter Tory Dibbins, 53, a Democrat and physical therapist from Portland, said that if Democrats win big in Maine and beyond, then they have to show that they\u2019re willing to compromise.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk about \u2018let\u2019s end the divisiveness and be inclusive,\u2019 then you have to try to get people to be more bipartisan. You can\u2019t keep going in the path we\u2019re on,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the 1st District, Pingree beat back challenges by independent state Rep. Marty Grohman and Republican Mark Holbrook.\n\nGrohman, of Biddeford, left the Democratic party in 2017 after expressing frustration with partisanship in government. He had hoped to take advantage of the ranked-choice voting system to unseat Pingree, but conceded before 11 p.m.\n\nIn the Senate race, King survived challenges by opponents on his ideological right and left.\n\nKing, a popular former Maine governor, faced Republican state Sen. Eric Brakey and Democratic activist Zak Ringelstein. King caucuses with the Democrats and was first elected to the Senate in 2012.\n\nDuring the race, Ringelstein charged that the Democratic establishment abandoned him despite his winning the nomination. He conceded on election night.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Sharp contributed.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "New York Gov.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Democrat Andrew Cuomo easily defeated Republican challenger Marc Molinaro on Tuesday to win a third term and an opportunity to create a legacy as one of New York\u2019s longest-serving and most dominant governors.\n\nCuomo had sought to portray his opponent, the county executive of Dutchess County, as an extreme conservative and repeatedly mocked him as a \u201cTrump Mini-me.\u201d It was a successful tactic in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 2-1 and where the president remains largely unpopular.\n\nHe offered relatively few new proposals for a third term, instead touting his work to rebuild bridges and airports, lower taxes, increase the minimum wage, jumpstart the upstate economy and take on Albany\u2019s reputation for dysfunction. He also vowed to continue his work to push back against Washington.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s calculus is wrong,\u201d Cuomo told supporters at his election night party in Manhattan. \u201cToday\u2019s election made clear that New York is not buying what President Trump is selling. We know his type too well ... He uses fear and division to separate Americans. He preaches that diversity is the enemy ... But we don\u2019t fear diversity we celebrate diversity.\u201d\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has won a third term by beating Republican Marc Molinaro. (Nov. 6)\n\nCuomo is the 10th governor in New York to secure a third term, joining the likes of DeWitt Clinton, Al Smith, Nelson Rockefeller, George Pataki and his own father, the late Mario Cuomo. He had been considered a likely presidential contender in 2020 until he vowed this year to serve an entire four years if re-elected.\n\nThird terms proved difficult for former governors as staff turns over, critics grow bolder and voters become fatigued. New York City\u2019s antiquated subway system, in need of billions of dollars in upgrades, is likely to pose a significant challenge. Other issues looming for the governor include proposals to legalize recreational marijuana, continuing struggles for the upstate economy, a dearth of affordable housing and a divisive political climate that has exposed fault lines between liberals and moderates within his own party.\n\nCuomo significantly out-fundraised Molinaro and had more than 40 times his rival\u2019s financial resources in the homestretch of the campaign. Throughout the race he maintained a big lead in the polls, which found that Molinaro remained largely unknown to many voters.\n\nMolinaro, who has said he didn\u2019t vote for Trump, tried unsuccessfully to focus the race on Cuomo\u2019s eight years as governor, arguing the governor had failed to address rampant political corruption, New York City\u2019s aging subways or the upstate economy. He also vowed to work with both parties and eschew Cuomo\u2019s often hard-charging brand of governing. But his campaign struggled to broadcast his message in a contentious midterm election in which national politics dominated.\n\n\u201cI challenge Gov. Cuomo to work with all those New Yorkers who feel like they are on the outside looking in,\u201d Molinaro said in his speech concession speech.\n\nAs he did during his primary battle with former \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Cynthia Nixon, Cuomo campaigned as a pragmatic leader who values action over rhetoric. He touted his administration\u2019s work to overhaul airports and train stations in New York City, build a replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge and pass gun control, a higher minimum wage, same-sex marriage and income tax cuts.\n\nThree third-party candidates placed far behind Cuomo and Molinaro in Tuesday\u2019s voting: Green Party candidate Howie Hawkins, independent Stephanie Miner and Libertarian Larry Sharpe.\n\nCuomo\u2019s running mate, Kathy Hochul, will serve a second term as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. In New York candidates for the job of the state\u2019s No. 2 executive run alongside candidates for governor. Hochul is a former Congresswoman from Buffalo who replaced former Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy as Cuomo\u2019s running mate four years ago.\n\nIn legislative races, while votes are still counted in some races, Democrats claimed victory in the state Senate, saying they expect to have a strong majority of the chamber\u2019s 63 seats thanks to big wins on Long Island.\n\nRepublicans conceded the loss of what was their last grasp on power in state government. Democrats will now control the Assembly, the Senate and all four statewide offices.\n\n\u201cWhile tonight\u2019s results are disappointing, the Senate Republican Conference will continue to be a strong and important voice in Albany,\u201d Republican Senate Leader John Flanagan said. \u201cWhen we need to push back, we will push back. And where we can find common ground, we will always seek it.\u201d\n\nSen. Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Yonkers is now in line to lead the Senate when the Legislature reconvenes in January.\n\n\u201cWe will finally give New Yorkers the progressive leadership they have been demanding,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nIn other statewide races, Democrat Tish James was elected attorney general, soundly defeating Republican Keith Wofford. James, now the New York City public advocate, will be the first woman elected attorney general and the first African American to serve as the state\u2019s top law enforcement official. She\u2019ll replace Barbara Underwood, who as appointed to fill out the term of Democrat Eric Schneiderman. Schneiderman resigned earlier this year after he was accused of assaulting four women he dated.

John Faso, 66, in a politically diverse Hudson Valley district that went for Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nMax Rose, a 31-year-old Army veteran who was wounded in Afghanistan in 2013, beat New York City\u2019s only Republican congressman, Dan Donovan, 62, in a district centered on Staten Island that was solid Trump Country in 2016.\n\nTwo more Republicans in upstate districts were in tight races too close to call as of early Wednesday\n\nRepublican Chris Collins, who is running in western New York while under an insider trading indictment, declared victory with a lead of around 3,000 votes, while his Democratic challenger Nate McMurray initially conceded defeat and then took it back.\n\nAnd in the center of the state, Democrat Anthony Brindisi, a state assemblyman from Utica, held a lead of around 1,400 votes over Republican U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney, an early Trump supporter.\n\nEven with those races up in the air, New York\u2019s congressional delegation is set to move to the left, with at least 20 of its 27 seats held by Democrats.\n\nSpeaking to supporters in Kingston, Delgado told supporters his victory represents \u201ca new day built upon our shared values: equality, integrity, accountability, service, faith and a whole lotta love.\u201d\n\nDelgado, who earned a Harvard law degree before joining an international law firm, won as a black candidate in a district that is 90 percent white and evenly split among Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\n\u201cWay too much of our political climate is fueled by divisiveness, hatred and fear,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cIt only serves to distract us from our shared struggle and deep inequities that impact so many people here at home and across this country.\u201d\n\nFaso told supporters he was proud of his time in Congress and that despite the current climate of polarization and division, \u201cwe have to recognize that America is great because the American people are good.\u201d\n\nRose, running in a conservative-leaning district in New York City, zigged from other liberal candidates by not making the Trump leadership a central issue of his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe story of this country has always been that no matter our differences, no matter the challenges in our way, we do what others said was impossible and they said this was impossible,\u201d an enthusiastic Rose told supporters on Staten Island.\n\nDonovan was Staten Island\u2019s district attorney before being elected to Congress in 2015 in a special election to replace former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and served prison time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at this as a sad occasion,\u201d an emotional Donovan told his supporters. \u201cI look at this as the end of something that I have enjoyed so much.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat, state assembly majority leader Joseph Morelle, defeated Republican doctor Jim Maxwell to succeed the late U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter, keeping the seat in party hands. Slaughter, who died in March at age 88, had represented the Rochester area since 1987.\n\nRepublican incumbents John Katko and Elise Stefanik won contested re-election bids in upstate New York and Peter King fended off a challenge on Long Island to secure his 14th term.\n\nDemocrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, appeared set to become the youngest woman elected to Congress.\n\nBoth of the House races in New York considered too close to call by The Associated Press could come down to the counting of absentee and military ballots, which could take days.\n\nBrindisi declared victory in his race but Tenney refused to concede, telling supporters \u201cI\u2019m never a quitter.\u201d\n\nCollins, 68, appeared confident he would be declared the victor in his race.\n\n\u201cI am re-elected, that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he told reporters. McMurray, the town supervisor in Grand Island, New York, said he wanted a recount, something not specifically allowed for under New York law.\n\nCollins has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he leaked inside information about a biopharmaceutical company, allowing his son and others to avoid nearly $800,000 in stock losses.\n\nHe dropped out of the race after his indictment, but made a surprise return to the campaign trail a month later.

That would mean four more weeks of bitter, race-laden campaigning in a contest both have described as a \u201cbattle for the soul of our state.\u201d\n\nWith most of the rest of nation finishing its midterm campaigns, that would also focus a white-hot spotlight on a race that already has drawn massive investments of time, money and star power \u2014 from President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama to media icon Oprah Winfrey \u2014 with Abrams trying to make history as the first black woman to lead a U.S. state and Kemp trying to keep GOP-run Georgia from sliding into presidential battleground status ahead of 2020.\n\nKemp mentioned Trump\u2019s backing in his remarks early Wednesday, but said having his supporters in front of him was more important. \u201cOver the last 21 months, we\u2019ve chopped a lot of wood,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prospects of a razor-thin result and potential runoff come after weeks of wrangling over a Georgia election system that Kemp runs in his post as secretary of state, leaving open the possibility that Abrams supporters may not accept a loss. Kemp has steadfastly defended his job performance and refused calls to step aside \u2014 the latest coming in an Election Day lawsuit.\n\nThe Protect Democracy nonprofit announced that it filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to keep Kemp from being involved in counting votes, certifying results or any runoff or recount. The lawsuit says that Kemp presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \u201cviolates a basic notion of fairness.\u201d Secretary of State\u2019s office spokeswoman Candice Broce called the lawsuit a \u201ctwelfth-hour stunt.\u201d\n\nAbrams has called Kemp \u201can architect of suppression,\u201d and voting rights activists expressed concerns throughout Tuesday amid widespread reports of technical malfunctions and long lines at polling stations across the state. Some said they waited three hours to cast ballots, and watched dozens of voters abandon lines in frustration.\n\nThe elections chief wasn\u2019t immune to the difficulties: When Kemp went to cast his ballot, he had an issue with his voter card, but it was fixed quickly. He walked by reporters and said, \u201cTake Two.\u201d\n\nAbrams, a 44-year-old Atlanta attorney, former state minority leader and moonlighting romance novelist, already has made history as the first black woman to be nominated for governor by either major party. She\u2019d also be the first woman or nonwhite governor in Georgia history.\n\nKemp, a 54-year-old businessman and veteran secretary of state, is vying to maintain the GOP\u2019s hold in a state where Republicans have won every governor\u2019s race since 2002, though by increasingly narrow margins amid a growing and diversifying electorate.\n\nBallot access and election integrity flared up in the final weekend after a private citizen alerted the Georgia Democratic Party and a private attorney of vulnerability in the online voter database Kemp oversees. The attorney alerted the FBI and Kemp\u2019s office, and then Kemp announced, without providing any evidence, that he was launching an investigation into Georgia Democrats for \u201cpossible cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nKemp pushed back Monday against concerns that his call for an investigation is politically motivated. Abrams would have none of that, declaring Kemp a \u201cbald-faced liar\u201d intent on deflecting attention from security problems with his system.\n\nThe contest has been so intense that early voting approached the overall number of ballots cast in the governor\u2019s race four years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a time where the state of Georgia had more at stake than we do in this contest,\u201d Kemp told supporters at one campaign stop.\n\nIn the closing days, Kemp basked in Trump\u2019s glow, pulling out of a debate to attend a Sunday rally that drew thousands of boisterous Republicans to central Georgia to see Trump deplane from Air Force One.\n\nAbrams, meanwhile, argued that the contest should be about more than identity politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to vote for me because I\u2019m black,\u201d she told supporters in Savannah on Monday. \u201cAnd no one on the ballot needs a vote because we\u2019re women.

You need to vote for us because we\u2019re better.\u201d\n\nOn policy, the principal dividing lines are health care (Abrams wants to expand Medicaid insurance; Kemp wants to maintain Georgia\u2019s refusal); education (Kemp supports private school vouchers; Abrams opposes them); and criminal justice (Kemp is a law-and-order conservative; Abrams focuses on rehabilitating non-violent offenders and criticizes cash bail as unfair to poorer defendants).\n\nThe Georgia outcome also is among the most closely watched of any midterm contest because of Abrams\u2019 aggressive strategy to attract new voters \u2014 particularly nonwhites and younger Georgians \u2014 with an unabashedly liberal message, rather than focusing on older voters within the traditional midterm electorate.\n\nThe excruciatingly close outcome partly validates Abrams\u2019 strategy, but Kemp also expand the Republican advantage across rural and small-town Georgia.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kate Brumback and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow and Nadler on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/benjaminrnadler .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of 2018 file photos show Vermont Democratic gubernatorial challenger Christine Hallquist, left, and Republican Gov.

Pritzker, a billionaire who campaigned on moving Illinois past the political bitterness of the past four years, was elected governor Tuesday over Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, declaring, \u201cWe make no small plans.\u201d\n\nThe 53-year-old heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, who largely self-financed a campaign to his first elective office, rode to victory on the unpopularity of an incumbent whose legacy will be his role in a record-long budget standoff with a Democratic-controlled Legislature.\n\nGreeting supporters, Pritzker invoked the theme of a state rising above hardship and long odds, from rebuilding Chicago after the 1871 fire to catapulting home-state hero Barack Obama to become the first black president.\n\n\u201cThat is Illinois, full of light that comes from the people who endure and overcome struggle,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThat light brought triumph tonight.\u201d\n\nThe triumph appeared complete. Democrats won every statewide race and were on their way to maintaining healthy majorities in the state House of Representatives and Senate. It was an appropriate outcome, Pritzker said, for a party where immigrants and minorities and women help build a \u201cbigger table.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho we are is how we overcome our biggest challenges,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cWe ... recognize that there is grace and courage and pride in the struggle to rise. And ladies and gentlemen, rise we will. We make no small plans for the state of Illinois.\u201d\n\nRauner, a 61-year-old former private equity investor whose campaign bravado four years ago included the contention that a government shutdown might be in order to get Illinois back on track, became only the fourth Illinois governor since 1900 to win and serve just one four-year term before being ousted. Incumbents lost in 1912 and 1972, and a sitting governor was defeated in a 1976 primary.\n\nRauner conceded the race less than an hour after polls closed, sounding a clarion call of teamwork often missing from his heated tilts with Democrats in Springfield.\n\n\u201cNow we stand not as Republicans or Democrats, we stand as the people of Illinois,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cNow we move forward together to come up with solutions to create a better future. I encourage all of us to put aside partisan politics, rancor and hard feelings. Now is the time to move forward.\u201d\n\nIt was a battle of wealthy titans spending their way through one of the costliest races for governor in U.S. history. In a 2010 race in California, $280 million was spent. Combined, the candidates had raised $259 million by late last week.\n\nPritzker raised $176 million. The $171 million he chipped in from his own pocket is the most ever by a U.S. gubernatorial candidate. Rauner raised $79 million and Republican state Sen. Sam McCann, the Conservative Party candidate who billed himself as a conservative alternative to Rauner, brought in $4.8 million.\n\nA focal point of debate was taxes. Pritzker promises to overhaul the state\u2019s income-tax system to allow for a graduated tax rate that requires the wealthy to pay more. But he says that the specific rates would be a matter for negotiations with the Legislature.\n\nRauner, who promised to roll back the income tax increase that lawmakers adopted last year to fund the breakthrough budget, called Pritzker\u2019s plan a tax increase and asserted that Pritzker plans $11 billion in new spending.\n\nVoters appeared to be out of patience. Dan Bitner of Springfield cast his early ballot on Monday for Pritzker.\n\n\u201cAfter four years, Rauner hasn\u2019t gotten much of anything done,\u201d Bitner said.\n\nBoth promised increased education spending and proposed billions of dollars for infrastructure work.\n\nChris Hansen of Elburn, west of Chicago, said he voted for Rauner because he\u2019s worried Pritzker will raise taxes to fix Illinois\u2019 financial problems.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford any more taxes,\u201d said Hansen, who is parts manager at Heritage Harley Davidson in Lisle. \u201cI honestly believe Rauner is the one guy who wants to bring businesses and jobs to Illinois, and God knows we need it.\u201d\n\nScandal chased both contenders. Rauner has been on the defensive for months over his handling of a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease at the state-run veterans\u2019 home in Quincy, which has led to the deaths of 14 residents, including a dozen that first summer. Democratic Attorney General Lisa Madigan opened a criminal probe into the Republican\u2019s management of the crisis .\n\nLast month, the Cook County inspector general issued a report alleging that Pritzker and his family engaged in a \u201cscheme to defraud\u201d taxpayers by ripping toilets out of a Chicago mansion they were renovating to make it technically uninhabitable and save him $330,000 in property taxes. The report contends that those involved could have illegally misled authorities about the reason for removing the plumbing.

Pritzker defeated Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner , who conceded the race less than an hour after polls closed, while Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul topped Republican attorney Erika Harold for the open attorney general seat.\n\nRepublican Rep. Peter Roskam of Wheaton lost his bid for a seventh term to Democrat Sean Casten in a suburban Chicago district, while Democrat Lauren Underwood defeated GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren in another Chicago-area district the party had targeted in its effort to win House control.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Bost won re-election after a tougher-than-usual challenge from Democrat Brendan Kelly in a southern Illinois district, and central Illinois GOP Rep. Rodney Davis narrowly survived over Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan.\n\nOther Democrats who won re-election statewide: Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Secretary of State Jesse White and Treasurer Michael Frerichs.\n\nThe election saw higher-than-normal turnout, as Democrats pushed back against President Donald Trump and his policies and Republicans tried to hold on to some power in the left-leaning state.\n\nHere\u2019s a look:\n\nCONGRESS\n\nCasten, a scientist and businessman from Downers Grove, defeated Roskam, arguing that he was too conservative and too cozy with the president to continue representing a district that supported Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016. He criticized Roskam for his long record of opposing abortion and for helping draft the GOP tax plan, which Casten said hurts the district\u2019s residents. Roskam warned Casten wants to raise taxes and criticized the first-time candidate for name-calling and \u201cembracing the politics of ridicule,\u201d saying he uses the same kind of divisive talk \u2014 and tweets \u2014 that has turned the district\u2019s voters against Trump.\n\nUnderwood, a 32-year-old African-American nurse from Naperville, topped Hultgren to become the first woman and first minority to win the congressional seat once held by GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Underwood said she was motivated to run for her first political office after Hultgren supported health care legislation that would\u2019ve made coverage of pre-existing conditions more expensive. She also criticized him for not being accessible to district residents. Hultgren argued voters knew his track record of getting things done for the district, a rural and suburban area north and west of Chicago that backed Trump by 4 points over Clinton.\n\nBost, of Murphysboro, won re-election over Kelly, the St. Clair County state\u2019s attorney, in a southern Illinois district that Democrats also sought to flip . The once reliably Democratic district strongly backed Trump in 2016, and the president campaigned for Bost last month. Trump also was in the district in August, where he touted his trade policies at U.S. Steel in Granite City. Bost is a former state representative first elected to the House in 2014. Both he and Kelly are veterans \u2014 Kelly served in the Navy and Bost in the Marines. Green Party nominee Randy Auxier of Murphysboro also ran.\n\nIn central Illinois, Davis of Taylorville narrowly survived the challenge from Londrigan to win his fourth term. Londrigan, of Springfield, also made health care a central focus of her campaign, recounting her son\u2019s life-threatening illness and saying her family could have faced bankruptcy if they hadn\u2019t had health insurance. She criticized Davis for supporting legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, then joining a White House celebration of the House vote. Davis argued Londrigan is too extreme for the district.

Fire Department, Tuesday , Nov. 6, 2018, in Armada Twp, Mich. (Todd McInturf /Detroit News via AP)\n\nDETROIT (AP) \u2014 Michigan voters on Tuesday made their state the first in the Midwest to legalize recreational marijuana, passing a ballot measure that will allow people 21 or older to buy and use the drug and putting conservative neighboring states on notice.\n\nThree other states had marijuana-related measures on their ballots. North Dakota voters decided recreational pot wasn\u2019t for them , while voters in Missouri passed one of three unrelated measures to legalize medical marijuana. Utah voters also were considering whether to allow medical marijuana and to join the 31 other states that have already done so.\n\nIncluding Michigan, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. And Canada recently did so. But the passage in Michigan gives it a foothold in Middle America and could cause tension with neighboring Indiana and Ohio, which overwhelmingly rejected a 2015 legalization measure.\n\n\u201cTroopers that work along the state line are very cognizant of what\u2019s going on up north,\u201d said Indiana State Police Sgt. Ron Galaviz, a spokesman for the agency\u2019s Fort Wayne Post, which stretches north to the Michigan line.\n\nHe said if the referendum passed, \u201cwe know some of our citizens are going to go over to Michigan to partake.\u201d And those who return either under the influence or in possession of pot may learn the hard way that it remains illegal in Indiana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll enforce our laws as written,\u201d added Galaviz, a Michigan native. \u201cIf you\u2019re traveling to or through our state, we really don\u2019t want you bringing it down here.\u201d\n\nKristin Schrader, 51, a Democrat from Superior Township in Washtenaw County, said she voted to legalize marijuana because she doesn\u2019t want people leaving Michigan to get it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no attachment to marijuana myself, but I don\u2019t care to stand in the way of the train while it\u2019s coming down the tracks. I don\u2019t want people to go to other states to get it and spend their money somewhere else. If there\u2019s going to be an economic benefit to legalize marijuana, I want it to be in Michigan.\u201d\n\nThe Michigan law will take effect in about a month, as the election first has to be certified by the Board of State Canvassers. Ten days after that certification, people age 21 or older will be allowed to have, use and grow the drug, but the process of establishing regulations for its retail sale could take about two years.\n\nThe measure, which was endorsed by a national organization of black-owned businesses and a group of retired Michigan law enforcement officers, will create a state licensing system for marijuana businesses and allow cities and townships to restrict them. Supporters say it will raise roughly $130 million in additional tax revenue each year that will go toward road repairs, schools and local governments. They also say it will allow for greater regulation of pot usage and for the police to focus on more pressing problems.\n\nOpponents, including many law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, chambers of commerce and religious groups, said legalizing marijuana would lead to increased use by children, drug abuse and car crashes. They also said Michigan\u2019s proposal would be too permissive by allowing people to have up to 2.5 ounces (71 grams) of the drug on them and up to 10 ounces (284 grams) at home.\n\nUnlike Michigan\u2019s measure, North Dakota\u2019s rejected measure didn\u2019t receive any significant funding from outside groups. It came as the state was still setting up its medical marijuana system, which voters approved by a wide margin two years ago.\n\nIn Missouri, voters passed one of three unrelated medical marijuana measures that made it onto the ballot. The constitutional amendment will allow patients with cancer, HIV, epilepsy and other conditions access to the drug.\n\nVoters in Utah also were considering whether to legalize medical marijuana. The Mormon church, which carries outsized influence in the conservative state, had opposed the proposal but recently joined lawmakers and advocates to back a deal that would legalize it in the conservative state. Utah\u2019s governor said he would call lawmakers into a special session after the midterm election to pass the deal into law, even if Tuesday\u2019s initiative failed.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Brady McCombs in Salt Lake City, Jim Salter in St. Louis and John Flesher in Traverse City, Michigan, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Karoub on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jeffkaroub and find more of his work at https://apnews.com/search/jeff%20karoub .

Voters have a number of races to consider, including judiciary and federal offices and some local issues. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nThere were first-time voters and straight-ticket voters and some who, this go-around, switched sides. They went to the polls considering the caravan of migrants trudging across Mexico, their health insurance and their paychecks, an impotent Congress, and the nation\u2019s poisonous political culture that has divided even families and friends along party lines.\n\nMore than anything on this Election Day in America, in a midterm contest like no other before it, voters cast their ballots with one man in mind: President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump is terrifying and we need to make a change, so I\u2019ve been encouraging my friends and family to vote,\u201d said Samantha Bohr, 26, casting her ballot in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey.\n\nNine hundred miles away, in Nashville, Tennessee, 50-year-old Robert DuBois arrived at his polling place wearing one of Trump\u2019s signature red Make America Great Again caps. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s a line out that door,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either don\u2019t want Trump\u2019s agenda or you do want Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nThey joined millions of Americans who turned out in droves Tuesday \u2014 some lining up before the sun rose, some standing for hours or braving pouring rain or snow \u2014 to vote in an election that will determine control of Congress and render a verdict on Trump\u2019s first two years in office. The outcome could redefine the nation\u2019s political landscape for months and years to come.\n\nDemocrats need to gain 23 seats to take control of the House of Representatives, and hope to ride the wave of liberal fury that organized after Trump\u2019s surprising victory in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy loathing for him knows no bounds,\u201d said Kathleen Ross, 69, a retired professor voting in Olympia, Washington, who described herself as a lifelong progressive. She said she was confident the country eventually would reject Trumpism and the divisive governing it represents. \u201cI tend to think the arc of the universe bends toward justice, so I don\u2019t become discouraged.\u201d\n\nTrump has sought to counter some of that rage by stoking anger, fear and enthusiasm in his base. In recent weeks, he\u2019s put the spotlight on a caravan of Central American migrants that he calls \u201can invasion\u201d of criminals and terrorists. He ran an advertisement about immigration so racially incendiary that all three major cable news networks, including Fox News, either refused to air it or eventually decided to stop showing it.\n\nAmong some Republican voters, that message resonated.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is pretty scary to me, at the border, with all those people coming, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m hardhearted or anything,\u201d said Patricia Maynard, 63, a retired teacher in Skowhegan, Maine.\n\nWhen she voted for Trump in 2016, the blue-collar economy was her primary concern. Now, she said, immigration tops the list. She laments that Congress has so far failed to pass legislation to build the wall Trump promised along the border. So she voted for Republicans Tuesday, with hopes they would retain control and push Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn Jefferson City, Missouri, Linda Rice believes there are criminals in the caravan. Both Rice and her husband, Richard, praised Trump\u2019s time in office, particularly his focus on the economy and his work to secure the border. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that my tax money should be taken away from me and given to a person who came across the border illegally,\u201d Richard Rice said. \u201cGet in line. Do it correctly.\u201d\n\nJust ahead of Election Day, Trump sent military troops to the border\u2014 a move critics called unnecessary and a political stunt, given the migrants, many of them women and children fleeing poverty and violence, are traveling mostly on foot and remain hundreds of miles away.\n\nFor those who oppose Trump, the caravan controversy singularly represents what they find unconscionable about his presidency.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always used the scare tactics and found an enemy to band against,\u201d said 24-year-old Enrique Padilla of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Padilla considers his own family an example of the American dream. His father migrated from Mexico as a laborer at 18, raised his family, and now Padilla has a college degree. The president\u2019s persistent demonization of immigrants galvanized him and many of his peers to vote against Republicans, Padilla said.\n\nIn Louisville, Kentucky, Mary Cross, a 64-year-old African-American voter, said she believes Trump uses issues like immigration to distract from more important topics. \u201cIt\u2019s manufactured fear. It\u2019s uncivilized. It\u2019s just a bunch of mayhem for nothing. There\u2019s no substance to this,\u201d said Cross, who thinks the country should be talking about the Republican-led campaign to overturn the Affordable Health Care Act that protects people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nCross, and others, expressed a heightened sense of unease and sadness about the state of America\u2019s political climate. The election comes just days after a series of hate crimes and political attacks. Where Cross lives, a gunman tried to get into a majority-black church but found the doors locked and went instead to a nearby grocery store, where he gunned down two African-American shoppers in what police are calling a hate crime.\n\n\u201cOur president, with his rhetoric and vulgar language, continues to throw fuel on the fire. Racism has always been around, but since he\u2019s been in office, people feel free to express it and feel good about it,\u201d said the Rev. Kevin Nelson, the pastor of the Louisville church the gunman targeted. The congregation has received cards and calls from all over the country, from Christians and Jews and Muslims and atheists \u2014 and also a white man in Texas who said he was sorry about what happened and promised to cast his ballot against the rhetoric he believed to be igniting hate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always hoping that somehow, some way, someday, it\u2019s going to change,\u201d Nelson said before he voted Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that it could be this time.\u201d\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center released a survey on the eve of the election that showed a quarter of Americans have lost friends over political disagreements and are less likely to attend social functions because of politics.\n\nOdell White, a 60-year-old African-American conservative, described the country\u2019s tribalism as veering toward civil war.\n\n\u201cWe are dangerously close to that type of mentality \u2014 brothers fighting brothers. That\u2019s how bad it is,\u201d said White, who supports Trump and voted for Republicans. Friends have turned away because of his political leanings. White said he doesn\u2019t like the president\u2019s aggressive rhetoric, but he\u2019s willing to overlook it because of the booming economy and the two conservatives Trump installed on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Trumpism has proved too much for some.\n\nIn Portland, Maine, Josh Rent, 43, a small business owner and registered Republican, said he voted mostly for Democrats all the way down the ballot for the first time to protest Trump, who he believes is unnecessarily dividing Americans for his own gain. \u201cHe\u2019s just nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t have to be this nasty, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats do win big, Tory Dibbins, a 53-year-old physical therapist from Portland, Maine, and herself a Democrat, has a warning.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk about \u2018let\u2019s end the divisiveness and be inclusive\u2019 then you have to try to get people to be more bipartisan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to win people back to the center.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAlso contributing were AP reporters Adam Geller in New Jersey, Sheila Burke in Tennessee, Martha Irvine in Illinois, Steve Megargee in Tennessee, Jocelyn Noveck in New York, Rachel La Corte in Washington, Margery Beck in Nebraska, Kantele Franko in Ohio, Summer Ballentine and Jim Salter in Missouri, Matt Volz in Montana, Hannah Grabenstein in Arkansas and Chris Chester in Maine.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 A new way of voting makes its national debut in U.S. Senate and House races on Election Day in Maine.

Thousands of Central American migrants have arrived at the stadium, still hundreds of miles away from their goal of reaching the U.S. a day before midterm elections in which they unwittingly became a central issue. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Humanitarian aid converged around a stadium in Mexico City where thousands of Central American migrants winding their way toward the United States were resting Tuesday after an arduous trek that has taken them through three countries in three weeks.\n\nMexico City Mayor Jose Ramon Amieva said 4,500 migrants have arrived at the Jesus Martinez stadium since Sunday, and city officials are bracing to attend as many as 5,500 at the site by Wednesday. Hundreds of city employees and even more volunteers were on hand to sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics.\n\nMigrants searched through piles of donated clothes, grabbed boxes of milk for children and lined up to make quick calls home at a stand set up by the Red Cross as U.S. voters went to the polls for midterm elections in which President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue.\n\nEmployees from the capital\u2019s human rights commission registered new arrivals with biographical data\u2014 such as age and country of origin\u2014 and placed yellow bracelets on wrists to keep count.\n\nRina Valenzuela wore one of the yellow bracelets as she sat attentively listening to aid workers from the nonprofit Institute for Women in Migration explain the difficulties of applying for and securing asylum in the U.S. Valenzuela, who is from El Salvador, decided she\u2019s better off applying for refuge in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhy go fight there, with as much effort and as much suffering as we have gone through, just for them to turn me back? Well, no,\u201d she said.\n\nThe aid workers explained that the asylum process in the U.S. could take years, with no guarantee of approval.\n\nHonduran Antonio Perez listened to the warnings but said he remains determined to continue north.\n\n\u201cThis is interesting but tough news,\u201d he reflected. \u201cBut neither this nor Donald Trump is going to stop me.\u201d\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium was more institutional and organized than what migrants encountered on the road, where townspeople pushed bags of drinking water, tacos and fruit into their hands as they passed through tiny hamlets in southern Mexico.\n\nBut there were signs Tuesday that the stadium was already nearing its capacity to hold 6,000 people.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, 41, said there was no space in the stadium when she and her 8-year-old daughter arrived during the night, so the two from Honduras slept on the grass outside. Migrants pitched tents in the parking lot and constructed makeshift shelters from plywood covered with blankets and tarps. Forty portable toilets were scattered across the grass.\n\nThe stadium\u2019s enclosed space and government intervention makes it difficult for aid workers to reach the migrants, said Nancy Rojas, an Oxfam charity worker who has accompanied the migrants for weeks.\n\nFour big tents have been set up for women and children to sleep under with thin mattresses and blankets, while men were relegated Monday night to concrete bleachers. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) during the night in a city some 7,300 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level and still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\nSeveral smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south. Mexico City Mayor Amieva said the city needs to \u201creinforce\u201d to meet the needs of the migrants, especially vulnerable children and pregnant women.\n\nMexico City\u2019s central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd, plus 600 bottles of water. The human rights commission said it planned to set up more tents and eating areas.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea and other maladies. City officials administered vaccines for tetanus and influenza.\n\nTrump has seized on the caravan as an election issue and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, vowed to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support relatives back home.\n\nWalkiria Viamney, 19, said she and her husband have relatives in Tijuana and California who have promised to help them cross into the United States. The pair from Honduras hoped to soon advance northward, although they relished the opportunity to rest and wash clothes in the stadium.\n\nNot far from Viamney, men played cards and chess while children ran between inflatable games. Others gave themselves sponge baths or lounged in the shade of improvised tents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here for three days already, and I\u2019m already rested. I want to move on,\u201d said Francisco Redondo, 40, a Honduran who said he worked construction for 12 years in California.\n\nOrganizers are urging members of the caravan already in Mexico City to await the arrival of stragglers and perhaps even the other caravans further back. The idea is to find strength in numbers. The outpouring of support for the caravan that first set out from Honduras on Oct. 13 has inspired thousands of others to march north from Central America.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas. A caravan last spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nEdgar Corzo, an official with the National Human Rights Commission, said that based on experiences with previous migrant caravans, the group probably will begin to break up now that it is in the capital.\n\n\u201cEach one goes to the place that he considers best,\u201d mainly wherever is closest to where they have relatives or friends already in the United States, he said.", "Today in History\n\nToday is Tuesday, Nov. 6, the 310th day of 2018.

(Rodney White/Des Moines Register via AP, Pool, File)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Republican Kim Reynolds won her first full term as governor Tuesday, beating Democratic businessman Fred Hubbell to become the first woman elected governor in Iowa.\n\nReynolds became governor in 2017 after Terry Branstad was named ambassador to China. She had previously won two terms as lieutenant governor.\n\nIn her campaign, Reynolds pointed to Iowa\u2019s low unemployment rate and her support of legislation that lowered taxes, expanded mental health options and sought to outlaw most abortions.\n\nShe overcame a challenge from Hubbell, who argued Reynolds had poorly managed the state and had wasted taxpayer money on corporate tax breaks. Hubbell also criticized Reynolds for her support for privatizing Iowa\u2019s Medicaid system for poor and disabled people.\n\nAlthough the $18 million raised by Hubbell was a record for an Iowa gubernatorial candidate, that figure includes $6.4 million of his own money. Reynolds raised nearly $11 million.\n\nReynolds portrayed herself as a fifth-generation Iowa resident from a working-class family who, as a teenager, worked as a waitress at a department store restaurant and as a grocery store checker.\n\nReynolds, 59, was a four-term county treasurer and served a partial Iowa Senate term before joining Branstad\u2019s ticket in 2010. She served as his lieutenant governor from 2011 until May 2017, when she became governor.\n\nShe was elected on a day Iowans also sent two women to the U.S. House for the first time, handing defeat to two incumbent Republican men.\n\nIowa election officials said the state broke the record for mid-term election absentee ballots with more than 538,000 votes cast before Tuesday.

Utah shot 8-of-31 from 3-point range, but that was skewed by the Jazz making three 3s in garbage time.\n\nDespite a 21-5 deficit in free throw attempts in the first half, the Raptors made eight 3s and shot 63 percent from the field to lead 65-54 at the break.\n\nHOME COOKING?\n\nThe Jazz haven\u2019t started 0-4 at home since their inaugural season in New Orleans in 1974-75.

Rod Blum, R-Iowa, in Iowa's 1st Congressional District race, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Dubuque, Iowa. (Eileen Meslar/Telegraph Herald via AP)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Democrats in Iowa captured a majority of the state\u2019s seats in the U.S. House in Tuesday\u2019s midterms for the first time in years, but Republicans kept control of the state\u2019s executive branch.\n\nRepublican Gov. Kim Reynolds defeated Democrat Fred Hubbell to earn a full four-year term, and her party was poised to keep control of the state Legislature.\n\nGOVERNOR\n\nReynolds, the longtime lieutenant governor who was elevated to governor last year, won a four-year term as Iowa\u2019s first elected female chief executive. Reynolds had told voters that Iowa is moving in the right direction and frequently touted its \u201cNo. 1 state\u201d ranking by U.S. News and World Report.\n\nHubbell, a businessman and philanthropist from one of the state\u2019s most prominent families, sunk $6.4 million of his own money into his first run for public office. Hubbell had argued that the state went too far to the right and was underfunding public education and mismanaging programs like Medicaid.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL RACES\n\nIowa voters gave Democrats control of three of four of the state\u2019s seats in the U.S. House.\n\nIn northeastern Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District, Democratic state Rep. Abby Finkenauer ousted Rep. Rod Blum, a Republican. Finkenauer became the second youngest woman elected to Congress at age 29.\n\nBlum, a businessman and strong supporter of President Donald Trump, was hampered by a House ethics investigation into one of his companies to win a third term.\n\nIn Iowa\u2019s 3rd District, GOP Rep. David Young lost his bid for a third term despite his endorsement from Trump. The former aide to Sen. Chuck Grassley was defeated by Democrat Cindy Axne, a former state government official who had run on health care and agricultural issues.\n\nRep. Steve King narrowly won his bid for a ninth term representing conservative northwestern Iowa\u2019s 4th District, despite his reputation for making inflammatory remarks about race and supporting far-right political movements. Democrat J.D. Scholten ran an aggressive campaign but fell short of an upset that would have reverberated nationally.\n\nSTATEWIDE RACES\n\nVoters delivered mixed results in three other statewide races.\n\nDemocrat Deidre DeJear, 32, a former campaign organizer for President Barack Obama, lost her bid to become the first black woman elected to statewide office in Iowa. She was defeated by Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate, who championed the state\u2019s new voter identification law. DeJear had argued the law disenfranchises many voters, while Pate said that it ensures election integrity.\n\nIn the auditor\u2019s race, Democrat Rob Sand, a 36-year-old former prosecutor, defeated the incumbent Mary Mosiman, whom he argued had gone too easy on government corruption. The win cements Sand\u2019s status as a rising star in the party. Mosiman had argued that Sand isn\u2019t qualified for the position because he\u2019s not a certified public accountant.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Mike Naig prevailed in his bid for a full four-year term after his appointment in March. Naig, a Republican who had received backing from the Iowa Farm Bureau, defeated Democrat Tim Gannon, a farmer and former USDA official.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nRepublicans were trying to hang on to the large majorities they won in the 2016 election.\n\nWith control of both chambers, GOP lawmakers approved laws that eliminated collective bargaining rights for most public workers, expanded gun rights, cut taxes and enacted the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion ban.\n\nThe Legislature also passed a requirement that voters show identification at the polls, but those without one Tuesday could cast ballots by signing an oath attesting to their identities.\n\nDemocrats were trying to reduce the Republican majority, with the GOP holding 29 of 50 seats in the Senate and 58 of 100 House seats.\n\nTURNOUT\n\nTurnout was expected to potentially set a record for a midterm election.\n\nNearly 1.3 million ballots were counted as of late Tuesday, which exceeded the 1.14 million cast in 2014, and more were still coming in.\n\nMore than 529,000 of them were early voters who had turned in absentee ballots or voted in-person at auditor\u2019s offices or satellite locations before Tuesday, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s Office.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "CARLSBAD, Calif.

Republican Rep. Mike Bishop in the 8th District conceded defeat to former CIA analyst Elissa Slotkin, who pounded the incumbent with TV ads highlighting his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

They\u2019re poised to make gains, though they conceded that Republicans will retain control of both houses. Republicans have benefited for years because they controlled how districts were drawn after the 2010 census. The GOP held majorities of 63-46 in the House and 27-10 in the Senate before Tuesday, with one Democratic-leaning seat in each chamber vacant.\n\n___\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nDemocrat Dana Nessel is best known for representing two women who successfully challenged Michigan\u2019s ban on gay marriage. She has promised to shake up the attorney general\u2019s office, especially how it handles Flint water cases. She says the special prosecutor is overpaid and that criminal charges were influenced by politics. The Republican candidate, Tom Leonard, wants to put more emphasis on how local courts and law enforcers handle people who are mentally ill.

The state legalized medical marijuana 10 years ago. The nonpartisan Citizens Research Council of Michigan says police and jails might save money by not arresting people, but it also notes there will be a cost for abuse and other public health issues. Marijuana sales will carry a special 10 percent tax, with 70 percent of revenue going to schools and roads, on top of Michigan\u2019s 6 percent sales tax.\n\n___\n\nVOTING PROPOSAL\n\nProposal 3, which allows people to register to vote as late as Election Day and immediately get a ballot, easily passed. Absentee ballots will be granted without voters having to provide a reason they\u2019re requesting one. Straight-party voting \u2014 a single mark for candidates of one party \u2014 will also be revived. Supporters, including the American Civil Liberties Union, civil rights groups and unions, say it will make voting more accessible.

The job now will go to a 13-member commission picked at random after the next census. It\u2019s an extraordinary change now enshrined in the state constitution that snatches power from lawmakers and the governor. Republicans drew the maps after the 2010 census because they were in control of the state Capitol and have remained so, at least partly because of how those seats were drawn. Critics of the proposal say a commission won\u2019t be accountable to the public.

(AP) \u2014 Democrat Sharice Davids unseated Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder in Tuesday\u2019s election to become the nation\u2019s first LGBT and Native American woman in Congress.\n\nFour-term incumbent Yoder was vulnerable in the Kansas City-area 3rd District because of tepid support for President Donald Trump, who narrowly lost it in 2016. The district includes a mix of fast-growing bedroom communities, established suburbs and poorer city neighborhoods.\n\nTrump had endorsed Yoder, the chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee on immigration and homeland security issues.\n\nDavids excited Democratic activists and donors nationwide with her unprecedented profile. A member of the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk Nation, she was a White House fellow during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration and received a law degree from Cornell University. She\u2019s also fought mixed martial arts bouts.\n\nDavids told jubilant supporters that she was honored to be chosen to represent people who have sometimes not had their voices heard by the federal government.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, this campaign has been built on bringing new leaders to the table, and new voices to the table. And I am so honored to stand here today knowing I will fill that role for our community in January,\u201d Davids said.\n\nShe said her life story of being raised by a single mother, being a first-generation college student and working while she was in school is not that unusual.\n\n\u201cWhat is uncommon, until now, is to have those voices and those stories and those experiences truly reflected in our federal government, in Congress and the Senate,\u201d she said.\n\nHer campaign upended conventional wisdom that Democrats had the best shot at winning the GOP-leaning district with a centrist candidate such as Dennis Moore, the Democrat who held the seat for 12 years before Yoder won it easily in the anti-Obama wave of 2010.\n\n\u201cRemember serving in Congress the seat doesn\u2019t belong to one person, it belongs to the people of Kansas ... and the people have chosen and I want to congratulate my opponent Ms. Davids,\u201d Yoder said.\n\nYoder did much of what would be expected to keep his job, raising more than $3.8 million for his re-election. He touted the endorsement of Kansas political icon and 1996 Republican presidential nominee Sen. Bob Dole and picked up the backing of local mayors, law enforcement officials and groups such as the Kansas Farm Bureau.\n\nBut he was one of 25 incumbent Republicans running in a district Trump had lost.\n\nYoder\u2019s subcommittee chairmanship put him at the center of the debate over immigration. He picked up Trump\u2019s endorsement after Republicans proposed setting aside $5 billion that could be used to help build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nHe drew criticism from the left, which argued that he didn\u2019t do enough to help stop the separation of immigrant children from their parents when families attempted to enter the U.S. illegally. And he was attacked on the right when appropriations legislation allowed more legal immigration.\n\nDavids also struggled with the issue. When a liberal podcast host in July asked her whether she would support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she answered, \u201cI do. I would, I would.\u201d She recanted after winning a six-person primary race in August, declaring flatly in a television ad, \u201cI don\u2019t support abolishing ICE.\u201d\n\nBut her stumble was a mere blip. She raised $4.3 million \u2014 most of it after mid-July, including more than $1.1 million after September \u2014 and emphasized the details of her biography.\n\nDavids said Yoder had called to congratulate her and she thanked him for his years of service \u201cbecause despite our policy differences it takes a lot to run for Congress, to put yourself out there and it takes a lot of work and a lot of voices, whether we agree with them or not.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "", "", "Congressional candidate Steve Watkins takes the stage at an election night rally in Topeka, Kan., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

He\u2019s run the famed Iditarod dog sled race twice in Alaska and attempted to scale Mount Everest in 2015.\n\nBut he was caught exaggerating his role in a small business in the Middle East and removed a quote about his \u201cheroic leadership\u201d during the Mount Everest expedition attributed to his guide, after the guide told The Associated Press that he\u2019d never said it.\n\nEven before, Republican critics noted that the Topeka native had spent most of his adult life living outside Kansas and had not voted in the state until a municipal election in November 2017, after he\u2019d decided to run for Congress.\n\nAlso, Watkins\u2019 father, a Topeka physician, was heavily involved in the race as the almost-exclusive source of funding for a political action committee, Kansans Can Do Anything, boosting his son\u2019s candidacy. The elder Watkins contributed more than $765,000 to the PAC.\n\nOne former GOP foe, ex-state Sen. Steve Fitzgerald, called him \u201ca charlatan, a fraud and an opportunist,\u201d days before the August primary, though he later wouldn\u2019t criticize Watkins.

Though she consistently led the lesser-known James in polls since his primary victory and kept her message positive in TV ads, he looked to be a tougher challenger than her past opponents.\n\nTrailing by about 6 percentage points with more than half the votes counted, James called Stabneow to concede.\n\nMichigan Republicans have held a Senate seat just once in 40 years, the one Stabenow took in 2000.\n\nAs the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, she emphasized her ability to shape farming legislation. She also said she stood up to Trump\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to slash federal spending on the Great Lakes and sponsored a new law outlawing so-called gag rules that prohibited pharmacists from telling consumers when they could save on prescriptions by paying cash instead of using insurance.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very rural-friendly and that\u2019s important to businesses up here, especially cherries and wine,\u201d said 26-year-old Tyler Bevier of Traverse City, who works in a local government planning office and said he voted for Stabenow because of her experience. \u201cShe seems to be a positive voice for the farming community and is a good influential leader.\u201d\n\nJames, of Farmington Hills, flew helicopters in the Iraq War before returning to Michigan to help run his family\u2019s automotive logistics company in Detroit.

(Thad Allton /The Topeka Capital-Journal via AP)\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Laura Kelly won the Kansas governor\u2019s race Tuesday, prevailing over Republican Kris Kobach after promising to slam the door on conservative budget and tax-cutting policies that were followed by persistent budget problems.\n\nKelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, defeated Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, even though Kobach is President Donald Trump\u2019s closest ally in a state that Trump won handily in 2016. Independent candidate and Kansas City-area businessman Greg Orman trailed far behind.\n\nThe Democratic governor-elect made former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and his ill-fated 2012-13 experiment in slashing state income taxes \u2014 not Trump \u2014 a key issue in her red state. Budget woes made Kansas a cautionary example of how not to do trickle-down economics, and Kelly was visible in the successful and bipartisan effort in 2017 that reversed most of the cuts.\n\n\u201cThey spoke with a single thunderous voice,\u201d Kelly said of voters in her victory speech at a Topeka hotel. \u201cKansans voted for change, a change not only in the direction of our state but a change in the tone in our state.\u201d\n\nKelly wooed GOP moderates and independent voters upset with Brownback\u2019s tax-cutting experiment. She said her victory signaled greater bipartisanship.\n\nKelly\u2019s message resonated with even Republican voters such as Kimberli Evans, a 43-year-old federal employee from Topeka, who voted for the Democratic nominee. She said fair funding for public schools is one of her big concerns.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Brownback experiment did not work and needs to be reversed,\u201d Evans said after casting her ballot.\n\nKobach had criticized the $600 million-a-year income tax increase and campaigned on shrinking government so that the state could resume cutting taxes.\n\nKobach brought some celebrity to the race, having built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration policies and strict voter identification laws. He has advised Trump and served as vice chairman of Trump\u2019s since-disbanded commission on voter fraud.\n\nHe narrowly ousted Gov. Jeff Colyer in the GOP primary in August after Trump defied a split among his advisers and tweeted an endorsement of Kobach. Trump carried the state easily in the 2016 presidential race and had a rally to help Kobach\u2019s campaign in October. Donald Trump Jr. had two fundraising events for him.\n\n\u201cWe fought the good fight,\u201d Kobach told his supporters at another Topeka hotel. \u201cThis one just wasn\u2019t God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between Kobach and Kelly was stark because Kelly not only portrayed Kansas as in financial recovery but also had a list of places where she\u2019d like to bolster spending, including higher education, early childhood education and mental health services.\n\nKansas is considered a deep red state with party registration 44 percent Republican and 25 percent Democratic. But its dominant Republican Party sometimes splits between moderates and conservatives, leaving an opening for a Democrat to peel off disaffected GOP voters.

(AP Photo/Al Goldis)\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Gretchen Whitmer was elected Michigan\u2019s next governor on Tuesday, retaking the office for her party after eight years of Republican control of a state that Donald Trump won by the slimmest of margins.\n\nWhitmer, a former legislative leader who led a female-dominated statewide ticket, defeated GOP state Attorney General Bill Schuette. Her running mate, Garlin Gilchrist II, will be Michigan\u2019s first black lieutenant governor.\n\n\u201cAt a time where we see too many people who want to divide us through building walls, I think we in Michigan need to get back to building bridges,\u201d Whitmer told supporters in Detroit. The people, she said, chose \u201chope and inclusion\u201d along with \u201crespect and collaboration\u201d over divisive politics.\n\nWhile campaigning, Whitmer cast herself as a bipartisan problem-solver who joined with term-limited Gov. Rick Snyder to expand Medicaid to more than 600,000 adults. She pushed to \u201cfix the damn roads,\u201d lagging schools and drinking water infrastructure, which was exposed by Flint\u2019s lead-tainted water.\n\nHer win further cemented a trend in Michigan gubernatorial races. The last time the state consecutively elected governors from the same party was the 1960s, and the party opposite the president has now won 10 of the last 11 elections.\n\nWhitmer\u2019s victory was somewhat tempered because Democrats fell short of winning at least partial control of the Republican-led Legislature, a crucial step for her to be able to enact a governing agenda.\n\nThe 47-year-old Whitmer, of East Lansing, was a state lawmaker for 14 years \u2014 always in the minority \u2014 and later served as Ingham County\u2019s interim prosecutor. As the top Democrat in the Senate, she spoke forcefully against GOP-backed laws that slashed business taxes while raising them on individuals, made union fees optional, and required residents or businesses wanting health insurance coverage for elective abortions to buy extra coverage. She disclosed during a debate on the abortion bill that she had been raped in college.\n\n\u201cI thought that was so brave. I think she\u2019s got the moxie and the courage to stand up for her beliefs,\u201d said Kristin Schrader, a 51-year-old marketing and communications officer for a Girl Scouts organization who voted for Whitmer. The resident of Superior Township near Ann Arbor called Whitmer pragmatic and credited her for working across the aisle and staying positive despite being in the minority party for so long. Others who voted for Whitmer cited her pledge to press for a multibillion-dollar plan to improve deteriorating roads.\n\nSchuette \u2014 a former congressman, state senator, state Cabinet official and state appellate judge from Midland \u2014 called Whitmer to concede. She led by 9 percentage points with more than third-fourths of precincts reporting early Wednesday. Republicans kept control of the state Senate despite losing seats, while the battle for the Michigan House majority remained unsettled.\n\nSchuette had called for an income tax cut and lower auto insurance rates while urging voters to stick with a Republican to succeed the more moderate Snyder, who has been at the helm during a sustained economic recovery. Schuette warned against going \u201cbackward\u201d and likened Whitmer to Democratic former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who was in charge during Michigan\u2019s economic downturn and pushed through a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts to resolve major budget deficits.\n\nPeople who voted for Schuette said they favored his opposition to tax increases, his pro-business record and his work as attorney general, specifically how he investigated Flint\u2019s water crisis and the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal at Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by how he handled them,\u201d said Jeff Burden, a 38-year-old writer from Westland.\n\nWhitmer attacked Schuette\u2019s time as attorney general by criticizing his opposition to the federal health care law, his legal defense of the state\u2019s gay marriage ban and other moves.\n\nSchuette secured Trump\u2019s backing in the primary but mentioned the president less afterward and later softened his position on the Medicaid expansion. He highlighted his office\u2019s prosecution of Nassar and accused Whitmer of failing to charge Nassar with assaults before Michigan State University police brought the case to him.\n\nSchuette also brought charges against current and former state and city officials for the public health emergency in Flint, where the drinking water was tainted with lead and people died in a Legionnaires\u2019 disease outbreak. Whitmer alleged that Schuette ignored complaints about the water and waited to investigate until the crisis attracted widespread media attention.\n\nThe Flint charges \u2014 which include manslaughter counts against two high-ranking members of the Snyder administration \u2014 were among various factors in the governor\u2019s refusal to endorse Schuette.\n\nJoyce Coleman, a 65-year-old retired teacher from Detroit who voted for Whitmer, applauded Schuette\u2019s prosecution of Nassar but said \u201cthere\u2019s some things that I don\u2019t appreciate. ... I don\u2019t like the way he went after the LGBT community.\u201d She said she liked Whitmer\u2019s focus on Flint and turning around the school system.\n\nJerry Barbree, a 50-year-old from Springfield who is on disability due to epilepsy, said he voted for Schuette because Republicans \u201chave been trying to get things fixed.\u201d He cited as an example Trump\u2019s emphasis on an immigration crackdown, saying the \u201cwe\u2019ve got enough of our own people here that we\u2019ve got to support.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John Flesher in Traverse City contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Eggert on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00 .

(AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Kevin Byard secured the interception that sparked the sluggish Tennessee Titans and turned toward midfield.\n\nThe flashback for the Dallas Cowboys was just as disheartening as the original.\n\nByard mimicked Terrell Owens\u2019 mocking celebration on the star logo at the 50-yard line from 18 years ago, Marcus Mariota accounted for three touchdowns and the Titans spoiled Amari Cooper\u2019s Dallas debut with a 28-14 victory on Monday night.\n\nThe end-zone pick of Dak Prescott came after Mariota fumbled on the first two Tennessee possessions. Just as T.O. did at old Texas Stadium 18 years ago, Byard ran to midfield, under the huge videoboard at spacious AT&T Stadium, and spread his arms.\n\nOwens did it twice in a blowout San Francisco win over a bad Dallas team that time. This win by the Titans (4-4) ended their three-game losing streak while handing the Cowboys (3-5) their first loss in four home games and making their road to the playoffs a difficult one.\n\n\u201cIt was huge,\u201d Mariota said of Byard, while adding that he didn\u2019t see the celebration. \u201cThe defense has done an unbelievable job throughout the year in building us up. They found ways to give us plays, to get turnovers.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys looked like the team headed for a blowout win, but led just 7-0 after Mariota\u2019s early miscues because of Brett Maher\u2019s missed 38-yard field goal on the opening possession and Prescott\u2019s ill-advised throw into double coverage.\n\n\u201cThat was the difference. Simple as that,\u201d said Prescott, who lost a fumble at his 40-yard line to set up Tennessee\u2019s tiebreaking score in the third quarter. \u201cDefense gives a turnover there. We\u2019re up seven points and I go down there and try to force the ball and give it right back to them.\u201d\n\nCooper scored the first Dallas touchdown after DeMarcus Lawrence stripped the ball from Mariota . The two-time Pro Bowl receiver finished with five catches for 58 yards after coming over from Oakland in a trade for a first-round pick during the open week.\n\nGiven another chance when what would have been a third straight fumble to start the game was overturned by a review that showed Luke Stocker didn\u2019t have the ball long enough on a catch, Mariota led an 80-yard drive capped by Derrick Henry\u2019s 1-yard plunge for a 7-7 tie.\n\nMariota converted two third-and-9s with passes and a shorter third down with a run on his first TD drive, setting the stage for the Titans to convert 11 of 14 third downs.\n\nThe Cowboys fell flat in 15-year tight end Jason Witten\u2019s first trip home since retiring to become lead analyst for \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nDallas had just 108 yards in the second half \u2014 the bulk of those on a desperation drive down two scores late \u2014 and was booed several times at the end of failed drives.\n\nAfter getting sacked on third down with nobody realizing Tennessee had called timeout in a 7-7 game in the second quarter, Mariota completed a 36-yarder to Darius Jennings before a screen pass to Dion Lewis went 18 yards for a touchdown.\n\nMariota broke a 14-14 tie in the third quarter when he pulled the ball out of Lewis\u2019 gut at the last second and delivered a 7-yard shovel pass to Jonnu Smith to put the Titans ahead for good. Mariota\u2019s 9-yard scoring run all but sealed things with 4:38 to go.\n\nMariota was 21 of 29 for 240 yards without an interception and had 32 yards rushing. Lewis had 62 yards rushing and 60 receiving coming off a career-high 155 scrimmage yards in his last game.\n\nStar Dallas running back Ezekiel Elliott finished with 61 yards after a hot start. Prescott was 21 of 31 for 243 yards and two scores \u2014 4 yards to Cooper and 23 yards to Allen Hurns. The two turnovers were Prescott\u2019s first at home this season.\n\nT.O. FLASHBACK\n\nThere was something else familiar about Byard\u2019s celebration: a Dallas defender trying to do something about it.\n\nGeorge Teague famously knocked Owens off the star back then, and Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones made a similar move on Byard and the group that joined the celebration. Owens seemed to get a kick out of the whole thing on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI was actually expecting somebody to knock my head off,\u201d said Byard, who thought about the possible celebration at the team hotel. \u201cI was like, \u2018If we get to the 50, if we get enough guys to the 50, we are just going to start dancing on the star.\u2019\u201d\n\nWITTEN TRIBUTE\n\nThe Cowboys paid tribute to Witten with a pregame video on the giant board hanging over the field. The franchise leader in games, catches and yards receiving wiped his eyes when a small inset of him was shown during the video, but seemed to have gained his composure when he was shown on the full screen. Witten waved, smiled and tapped his chest around his heart several times as the crowd roared.\n\nINJURIES\n\nDallas LB Sean Lee pulled up with a hamstring injury while trying to cover Smith on a 26-yard completion to the Titans tight end. Lee didn\u2019t return. ...

(AP Photo/Jim Salter)\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Missouri voters will decide on Tuesday whether to support one, two or three different options to allow medical marijuana for treatment of cancer, HIV and other conditions.\n\nThree separate medical marijuana proposals are on the ballot, the result of three successful and unrelated petition drives.\n\nThey are among several issues confronting Missouri voters, who also will also vote on whether to gradually raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $12 an hour from the current $7.85 per hour; raise the state gas tax, currently 17 cents per gallon, by 10 cents per gallon to fund road and bridge improvements, and whether to create a new position of nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate boundaries based on the 2020 Census.\n\nPassage of any of the three medical marijuana issues would mean that Missouri becomes the 31st state to approve its use (Utah voters also are considering a medical marijuana ballot issue). Legislative researchers have estimated that more than $100 million worth of medical marijuana could be sold annually.\n\nTwo of the ballot measures are constitutional amendments and the other would change state law. Legal experts predict a court battle if more than one of the measures is approved.\n\nBased on information from the Missouri Secretary of State\u2019s office, constitutional amendments take precedence over the state law proposition, and if both constitutional amendments pass, the one with the most \u201cyes\u201d votes takes effect.\n\nBut among the unresolved issues: If a measure passes but is nevertheless trumped by one of the others, would its non-conflicting provisions also become law?\n\nConstitutional Amendment 2, from a coalition of patients, doctors and veterans called New Approach Missouri, emphasizes the value of medical marijuana for veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder is among the qualifying conditions, and a 4 percent sales tax goes to a newly-created fund for health and care services for veterans.\n\nThe competing constitutional change proposal, Amendment 3, was financed almost exclusively by Brad Bradshaw, a Springfield personal injury attorney and medical doctor. It\u2019s funding mechanism: A 15 percent tax on the retail sale of marijuana as well as a wholesale tax on the sale of marijuana flowers and leaves. Those funds would be used to create a new state institute to research \u201cpresently incurable diseases.\u201d\n\nOpponents have criticized a provision giving Bradshaw broad powers over the new research institute, including choosing its board members.\n\nProposition C\u2019s plan changes state law to impose a 2 percent tax on medical marijuana sales to be used for veteran services, drug treatment, early childhood education and public safety in cities with medical marijuana facilities. It was supported by Missourians for Patient Care, a political action committee that did not disclose its financial supporters.\n\nVoters also will consider Amendment 1, which supporters say would make the state government more ethical.\n\nCurrently, state House and Senate districts are redrawn after each census by bipartisan commissions appointed by the governor. Nominees are submitted by the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAmendment 1 would create a new position of nonpartisan state demographer who would propose maps to commissioners that reflect the parties\u2019 share of the statewide vote in previous elections for president, governor and U.S. senator. Criteria of \u201cpartisan fairness\u201d and \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d outrank more traditional criteria such as geographically compact districts.\n\nThe measure also seeks to reduce lobbyist influence and puts new limits on contributions to legislative candidates.\n\nThe campaign for the initiative is run by a Democratic consultant and has received money from groups that typically back Democrats. Some Republicans support the proposal, including former U.S. Sen. John Danforth. But others in the GOP believe it is a partisan effort to help Democrats gain ground on Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Chicago Bulls' Jabari Parker hangs on the rim after slamming the ball during the first overtime of the NBA basketball game against the New York Knicks, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in New York.

(AP) \u2014 South Dakota approved ballot questions Tuesday to stop out-of-state money flooding citizens\u2019 initiative campaigns and to simplify future changes to the state constitution.\n\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s voters rejected a pair of other measures to dramatically reshape the state\u2019s ballot question system. They also tossed aside a tobacco tax hike that sparked major opposition spending from the tobacco industry.\n\nRepublican Dusty Johnson was elected South Dakota\u2019s next U.S. representative, not to mention Republicans keeping control of every statewide office.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at races of interest beyond the governor\u2019s race won by Republican Kristi Noem:\n\nBALLOT QUESTION CHANGES\n\nSouth Dakota, the first state to let citizens propose and pass laws way back in 1898, handed a win to those frustrated over money from outside the state\u2019s borders influencing voter measures. Citizens also backed the Legislature\u2019s plan to require constitutional amendments to stick to a single subject.\n\nThey were a pair of victories for House Speaker Mark Mickelson, who spearheaded both proposals after the 2016 election season brought 10 questions and millions of dollars from out-of-state groups.\n\nRepublican Dick Kelly, a 77-year-old former state lawmaker and local government official, voted for the outside funding ban, saying South Dakota has become a testing ground for people with a lot of money.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there should be that much influence by outside corporations or individuals with an agenda to come in and influence how we live in South Dakota,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe don\u2019t live the same way they live in California or New York, and I don\u2019t want to live that way. I want to live our way.\u201d\n\nDespite anger among some over lawmakers\u2019 repeal of a 2016 voter-approved ethics measure, voters panned a citizen-backed constitutional amendment that would have prevented the Legislature from changing initiatives \u2014 or the ballot question system \u2014 without a public vote. The amendment would have imposed stricter lobbying and campaign finance rules and created a new government ethics watchdog.\n\nVoters also decided to leave the current simple majority threshold required for constitutional amendments as is, rather than raise it to 55 percent.\n\nTOBACCO TAX FOR TECH SCHOOLS\n\nSmokers won\u2019t be paying to make state technical schools more affordable. Voters dispatched a ballot question to increase taxes on different tobacco products after the tobacco industry dumped millions into the state to oppose it.\n\nProceeds would have gone to lowering tuition and fees, offering scholarships and providing financial support for the state\u2019s four technical institutes. South Dakota hasn\u2019t raised its tobacco tax since 2006.\n\nAndy Middlen, a registered Democrat from Sioux Falls, cast an absentee vote Monday against it because he said he didn\u2019t believe the revenues raised would go where politicians said they would.\n\nU.S. HOUSE\n\nRepublican Dusty Johnson beat Democrat Tim Bjorkman to succeed Rep. Noem as the state\u2019s lone representative. Johnson was the favorite throughout the race. The former public utilities commissioner and past gubernatorial chief of staff ran an energetic and well-funded campaign as a traditional conservative. He said his top priority in Washington is getting a farm bill done.\n\n\u201cWe feel great,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis was a job interview and tonight the people of South Dakota have hired us. I\u2019m not going to disappoint them.\u201d\n\nBjorkman said he gave South Dakotans an issue-based campaign free of rancor and harsh rhetoric that\u2019s all too common in politics.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nRepublican lawyer and Army Reserve officer Jason Ravnsborg will be the latest in a long line of Republicans to be the state\u2019s chief lawyer and law enforcement officer. He overcame former U.S. Attorney Randy Seiler, who touted his prosecutorial experience.\n\nRavnsborg, a partner at a Yankton law firm, campaigned as the candidate favored by the law enforcement community. He\u2019s proposed expanding programs allowing lower-level prisoners to work and establishing a meth-specific prison and mental health facility in the central or western part of the state.\n\nThe high-profile office takes on the state\u2019s top legal cases and has served as a frequent springboard for gubernatorial hopefuls.\n\nOTHER STATEWIDE OFFICES & LEGISLATURE\n\nVoters also favored Republicans for a slew of other statewide offices, choosing Steve Barnett as secretary of state; Kristie Fiegen as public utilities commissioner; Rich Sattgast as state auditor; Josh Haeder as state treasurer; and Ryan Brunner as school and public lands commissioner. All 105 seats of the Legislature \u2014 70 in the House and 35 in the Senate \u2014 were also on the ballot.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Sen.-elect Josh Hawley makes his victory speech while his wife Erin watches during an election watch party Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018, in Springfield, Mo.

He threw his support behind Trump\u2019s policies, while avoiding using or reacting to the president\u2019s incendiary rhetoric.\n\nHawley was the only statewide candidate in Missouri to receive more votes than Trump in 2016, when he won his bid for attorney general.\n\nMissouri was once considered a bellwether state, but Republicans now control the state Legislature and almost every office.

She joked that her mouth sometimes caused her trouble but said she actually tried to be careful about what she said.\n\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI will be out here fighting with you. I am not going away. I love this state and will continue to serve.\u201d\n\nMcCaskill presented herself as a moderate during more than 50 town halls held in Republican strongholds, noting that she voted with Trump nearly half the time in the Senate.\n\n\u201cHe is Trump\u2019s guy, and I am not anybody except Missouri\u2019s guy, or gal I guess,\u201d McCaskill said during a Monday campaign stop in Columbia.\n\nHawley dismissed McCaskill\u2019s claim to be a moderate, hammering her on Senate votes against both of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court picks, his federal tax overhaul and other priorities.\n\nHe launched an ad criticizing the Democrats\u2019 handling of sexual misconduct allegations against Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh, making the Missouri race a barometer of the \u201cKavanaugh effect\u201d\u2014 whether GOP voters would be more likely to vote after the attacks on the justice.\n\nColumbia Republican Jimmy Reed, 67, said Trump\u2019s endorsement of Hawley motivated him to go to the polls Tuesday. He said the president deserves a chance to get things done, and he needs a Republican majority in Congress to do that, so he voted for Hawley.\n\n\u201cShe may be somewhat moderate, but she\u2019s still a Democrat against the other side right now,\u201d Reed said of McCaskill.\n\nDemocrats had accused Hawley of going easy as attorney general on former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens, who faced multiple political and personal scandals after media reported details about Greitens\u2019 extramarital affair in 2015 and his use of a charity donor list for his gubernatorial campaign.\n\nThat criticism of Hawley faded after Greitens stepped down in June.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jim Salter in Chesterfield, Missouri and Margaret Stafford in Kansas City, Missouri contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of file photos shows the candidates for Minnesota attorney general in the November 2018 election from left, Democratic U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison and Republican Doug Wardlow. (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Rep. Keith Ellison won Minnesota\u2019s race for attorney general Tuesday, surviving an ex-girlfriend\u2019s domestic abuse allegation that put the seat in play for Republicans for the first time in half a century.\n\nEllison defeated Republican Doug Wardlow, who was a virtual unknown and would have been a heavy underdog but for the abuse claim against Ellison, which he strongly denied.\n\nEllison rose to national prominence as the first Muslim elected to Congress and last year became deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He talked of using the attorney general\u2019s office to resist President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThen his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan, accused him of dragging her off a bed during an argument in 2016. Monahan claimed to have a video, but never produced it, and an investigation commissioned by Minnesota Democrats ruled the accusation was \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d\n\nWardlow, and Republicans, called the investigation a whitewash, and hammered Ellison with the allegations throughout the campaign.\n\n\u201cThis was the challenge of a lifetime,\u201d Ellison said of his win.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to add,\u201d he said when asked about the allegations. \u201cI just want to be the best Minnesota attorney general I can possibly be. That\u2019s all I want to do.\u201d\n\nThe seat opened abruptly in June when incumbent Lori Swanson launched a late bid for governor. Soon after Ellison declared and shortly before the primary, Monahan\u2019s claim surfaced.\n\nThough Ellison survived a crowded primary, the accusation dogged him, and other Democrats who refused to disavow him, throughout the campaign.\n\nSuddenly the virtually unknown Wardlow \u2014 who was a lawyer for a conservative Christian legal advocacy group \u2014 became a realistic contender. A Star Tribune/Minnesota Public Radio poll last month gave Wardlow a slight lead. The last GOP attorney general, Doug Head, served one term before losing the 1970 gubernatorial race to Democrat Wendell Anderson.\n\nEllison has been a national political figure since 2006, when, after serving two terms as a state representative, he became the first Muslim elected to Congress.\n\nPaul Taklo, 48, a designer in Minnetonka, said he voted for Wardlow. Taklo described himself as a conservative with libertarian beliefs who generally votes Republican.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t care for Ellison,\u201d Taklo said. \u201cIt\u2019s the liberal aspect of him.\u201d\n\nDavid Galle, 49, a lawyer in Minneapolis, backed Ellison in early voting Monday, calling him a strong supporter of Minneapolis and the state.\n\n\u201cWas I disheartened with some of the, you know, coverage? Yes, it certainly is messy, but as far as his approach to Minnesota versus his challenger, he was for me the clear choice,\u201d Galle said.\n\nA leader in the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party, Ellison became deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee last year.\n\nNot only did Ellison become a lightning rod in the attorney general\u2019s race, Republicans in other races attacked their Democratic opponents for failing to denounce him. While an investigation commissioned by Democratic leaders declared the allegations unsubstantiated, Wardlow called it a whitewash.\n\nDuring Wardlow\u2019s single term in the Minnesota House, he backed so-called right-to-work legislation to block unions from collecting mandatory dues. He also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from setting up the MNsure health insurance exchange.\n\nAfter losing in 2012, he joined the Alliance Defending Freedom, leading its unsuccessful fight in a U.S. Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. He also litigated against letting transgender students use bathrooms of their choice and defended a Michigan funeral home that fired a transgender employee.\n\nEllison vowed to use the attorney general\u2019s office to fight President Donald Trump on immigration and other issues. While Wardlow presented himself as an apolitical alternative, he was recorded as saying at a private event that he wanted to fire 42 Democratic attorneys and replace them with Republicans. He said he misspoke.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "FILE - In this Oct. 23, 2018 file photo, South Dakota Republican U.S. Rep.

Noem said her experience helped her win, and now her priorities are focusing on education, filling workforce needs and dealing with public safety issues.\n\nRamona Rupp, a Republican from Sioux Falls, said she supported Noem based on the congresswoman\u2019s experience and because she seems like a hard worker. The 64-year-old retiree said she hopes Noem keeps her promise not to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cI just feel it\u2019s time to get more females involved, too,\u201d said Rupp, noting, though, that her vote is based on the best candidate, not on gender. \u201cThere\u2019s always room for change, and, you know, she\u2019s proven herself over and over.\u201d\n\nNoem, who has roots in ranching and farming, brought major strengths to the race: a nearly 100,000-voter GOP advantage, experience running statewide campaigns and support from the state\u2019s dominant political party and its top officials.

Online leader Amazon Inc. has refused comment on reports that it plans to split its new headquarters between two locations. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported late Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, that the company would locate the new facilities in Queens in New York City and in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a yearlong search for a second home, Amazon is now reportedly looking to build offices in two cities instead of one, a surprise move that could still have a major impact on the communities it ultimately selects.\n\nNew York\u2019s Long Island City as well as Crystal City in northern Virginia have emerged as the front runners, according to sources familiar with the talks with Amazon.\n\nSelecting those areas would bring more jobs to places that already have plenty. Jed Kolko, the chief economist at job site Indeed, said that choosing New York and the D.C. area would \u201cbe a much less radical move than many imagined\u201d and another example of \u201crich places getting richer.\u201d\n\nThe company had originally promised to bring 50,000 new high-paying jobs to one location, which founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said would be \u201ca full equal\u201d to its Seattle home base. Amazon may now split those jobs equally between two locations, The Wall Street Journal reported, with each getting 25,000.\n\nThat would beg the question of whether the new locations would be headquarters at all. Kolko said a headquarters is \u201cwhere the decision makers are,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear where Amazon\u2019s executives \u2014 such as Bezos \u2014 would spend much of their time. If Amazon decides to split the 50,000 workers in two places, each of those offices would be smaller than Seattle\u2019s, which has more than 40,000 employees.\n\nVirginia officials and some state lawmakers were recently briefed by the head of the state\u2019s economic development office that Amazon was considering splitting up its second headquarters, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nOfficials in Virginia believe there\u2019s a strong likelihood Amazon will pick Crystal City as one of its sites, but the company has not said anything definitive, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a real secretive company,\u201d the person said.\n\nOne of the other areas the online retail giant is considering is Long Island City, according to a source familiar with the talks. Across the East River from midtown Manhattan, Long Island City is a longtime industrial and transportation hub that has become a fast-growing neighborhood of riverfront high-rises and redeveloped warehouses, with an enduring industrial foothold and burgeoning arts and tech scenes.\n\nAmazon has been tight-lipped about the process and declined to comment on the latest news. There\u2019s been intense competition to win over the company, with some throwing around billions of dollars in tax incentives. Amazon kicked off its hunt for a second headquarters in September 2017, initially receiving 238 proposals before narrowing the list to 20 in January.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo met two weeks ago with Amazon officials in his New York City offices, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss the negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity. Cuomo offered to travel to Amazon\u2019s Seattle hometown to continue talks, the source said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuomo told reporters that Amazon is looking at Long Island City, but didn\u2019t say if it was a finalist. He said winning over Amazon would give an economic boost to the entire state, and joked that he was willing to change his name to \u201cAmazon Cuomo\u201d to lure the company.\n\nAn estimated 135,000 or more people live in Long Island City and neighboring Sunnyside and Woodside, and the median household makes about $63,500 a year, a bit higher than the citywide median, according to New York University\u2019s Furman Center housing and urban policy think tank. About 40 percent of people over 25 in the Long Island City area have a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree, slightly above the citywide rate, the Furman Center\u2019s data shows.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Amazon is finalizing deals to locate to Long Island City and the Crystal City section of Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the possible plan to split the headquarters between two cities, said Dallas is also still a contender. Both newspapers cited unnamed people familiar with the decision-making process.\n\nA spokesman for the Dallas Regional Chamber declined to comment.\n\nLong Island City and Crystal City would meet Amazon\u2019s requirements for a new locale: Both are near metropolitan areas with more than a million people, have nearby international airports, direct access to mass transit and have room for the company to expand.\n\nOther locations that were on Amazon\u2019s list of 20 either declined to comment or said they haven\u2019t heard from the online retailer.\n\nJay Ash, the economic development chief in Massachusetts, said Tuesday that he\u2019s had \u201cno recent contact\u201d with Amazon about a headquarters in Boston, but his office is still talking with the company about other opportunities. Earlier this year, Amazon unveiled plans for an office expansion in Boston\u2019s Seaport District, promising 2,000 new technology jobs by 2021 in fields including machine learning and robotics.\n\nAmazon has said it could spend more than $5 billion on the new headquarters over the next 17 years, about matching the size of its current home in Seattle, which has 33 buildings and 23 restaurants.\n\nThe company already employs more than 600,000 worldwide. That\u2019s expected to increase as it builds more warehouses across the country to keep up with online orders. Amazon recently announced that it would pay all its workers at least $15 an hour, but the employees at its second headquarters will be paid a lot more \u2014 an average of more than $100,000 a year.\n\nEarlier this month, Bezos said during an on-stage interview in New York that the final decision will come down to intuition.\n\n\u201cYou immerse yourself in that data, but then you make that decision with your heart,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nKlepper reported from Albany, New York, and Suderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.

Stone said Tuesday the matter already was addressed before the five-minute clip surfaced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing the way the video got released,\u201d he said. \u201cWe dealt with this long before this video was released. As a coaching staff, as management, as players it was dealt with internally and the way it should be, and we\u2019re going to move forward and grow from it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want negative stuff surrounding our team and this is a hiccup.

Tina Smith and Republican Karin Housley. (Star Tribune via AP, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, who was appointed to take former Sen. Al Franken\u2019s seat after he resigned, won Tuesday\u2019s special election to finish the final two years of his term.\n\nThe longtime Democratic power player defeated Republican state Sen. Karin Housley, who had an energetic campaign and a name made famous by her husband\u2019s professional hockey career. Housley gave Republicans hope they could win back the office that the party lost to Franken in 2008.\n\nSmith reflected on the whirlwind of campaigning and serving in the Senate since her January appointment.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to everyone in Minnesota who has put their faith in me,\u201d she told a raucous crowd of Democrats in St. Paul. \u201cWhen we started this effort 10 months ago, I said that I should not be underestimated. Tonight, we showed the country that Minnesota must not be underestimated.\u201d\n\nLess than four years after voters overwhelmingly gave Franken a second term, he was swept out of office when several women accused of him of sexual misconduct. His resignation in December triggered the contest between Smith and Housley.\n\nSmith will finish the term ending in 2020, when she could potentially stand for re-election.\n\nTuesday\u2019s election was a rarity in Minnesota, with two U.S. Senate seats on the ballot. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar easily captured a third term over little-known state Rep. Jim Newberger.\n\nWith Franken\u2019s departure, Republicans jumped at the unexpected chance to reclaim an office they have not held since former Sen. Norm Coleman lost to Franken by 312 votes. Housley quickly emerged as the top GOP candidate, with her reputation as a fierce campaigner and a name recognition boost from her husband, former NHL star and Buffalo Sabres head coach Phil Housley.\n\nRepublican men, including former Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Reps. Tom Emmer and Erik Paulsen, quickly passed on the race, and Housley easily clinched the party\u2019s nod in an August primary.\n\nPublic polling showed the race close, but it never seriously figured in the nationwide battle for control of the Senate. Outside political organizations with their eyes on the Senate majority spent just a trickle in Minnesota, focusing millions instead on North Dakota, Wisconsin and other more promising states.\n\nPhillip Baum, 63, a self-described moderate conservative in Minnetonka, split his ticket Tuesday, backing Klobuchar in her Senate race but Republican Jeff Johnson for governor. Baum, a general contractor, said he was on the fence in the Smith-Housley race until Smith skipped a televised debate.\n\n\u201cThat sent the wrong message for me,\u201d Baum said. He voted for Housley.\n\nSarah Roth, 22, also of Minnetonka, went for Smith as part of a straight-Democratic vote. Roth described herself as a liberal and said she thought it was critical to change the balance of power in the country.\n\n\u201cI think the past couple of years, ever since President Trump has been in office, it has just been not the country that I am used to or that I thought I would be in.\u201d\n\nSmith got a head start in the race when Gov. Mark Dayton announced in December that he would appoint her to Franken\u2019s seat. Smith had been Dayton\u2019s lieutenant governor since 2015 and a longtime trusted aide, serving as his chief of staff after a career spent running campaigns and as a Planned Parenthood executive.\n\nAfter joining the Senate in January, Smith cultivated an image of a studious senator with sober, issue-focused ads on tackling pharmaceutical costs and vocational job training. She tried to avoid engaging with Housley throughout the campaign, including skipping a debate televised statewide and leaving Housley alone on stage. Smith said a busy campaign and Senate schedule got in the way, and the pair still had two debates.\n\nBut Housley bashed Smith for her absence and spent much of the campaign casting her as a longtime political insider with a hand in major flops during Dayton\u2019s administration, including the rocky launch of a new driver-registration system and pervasive abuse and neglect at senior centers statewide.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (0) puts up a shot over New Orleans Pelicans forward E'Twaun Moore (55) in the second half of an NBA basketball game in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

Scott Walker in Madison, Wis. (Steve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Democrat Tony Evers ousted Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday, denying the polarizing Republican and one-time presidential candidate a third term and succeeding where his party had failed in three previous attempts, including a 2012 recall.\n\nEvers\u2019 victory is a monumental win for Democrats and a steep fall for Walker, who just three years ago was seen as an early front-runner in the GOP primary for president. When Walker dropped out of the presidential race, he focused on rebuilding his low approval ratings in Wisconsin.\n\nWalker had promised if he won the third term would have been his last, but voters decided that two was enough.\n\nEvers, 67, a former teacher and state superintendent since 2009, used his folksy, nondescript personality to his advantage in the campaign, using words like \u201cjeepers\u201d and \u201choly mackerel\u201d while arguing that voters were tired of divisiveness and yearned for more collegial politics.\n\nThe win gives Democrats a boost after President Donald Trump narrowly carried Wisconsin by less than 1 point in 2016. It also puts Evers in position to dismantle much of what Walker and Republicans did over the past eight years, including rolling back portions of the law that effectively ended collective bargaining for public workers.\n\nDemocratic voters were ecstatic about ousting Walker.\n\n\u201cTony Evers provides us with a new direction that a lot of people want to go,\u201d said Danielle Moehring, 27, a scientist from Madison.\n\nMoehring said she thought anger over Trump was motivating people to \u201ccome out of the woodwork,\u201d get involved and vote.\n\nEllen Martin, a 67-year-old retired occupational therapist from Madison, said she voted for Evers because he will \u201csave our state, especially the environment, education.\u201d\n\nMartin said she thought voters in Wisconsin were tired of Walker after eight years in office.\n\n\u201cI never liked him,\u201d Martin said. \u201cHe\u2019s shamed our state, embarrassed our state, ruined our politics.\u201d\n\nEvers, a cancer survivor, campaigned on supporting the national health care law and its guarantees of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. He also promised to cut middle class taxes by 10 percent, paid for by all-but repealing a manufacturing and agriculture tax credit program Walker enacted. Evers is also open to raising the gas tax to pay for road repair and construction, although he hasn\u2019t released a specific plan.\n\nWalker, the 51-year-old son of a Baptist preacher, swept into office in 2010, part of a Republican wave that saw the GOP take over control of the state Legislature as well. With Republican partners in the Statehouse, Walker pushed through a law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most public workers.\n\nAnger over that law led to the failed 2012 recall election. Walker\u2019s stature among conservatives and national profile skyrocketed after the union fight and the passage of a host of Republican priorities, including making Wisconsin a right-to-work state; cutting taxes by $8 billion; implementing a voter ID law; expanding the private school voucher program statewide; freezing tuition at the University of Wisconsin; rejecting federal Medicaid expansion money under the Affordable Care Act; and restricting access to abortion.\n\nWalker ran for president in 2015, but dropped out before any votes were cast, out of money and down in the polls. His voter approval rating in Wisconsin dropped to its lowest levels.\n\nLast year, working closely with the Trump administration, Walker signed a deal with Taiwan-based Foxconn to build a display screen factory in the state that could result in $10 billion in investments and 13,000 jobs. He\u2019s pointed to that as signs of the state\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nEvers wants to renegotiate the deal, saying the potential $4 billion in state and local tax breaks for the Taiwan-based company is too much. Evers has also vowed, on his first day in office, to withdraw Wisconsin from a federal lawsuit seeking repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of file photos show candidates for Minnesota governor in the November 2018 election from left, Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Walz and Republican Jeff Johnson. (AP Photo/Jim Mone, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Democratic Rep. Tim Walz won Tuesday\u2019s open election for Minnesota governor, defeating second-time Republican candidate Jeff Johnson to extend Democrats\u2019 hold on the state\u2019s top executive office.\n\nAfter campaigning to expand the state\u2019s low-income health care program with a public option and increase public school funding, Walz said his victory was proof that voters are ready for those policies. And he relished massive turnout that helped power Democrats up and down the ballot.\n\n\u201cThat can-do spirit in Minnesota is alive and well. I can feel it though this,\u201d Walz said.\n\nIt was the first open governor\u2019s race since 2010, when Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton won the first of his two terms. Dayton opted not to run for a third term, setting off a wide-open race to replace him.\n\nWalz was the heavy favorite throughout the race, holding large leads over Johnson in public polling. But his victory was still an oddity: It was the first time one of Minnesota\u2019s political parties has held on to the office for three or more terms since the 1950s.\n\nWhile Johnson portrayed his own candidacy as a course correction after the Dayton administration, Walz vowed to continue the liberal path that Dayton began during his two terms. Expanding the state\u2019s low-income health care program, MinnesotaCare, to have a public option was a hallmark of his campaign. But he drew criticism from both sides for his tepid support of a $15 hourly minimum wage, despite campaigning for it earlier in the election cycle.\n\nAt a polling place near the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, several voters said Walz, a former high school teacher, was one of their biggest motivations for voting.\n\n\u201cTim Walz has the answers,\u201d said Dennis Draughn, 33, who teaches at suburban Apple Valley High School.\n\nDesiree Richardson, 25, a teacher in the Minneapolis Public Schools system, said Walz\u2019s platform resonated with her, too.\n\n\u201cHe wants to back the schools. So that\u2019s a big one because I work in the school system, so I want somebody that\u2019s going to back me,\u201d she said.\n\nWalz will move up to the state\u2019s top office after six terms in Congress, where he represented the conservative-leaning 1st District in southern Minnesota. He used his appeal in rural areas to promote a theme of \u201cOne Minnesota\u201d and enlisted a popular liberal activist and lawmaker, Rep. Peggy Flanagan, as his running mate. He also brought mayors from Fergus Falls to Golden Valley onboard to support the campaign.\n\nJohnson, a Hennepin County commissioner known for often being a lonely conservative voice on that body, was the GOP\u2019s losing candidate against Dayton in 2014. But Johnson had already surprised once, handily beating former Gov. Tim Pawlenty in the primary despite being outraised several times over.\n\nBut the Republican Governors Association, a major outside political group that backed Pawlenty, balked at Johnson\u2019s candidacy, backing away from a $2.3 million advertising blitz that had been planned for summer and fall. It never aired an ad on Johnson\u2019s behalf.\n\nJohnson accused Walz of overpromising, and deemed his health care plan unworkable for hospitals that are reimbursed by the state at lower rates than private health insurers.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "Democratic candidate Colin Allred speaks to supporters during an election night party after he was projected to win the Texas 32nd U.S. congressional house district at the Magnolia Hotel Dallas Park Cities in Dallas, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

The Associated Press had previously called the race for Hurd but later determined it was too close to call.\n\nWomen looked to make gains in Texas, where men hold all but three of the states\u2019 36 seats in Congress. Fletcher snagged one of them, but longtime GOP incumbent John Carter held onto his typically safe district near Austin, defeating Democrat MJ Hegar, a combat veteran and pilot.\n\nABBOTT GETS A SECOND TERM\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott won another four years following one of the most uneventful Texas gubernatorial races in decades. Democrat Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff, barely raised money and her campaign was nonexistent to many voters.\n\nBut Abbott\u2019s real test comes after Election Day, when his power will be tested in a divided Republican-controlled Legislature that shrugged off many of his demands before going home.\n\nHISTORY IN THE MAKING\n\nTexas\u2019 booming Hispanic population is on pace to outnumber white residents as soon as 2022.\n\nTexas also elected a Latina to Congress for the first time. Two of them, in fact: Democrats Veronica Escobar of El Paso and Sylvia Garcia of Houston.\n\nDemocrat Gina Ortiz Jones was still alive in her bid to become Texas\u2019 first Filipina-American and openly gay member of Congress. With all precincts reporting early Wednesday, Hurd led her by 689 votes out of more than 209,500 cast.\n\nTEXAS\u2019 INDICTED AG SEEKING RE-ELECTION\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was re-elected despite spending nearly his entire term in office under indictment for securities fraud.\n\nDemocrat Justin Nelson staked his campaign on reminding voters that Paxton still faces trial over allegations that he duped investors in a startup before becoming Texas\u2019 top law enforcement officer.\n\nBut Paxton, who has pleaded not guilty, has regained his footing within the GOP as his criminal case has languished in court for three years. Paxton\u2019s wife, Angela Paxton, is also on the cusp of joining the state Senate in her first run for office.\n\nTURNOUT COULD SET NEW RECORD\n\nLike other states in what has been a deeply divisive election year, Texas shattered early voting records in big cities for a midterm election. Fewer than 5 million voters in Texas cast ballots in the 2014 and 2010 midterms, but this cycle could be closer to a high-turnout presidential year.\n\nO\u2019Rourke needed to bring out historically unlikely voters to unseat Cruz, whose campaign had made little overtures outside his conservative base.

Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American \u2014 and one of the first two Muslim women \u2014 elected to Congress. Omar faced Republican Jennifer Zielinski in the Minneapolis-area district.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nPowered by surging turnout in the suburbs that pushed Democrats to commanding victories up and down the ballot, Democratic House candidates were on track to unseat enough Republican incumbents to take back the majority.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Kurt Daudt conceded they would lose the majority that they\u2019ve held since 2015. The final margin of Democrats\u2019 majority was unclear as votes were still being tallied.\n\nIt had been considered a tall order, as Democrats needed to flip 11 seats to take control of the chamber. Republicans were bullish on their chances of defending longtime incumbents even amid a backlash against President Donald Trump and his party.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 new majority expands the party\u2019s foothold in state government. Walz won the open race for governor, but Republicans kept control of the state Senate in a special election in a rural St. Cloud-area district.\n\nThe special election was triggered when GOP Sen. Michelle Fischbach resigned the seat to be sworn in as lieutenant governor. It\u2019s generally a safe GOP district, but Fischbach\u2019s departure left the Senate deadlocked at 33-33, raising the stakes in Tuesday\u2019s election. Minnesota\u2019s 66 remaining Senate districts aren\u2019t on the ballot until 2020.\n\nGOP Rep. Jeff Howe, who has represented half of the district since 2013, defeated former Sartell mayor and county commissioner Joe Perske. With two weeks to go, more than $1 million of mailers and political spending poured into the race.\n\nOTHER STATEWIDE\n\nSecretary of State Steve Simon sought a second term as chief elections officer, emphasizing his work on beefing up cybersecurity to protect the election system from hacker attacks, and on boosting voter turnout. His Republican challenger was former state senator and former Red Wing mayor John Howe, who highlighted the office\u2019s lesser-known functions of business registrations.\n\nIn the race for the open position of state auditor, Republican Pam Myhra, a certified public accountant, former state representative from Burnsville and former audit manager for the accounting firm KPMG, faced Democrat Julie Blaha, of Ramsey, former secretary-treasurer of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, former math teacher and former president of the teachers\u2019 union in the Anoka-Hennepin school district.\n\nAssociate Justice Margaret Chutich sought re-election to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Her opponent, family law attorney Michelle MacDonald, was making a third run for the high court despite a past that included having her law license suspended for professional misconduct allegations. She remains on probation.\n\nVOTING\n\nMinnesotans embraced their expanded right to vote early. More than 600,000 people had already voted via absentee and mail-in ballots by Tuesday morning.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of Sept. 28, 2018, file photo, shows candidates for Texas governor in the November 2018 election, from left, incumbent GOP Gov. Greg Abbott and Democrat Lupe Valdez. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, Pool, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Republican Gov. Greg Abbott won a second term Tuesday in one of Texas\u2019 most uneventful races for governor in decades, despite the headwinds of Democratic enthusiasm nationally and U.S. Senate challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke awakening liberal voters at home.\n\nSimilar forces put the GOP\u2019s grip on governorships in Georgia, Florida and Wisconsin on the defense. But in Texas, Abbott\u2019s re-election was seldom in doubt against Democrat Lupe Valdez, a former sheriff who was running to become the state\u2019s first Latina and openly gay governor.\n\nThe lopsided victory was a reminder that Texas is still deeply Republican, even as O\u2019Rourke gave Republican Sen. Ted Cruz the state\u2019s closest U.S. Senate race in a generation. Valdez never put together a serious statewide campaign, including never airing television ads, and she struggled to break even $1 million in fundraising.\n\nAbbott, 60, now follows Rick Perry and George W. Bush as Texas Republican governors who handily won re-election \u2014 and elevated their national ambitions in the process. Abbott, however, lacks the big Texas personas of those predecessors and has built his name in other ways.\n\nLast year, Abbott signed the toughest \u201csanctuary city\u201d ban in the U.S. and was the only governor to push for a North Carolina-style bathroom bill targeting transgender people, two highly divisive issues that have spelled trouble for Republican officeholders elsewhere.\n\nBut in Texas, Abbott was being safely rewarded with four more years, which are likely to include more efforts to restrict abortions and immigration crackdowns.\n\nBut a bigger challenge awaits him after Tuesday. He is out to reassert his power after failing last year to mend bitter party infighting in the Republican-controlled Legislature, and lawmakers brushed off many of his policy demands after Abbott dragged them into a special session.\n\nAbbott was also unsuccessful in driving out two of his biggest Republican critics this year after campaigning for their primary opponents.\n\nHe looked far more dominant in his own race. Valdez, 71, was a barrier-breaking candidate but even national Democratic groups never got behind her stumbling campaign. Among the issues Valdez faced was backlash from liberal Hispanic activists over her record of cooperating with federal immigration agents while she was Dallas County sheriff.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul J.

The Saints won 45-35. (AP Photo/Butch Dill)\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Rams didn\u2019t really aspire to perfection, and they didn\u2019t appear to be overly crushed when their unbeaten start to the season ended in New Orleans.\n\nThe Rams definitely dream of the Super Bowl, and coach Sean McVay believes their quest will get a major boost from the minor setback of Sunday\u2019s 45-35 loss to the powerhouse Saints.\n\n\u201cThe sense we got from our players is that if anything, it creates an added sense of urgency,\u201d McVay said Monday night at the team\u2019s training complex. \u201cYou know, that feeling in your gut where you wake up and you\u2019re just sick because you didn\u2019t get the result that you wanted is something that you can\u2019t create unless you do end up losing. We try to be consistent whether you win or lose, but there is something that is created just based on not getting the result that you wanted.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are 8-1 with a new reason to work hard after they failed for the first time in their remarkable season. Los Angeles\u2019 defense largely couldn\u2019t slow down Drew Brees and Alvin Kamara, while the Rams\u2019 high-octane offense couldn\u2019t quite keep up on the scoreboard despite rallying from a 21-point deficit to tie it.\n\nAfterward, several Rams players expressed a backhanded relief that the specter of a perfect season no longer hangs over the head of a franchise that is less than two years removed from a 4-12 finish. Defensive lineman Michael Brockers said LA\u2019s first loss \u201cmight be a blessing in disguise.\u201d\n\nAnd McVay left the Superdome with plenty of teachable moments on video.\n\nMany of those lowlights occurred while the Rams fell behind 35-14 late in the first half. Those 35 points are the most allowed in a half by the Rams defense since 2008 \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something, since 2008 was the second of 10 consecutive losing seasons for this club.\n\nMcVay praised cornerback Marcus Peters for taking responsibility for his mistakes in coverage, but the coach also realizes the blame must be shared across the roster after giving up a season-worst 487 yards.\n\n\u201cI think with the expectations that our defense has, and that we have for them, they would expect to be better,\u201d McVay said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of credit that needs to go to the Saints. They\u2019re one of the top offenses in the league for a reason. ... It\u2019s a great tape for us to be able to look at, figure out what we can do as a defensive group to be able to respond the right way (and) use it as a chance to learn from it.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2019 8-0 start was the franchise\u2019s best since 1969, and one loss hasn\u2019t stopped their historic turnaround. This franchise has won more than eight games just once in the previous 14 seasons \u2014 and that was last season, when McVay led the Rams to a seven-game improvement from 2016 with an 11-5 regular-season record.\n\nAfter the loss in New Orleans, several Rams also noted they have never lost back-to-back regular-season games under McVay. A visit from the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday is a chance for the Rams to keep that standard intact while essentially ending the NFC West race before mid-November.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait to get back out and get another opportunity to compete and try to erase this feeling that you do have,\u201d McVay said. \u201cI feel like our building shares that same feeling. We\u2019re excited about getting to work.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Rams added rookie OLB Ogbo Okoronkwo to their active roster and waived linebacker Trevon Young. Okoronkwo had foot surgery and went on the physically unable to perform list before training camp, which meant Los Angeles had to decide Monday whether to activate the fifth-round pick or put him on injured reserve. McVay hasn\u2019t decided how much Okoronkwo will play this season, but the coach was \u201cintrigued\u201d by what he saw in practice over the last three weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s done some things that we felt like were positive, were encouraging,\u201d McVay said. ... The Rams have no new injuries from their trip, McVay said.

They\u2019ll be able to use their majorities to support or stymie the governor\u2019s office depending on who wins the title; the race between Republican incumbent Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers was too close to call early Wednesday morning and could be headed toward a recount.\n\nThe GOP went into Election Day with a 64-35 majority in the Assembly, an all-but insurmountable advantage. With 16 races too close to call early Wednesday morning, Republicans had a 50-33 edge and not a single Republican incumbent had lost so far.\n\nRepublicans held only an 18-15 majority in the Senate, however. Democrats had hoped voter anger toward President Donald Trump would put them over the top; the party flipped two GOP seats in special elections earlier this year.\n\nThirteen Senate seats were in play, including eight Republican seats. Democrats had to hold their five seats and flip three GOP seats.\n\nNot only did Republicans hold their eight seats, Andre Jacque came back to defeat Democratic incumbent Caleb Frostman after losing to him in one of the special elections.

Tammy Baldwin, one of the most liberal members of Congress, defeated Republican Leah Vukmir, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, to win a second term Tuesday.\n\nBaldwin led Vukmir in fundraising and the polls throughout the race. Vukmir campaigned as the underdog and urged Republicans who supported Trump to surprise the pollsters like they did in 2016.\n\nBut Democrats came through for Baldwin in a race that marked the first time in Wisconsin history both major party candidates for U.S. Senate were women.\n\nBaldwin had recent history on her side: In the last three midterm elections, no incumbent Wisconsin senator from the party not in the White House lost a re-election bid.\n\nBaldwin, 56, won her first local race at age 24 and was elected to the Senate in 2012, beating former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, in a year when former President Barack Obama was also on the ballot. Baldwin was the first openly gay person elected to the Senate.\n\nVukmir, first elected to the Legislature in 2002, is one of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members. She is a close ally of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, helping to pass the Act 10 collective bargaining law, 20-week abortion ban and right-to-work bill.\n\nBaldwin and Vukmir disagreed on every major issue including health care, immigration, taxes, abortion, national security, gun control and criminal justice.\n\nBaldwin said in her victory speech that the win sends a \u201cloud and clear message\u201d that people in Wisconsin want a senator who will stand up for them against special interests. Baldwin was an early target for outside conservative groups that spent millions attacking her over the summer. But after Vukmir won the August primary, Baldwin outraised her more than 5-to-1.\n\n\u201cDemocrats, Republicans and Independents sent a loud and clear message tonight that they wanted a senator who works not for the special interests, but someone who works for you,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nStephenie Hamen, a 42-year-old artist from Sun Prairie, said she voted for Baldwin, in part as a vote for women\u2019s rights and a vote against Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was to vent (against the president),\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to stand up for women as Americans and be heard.

But the widow and parents of a veteran who died there had come out in support of Baldwin, cutting television ads to help her and undercutting Vukmir\u2019s criticism.\n\nBaldwin recounted the story of her childhood illness that made her an advocate for universal health coverage, while also speaking in detail for the first time about her mother\u2019s struggles with mental illness and prescription drug abuse. Baldwin said that has fueled her fight against opioid abuse.\n\nBaldwin portrayed Vukmir as siding with insurance companies over people, citing her votes in the Legislature against bills the insurance industry opposed that would expand insurance coverage for hearing aids and cochlear implants, mental health care and substance abuse treatments and access to oral chemotherapy.\n\nVukmir said her positions were misrepresented, and as a nurse she was looking out for the best interests of health care consumers.\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FILE - This combination of 2018 file photos shows Arkansas's 2nd Congressional District candidates in the November 2018 election from left, Democrat Clarke Tucker and incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.

(AP) \u2014 A Republican congressman in central Arkansas won re-election Tuesday night, fending off a challenge from a cancer survivor who had criticized his vote for repealing the federal health care law as the GOP maintained control of the state\u2019s four House districts.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. French Hill defeated Democratic challenger Clarke Tucker in the 2nd Congressional District race covering Little Rock and seven central Arkansas counties. Hill was first elected to the seat in 2014. The race also featured Libertarian nominee Joe Swafford.\n\nHill said his win showed voters agreed the district was better off, but said Congress needed to focus on fixes to the immigration and health care systems.\n\n\u201cWe have to move for change to make our country better, and clearly those two are places where we have to work together and do that, on both sides of the aisle, and with leadership from our president,\u201d Hill told supporters.\n\nDemocrats believed the 2nd District\u2019s urban section gave the party a better chance than Arkansas\u2019 three other congressional seats, where the GOP incumbents easily won re-election Tuesday night against long-shot Democratic rivals. In 2016, Trump won 52 percent of the 2nd district\u2019s vote.\n\nTucker, a state legislator, talked often in the race about his bout with bladder cancer last year, and criticized Hill over his vote to repeal the federal health care law last year. Tucker underwent surgery and chemotherapy last year and is now cancer-free. Tucker said the experience and House Republicans\u2019 vote to repeal the health care law motivated him to challenge Hill. The repeal effort failed in the Senate.\n\nTucker said he was proud of the campaign he ran, which he said remained focused on issues that matter to people in the district.\n\n\u201cWe always knew it was going to be close,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cWe just fell a little bit short tonight.\u201d\n\nHill easily won his second term in 2016 by more than 20 percentage points, but has been on defense in the race. He has run a series of ads trying to link Tucker with national Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton. He also has criticized Tucker as soft on immigration and for the times he voted \u201cpresent\u201d or didn\u2019t cast a vote on controversial bills in the state House.\n\nHill\u2019s campaign fund dwarfed Tucker\u2019s, and the race drew the interest of national groups on both sides. Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton\u2019s PAC has run online ads and sent out mailers targeting Tucker, while the Democrats\u2019 congressional campaign arm has run TV spots attacking Hill over health care. Both candidates last month condemned a political action committee\u2019s radio ad in favor of Hill that suggested white Democrats would lynch black Americans if they won the midterm election.\n\nRepublican Rep. Steve Womack, who chairs the House Budget Committee, defeated Democrat Josh Mahony in northwest Arkansas\u2019 3rd District. In east Arkansas\u2019 1st Congressional District, Republican Rep.

(AP) \u2014 Nebraska voters opted Tuesday to expand Medicaid under the federal health care law, a measure that will extend coverage to thousands of low-income residents but create additional costs for lawmakers in next year\u2019s session.\n\nThey also decided races for U.S. Senate and House, governor and the state Legislature.\n\nMEDICAID EXPANSION\n\nAn estimated 90,000 uninsured Nebraskans will gain access to Medicaid under the citizen-led ballot measure. After six failed attempts for expansion under the federal health care law, advocates bypassed the lawmakers who rejected it and took the issue directly to voters.\n\nWhen the measure goes into effect, the federal government will cover 90 percent of the cost starting in 2020, while the state pays the rest \u2014 an estimated $40 million to $69 million annually.\n\nSupporters say expanding Medicaid would benefit people who work but don\u2019t have health coverage. They also argue it would reduce the cost of uncompensated health care for the uninsured.\n\nOpponents see the expansion as an unsustainable mandate that could divert money away from other needs.\n\nGOVERNOR\u2019S RACE\n\nRepublican Gov. Pete Ricketts easily won re-election against his Democratic challenger, state Sen. Bob Krist, who hoped to score a surprise upset in the GOP-dominated state.\n\nRicketts outraised Krist and was viewed as the favorite to win the race. He has pledged to continue advocating for property tax cuts if re-elected and pointed to his efforts to promote Nebraska businesses.\n\nKrist pitched himself as a governor who would work collaboratively with lawmakers to reduce property taxes. He also promised to maintain his reputation as a voice for nonpartisanship in the Legislature, where he served for 10 years.\n\nKrist was a Republican, then briefly an independent before finally joining the Democrats because it provided an easier path to qualify for the ballot.\n\nRicketts, a former TD Ameritrade executive, is the son of billionaire Joe Ricketts and a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs.\n\nU.S. SENATE RACE\n\nU.S. Sen. Deb Fischer earned a second term in office against Democratic challenger Jane Raybould, a Lincoln City Council member who portrayed the Republican as loyal to her party even when it hurts the state.\n\nFischer rejected the criticism, pointing to her work on various Senate committees that oversee farm policy and military services, including the U.S. Strategic Command at Nebraska\u2019s Offutt Air Force Base. She also touted her credentials as a conservative who voted to cut taxes.\n\nRaybould cast herself as an outsider who would focus on lowering health care costs by changing but not eliminating the Affordable Care Act. She also pledged to promote rural economic development policies.\n\nThe candidates differed on their support for new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual assault allegations during his confirmation process. Fischer voted to confirm Kavanaugh while Raybould said the allegations merited further investigation.\n\nKavanaugh repeatedly denied the allegations.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL RACES\n\nU.S. Rep. Don Bacon won a tight re-election bid against Democrat Kara Eastman, a progressive who hoped to unseat the first-term Republican in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, encompassing Omaha and most of its suburbs.\n\nThe district is traditionally the most competitive in Nebraska, having changed hands from Republican to Democrat in 2014 with the election of Brad Ashford. Bacon defeated Ashford two years later.\n\nUnlike Ashford, who stressed his role as a centrist, Eastman has embraced a progressive platform that includes expanded Medicare, greater gun control and tuition-free college for families making less than $125,000 a year.\n\nBacon described himself as a conservative and supporter of President Donald Trump who is open to compromise on issues including immigration, health care and climate change.\n\n\u201cWhat this district wants is a pragmatic conservative who\u2019s not a firebrand, who\u2019s civil to others,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m honored that my (constituents) rehired me.\u201d\n\nIn the 1st Congressional District, Republican Rep.

Republicans have outnumbered Democrats 30-17 \u2014 three votes shy of the 33 needed to overcome the filibusters that thwarted dozens of bills this year.\n\nHowever, even if Republicans gain those seats, Nebraska\u2019s system makes it hard to predict how legislation will fare. The Legislature has no official party leadership, so it\u2019s easier for individual senators to break ranks when they support or oppose a bill, or strike deals with senators from the other party.\n\nRicketts has responded by calling for more \u201cplatform Republicans\u201d in the Legislature and funneling his own money into competitive legislative races.\n\n___\n\nFollow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "New Orleans forward Anthony Davis shoots the ball over Oklahoma City guard Russell Westbrook (0) in the first half of an NBA basketball game in Oklahoma City, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

The party pinned its hopes on Racine ironworker Randy Bryce but Republican attorney Bryan Steil defeated him easily. Bryce had built a national following, branding himself \u201cIron Stache,\u201d a play on his occupation and his thick mustache. He generated more than $6 million in contributions by the end of July but had plenty of problems. He failed to pay child support and has been arrested nine times. Steil, a University of Wisconsin System regent, worked as a Ryan aide for a year in 2003 and had Ryan\u2019s support since he entered the race. The district covers Wisconsin\u2019s southeastern corner and includes Janesville, Racine and Kenosha.\n\n6th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT\n\nRepublican incumbent Glenn Grothman defeated Democratic challenger Dan Kohl to win a third term in Washington. The 6th Congressional District has trended Republican for years, but Grothman was still worried the race against Kohl would be the toughest re-election fight of his career. Early returns Tuesday evening showed Grothman with about 56 percent of the vote.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL\n\nDemocrat Josh Kaul is looking to unseat Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel. Kaul is the son of the late former Democratic Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager and served as a federal prosecutor in Baltimore but hasn\u2019t played up his background on the campaign trail, choosing instead to focus on attacking Schimel. He says Schimel took too long to test thousands of unanalyzed sexual assault evidence kits , allowing testing delays at the state crime labs to grow, spending taxpayer money on commemorative coins for local police and failing to get control of the state\u2019s opioid crisis. Schimel has pushed back by playing up his efforts to award safety grants to schools and painting Kaul as an outsider with little prosecutorial experience.\n\nSECRERTARY OF STATE\n\nDemocratic incumbent Doug La Follette won his 12th term in a powerless office Tuesday evening, defeating Republican Jay Schroeder, a mortgage loan officer from Neenah. Republican lawmakers have stripped the secretary of state\u2019s office of nearly all of its duties over the years. The secretary\u2019s only real tasks now are sitting on the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands and issuing international authentication certificates for documents.\n\nTREASURER\n\nRepublican Travis Hartwig of Oak Creek and Democrat Sarah Godlewski of Madison are vying to replace outgoing state Treasuer Matt Adamcyzk. The treasurer has no real tasks except to sit on the Board of Commissioners of Public Land and track unclaimed property. Godlewski wants the office to review state finances and protect senior citizens from financial exploitation. Hartwig wants the office to help with audits of state and local government.

Fischer emphasized her role as a rancher in Nebraska\u2019s rural Sandhills region. Raybould, a Lincoln city councilwoman and former county commissioner, pushed her business experience and working-class roots helping with her family\u2019s grocery store chain.\n\nConversely, Raybould sought to portray Fischer as a Washington insider who votes with her party even when it hurts Nebraska residents. She pointed to Fischer\u2019s support of a GOP health care bill that would have replaced the Affordable Care Act, but raised insurance costs in Nebraska faster than other states.\n\nFischer pushed back, pointing to her work on Senate committees that focus on agriculture and the military, both important areas to Nebraska with its farm economy and Offutt Air Force Base.\n\nThe candidates also differed on their support for new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual assault allegations during his confirmation process. Kavanaugh denied the allegations.

She also reiterated in her concession some of her strongest criticisms lobbed at Fischer.\n\n\u201cWe called out Sen.

Pete Ricketts sailed to a second term in Nebraska on Tuesday, prevailing over a Democratic state lawmaker who promised to govern as a centrist and reduce partisanship at the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans typically are favored in Nebraska, given the GOP\u2019s large voter registration edge, and Ricketts had reason to be optimistic with a five-to-one spending advantage and a series of television ads that touted his efforts to promote business locally and abroad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to the people of Nebraska for allowing us to continue the work on the foundation we\u2019ve built,\u201d Ricketts said in an interview with The Associated Press after his victory. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to have this opportunity for the next four years, and I look forward to getting back to work.\u201d\n\nHis challenger, state Sen. Bob Krist, stressed his work to lower property taxes and promote nonpartisanship in an increasingly polarized Legislature. Krist was previously a Republican but often clashed with GOP leaders and changed his affiliation after announcing his run for governor. He briefly registered as an independent but joined the Democrats because it provided an easier path to qualify for the ballot.\n\nIn an interview after his loss, Krist told the AP that he was proud of his campaign and \u201claid it all on the line\u201d in hopes of scoring a surprise upset. He said he doesn\u2019t believe Ricketts has worked hard enough to address rising property taxes, a major concern for farmers and ranchers. Ricketts disputed the allegation, pointing to several initiatives he has introduced over the last four years.\n\n\u201cSomething has to be done,\u201d Krist said. \u201cI think the citizens of Nebraska are about ready to put a (property tax) referendum on the ballot. I can only hope and pray this is a wakeup call for Pete Ricketts.\u201d\n\nKrist said he still has faith in the Nebraska Democratic Party, despite his loss and what he described as a lack of support from national groups such as the Democratic Governors Association.\n\nRicketts was elected governor in 2014 after narrowly surviving a six-man GOP primary and easily defeating his Democratic opponent, Chuck Hassebrook. The former TD Ameritrade executive is the son of billionaire Joe Ricketts and a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, one of Major League Baseball\u2019s most valuable franchises.\n\nRicketts has faced criticism for donating more than $190,000 of his own money to like-minded legislative candidates, including those who were trying to unseat fellow Republicans. He drew fire from Planned Parenthood of the Heartland for a budget that denies federal family-planning dollars to the group.\n\nHe also helped bankroll a petition drive to reinstate the death penalty after lawmakers abolished the punishment in 2015. Voters approved the measure in 2016, and in August, Nebraska executed its first death-row inmate in more than two decades.\n\nRicketts defended his donations to legislative candidates, but Krist said it\u2019s inappropriate for a sitting governor to try to influence those elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely against someone throwing millions of dollars at campaigns that they have nothing to do with,\u201d Krist said. \u201cYou have to work to build consensus (in the Legislature).

They kept a lot to the outside. We\u2019d talked a lot about that, and I thought they played really well and made my job a lot easier.\u201d\n\nWashington in particular did a good job defending McDavid at even strength, bottling up the reigning Art Ross Trophy winner and limiting his scoring chances.

Mary Fallin, whose approval ratings have been dismal after years of state budget crises and a teacher walkout in the spring that shuttered schools for two weeks.\n\nBut many voters said they liked the fact that Stitt, the founder and former CEO of Gateway Mortgage Group, would bring a businessman\u2019s approach to the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI voted for Kevin Stitt for the sole purpose that he\u2019s a business owner, and we need someone who knows how to handle a business,\u201d said Alicia Lutz, 59, a retired housewife from the Oklahoma City enclave of Bethany. \u201cThe government is like a business, and that\u2019s why I voted for him.\u201d\n\nEdmondson, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2010, rarely mentioned Trump on the stump and focused instead on state issues like improving public schools and expanding Medicaid to cover more of the working poor.\n\nHe hoped teachers energized by the two-week walkout in the spring would give his campaign a boost and neutralize Stitt\u2019s advantage in rural parts of the state that have been trending Republican for decades.\n\n\u201cPeople are focused on the education of their children, which is where they ought to be focused,\u201d Edmondson said. \u201cThat\u2019s our future.\u201d\n\nLibertarian Chris Powell also was on the ballot in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nStitt has said he would support raising teacher salaries even more, but he also has hammered an anti-tax message and said he would have opposed the tax hike the Republican-led Legislature approved this year to raise teacher salaries.\n\nA relative unknown less than a year ago, Stitt defeated a 10-man GOP primary field that included Lt. Gov.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 Chinese authorities have begun deploying a new surveillance tool: \u201cgait recognition\u201d software that uses people\u2019s body shapes and how they walk to identify them, even when their faces are hidden from cameras.\n\nAlready used by police on the streets of Beijing and Shanghai, \u201cgait recognition\u201d is part of a push across China to develop artificial-intelligence and data-driven surveillance that is raising concern about how far the technology will go.\n\nHuang Yongzhen, the CEO of Watrix, said that its system can identify people from up to 50 meters (165 feet) away, even with their back turned or face covered. This can fill a gap in facial recognition, which needs close-up, high-resolution images of a person\u2019s face to work.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need people\u2019s cooperation for us to be able to recognize their identity,\u201d Huang said in an interview in his Beijing office. \u201cGait analysis can\u2019t be fooled by simply limping, walking with splayed feet or hunching over, because we\u2019re analyzing all the features of an entire body.\u201d\n\nWatrix announced last month that it had raised 100 million yuan ($14.5 million) to accelerate the development and sale of its gait recognition technology, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nChinese police are using facial recognition to identify people in crowds and nab jaywalkers, and are developing an integrated national system of surveillance camera data. Not everyone is comfortable with gait recognition\u2019s use.\n\nSecurity officials in China\u2019s far-western province of Xinjiang, a region whose Muslim population is already subject to intense surveillance and control, have expressed interest in the software.\n\nShi Shusi, a Chinese columnist and commentator, says it\u2019s unsurprising that the technology is catching on in China faster than the rest of the world because of Beijing\u2019s emphasis on social control.\n\n\u201cUsing biometric recognition to maintain social stability and manage society is an unstoppable trend,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great business.\u201d\n\nThe technology isn\u2019t new. Scientists in Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency have been researching gait recognition for over a decade, trying different ways to overcome skepticism that people could be recognized by the way they walk. Professors from Osaka University have worked with Japan\u2019s National Police Agency to use gait recognition software on a pilot basis since 2013.\n\nBut few have tried to commercialize gait recognition. Israel-based FST Biometrics shut down earlier this year amid company infighting after encountering technical difficulties with its products, according to former advisory board member Gabriel Tal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complex than other biometrics, computationally,\u201d said Mark Nixon, a leading expert on gait recognition at the University of Southampton in Britain. \u201cIt takes bigger computers to do gait because you need a sequence of images rather than a single image.\u201d\n\nWatrix\u2019s software extracts a person\u2019s silhouette from video and analyzes the silhouette\u2019s movement to create a model of the way the person walks. It isn\u2019t capable of identifying people in real-time yet. Users must upload video into the program, which takes about 10 minutes to search through an hour of video. It doesn\u2019t require special cameras \u2014 the software can use footage from surveillance cameras to analyze gait.\n\nHuang, a former researcher, said he left academia to co-found Watrix in 2016 after seeing how promising the technology had become. The company was incubated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Though the software isn\u2019t as good as facial recognition, Huang said its 94 percent accuracy rate is good enough for commercial use.\n\nHe envisions gait recognition being used alongside face-scanning software.\n\nBeyond surveillance, Huang says gait recognition can also be used to spot people in distress such as elderly individuals who have fallen down. Nixon believes that the technology can make life safer and more convenient.\n\n\u201cPeople still don\u2019t recognize they can be recognized by their gait, whereas everybody knows you can be recognized by your face,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cWe believe you are totally unique in the way you walk.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video producer Olivia Zhang contributed to this story.", "Oklahoma Republican Governor-Elect, Kevin Stitt, speaks to his supporters during a watch party in Oklahoma City, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

A federal judge last week rejected Goodson\u2019s effort to halt an attack ad and mailer from the group.\n\nSimilar attacks sank Goodson\u2019s bid for chief justice two years ago, and she portrayed the race as a referendum on outside group spending in judicial races.\n\nSterling ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for attorney general four years ago, and noted his membership in the National Rifle Association and the Federalist Society in campaign literature.\n\n\u201cI thought Justice Goodson did a good job of running a race and withstanding a lot of negative ads and criticism by the third party,\u201d Sterling said Tuesday night.\n\nBALLOT MEASURES\n\nProposals to raise Arkansas\u2019 minimum wage and put a voter ID requirement in the state\u2019s constitution passed, as did a casino legalization measure.\n\nThe initiative approved Tuesday would raise Arkansas\u2019 minimum wage gradually from $8.50 an hour to $11.\n\nThe voter ID measure adds the requirement to show photo identification to the list of qualifications to vote in Arkansas. Arkansas already has a voter ID law in effect that the state Supreme Court upheld last month.\n\nVoters also legalized casinos in four Arkansas counties, including at a dog track and a horse track that already offer video poker and other forms of electronic gambling.\n\nThe state Supreme Court last month disqualified two other ballot measures imposing strict term limits on lawmakers and capping damages awarded in civil lawsuits. The proposals remained on the ballot, but the state is barred from counting any votes for or against them.\n\nSOLIDLY RED ARKANSAS\n\nRepublican Gov. Asa Hutchinson won re-election and the GOP maintained control of Arkansas\u2019 partisan statewide offices, including the three that will be in charge of redrawing legislative districts after the 2020 Census.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge defeated Democratic challenger Mike Lee, a former consumer product regulator. Republican Land Commissioner John Thurston defeated Democrat Susan Inman in the race for secretary of state. Those two offices and the governor sit on the Board of Apportionment that will redraw state House and Senate districts in three years.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "FILE - In this Nov. 2, 2018 file photo, Greg Pence, Republican candidate for Indiana's 6th Congressional District, speaks at a campaign rally featuring President Donald Trump in Indianapolis.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Mike Braun\u2019s Senate victory Tuesday helped solidify Republican control of offices across Indiana on what was shaping up as a strong night for Democrats elsewhere.\n\nThe multimillionaire auto parts magnate ousted Joe Donnelly, Indiana\u2019s only Democratic statewide officeholder, and helped Republicans reinforce their control of the chamber. The race saw two campaign appearances for Braun by President Donald Trump and one for Donnelly by former President Barack Obama in the campaign\u2019s waning days.\n\nIndiana\u2019s nine U.S. House seats were also up for grabs Tuesday, but only two GOP-controlled ones were considered in play. The Republican incumbents won both of those, in southern Indiana\u2019s 9th District and northern Indiana\u2019s 2nd District.\n\nThe Republican incumbents in Indiana\u2019s three other statewide races \u2014 those for secretary of state, state auditor and treasurer \u2014 also won re-election.\n\nVoters approved a ballot measure amending the Indiana Constitution for the second time in two years. The constitutional amendment approved Tuesday obligates the General Assembly to pass balanced budgets, although the Legislature can intervene to suspend that requirement.\n\nHere are some of the key races:\n\nU.S. SENATE RACE\n\nBraun won his race against Donnelly after Hoosier voters were bombarded by weeks of advertisements touting competing claims about foreign outsourcing.\n\nAds targeting Braun, a multimillionaire auto-parts magnate, focused on his company importing the products he sells from China. Those aimed at Donnelly zeroed in on a factory in Mexico that\u2019s owned by a company Donnelly\u2019s family owns.\n\nPENCE\u2019S BROTHER\n\nGreg Pence, an older brother of Vice President Mike Pence, won the heavily Republican 6th District seat his famous sibling once held.\n\nThe 61-year-old owner of two antique malls faced Democrat Jeannine Lee Lake, who publishes a bimonthly Muncie newspaper. He had been expected to easily win the eastern Indiana seat, which was open because Republican Rep. Luke Messer ran in the GOP primary for Senate. Greg Pence is one of Mike Pence\u2019s three brothers.\n\nCOMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES\n\nRepublican Rep. Trey Hollingsworth defeated Bloomington attorney Liz Watson to win a second term in southern Indiana\u2019s 9th District. Political observers had said the race for the district that extends from the Ohio River to the south Indianapolis suburbs was competitive and could possibly change party hands if a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d reached Indiana, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nRepublican Rep. Rep. Jackie Walorski won re-election to a fourth term in northern Indiana\u2019s 2nd District, the other U.S. House race that was deemed competitive. Walorski had faced Methodist minister-turned-health care company executive Mel Hall in the South Bend-area district.\n\nAs political observers had largely expected, Republicans held onto the seven Indiana congressional seats they control, while Democrats retained the two others.\n\nLEGISLATURE\n\nHalf of the seats in the 50-member Indiana Senate and all 100 seats in the Indiana House were up for election this year. Republican supermajorities in both chambers have left Democrats largely powerless over the past six years.\n\nSeveral longtime legislators decided not to seek new terms this year. Democrats needed to add four House seats to break the current 70-30 Republican supermajority, while the GOP\u2019s 41-9 Senate margin means Democrats had to pick up at least eight seats. Democrats fell short of that goal in the Senate, but the outcome of several House races remained unclear early Wednesday.\n\nBALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\nIndiana voters approved a constitutional amendment Tuesday that obligates the General Assembly to pass balanced budgets unless supermajorities of two-thirds of the members of each chamber vote to suspend that obligation.\n\nIndiana\u2019s electorate had last voted to amend the constitution in 2016 when it approved a provision to protect the right to hunt and fish.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "Former President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate for Georgia Governor Stacey Abrams pose for a photograph with two unidentified family members after a campaign rally at Morehouse College Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Democrats, the midterm elections have been a beacon in the dark, a chance to re-emerge from the political wilderness and repudiate a president they view as a dangerous force.\n\nBut on the cusp of Tuesday\u2019s vote , many Democrats are as anxious as they are hopeful.\n\nTheir memories from 2016, when they watched in disbelief as Donald Trump defied polls, expectations and political norms, are still fresh. And as Trump travels the country armed with a divisive and racially charged closing campaign message, the test for Democrats now feels at once similar and more urgent than it did two years ago: They failed to stop Trump then, what if they fall short again?\n\n\u201cPart of what\u2019s at stake here is our ability to send a message that this is not who we are,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing 2016 campaign.\n\nThis year, history is on Democrats\u2019 side. The sitting president\u2019s party often losing ground in the first midterm after winning office, and for much of 2018, voter enthusiasm and polling has favored Democrats as well.\n\nPrimary contests filled the Democratic roster with a new generation of candidates, including several minority candidates who could make history in their races. While the fight to regain control of the Senate, largely playing out in conservative states, may prove out of reach for Democrats, the party has been buoyed by its ability to run competitively in Republican-leaning states such as Texas and Tennessee.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 focus is largely on snatching back the House and picking up governors\u2019 seats in Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere. The party is also seeking redemption in the Midwest where Trump won over white, working-class voters who had backed Democrats for years. In Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Democrats appear poised to regain ground.\n\nSuch victories would build momentum behind the party\u2019s shift toward a new generation of candidates who are younger, more diverse, with greater numbers of women and more liberal than Democratic leadership. They would also signal that Trump\u2019s hard-line positions on immigration and his penchant for personal attacks turn off more voters than they energize.\n\nA good night for Democrats on Tuesday would provide a blueprint for how the party can successfully run against Trump in the 2020 presidential race. At least two dozen Democrats are waiting in the wings, eager to take Trump.\n\nBut the president has proved once again to be a powerful political force late in a campaign.\n\nEven with his daily airing of grievances on Twitter and an approval rate below the average for his recent predecessors at this point, he has almost single-handedly put Republicans in a stronger position this fall. He\u2019s aggressively appealed to his loyal, core supporters with a sharply anti-immigrant, nationalist message and by casting Democrats as outside the mainstream.\n\n\u201cA vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to really put extreme far left politicians in charge of Congress and to destroy your jobs, slash your incomes, undermine your safety and put illegal aliens before American citizens,\u201d Trump said during a rally Saturday in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nIf Republicans hang on to control of Congress, Trump will almost certainly be emboldened. Democrats would be left with difficult questions about a path forward.\n\nFor example, how can Democrats assemble a winning coalition in 2020 if they fail to appeal to the moderate suburban voters who hold sway in the congressional districts that decide which party holds a House majority? And how will Democrats, if they fall short, sustain the energy from young people and women who have marched in protest of Trump, registered to vote and volunteered for the first time this election season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the election is not what we hoped for that people will say, \u2018it\u2019s too hard\u2019 and become disengaged,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as Clinton\u2019s communications director during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAs Americans participated in early voting this weekend, that same anxiety was palpable among some voters.\n\nIn Southern California, lifelong Democrat Theresa Hunter said she didn\u2019t take Trump seriously in 2016. But she sees a chance for Democrats to render their judgment on the president by pushing his party out of power in a different branch of government.\n\n\u201cTo see his party jump on board and march in lockstep is what\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Hunter, a 65-year-old retired salesperson from Lake Forest, California.\n\nA few hours north, California voter Lawrence Reh was casting his ballot. Afterward, his voice quivered and he wiped back tears as he voiced frustrations about Trump and his worries about the direction of the country.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make any progress in this election, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll go from here,\u201d Reh said.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for The Associated Press since 2007.

Donnelly faces Republican Mike Braun in the US Senate race. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Republican Mike Braun, a multimillionaire businessman who campaigned as a political outsider, ousted Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly on Tuesday after a race in which both tried to appeal to Donald Trump supporters.\n\nIt\u2019s a victory few would have predicted last year when Braun, a two-term state lawmaker, announced he would run in the GOP primary against two congressmen.\n\nBut by leveraging his own fortune to loan his campaign more than $10 million, he was able to deluge his Republican rivals under a wave of TV advertisements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been animated by the belief that Hoosiers deserved better than the representation we\u2019ve received from politicians in Washington, that people who have built their lives in the real world of business could create better lives for Hoosiers and Americans,\u201d Braun said. \u201cThe theme of my campaign is that we need to take to Washington what works in the real world.\u201d\n\nTrump won Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s home state, two years ago by 19 points and was personally invested in Braun\u2019s race, campaigning aggressively against Donnelly, who he called \u201cSleepin\u2019 Joe.\u201d\n\nEver since Trump\u2019s victory, Donnelly tried to walk a delicate line, celebrating areas where he agreed with the president while promising he also wouldn\u2019t be a rubber stamp. Rarely did he mention that he\u2019s a Democrat.\n\nBut as the race tightened, he also adopted some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, angering members of his own party by attacking socialists and the \u201cradical left,\u201d while calling for a border wall with Mexico.\n\nIn his concession statement, Donnelly said he was honored to serve the state.\n\n\u201cIt has been one of the greatest honors of my life to represent Indiana in the Senate,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cI wish Mike the best, and I hope he makes every single Hoosier proud as our senator.\u201d\n\nDonnelly had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly won in 2012 after his opponent Richard Mourdock made incendiary comments about abortion and rape.\n\nRepublicans say the first-term senator talked a good game with his pro-Trump message. But they argued he was against Trump when it counted, noting he opposed the GOP-led tax cut, legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cCareer politicians like Joe Donnelly will say anything to keep their jobs,\u201d Braun said in one of his final campaign ads.\n\nMark Allan, 50, is a truck driver from Indianapolis who voted for Braun. He likes the way Trump is leading the country, particularly when it comes to immigration and foreign policy, and wanted to cast a ballot for someone who will vote for the president\u2019s priorities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with Donnelly, but he\u2019s been on both sides of the fence,\u201d Allan said. \u201cWe need to keep the Senate Republican to support the agenda of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of the race offers a strong indicator of where Indiana is headed politically. The state formerly elected conservative Democrats as governor and in significant number to Congress. But after voting in 2008 for former President Barack Obama, who campaigned for Donnelly Sunday in Gary, Indiana has swung to the right.\n\nOn Tuesday, it shifted in that direction even further.\n\nJust look at Braun\u2019s own political background. Although insisting he\u2019s a lifelong Republican, Braun voted in Democratic primaries for years, before switching over to the GOP before he was elected to his first of two legislative terms in the Indiana House.\n\nBraun, who is worth somewhere between $37 million and $95 million, says Trump\u2019s success inspired him to run. On Tuesday he won after adopting a similar outsider businessman template.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t need this. I didn\u2019t need it either, by the way,\u201d Trump said at a rally for Braun near Indianapolis last week. \u201cBut we\u2019re having fun. You know why? We\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "", "", "Los Angeles Kings interim coach Willie Desjardins reacts to a question from reporters after his first practice with his new team on Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Los Angeles.

(AP) \u2014 Willie Desjardins realizes the Los Angeles Kings have more than enough time to turn around their dismal start to the season.\n\nThe interim head coach still wants his Kings to play as if their season and their jobs are on the line in early November.\n\nDesjardins ran an energetic practice Monday to begin his tenure with the Kings, who fired John Stevens and assistant coach Don Nachbaur on Sunday in a shakeup of the struggling club. Desjardins didn\u2019t promise any magic solutions to the Kings\u2019 woes, but he plans to impress urgency upon his new players.\n\n\u201cI think the theme we had was that we can\u2019t wait,\u201d Desjardins said. \u201cYou only have so many years that you have a chance to win, and you\u2019ve got to win now. The easy road would be to say that we can\u2019t do it this season. You can\u2019t afford to waste a season, because you never know what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s the same with me. I didn\u2019t know if I would get another shot at the NHL, so this is my chance. I\u2019ve got to make it work, and that\u2019s the same message to the players.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to make this season work. What exactly it is, we\u2019ve got to find out.\u201d\n\nDesjardins didn\u2019t land his first NHL head coaching job until he was 57 years old, leading the Vancouver Canucks from 2014-17. After taking the young Canadian national team to Olympic bronze medals last February, he returned home to Medicine Hat, Alberta, and started a hockey school.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Blake abruptly called him last week with the chance to take over the struggling Kings, who haven\u2019t returned to the heights they reached during their Stanley Cup championship seasons in 2012 and 2014. Los Angeles still has a wealth of top-end NHL players, including defenseman Drew Doughty, captain Anze Kopitar, forward Jeff Carter and goalie Jonathan Quick, who is injured.\n\nAfter the Canucks fired him, Desjardins didn\u2019t want to return to the NHL as an assistant coach. He was thrilled to get another chance to be a head coach with a team possessing as much talent as the Kings \u2014 even if his current contract only lasts until the end of this season.\n\n\u201cComing in here, it\u2019s a great situation,\u201d Desjardins said. \u201cI think there\u2019s lots to work with. Sometimes you have situations where you don\u2019t have much of a chance to be successful. They\u2019ve got a lot of good pieces here. There\u2019s some really quality people within this team, some high-end guys.\u201d\n\nThe Kings are in a funk at 4-8-1 heading into their Freeway Faceoff showdown with the Anaheim Ducks on Tuesday night. Desjardins said he can\u2019t immediately shake up the Kings\u2019 playing style, so he will lean on assistant coach Dave Lowry as he attempts to get better results from the same players and largely the same schemes used under Stevens for now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, because one of the big things you need from players and coaches, you\u2019ve got to have some trust,\u201d Desjardins said. \u201cAnd trust is gained over time, but we don\u2019t have time for that. You\u2019ve got to trust each other right now. That\u2019s harder to do, but we\u2019ve got to do it.\u201d\n\nBlake sharply criticized his players\u2019 competitiveness and determination while firing Stevens. The veteran Kings didn\u2019t disagree with their boss after their first workout under Desjardins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather apparent that you can\u2019t be successful in this league, or in life in general, if you don\u2019t have the emotion and the passion,\u201d Kings defenseman Alec Martinez said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned this week.\u201d\n\nCarter was particularly dismayed by the players\u2019 role in the departure of Stevens, who also was his coach in Philadelphia before Stevens was fired during the 2008-09 season.\n\n\u201cI think the world of him,\u201d Carter said of Stevens. \u201cA lot of guys in here do. I guess that needs to be a big wakeup call for everybody in this room that we need to get our act together. We haven\u2019t played good enough hockey, that\u2019s the bottom line. It\u2019s compete. It\u2019s energy. It\u2019s everybody doing their job.\u201d\n\nDesjardins doesn\u2019t expect to fix everything quickly, but he has the winter to work on it. His family is staying in Alberta for now, so Desjardins plans to devote pretty much every waking hour to his work \u2014 and there is plenty to work on.\n\nThe Kings are the NHL\u2019s lowest-scoring team with 28 goals in their 13 games, with meager shot creation and an inconsistent power play. They\u2019re also not playing up their traditional defensive standards, allowing 45 goals after finishing last season as the NHL\u2019s stingiest team.\n\n\u201cIt means we\u2019re not getting the job done, and that\u2019s the disappointing part,\u201d Los Angeles defenseman Dion Phaneuf said. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s on us as players. When a change is made, it\u2019s not about the coaching staff.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) \u2014 The Seattle Seahawks figured out just how easy it is to get off track.\n\nAfter successfully resetting its roster and figuring out a style and method for winning in the first half of the season, Seattle took a major step backward in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Seahawks had built a winning formula on running the ball, avoiding mistakes on offense and stopping the run on defense. Now, Seattle has to prove it can beat a quality opponent when the script doesn\u2019t play out perfectly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found ourselves in most of the games we didn\u2019t win right there at the end, so close to getting it done,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the second half of the season will allow us to finish those games and get the wins that we want and turn this season into a really positive year for us.\u201d\n\nThe 25-17 loss to the Chargers revealed how quickly the Seahawks can lose the style of play that led them to win four of the previous five games. They sit at 4-4, facing a challenging three-game stretch that starts this week with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at this like it\u2019s a rebuilding year. (GM) John (Schneider) and I didn\u2019t look at this like that. We saw the opportunities to fill the spots and we thought we could keep moving and going,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some growing time and we saw that the first two weeks of the season. As far as expectations, our expectations are higher and that\u2019s why we\u2019re disappointed that we\u2019re not in better shape than we are right now.\u201d\n\nSeattle still had a chance to force overtime against the Chargers until Russell Wilson\u2019s pass for David Moore at the back of the end zone was tipped slightly and fell incomplete on the final play.\n\nThe Seahawks issues started long before that pass hit the turf.\n\nSeattle did not stop the run, giving up 7.3 yards per carry to the Chargers and letting Melvin Gordon run for 113 yards and a touchdown.\n\nIt did not avoid offensive mistakes. Wilson was sacked four times, with several of those his fault for not getting the ball out or trusting the protection. He also made a critical turnover, throwing an interception that was returned 42 yards for a touchdown by Desmond King in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd Seattle\u2019s own run game was spotty. The Seahawks finished with 154 yards rushing, but starter Chris Carson didn\u2019t play the final 2 \u00bd quarters due to a lingering hip injury. After scoring a touchdown on their opening possession, the Seahawks got just three points out of the next nine drives.\n\nThe end result was too much reliance on Wilson for a fourth-quarter rally. While Wilson nearly pulled it off, the Seahawks fell to 5-6 at home over the past two seasons and have lost the last five games when Wilson has attempted 30 or more passes dating to last season.\n\nCarroll was uncertain the status of Carson or strong safety Bradley McDougald for Sunday\u2019s game against the NFC West-leading Rams. Carroll said Carson\u2019s hip was a lingering problem coming out of last week\u2019s victory over Detroit, and a light week of practice wasn\u2019t enough for Carson to handle the load early against the Chargers. Carson had just eight carries, leaving Mike Davis as the primary back. Davis had 15 carries for 62 yards.\n\nMcDougald didn\u2019t play in the second half with a knee injury that Carroll said was \u201cpretty sore\u201d on Monday. McDougald will likely be a very limited participant in practice this week, but Carroll said he was pleased with the performance of backup Delano Hill stepping in for McDougald, who has been one of Seattle\u2019s top defensive players this season.\n\nNOTES: Carroll said G D.J. Fluker (calf) appeared to be OK. Fluker didn\u2019t play late in the game due to the injury and was replaced by C Joey Hunt playing out of position. ... Carroll declined to comment on any speculation about a reunion with DE/LB Bruce Irvin, who was released by Oakland. Irvin spent his first four seasons in Seattle and the Seahawks could use a boost in the pass rush. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to comment on that right now if you don\u2019t mind.

We\u2019re not playing to the level we need to play in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIn the final seven minutes of last week\u2019s 29-27 loss at the Los Angeles Rams, the Packers failed to extend a 27-26 lead, had a bad punt, gave up the go-ahead field goal and fumbled the ensuing kickoff.\n\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter against the Patriots, the Packers were driving into scoring position when running back Aaron Jones fumbled.\n\nThe Patriots used a pass from receiver Julian Edelman to running back James White to set up the go-ahead touchdown, forced the Packers to punt, then added an insurance touchdown.\n\nNot only did the Packers lose the game, but they lost ground in the NFC North to Chicago (5-3), which routed Buffalo for its second consecutive win, and Minnesota (5-3-1), which beat Detroit for its fourth win in five games.\n\nAfter hosting Miami (5-4), Green Bay goes back on the road to face Seattle (4-4) and Minnesota.\n\n\u201cThe games in November are really where teams historically start to separate one way or the other,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cOur focus is really on our self-scout and things we\u2019ve been working on. The last two weeks, we\u2019re not finishing games.\u201d\n\nThe problems run across all three phases. Defensively, the Packers have failed to get a takeaway the past two weeks.\n\nOn special teams, there was Ty Montgomery\u2019s fumble on the kickoff return against the Rams and two penalties against the Patriots.\n\nOn offense, Green Bay has run a total of 22 plays in the fourth quarter the past two weeks. Against the Patriots, the fourth quarter started with a fumble, continued with a three-and-out and ended with a fourth-down failure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not hitting on all cylinders,\u201d quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019re hurting ourselves with negative-yardage plays and missed throws and turnovers at the wrong time and not being on the same page too many times, whether I\u2019m missing a throw or we\u2019re not in the spot I think we\u2019re going to be at, it\u2019s happening in the worst times. When we have to play our best in those crunch times, we haven\u2019t been playing our best.\u201d\n\nTo get on track, the Packers are going to have to play through some injuries. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga (knee), safety Kentrell Brice (knee), cornerback Kevin King (hamstring) and linebacker Blake Martinez (ankle) were knocked out of the game by injuries.\n\nMartinez, who was injured when he stepped on the ankle of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, returned for the final couple of series.\n\n\u201cI pride myself on being a tough guy and I didn\u2019t want to leave my team,\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\u201cI knew if I could run straight and do certain things, I could go out there and finish the game.\u201d\n\nAccording to McCarthy, King will be \u201chard pressed\u201d to be ready to face the Dolphins. Bulaga, who\u2019s suffered major injuries to both knees, avoided a significant injury and could be back for Sunday. Receiver Geronimo Allison might need surgery after suffering a groin injury at Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

(AP) \u2014 Two condemned multiple murderers, including a serial killer, apparently committed suicide within hours of each other on the nation\u2019s largest death row, California officials said Monday.\n\nCorrections officials said they found Andrew Urdiales, 54, unresponsive during a security check at San Quentin State Prison late Friday.\n\nHe was sentenced to death on Oct. 5 by an Orange County judge for killing five women in California, and previously faced the death penalty for three murders in Illinois.\n\nThe California victims were Robbin Brandley, 23, in January 1986 in Mission Viejo; Maryann Wells, 31, in September 1988 in San Diego; Julie McGhee, 29, in July 1988 in Cathedral City; Tammie Erwin, 20, in April 1989 in Palm Springs; and Denise Maney, 32, in March 1995 in Palm Springs. The murders occurred while he was stationed at various U.S. Marine Corps facilities in Southern California.\n\nHe previously was convicted of killing Cassie Corum, 21, and Lori Uylaki, 25, both from Hammond, Illinois; and Lynn Huber, 22, of Chicago, in the mid-1990s. Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan commuted his sentence to life in prison in 2002 for two murders, and his third sentence was also commuted when Illinois banned the death penalty.\n\nHe had been on California\u2019s death row since Oct. 12.\n\nSeparately, authorities say they found Virendra Govin, 51, unresponsive alone in his cell in a different death row housing unit late Sunday.\n\nGovin was sentenced in December 2004 for committing four Los Angeles County murders.\n\nThe victims were Gita Kumar, 42; Plara Kumar, 18: Tulsi Kumar, 16; and Sitaben Patel, 63.

The bad ones were splattered all over the game tape.\n\nOn Monday night, the Lions fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano.\n\n\u201cI spoke to Joe and informed him of my decision to relieve him of his responsibilities with our team,\u201d Patricia said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate Joe\u2019s leadership of our special teams units over the last three and a half seasons and have great respect for his many years of service as a coach in the National Football League. On behalf of our team and the entire coaching staff, I want to personally thank Joe for his commitment to the Detroit Lions and wish him and his family the best moving forward.\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s team has been in reverse lately.\n\nThe Vikings (5-3-1) limited Detroit to a season-low 209 yards as the Lions (3-5) lost their second straight.

We need learn from this.\u201d\n\nDetroit was held to single digits in points for the first time since a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016. The Lions put together just two drives of more than 30 yards and were 4 for 15 on third downs.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is as the season goes on and you have some success in certain areas, teams are going to gear up to try and stop those things that you do, and you\u2019re going to have to do it differently,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to handle those changes better than what we\u2019re doing right now.\u201d\n\nAnd on the other side, the Lions have allowed a run play of 40 or more yards in five games this season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had weeks where we feel we didn\u2019t necessarily perform on the one day of the week where we have to perform well,\u201d Patricia said.\n\nAs he readies his team for another division road game Sunday at against the NFC North-leading Chicago Bears (5-3), Patricia is convinced that player for player, his team matches up equally with every other team in the division.\n\n\u201cI think we have a lot of good players on this team, I really do,\u201d Patricia said.\n\nPatricia said talent isn\u2019t the issue bringing down his team.\n\n\u201cI would say with both offensive and defensive lines, the point of emphasis is fundamentals,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cSome of our fundamentals got out of whack. Some of our techniques weren\u2019t necessarily where it needs to be on a consistent basis.\n\n\u201cFundamentals and execution is what\u2019s holding us back now. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve got to start.\u201d\n\nThe problem he faces is that with the majority of practice time each week dedicated to game-planning, Patricia will be hard-pressed to find time to go back to basics with his team.\n\nAfter a 1-3 start, the Lions won two straight and looked to have righted their season. But these past two losses have them struggling again.\n\n\u201cAs a team, we need to get better,\u201d receiver Marvin Jones said. \u201cIt is definitely disappointing, but at the same time, we just have to go out there and execute. We cannot shoot ourselves in the foot. I think we definitely did that and we just have to get better.\u201d\n\nLions offensive lineman Frank Ragnow perhaps summed up the state of the team as they reached the midseason point.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not taking a step forward in this league, then you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Ragnow said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Click to copy\n\nClick to copy https://apnews.com/90005e79e8ae4af2ad2b095797f49154", "Police: Man tried robbing aspiring wrestler, got taken down\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn.

Cashman is a man with money to spend this offseason.\n\n\u201cYeah, we got under the tax, but we\u2019re one of the higher payrolls in the game, as you would expect \u2014 and as it should be,\u201d he said.\n\nCashman made his first move last week, re-signing 35-year-old outfielder Brett Gardner to a $7.5 million, one-year deal after declining his $12.5 million option and paying a $2 million buyout.\n\nNew York finished with a rotation of right-handers Luis Severino, Masahiro Tanaka and Lance Lynn along with left-handers Sabathia and Happ.\n\nOnly Severino and Tanaka are due back, and Cashman is expected to pursue a group of free-agent pitchers that also include left-handers Patrick Corbin and Dallas Keuchel.\n\nSabathia took a cut in salary from $25 million in 2017 to $10 million this year and went 9-7 with a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts \u2014 missing a $500,000 bonus by two innings when he was ejected in his last regular-season start for hitting Tampa Bay\u2019s Jesus Sucre after Rays pitcher Andrew Kittredge threw up-and-in to Austin Romine.\n\nSabathia had surgery on his right knee last month.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a great Yankee, and he has time on the clock still,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cI think he\u2019d like to stay, and I think we\u2019d like to keep him.\u201d\n\nHapp, 36, was 7-0 with a 2.69 ERA in 11 starts after the Yankees acquired him from Toronto, but he lost at Boston in the Division Series opener.\n\n\u201cI would think that there\u2019ll be a lot of interest in him,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cHe has a great reputation throughout the game as a pro, and the performance level was exactly what we needed. So he put himself in a good position as a free agent.\u201d\n\nCashman already is deep in talks to trade Sonny Gray, just 15-16 since New York acquired him from Oakland in July 2017. Gray, a right-hander who turns 29 this week, was unhappy with the harsh treatment he was given by demanding Yankees fans.\n\n\u201cThe game\u2019s evolved to the point where people can see what the real numbers are behind the numbers and the recognition that whoever winds up acquiring Sonny Gray is going to acquire someone that\u2019s going to be the player, the pitcher he was more with Oakland,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re very active in those discussions. We\u2019re in name exchanges. It will lead us eventually to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nCashman sidestepped questions about infielder Manny Machado, one of the top two offensive free agents along with Bryce Harper. Because shortstop Didi Gregorius will miss much of next season after surgery to repair a torn elbow ligament, Cashman is examining infield options within and outside.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the price point,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Cleveland Browns running back Duke Johnson (29) breaks free from Kansas City Chiefs strong safety Jordan Lucas (24) for a 19-yard touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Cleveland. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Duke Johnson wore a backpack on Monday that seemed symbolic.\n\nThe Browns finally asked him to carry a larger load.\n\nOf the handful of positives to emerge from Sunday\u2019s 37-21 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, capping another stormy week of change and uncertainty in Cleveland, Johnson\u2019s two-touchdown performance was at the top of the list.\n\nAfter being overlooked \u2014 some would argue misused \u2014 for much of the season, Johnson was the primary focus of the Browns\u2019 offensive game plan. He finished with nine catches for 78 yards, added one rush for eight and drew extra attention from Kansas City\u2019s defense, which allowed his teammates to make plays.\n\nJohnson was hesitant to say it, but Cleveland\u2019s change at offensive coordinator, with running backs coach Freddie Kitchens replacing the fired Todd Haley, made a difference.\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d Johnson said sheepishly when asked if the Kitchens-for-Haley swap was the reason for his rise in production. \u201cI guess you could look at it that way. Again, it\u2019s the same plays we\u2019ve been calling, the same offense. There\u2019s just certain things that coach Kitchens likes better than coach Haley did.\u201d\n\nBefore Sunday, Johnson\u2019s season-high was four catches and there were times when he wasn\u2019t on the field at all. What made that even more perplexing was that Johnson led the Browns (2-6-1) with 74 catches for 693 yards last season and developed into one of the NFL\u2019s best dual-threat backs.\n\nBut with Haley concerned about getting touches for running backs Nick Chubb and Carlos Hyde, who was recently traded to Jacksonville, Johnson became the odd-man out.\n\nA proven playmaker not getting a chance to make plays.\n\nJohnson was targeted by rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield against the Chiefs, and he hopes to get even more opportunities as the season progresses.\n\n\u201cI think it is possible,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJust going out there and showing what I\u2019m capable of doing, especially showing the reason why I\u2019m here. It was a great showing for myself, but not so much for the team and we\u2019re about team here. We should have gotten the win, that\u2019s most important.\u201d\n\nFollowing his first game since being chosen Hue Jackson\u2019s interim replacement, defensive coordinator/head coach Gregg Williams said Johnson\u2019s breakout was caused by a combination of things, including Kitchens and Mayfield working together for the first time.\n\n\u201cFreddie did a good job and Baker, too,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBaker\u2019s understanding of that from the read process \u2014 when a play is called as a quarterback, you don\u2019t automatically know it is going to go to that person. There is a read definition that takes you to that person, but from Baker and Freddie, they did a good job with that.\n\n\u201cIt was good to see that with Duke. Just like what we have talked about with other people, I think he can do more and he will. He had a good fire about him, and he will continue to improve too. We need him to improve.\u201d\n\nGetting Johnson more involved didn\u2019t result in a win for the Browns, but it was a small step toward improvement.\n\nCleveland matched a season-low with only four penalties, and Williams, who decided early on he was going to be aggressive, liked that his offense converted three times on fourth down.\n\nThe Browns couldn\u2019t keep up with Kansas City\u2019s high-speed, high-scoring offense, but Johnson was impressed with the team\u2019s character in the aftermath of Jackson and Haley\u2019s firings.\n\n\u201cI never saw them blink,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, two, scores down or whatever, we were always in a position to continue to fight. I never saw them blink. That is good. That is what we are supposed to do as professionals. Young team, old team, I do not care \u2014 that was good. There was a lot of positive that way. Defensively, we have to play better.\u201d\n\nAnother bright spot was left tackle Greg Robinson. The 2014 No. 2 overall pick made his first start for Cleveland filling in for Desmond Harrison, who was out with an unspecified illness. Robinson not only protected Mayfield\u2019s blind side, but handled all his other duties.\n\n\u201cHe played well, didn\u2019t he?\u201d said Williams, who was on the Rams\u2019 staff when they selected Williams. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him develop as a young guy. I\u2019ve seen him have his battles, ups and downs, and it\u2019s been good.\u201d\n\nFollowing the game, Mayfield singled out Robinson, who was grateful for the QB\u2019s praise.\n\n\u201cIt felt good to just get out there with the boys, taking it to the game field rather than just practicing,\u201d said Robinson, signed by the Browns in June. \u201cIt was encouraging and I\u2019m really happy that he spoke well about me.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Williams did not have updates on rookie CB Denzel Ward (hip), CB E.J. Gaines (concussion) or LB Christian Kirksey (hamstring), all injured Sunday. Williams reiterated his decision to sit DB Damarious Randall (groin) was so he can be healthy for multiple games and not just one.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the trial of Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo (all times local):\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nThe first day of jury selection has wrapped up in the New York trial of the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo.\n\nPotential jurors were quizzed Monday about their attitudes on drug trafficking and how much attention they have paid to news reports about Joaquin Guzman (wah-KEEN\u2019 gooz-MAHN\u2019).\n\nGuzman has pleaded not guilty to overseeing a multibillion-dollar drug operation and a ruthless campaign of murders and kidnappings of his rivals.

(AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Chargers have won five straight to improve to 6-2 at midseason for the first time in 12 years. With the next three games against teams with losing records, the one thing coach Anthony Lynn isn\u2019t worried about is complacency.\n\n\u201cThis group has an understanding that we start over every week. We refocus and regroup,\u201d Lynn said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to work on Wednesday like we hadn\u2019t done anything. I like this group\u2019s ability to stay in the present.\u201d\n\nThe Chargers\u2019 next three opponents have a combined record of 6-19. Los Angeles travels to Oakland (1-7) on Sunday before hosting Denver (3-6) and Arizona (2-6). After that, the slate gets more challenging with a road game against Pittsburgh, hosting Cincinnati and a Thursday night game at Kansas City, who beat the Chargers in Week 1.\n\nHistory, though, bodes well for teams that get off to fast starts. Of the 124 teams that started 6-2 since the current postseason format started in 1990, only 21 haven\u2019t made the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe have put ourselves in good position to maybe make the tournament at the end of the season but we still have to finish,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nLynn\u2019s squad continues to have momentum on both sides of the ball. Running back Melvin Gordon has rushed for 100 yards in three of his last four games with five touchdowns while wide receiver Tyrell Williams has four TDs in the past three games.\n\nOn defense, the Chargers have 14 sacks in their past four games despite defensive end Joey Bosa not playing a down yet this season due to a foot injury. The unit has also come up big in the last two games as it denied Tennessee from making a game-winning, two-point conversion and forced a Russell Wilson incompletion in the end zone on the final play at Seattle.\n\nDefensive end Isaac Rochelle said those plays can be frustrating late in games, but something they need to go through.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial for our defense and our team to be in those situations and deal with it now, especially when you come out with the win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt says a lot about us. Our defense held up two weeks in a row.\u201d\n\nAbout the only thing that hasn\u2019t gone well is the kicking game. The Chargers released Caleb Sturgis on Monday after he missed two extra points and a field goal against Seattle. The six-year veteran\u2014 who was 9 of 15 this season on extra points and 9 of 13 on field goals \u2014 is the first kicker since the Raiders\u2019 Jim Breech in 1979 to miss a PAT and field goal in three straight games.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we gave him a fair shot, stayed with him as long as we could and it came down to performance,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nMichael Badgley has been promoted from the practice squad. He made all three of his field goals and seven extra points in two games when Sturgis could not play due to a quadriceps injury. The Chargers have been the Bermuda Triangle for kickers as Badgley is the team\u2019s sixth placekicker since the start of last season.\n\nLos Angeles lost its first four games to start last season but is 15-5 since, which is the third-best mark in the AFC (New England is 18-3 and Pittsburgh is 15-4-1). Williams said the emphasis since the beginning of the season has been on getting out to a fast start but now they have to sustain it.\n\n\u201cGoing to another tough place and getting a win just keeps adding and building on how we play,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy", "ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Dallas Cowboys defensive end Randy Gregory is out against Tennessee after having arthroscopic knee surgery before the open week, and Titans safety Kenny Vaccaro is active after missing three games with a dislocated elbow.\n\nTennessee linebacker Will Compton won\u2019t play after being added to the injury report with a hamstring issue Saturday.\n\nGregory will be joined on the sideline by defensive lineman David Irving, who sprained an ankle in practice during the week.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Le\u2019Veon Bell might be ready to head back to work. The Pittsburgh Steelers don\u2019t exactly look like they need him.\n\nThe star running back tweeted \u201cFarewell Miami\u201d on Monday, possibly indicating the end of his months-long standoff with the club. Bell hasn\u2019t been inside the Pittsburgh locker room since last January, opting to stay away rather than sign his one-year franchise tender. The two-time All-Pro has sacrificed half of the $14.4 million he\u2019s due this season but needs to report by Nov. 13 to make sure he accrues enough service time to reach free agency in March.\n\nBell\u2019s extended absence initially created a furor inside the locker room. Now, it seems almost like an afterthought. The Steelers (5-2-1) have ripped off four straight victories heading into Thursday night\u2019s visit from Carolina (6-2), relying heavily on James Conner \u2014 Bell\u2019s replacement \u2014 to surge into the lead in the AFC North.\n\nConner topped 100 yards rushing for a fourth straight week during a 23-16 victory over Baltimore on Sunday, and caught his first career touchdown pass when he took a short flip from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and bulled past Baltimore safety Eric Weddle at the pylon.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s showing that no challenge is too big for him, against the No. 1 defense or whoever it might be,\u201d Steelers left tackle Alejandro Villanueva said of Conner. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re so close to him, and he lowers his shoulder, and you see him get a couple yards, it\u2019s extremely motivating.\u201d\n\nConner is second in the league in all-purpose yards and touches behind Los Angeles Rams standout Todd Gurley and tied for fourth in total touchdowns. The second-year back hardly seems bothered by the heavy workload, saying he\u2019s built for it. So does his coach.\n\n\u201cI agree with James,\u201d Mike Tomlin said Monday when asked about Conner\u2019s personal assessment.\n\nTomlin smiled as he answered, mirroring the considerably lighter mood around his team these days. The problems that plagued the Steelers during September have vanished, though Tomlin is reticent to point to any one area where his team has improved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to look for specific areas, I just try to challenge these guys to get better every day,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. I think that if we do that daily that will give us a chance to produce consistent performances that are on the rise. Not only in the second quarter (of the season) but as we continue through this journey.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern that\u2019s become well established during Tomlin\u2019s 12 years on the job. The Steelers have been traditionally slow starters under his watch, then get it together as the days grow shorter.\n\nPittsburgh hasn\u2019t allowed more than 21 points during its four-game run and the secondary that was torched regularly in the opening month has settled in. Coty Sensabaugh has taken over for Artie Burns at the cornerback spot opposite Joe Haden and rookie safety Terrell Edmunds has filled in capably while veteran Morgan Burnett heals from a series of injuries that have slowed him since training camp.\n\nThe Steelers aren\u2019t exactly overwhelming opponents but considering the firepower on offense, overwhelming teams isn\u2019t required. Pittsburgh gave up at least 327 yards in each of its first four games. The Steelers haven\u2019t surrendered more than 324 yards over their last four.\n\n\u201cOur defense is working in the right direction,\u201d safety Sean Davis said. \u201cWe held the Ravens to 16 points ... and I feel like we\u2019re putting together winning performances. As long as the defense continues to do that, and with our offense playing the way they\u2019re playing, we\u2019re just going to continue riding the roller coaster. Our trajectory is high.\u201d\n\nConsiderably higher than it appeared while getting repeatedly torched during the opening month. Yet the job is still only halfway done. The schedule remains daunting. If Bell \u2014 whenever he shows up \u2014 can return to at least some semblance of the form that made him an All-Pro last season, Pittsburgh could be a tough out. If he can\u2019t, they like their chances anyway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going to be a long ride,\u201d linebacker Bud Dupree said. \u201cIt was great that we got the win to get on top of the division again. We\u2019ve got another game against the Bengals. We just need to be sure to dominate everywhere.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "NEWARK, N.J.

The winners will be announced next week.\n\nOhtani figures to be in a tight race with Yankees infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres after a historic first season with the Los Angeles Angels. The two-way Japanese sensation was 4-2 with a 3.31 ERA as a starting pitcher before an elbow injury forced him off the mound. He finished out the season exclusively as a designated hitter, hitting .285 with 22 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\nOhtani is the first player ever to hit 15 home runs and strike out 50 batters in a season, and he joined Babe Ruth as the only players ever to hit 15 homers and pitch 50 innings. He had Tommy John surgery after the season and is not expected to pitch in 2019.\n\nAndujar hit 47 doubles, tied for the second-most by a rookie in major league history, while Torres had 24 homers and 77 RBIs as a 21-year-old. They are the first teammates to finish top three in Rookie of the Year voting since Wil Myers and Chris Archer with Tampa Bay in 2013.\n\nThe World Series champion Boston Red Sox might be in line for more hardware. Mookie Betts is a finalist for AL MVP, and Alex Cora is in the final three for AL Manager of the Year in his first season. Betts led the majors with a .346 average and .640 slugging percentage while setting career highs with 32 homers and a 1.078 OPS.\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 Mike Trout and Cleveland\u2019s Jose Ramirez are also finalists for AL MVP. Trout has finished in the top two in AL MVP voting in five of the past six seasons after finishing fourth in 2017. Ramirez was third in the voting last year, when Houston\u2019s Jose Altuve beat out Yankees slugger Aaron Judge.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s Christian Yelich is the favorite for NL MVP, and Colorado\u2019s Nolan Arenado and Chicago\u2019s Javier Baez also were revealed as top vote-getters. Yelich emerged from a crowded field by hitting .370 with 10 homers and a 1.313 OPS in September while the Brewers topped the Cubs for the NL Central title.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 Jacob deGrom, Washington\u2019s Max Scherzer and Philadelphia\u2019s Aaron Nola are the top three for the NL Cy Young Award, with deGrom favored to win for the first time despite a 10-9 record. Felix Hernandez had 13 victories when he won the 2010 AL Cy Young, the fewest wins ever by a starting pitcher to win the award. Scherzer is a three-time winner, including the past two NL awards.\n\nCorey Kluber has a shot at a second straight AL Cy Young Award and third overall. The Cleveland right-hander is up against Tampa Bay\u2019s Blake Snell and Houston\u2019s Justin Verlander, who won the AL Cy Young and MVP Awards in 2011.\n\nCora is up against Tampa Bay\u2019s Kevin Cash and Oakland\u2019s Bob Melvin. Cash oversaw the Rays\u2019 successful experiment with using relief pitchers as \u201copeners\u201d to begin games, a trend that others \u2014 including Melvin \u2014 adopted later in the season. Melvin led Oakland as it charged back into the AL playoff picture and earned a spot in the wild-card game.\n\nMilwaukee\u2019s Craig Counsell, Colorado\u2019s Bud Black and Atlanta\u2019s Brian Snitker were named NL Manager of the Year candidates, while Atlanta\u2019s Ronald Acuna Jr., Washington\u2019s Juan Soto and Los Angeles\u2019 Walker Buehler are the top three for NL Rookie of the Year.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"]
