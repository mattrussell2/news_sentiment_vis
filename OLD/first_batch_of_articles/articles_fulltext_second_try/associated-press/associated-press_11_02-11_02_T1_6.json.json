NYCFC advanced from the knockout round with a 3-1 win over Philadelphia on Wednesday.\n\nAtlanta was in the race for the Supporters\u2019 Shield up to the final day of the regular season, but fell short after losing 4-1 at Toronto. Still, slowing down Atlanta\u2019s scoring machine and the duo of Josef Martinez and Miguel Almiron will be a challenging prospect for NYCFC. Martinez won the Golden Boot with a league-record 31 goals, while Almiron had 14 assists and was just as important in making Atlanta\u2019s attack so dangerous.\n\nNYCFC got one goal from David Villa in the win over Philadelphia but needs to continue getting contributions from Maxi Moralez and Ismael Tajouri-Shradi, who also scored against the Union.\n\nThe two regular-season matchups between the sides ended in ties. They played a 2-2 draw in Atlanta in April and finished 1-1 at Yankee Stadium in early June.\n\n1. NEW YORK RED BULLS vs. (5) COLUMBUS CREW\n\nThe winners of the Supporter\u2019 Shield will face the feel-good story of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Columbus secured its spot in the postseason on the final day of the regular season then ousted D.C. United on penalties in the knockout round thanks to another tremendous performance from goalkeeper Zack Steffen. It\u2019s been a special closing stretch to the season for the Crew, making the playoffs and seeming to have their long-term future secured in Columbus with new ownership.\n\nIt\u2019s been a special season for the Red Bulls as well, capturing the Supporters\u2019 Shield for the third time since 2013. But the previous two times the Red Bulls won Supporters\u2019 Shield they failed to make MLS Cup. New York was knocked out in the conference semifinals by Houston in 2013 and beaten by Columbus in the Eastern finals in 2015.\n\nRed Bulls will certainly have an advantage in the first leg despite being on the road after Columbus had to play 120 minutes and go to penalties to advance from the knockout round.\n\nColumbus does have a win this season at Red Bull Arena, beating New York 3-2 in late July. The teams played to a 1-1 draw in Columbus in early June.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\n1. SEATTLE SOUNDERS vs. (5) PORTLAND TIMBERS\n\nThe Sounders got to rest in the knockout round after wrapping up the regular season with a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes. The win, secured on a Raul Ruidiaz stoppage-time goal, combined with Colorado\u2019s Decision Day victory over FC Dallas, slid the Sounders into second place in the standings.\n\nThe Sounders won 14 of their final 16 games in another remarkable second-half surge under coach Brian Schmetzer.\n\nPortland lost its final regular-season match against the Whitecaps and had the daunting task of facing FC Dallas on the road in the knockout stage. But the Timbers pulled off a 2-1 upset with a pair of goals from Diego Valeri, despite playing for much of the second half a man down.\n\nThe victory set up the Cascadia semifinal between the two teams, who last met in the 2013 conference finals with Portland winning 5-3 on aggregate.\n\nThe two teams met three times during the regular season, but Seattle won the last one 1-0 at Providence Park.\n\nPortland will be without Larrys Mabiala after he was sent off with a red card in the match against Dallas.\n\n1.

Jefferson Savarino\u2019s shot deflected off Walker Zimmerman\u2019s head in the 69th minute for the winning margin. LAFC fans at Banc of California Stadium did not react well, some shouting an offensive slur and throwing items on to the field.\n\nBut RSL will face a much greater challenge in Sporting, which has won three straight and led the Western Conference (and was second in the league) with 65 goals, a club record. Kansas City secured the top seed with a 2-1 Decision Day victory over LAFC.\n\nThe two sides are meeting in the postseason for the first time since their tense 2013 MLS Cup final, which Sporting won on penalties after a 1-1 draw.\n\nThe teams met twice this season in league play, with RSL winning 4-1 at Rio Tinto Stadium in July, and a 1-1 draw in Kansas City in late September.\n\nSporting will be without Seth Sinovic, who was sent off with a red card in the regular-season finale.\n\n___\n\nFor more AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Colombian pop star Shakira posses with children after laying the cornerstone for a school her Barefoot Foundation will build in the Aranjuez neighborhood of Cartagena, Colombia, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

Lockett has already matched his career-high in touchdowns in just seven games played this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a big factor early in the year,\u201d head coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nHe caught six touchdowns as a rookie in 2015 but had managed just three over the last two seasons combined. He\u2019s on pace to set career highs in catches, yards, yards per reception and touchdowns through the first seven games of 2018.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really at his top speed right now and rolling, which his top speed is pretty fast,\u201d quarterback Russell Wilson said.\n\nEven though Lockett played in all 16 games for Seattle last year, he never got back to 100 percent. He said he struggled to make it through practices last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get somebody an opportunity who can barely make it through practice,\u201d Lockett said. \u201cEven though I was finding ways and still looked like myself and (could) run around in the games, it was just harder to be able to put myself in a position to help the team in an expanded role.\u201d\n\nBut even though Lockett has caught a touchdown in all but one game for the Seahawks this season, he quickly shot down any notion that it\u2019s a significant achievement to him.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Lockett said. \u201cI just go out there and play and have fun with my teammates and try to make the best out of every opportunity. You never know when you\u2019re going to get the ball or the ball is going to be thrown your way.\u201d\n\nWhile it may not mean anything to Lockett, it has meant a great deal to the team.\n\nWith Doug Baldwin a bit slowed this year due to a pair of knee injuries, Lockett has helped carry the scoring output for Seattle. His six receiving touchdowns are among the best in the NFL. Antonio Brown (8), Tyreek Hill (7) and Eric Ebron (7) are the only players with more receiving touchdowns, though Hill and Ebron have each played one more game than Lockett.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come through so many challenges,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cThat injury he had a couple years ago, that wasn\u2019t a little injury. That was a very significant injury when it happened. I was on the field and saw it and it was heartbreaking. ... You don\u2019t know how people respond to that. If they have the mental fortitude to come back from something that significant. Tyler has done a miraculous job to say the least.\u201d\n\nNotes: RB Chris Carson (hip), LB K.J. Wright (knee) and SS Bradley McDougald (knee) are all questionable to play against the Chargers on Sunday.

Prosecutors have said Flowers was a disgruntled former employee who sought revenge against 59-year-old store owner Bertha Tardy because she fired him and withheld most of his pay to cover the cost of merchandise he damaged.

That gave trainer Bob Baffert an early Kentucky Derby favorite just five months after winning his second Triple Crown with Justify.\n\nBut not without some anxious moments for the Hall of Fame trainer and co-owners Gary and Mary West.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge win for me,\u201d said Baffert, who second-guessed himself during Game Winner\u2019s rough start before his pupil recovered.\n\n\u201cAny other horse, he would\u2019ve been done.

Of all the milestones that Philip Rivers has earned, the one he appreciates the most ave to deal with longevity. On Sunday the Chargers QB makes his 200th consecutive start, becoming the fourth quarterback in league history to reach that milestone. (AP Photo/David Richard, File)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Philip Rivers has many accomplishments, but there is one trait that he has taken pride in over his 15-year career \u2014 durability.\n\nThe Chargers\u2019 veteran signal caller will become the fourth quarterback in NFL history to make at least 200 consecutive regular-season starts when Los Angeles travels to Seattle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool. I mean, obviously the two Mannings (Peyton and Eli) and Favre have started over 200 in a row, and I just feel thankful,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI think there is a small element of toughness involved, but then again, shoot, lots of prayers for me from many people on Sundays and guys\u2019 protection that allow me to be out there each and every week, whether dealing with minor things or big things.\u201d\n\nRivers\u2019 streak is even more impressive considering the physical and mental demands of the position as well as the constant QB turnover throughout the league. Since Rivers\u2019 first start on Sept. 11, 2006, at Oakland:\n\n\u2014 There have been 179 different starting quarterbacks, including San Francisco\u2019s Nick Mullens on Thursday night.\n\n\u2014 Of that group, 78 have started for two or more teams and 12 have been with four or more. Ryan Fitzpatrick has been the most traveled with starts for six teams.\n\n\u2014 While the Chargers have had only one starting QB, 18 teams have had 10 or more start under center and eight have had 13 or more with the Browns (18), Rams (16) and Vikings (16) leading the way.\n\n\u2014 Rivers, who has a 111-98 record, has started against 91 quarterbacks and defeated 69, including Favre and both Mannings.\n\nLongevity, though, is nothing new for Rivers, who started 51 consecutive games at North Carolina State.\n\n\u201cI think just being out there each and every week has always been important,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, you want to be able to go out there and help. It\u2019s not just be out there. You want to play at a high level, and that\u2019s been up and down over 199, but being out there means something.\u201d\n\nNFL on CBS commentator Boomer Esiason said he thought it wasn\u2019t humanly possible to see a quarterback start 200 or more consecutive games, but that Rivers\u2019 leadership is what has stood out throughout his career.\n\nHe also noted that Rivers\u2019 relationship with Drew Brees during his first two years with the Chargers, where both had a friendly rivalry, is something that rarely happens these days due to constant scrutiny and social media.\n\nWhile Brees has had great success with Sean Payton in New Orleans, Rivers has had a tougher time. The Chargers have not been to the playoffs since 2013.\n\n\u201cWith Philip\u2019s competitive personality and leadership he is what other quarterbacks should aspire to be,\u201d Esiason said. \u201cHe\u2019s an extension of the coaching staff when he is out on the field.\u201d\n\nEven at age 36, Rivers is off to one of the best starts of his career as the 5-2 Chargers have won four straight. He is third in the league with a 117.8 passer rating and is tied for third with 17 touchdown passes.\n\nHe has excelled this season on deep passes along with throwing into tight windows. According to the league\u2019s Next Gen stats, Rivers leads the league at 9.2 yards per attempt and has a 124.1 rating when the receiver is separated by less than a yard from the defender.\n\nRivers also has six touchdowns and no interceptions on deep passes (thrown in the air 20 yards or more). Seattle\u2019s defense has allowed only five completions on deep passes.\n\n\u201cSometimes as an older player, your body won\u2019t let you do it. He\u2019s gifted. He hasn\u2019t faced that problem,\u201d Chargers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt said.\n\nIf Rivers\u2019 streak continues, he would tie Peyton Manning (208) at the end of the season and Eli Manning (210) in Week 2 of next season. As for Favre\u2019s mark of 297, Rivers said that is too many games for him to have a chance.\n\n\u201cFavre was always a favorite of mine. Still is. I kind of wanted to have that mark, or at least push for it in college,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get there. So y\u2019all can do the math and figure out your projection of how many years I\u2019m going to play, but I\u2019m not going to get to 300.\u201d\n\nRivers might also be the last to get into the 200 straight starts club for a while. Atlanta\u2019s Matt Ryan, who is in his 11th season, is second among active straight starts with 138 and Detroit\u2019s Matthew Stafford, who is in his 10th, has 119. Seattle\u2019s Russell Wilson, who has started every game since entering the league in 2012, is at 103 and wouldn\u2019t reach 200 until midway through the 2024 season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\n___\n\nFollow Joe Reedy at www.twitter.com/joereedy", "KENT, Wash.

I\u2019ll see if we can video footage for you.\u201d\n\nThe offense is dealing with its own woes as rookie left tackle Kolton Miller has been in and out of the lineup with a knee injury, left guard Kelechi Osemele re-injured his knee Thursday after missing the previous three games, backup left guard Jon Feliciano is dealing with a rib injury and rookie right tackle Brandon Parker has struggled since taking over for the injured Donald Penn.\n\nThe situation got so bad Thursday when Miller was forced to leave that Osemele had to move to left tackle after not practicing there all season.\n\nOsemele and Miller are being evaluated and could miss some time so the Raiders brought back former draft pick David Sharpe on Friday to take the place of tackle T.J. Clemmings, who is on injured reserve.\n\nOakland allowed eight sacks against San Francisco and Gruden pulled Carr to protect his health.\n\n\u201cLast night I was concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cLast night we didn\u2019t just have a couple of injuries, we were decimated and had guys playing positions that they had never really practiced. That was uncommon for any game I\u2019ve ever called and I\u2019ve called a lot of games. I\u2019ve broadcast some games and I haven\u2019t seen that.\u201d\n\nEven the rookie punter is struggling. Oakland used a fifth-round pick on Johnny Townsend, who has struggled all season. His 25-yard punt two weeks ago set up Indianapolis\u2019 go-ahead score and he had a 23-yarder against San Francisco.\n\nTownsend is last in the NFL in gross punting average (41.9 yards) and has the second-lowest percentage of punts downed inside the 20 (18.8 percent).\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s overthinking some things a little bit,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cDirectional punting, putting the ball between the numbers to the side line to the right, to the left, getting it off quicker, whatever it may be. I make no excuses for Townsend, but I will say this, I have seen him bomb it. I have seen him be a difference maker and I am confident it\u2019s in our near future.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "", "CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) \u2014 Chris Herndon is not the superstitious type. So, he\u2019s totally fine with talking about his three-game touchdown streak.\n\nThe New York Jets\u2019 rookie tight end would rather chat about something else, though.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s definitely nice to get into the end zone, but it feels a lot better when we\u2019re winning,\u201d Herndon said Friday. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been fun these last three weeks, getting a few targets in the end zone and capitalizing on them, but ultimately I want us to win, so I don\u2019t try to focus on the stats.\u201d\n\nHerndon is the second rookie in franchise history to catch a TD pass in three straight games, joining wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (1996).\n\nBut, as he said, the end result hasn\u2019t always been there. His first NFL touchdown came in the Jets\u2019 42-34 win over Indianapolis on Oct. 14, when he had a 32-yard grab.\n\nHerndon had a 12-yard catch against Minnesota the following week to tie the game at 7 late in the first quarter. New York ended up losing 37-17.\n\nLast week at Chicago, Herndon had a 16-yard TD reception in the Jets\u2019 disappointing 24-10 loss.\n\nHe\u2019ll try to make it four in a row \u2014 and, he hopes, with a victory \u2014 when New York travels to Miami, where Herndon played his college ball.\n\n\u201cI just think the offense slowed down for him,\u201d coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cI think from a mental standpoint, he\u2019s playing faster because he can see everything that\u2019s coming and his abilities are starting to take over without even thinking.\u201d\n\nHerndon was a fourth-round pick in April after a solid college career that was cut short last year by a knee injury. Some draft experts thought he could have been as high as a second-rounder if not for him being hurt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely thankful to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t take any of this for granted because at this time last year, I was dealing with being injured. So, just being able to play in a professional league, that alone is an honor.\n\nHe tore the medial collateral ligament in his left knee before the Hurricanes were getting set to play in the ACC title game against Clemson. That was the end of his season and his career \u2014 but he refused to believe his NFL dreams would be over.\n\n\u201cI mean, not doubts,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t necessarily the best time to, you know, go down.\u201d\n\nWith him slipping into the fourth round, the Jets took a chance on him even though he needed to continue rehabilitating his knee through the early part of the offseason.\n\nHerndon\u2019s role with the team was uncertain as New York had several tight ends on its roster during the spring. The 22-year-old native of Norcross, Georgia, also found himself in trouble with the law when he was arrested on June 2 for driving while intoxicated after flipping his car in New Jersey.\n\nHe was remorseful after the arrest, and thankful to the Jets for sticking by him during his legal issues. Herndon leaned on his faith while acknowledging that he had doubts about what was next for him.\n\n\u201cYou kind of do, but that\u2019s when I just started praying more and letting God handle all that,\u201d he said. \u201cJust controlling all I can at that point. I was strong with it and I\u2019m still learning and growing with it each day.\u201d\n\nHerndon could potentially be disciplined by the NFL for next season, but he will let that play out. His mind right now is on getting better \u2014 on and off the field.\n\nAnd, things are certainly looking up as far as his play.\n\nHerndon has 12 catches \u2014 seven in the last three games \u2014 for 161 yards and the three TDs, which tie him with Robby Anderson for the team lead. He and Philadelphia\u2019s Dallas Goedert have the most by a rookie tight end this season, and one more would break the Jets\u2019 single-season mark for rookies at the position \u2014 currently shared with Rich Caster (1970), Mickey Shuler (1978) and Dustin Keller (2008).\n\nAnd, Herndon has another eight games to do it.\n\n\u201cYeah, I was actually kind of surprised when I heard that news,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m honestly just thankful.\u201d\n\nHerndon and rookie quarterback Sam Darnold were roommates for a stretch during training camp and developed a friendship off the field.\n\n\u201cWhenever we came home, either one of us had questions, especially me, because I\u2019m the tight end, I just asked him,\u201d Herndon said. \u201cThat kind of helped.\u201d\n\nNow, they\u2019re creating a bond on the field that\u2019s resulting in some big plays.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, he\u2019s is a great route runner,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cBut also, he\u2019s a great run blocker, which helps in the pass game. It sets up play action and all that stuff.

Arpaio said Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, that he's being unfairly blamed for releasing from custody a Mexican immigrant featured in a political ad that shows the man in a California courtroom bragging about killing police officers. (AP Photo/Matt York, File)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A political ad from President Donald Trump that shows a Mexican immigrant bragging about killing police officers has put the spotlight back on noted immigration hard-liner Joe Arpaio, who detained and released the man in the video years ago.\n\nThe former six-term sheriff of metro Phoenix says he\u2019s being unfairly blamed for releasing the immigrant depicted in the video that has stoked immigration anxieties in the days leading up to the midterm elections.\n\nThe ad centers on Luis Bracamontes, who was convicted of murder in the 2014 shooting deaths of two sheriff\u2019s deputies in California while he was in the United States illegally. Trump blames Democrats for weak laws that allowed the man to keep coming across the border, even though he was deported during the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nBracamontes was also incarcerated four times in jails run by Arpaio, a Republican who is known for his crackdowns on illegal immigration and being the first person to receive a pardon from Trump. He campaigned for Trump on several occasions during the presidential campaign but lost his bid for a seventh term in 2016 amid a swirl of legal troubles.\n\nArpaio said Friday that he hasn\u2019t seen the ad and didn\u2019t remember the details of the cases.\n\nBut he said his jail officers likely acted properly by contacting federal immigration authorities to pick up Bracamontes, because that was the procedure in the jails at the time when inmates completed their sentences. He pinned the blame on federal immigration authorities for dropping the ball.\n\n\u201cI would never release an illegal,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cI think my reputation has shown show that for many, many, many years.\u201d\n\nBracamontes used several aliases, making it hard to pinpoint his immigration record. California authorities say Bracamontes was deported four times before he killed Sacramento County sheriff\u2019s Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County sheriff\u2019s Detective Michael Davis Jr.\n\nBracamontes was deported at least once after doing time in Arpaio\u2019s jails in drug cases from 1996 through 2001, according to court records in Arizona.\n\nArpaio said at that time, his office had a system of notifying federal authorities about immigrants in the jail through a teletype system.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have denounced the ad, which links Bracamontes\u2019 crimes to a caravan of Central American migrants moving through Mexico, as a racist campaign tactic.\n\nBracamontes was deported in 1997, when Clinton was in office, according to court records in Arizona. He was arrested for marijuana possession in March 2001 during Bush\u2019s administration. It\u2019s unclear when he returned to the United States illegally before that arrest.\n\nComparisons have been drawn between the ad and the infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d commercial in the 1988 presidential race about a black man who raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough.\n\nA news release issued by Arpaio\u2019s office in the days after the attack on the California officers is murky on saying whether his office or federal immigration authorities had released Bracamontes onto the streets.\n\nArpaio said he\u2019s being unfairly blamed for releasing an immigrant back into the community who nearly 13 years later would kill police officers. He said his jail officers did as much as they could over the years to notify federal authorities when thousands of immigrants were being released from jails.\n\nArpaio, whose contempt of court conviction for disobeying a court order in an immigration case was pardoned by Trump, said he\u2019s a convenient target for people looking to criticize the president.\n\n\u201cWhy am I the bad guy?\u201d Arpaio asked. \u201cYou know why?

His best since then was seventh for SHR two years ago. This season, Busch has 20 top-10 finishes, including one win among his six top-fives.\n\nBusch still remembers what crew chief Jimmy Fennig used to tell him when he was a young driver for Roush.\n\n\u201cIf you think for one instance you can\u2019t win, make sure you go out and finish fifth,\u201d Busch recalled. \u201cThat\u2019s the mindset that I take from that championship run, and it\u2019s helped me over the years.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\nDOHA, Qatar (AP) \u2014 Simone Biles made history by picking up her record 13th career gold medal at the world gymnastics championships when she cruised to victory in the vault final on Friday.\n\nYet it\u2019s the silver she captured on uneven bars that the Olympic and world champion may cherish more.\n\nFor years Biles viewed bars with a mixture of skepticism and scorn. There was a point in time she admits she would have been OK with taking a \u201cchainsaw\u201d to every bars set in the country.\n\nThose days are over. Helped in part by the influence of new head coach Laurent Landi, Biles now considers the event a challenge more than a chore. Maybe that\u2019s why the smile on the podium during the medal ceremony after she came in second to Belgium\u2019s Nina Derwael was so wide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come a long way,\u201d Biles said.\n\nIt certainly showed. Biles put together a score of 14.7 to edge Germany\u2019s Elisabeth Seitz for silver. Belgium\u2019s Nina Derwael won the first ever gold medal for her country at worlds when the judges awarded her daring and intricate set with a score of 15.2.\n\nNot that Biles \u2014 who expressed frustration after a sloppy (by her standards) performance while winning a record fourth all-around title on Thursday \u2014 was complaining after finishing runner-up to Derwael. She became the first American woman to earn a world championship medal on all four events, and the way she\u2019s focused on upping her degree of difficulty on bars is a testament to the way her approach has matured over the years.\n\n\u2033(Before) to even work and put that much effort into bars, I would have probably been like \u2018No, No thank you,\u2019\u201d Biles said. \u201cI really put the work and the effort to bring up that event to the level with the other (events).\u201d\n\nEvents like vault, where Biles has long been among the best in the world. She easily captured gold even though she opted not to perform her new signature vault after she fell while trying to land in during the all-around final. She chose two slightly safer vaults instead, and her average of 15.366 was nearly a full point ahead of silver medalist Shallon Olsen of Canada and bronze medalist Alexa Moreno of Mexico.\n\nBiles wanted to do her new vault \u2014 which she drilled in both qualifying and the team final and will be named after her when the code of points is updated \u2014 but Landi talked her out of it.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You know what? You can\u2019t change what happened yesterday,\u2019\u201d Biles said. \u201d\u2019I know you really want to get out there and do that vault but you can\u2019t change what happened yesterday and you\u2019ve been successful at that vault while in training and on podium. So just go out there and do (another vault instead).\u201d\n\nThe decision helped Biles boost her gold medal total at the world championships to 13, the most every by any gymnast. She will have a chance to add to her medal total when the meet wraps up on Saturday. Biles will compete in both the balance beam final and the floor exercise final. If she medals on both \u2014 as she did at the 2016 Olympics \u2014 the 21-year-old will tie the all-time mark for career medals at the world championships with 20.\n\nNot bad considering she is dealing with a kidney stone that sent her to the emergency room on the eve of qualifying. Biles said the pain is manageable and she was more focused on simply trying to make up for her so-so all-around.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to come out here and redeem myself and I think I did that tonight,\u201d Biles said.\n\nMen\u2019s all-around champion Artur Dalaloyan added gold on floor exercise, his score of 14.900 allowed him to slip past Japan\u2019s Kenzo Shirai. Carlos Edriel Yulo of the Philippines was third, just ahead of American Yul Moldauer in fourth.\n\nChina\u2019s Xiao Ruoteng, who lost gold in the all-around on a tiebreaker, won gold on pommel horse on a tiebreaker. Xiao and Max Whitlock of Britain both finished with a score of 15.166 but Xiao claimed gold because his execution score was higher than Whitlock\u2019s. Lee Chih-Kai of Taiwan won the bronze, the first world championship medal for Taiwan in a quarter century. American Sam Mikulak was fourth.\n\nGreece\u2019s Eleftherios Petrounias captured gold on still rings with a score of 15.366.

He had six catches for 121 yards in that win over New England in 2014. (AP Photo/Matt Ludtke, FIle)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The Green Bay Packers\u2019 Davante Adams can trace his ascent to becoming one of the most productive receivers in the NFL to a cold night in late November four years ago.\n\nThat game against the New England Patriots is proof of how much a rookie must be prepared at any time to step up, even against the toughest of opponents.\n\n\u201cWell I mean, I let everybody know as far as my approach to the game ever since I got here was just to be ready at all times,\u201d Adams said this week.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that the Packers\u2019 current crop of rookie receivers can draw from when Green Bay faces New England again on Sunday night at Foxboro.\n\nIn 2014, Adams took advantage of more looks when the Patriots decided to focus on then-top Packers wideout Jordy Nelson. Adams had six catches for 121 yards on 11 targets, getting as many receptions and targets as he had drawn the three previous games combined.\n\n\u201cYeah, that was probably my coming out game,\u201d Adams said.\n\nNow Adams is quarterback Aaron Rodgers\u2019 top option, the receiver that usually draws an opponent\u2019s best cornerback. Adams has had at least 132 yards receiving in each of his last three games.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s big for us. I think he can do it all from the wide receiver position and we\u2019re expecting a lot of attention by the Patriots secondary\u201d on Adams, coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it could mean more looks for rookie wideouts Marquez Valdes-Scantling or Equanimeous St. Brown.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Valdes-Scantling has especially taken advantage of more work in recent games with injuries to starters Randall Cobb and Geronimo Allison. They returned last week, but Valdes-Scantling still caught a touchdown pass last week, his second in three games.\n\nAdams has offered simple, but important advice to the rookies, just like how Nelson did to Adams four years ago.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to be (Adams.) Don\u2019t try to be Cobb, don\u2019t try to be (Allison). Don\u2019t try to be anybody else that you see,\u201d Valdes-Scantling said in recounting a piece of advice from Adams.\n\nValdes-Scantling could draw another start against the Patriots with Allison listed as doubtful for Sunday after injuring his groin in practice this week to go with an already sore hamstring. Cobb is questionable again with a hamstring injury but seems to be improving.\n\n\u201cBe yourself. Everybody does things well, but what you do well, just keep doing it,\u201d Valdes-Scantling added about Adams\u2019 advice.\n\nAdams has become an all-around receiver. Explosiveness and an ability to make moves allow him to gain extra yards after a catch.\n\nBut while the 26-21 win over the Patriots in 2014 might have been his springboard, it took a while for Adams to gain the kind of consistency that now makes him an important part of the offense.\n\nFor example, following the Patriots game, Adams managed just four catches for 29 yards over his last four regular-season games combined in 2014. Then he had seven catches for 117 yards and a score in a 26-21 win in the playoffs over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nAdams has 28 touchdown catches since the 2016 season. Opposing secondaries have caught on to Adams\u2019 rise, yet he\u2019s still coming up clutch for Rodgers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to look to guys who maybe he hasn\u2019t looked to as much coming up,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIf that\u2019s how they decide to go about the game, remove (me) from the game, I\u2019m still going to do my best to contribute as much as I can to this offense. I know the rest of the guys will be ready as well.\u201d\n\nLinebacker Nick Perry (ankle) and safety Jermaine Whitehead (back) are the only other players on the injury report, listed as questionable for Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "San Francisco 49ers running back Raheem Mostert (31) walks off the field with trainers during the second half of the team's NFL football game against the Oakland Raiders in Santa Clara, Calif., Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018.

(Ben Garver/The Berkshire Eagle via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 More than 30 million Americans have cast early ballots ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, eclipsing the 2014 early totals nationally and suggesting a high overall turnout for contests that could define the final two years of President Donald Trump\u2019s term.\n\nAt least 28 states have surpassed their 2014 early votes. And perhaps even more indicative of the unusual enthusiasm this midterm cycle, some states are approaching their early turnout from the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some highlights:\n\nMASSIVE TURNOUT\n\nThe 30.6 million ballots includes data from 48 states, with several of those still collecting absentee ballots and welcoming in-person early voters. The total early vote in 2014 was 28.3 million in an election where more than 83 million Americans voted. That was a low turnout (about 36 percent) even by usual standards of a midterm, when there\u2019s an expected drop off from presidential elections.\n\nForecasters aren\u2019t predicting that overall turnout this year will hit 2016 levels (137.5 million; more than 60 percent of the electorate), but Democratic and Republican analysts, along with independent political scientists, say turnout could approach 50 percent, levels not seen for a midterm since the turbulent 1960s.\n\nBOOMS IN STATES NOT USED TO EXCITING MIDTERMS\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to see Virginia more than doubling its 2014 early turnout. Voters there showed their intensity last year in their governor\u2019s race, with record absentee ballot requests and returns and a solid turnout for both parties.\n\nBut then there\u2019s Tennessee. The state has settled firmly into Republican-dominated territory. In 2014, there wasn\u2019t a single statewide race that received national attention or a truly competitive House election.\n\nBut with an open Senate seat thanks to the retirement of Republican Bob Corker, voters are more than eager this year. Through Thursday, early turnout was 217 percent of what it was in 2014. It\u2019s even approaching early turnout from 2016, at more than 80 percent of that presidential-year mark.\n\nSeveral other states with competitive Senate or governor\u2019s races \u2014 Texas, Nevada, Georgia, among others \u2014 are nearing double the 2014 early totals.\n\nDEMOCRATS EDGING REPUBLICANS NATIONALLY\n\nIn states that require party registration, Democrats have cast 41 percent of the early ballots, compared to 36 percent for Republicans. Party strategists on both sides say they are far exceeding their usual numbers in key locales \u2014 urban strongholds for Democrats and more rural counties for Republicans.\n\nA word of caution from prognosticators: The party analysis isn\u2019t always an indicator of final outcomes. There are crossover voters, even in this hyperpartisan era. And there are independents and third-party voters, as well. For the record, those latter groups account for about 23 percent of the ballots in party registration states.\n\nFor the scorekeepers, though, Virginia, among the states that doesn\u2019t have party registration, is replicating its 2017 voting boom \u2014 and Democrats swept the top offices last year even amid strong GOP turnout.\n\nYOUNG VOTERS IN FLORIDA\n\nTrends in Florida\u2019s early voting suggest a surge in young voters, a group that historically has low turnout in midterm cycles.\n\nOf the 124,000 Floridians aged 18 to 29 who had voted in person at early polling stations as of Thursday, nearly a third did not vote in the presidential election in 2016, according to analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. About half of those new voters were newly registered.\n\n\u201cThere are newly energized voters who sat out in 2016, or have registered since then, who are turning out. There\u2019s no question about that,\u201d Smith said.\n\nIn contrast, for people 65 and older who had voted early and in person, about 7 percent didn\u2019t vote in 2016.\n\nNEW VOTERS IN GEORGIA\n\nIt cannot be said enough: It\u2019s the voters who don\u2019t often participate in midterms who can make the big difference. There\u2019s plenty of evidence that both major parties\u2019 bases are enthusiastic, but a frequent Election Day voter being so excited that they vote early doesn\u2019t change the math.\n\nSo candidates like Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp in the Georgia governor\u2019s race are keeping their eye on how many non-2014 voters have cast ballots.\n\nAn analysis by Georgia-based data analyst Ryan Anderson finds that 36 percent of the 1.8 million early votes in Georgia are new voters. If that held through Election Day, it would be a huge number. Abrams\u2019 campaign believes it would benefit them, though Republicans nationally note that President Donald Trump brought many new voters to the polls in 2016 \u2014 and those voters are still \u201cnew\u201d midterm voters.\n\nThat said, at least in Georgia, the racial and gender breakdown of the new voters bodes well for Abrams, who is trying to spike turnout among nonwhites, women and millennials.\n\nAnderson\u2019s analysis finds that barely more than half of the new voters are white in a state where the GOP wants the white share of the electorate to be push toward the mid-60s. Among the other findings: new female voters outnumber men by more than 70,000.\n\nThe bright spot for Kemp: More than half of early votes come from voters over 65 (though that total includes all races), and there is intense turnout in many of the state\u2019s most conservative areas beyond metro Atlanta.\n\n-----\n\nNegrete reported from New York.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nBROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) \u2014 As the first active-duty military troops sent to the U.S. border with Mexico installed coils of razor wire on a bridge and a riverbank Friday, a sense of unease spread across Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s portrayal of a border under siege by drug smugglers and other criminals is at odds with what residents in towns along the 1,954-mile (3,126-kilometer) divide with Mexico see in their daily routines, with U.S. border towns consistently ranking among the safest in the country.\n\nSome Valley residents question the need for a large military presence and fear it will tarnish the area\u2019s image. And some are afraid of violence if and when the caravan of Central American migrants that the troops have been sent to confront reaches the U.S. border.\n\nWhile the southern tip of Texas is the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, border agents make many arrests far from public view, on uninhabited banks of the Rio Grande and on nearby dirt paths and roads lined by thick brush.\n\n\u201cI feel safer here than when I go up to bigger cities,\u201d lifelong Rio Grande Valley resident Emmanuel Torres said Friday while working at a coffee shop in Brownsville, the region\u2019s largest city, with about 200,000 people.\n\nTorres, 19, said the area feels \u201ca lot like family,\u201d and he worries the military presence will fuel outsiders\u2019 perceptions of a dysfunctional border.\n\n\u201cPeople that don\u2019t live here are just going to create a bigger negative image,\u201d Torres said.\n\nWhen Trump pledged this week to send up to 15,000 troops to the border in response to the slow-moving caravan of migrants, he unnerved the economically struggling region of 1 million people that stretches over flat, sun-drenched citrus groves and farms of cotton, sugar cane and vegetables.\n\nThe Pentagon said more than 3,500 troops have been deployed to staging bases along the border, including about 1,000 Marines in California. Still, there were only about 100 troops at the border on Friday, working at and near a bridge leading to McAllen, Texas, the Rio Grande Valley\u2019s second-biggest city, with about 140,000 people.\n\nMore than a dozen military members in fatigues were at the northern bank of the river, below the bridge, laying concertina wire. Other soldiers erected wire barriers on the bridge\u2019s pedestrian paths.\n\nThe largest caravan traveling through Mexico is still weeks away from the U.S. border, and migrants have given no indication where they might cross. The Rio Grande Valley is the shortest route from Central America but also one of the most dangerous.\n\nThe troops are being sent in what has been described as a support role, helping border agents. But Trump said he told the military that if troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were rifles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all preparation in anticipation of the caravan,\u201d said Manuel Padilla Jr., the Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector chief. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that these people do not show up at the border. They\u2019re not going to be allowed in.\u201d\n\nConchita Padilla, a volunteer at the Brownsville Museum of Fine Art, said she believes the U.S. has the right to defend its borders. But she also said she is frightened by the troops because she doesn\u2019t know what they will do or how they will react to the caravan.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that if they fight each other, there might be innocent people in the way that are suffering consequences,\u201d said Padilla, 66. \u201cWe are just praying that they go in peace.\u201d\n\nAccording to an analysis by The Associated Press of FBI statistics, nine U.S. cities along the Mexican border had a violent crime rate of nearly 346 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2017. That\u2019s lower than the national rate of almost 383. In Brownsville, it was 257, in McAllen, 144.\n\nThose same nine border towns and cities also had a property crime rate of 2,058 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. Nationwide, the estimated rate was just over 2,362 per 100,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost shocking, but it\u2019s true,\u201d Jack Levin, director of Northeastern University\u2019s Brudnick Center on Violence. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Russell Contreras in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Lolita C.

It marked the first time since 2001 that USC has a record of .500 or worse heading into November.\n\nAddressing the team\u2019s struggles, coach Clay Helton dismissed offensive line coach Neil Callaway and took away the play-calling responsibilities from offensive coordinator Tee Martin, who remains on staff.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was the appropriate time,\u201d Helton said. \u201cI\u2019ve had the itch to get back, more integrated with the offense.

He added that he expected Daniels would be ready to go against the Beavers. Daniels suffered the concussion two weeks ago against Utah. Redshirt freshman Jack Sears started against the Sun Devils and threw for 235 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nOREGON STATE\u2019S QB: Oregon State started sophomore Jack Colletto against Colorado while Conor Blount recovered from a concussion. However, Jake Luton, who had been out with a high ankle sprain since Sept. 15, was inserted early in the second half and wound up throwing for 310 yards and three touchdowns. He was named the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nSmith said this week that Blount had still not been cleared to play, so Luton will get the start against USC.\n\nHISTORY: USC leads the all-time series 62-11. The Beavers\u2019 last win came in 2010 with a 36-7 rout at Reser. USC has won the meetings since then in 2013, 2014 and 2017. Oregon State\u2019s last win over a conference opponent at home was the 2016 Civil War.\n\nSUPPORTING TEE: Receiver Michael Pittman Jr. had nothing but praise for how Martin was handling the situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just like the player, so I just play in a system. I just get the plays and I just run them. It\u2019s not a big switch up to me, but one thing I did notice is I feel like Coach Tee came out here with a really positive attitude.

Signed in January 2014, it called for salaries of $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020.\n\nThe new deal involves a $23 million signing bonus, payable in equal installments on June 30 in each of the next three years, and annual salaries of $23,333,333.\n\n\u201cI wanted to stay here, so financial, everything aside, it was more valuable to me to just stay here,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Friday, the Dodgers made $17.9 million qualifying offers to two of their other free agents: pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and catcher Yasmani Grandal.\n\nKershaw gets an additional $28 million in guaranteed money. The new agreement includes $4 million annually in performance bonuses, in four $1 million increments for 24, 26, 28 and 30 games started, which could raise the deal\u2019s value to $105 million over three years.\n\nThe left-hander also can earn award bonuses of $1.5 million for winning the NL Cy Young Award or $500,000 for finishing second or third in the voting.\n\nKershaw, his wife Ellen and their two young children make their offseason home in the Dallas area, and if the Texas Rangers had had a winning season \u201cit would have been something to consider for sure,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t as much of a question for me this time around,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kiddos love it here. Ellen loves it here. I love it here. I love the team here, and there\u2019s not many opportunities that meet all the criteria that Ellen and I would be looking for. And myself personally, a chance to win every single year, it doesn\u2019t come around like this in LA very often.\u201d\n\nThe money designated a signing bonus will not be subject to state income because Texas does not have a state income tax.\n\nWinner of the NL Cy Young in 2011, \u201913 and \u201914, Kershaw was limited to 26 starts this year because of a back injury and went 9-5 with a 2.73 ERA while striking out 155. The Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second straight season, with Kershaw taking the loss in Sunday\u2019s season-ending Game 5 defeat to Boston. His average fastball velocity dropped by 2 mph in the past year to 91 mph.\n\n\u201cI plan on getting back to that level that I was at,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys older than me, and there\u2019s a lot of guys with more innings than me in the big leagues that are still maintaining their velocity.\u201d\n\nA herniated disk in his back sidelined him in 2016.

The Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a nearly 100-year-old, cross-shaped war memorial located on a Maryland highway median violates the Constitution's required separation of church and state. The court announced Friday, Nov. 2, that it would hear the case. (Algerina Perna /The Baltimore Sun via AP, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear a case about whether a nearly 100-year-old, cross-shaped war memorial located on a Maryland highway median violates the Constitution\u2019s required separation of church and state, a case that could impact hundreds of similar monuments nationwide.\n\nA federal appeals court in Virginia had previously ruled against the approximately four-story-tall cross. The judges said that it \u201chas the primary effect of endorsing religion and excessively entangles the government in religion.\u201d\n\nBut the Maryland officials who maintain the memorial told the Supreme Court that the monument\u2019s context and history show it is intended to convey a secular message of remembrance, not a religious message. They said the appeals court\u2019s decision would \u201ccompel the removal or dismemberment of a cherished war memorial that has served as a site of solemn commemoration and civic unity for nearly a century.\u201d In urging the high court to take the case, officials argued that the lower court\u2019s decision puts at risk hundreds of other monuments nationwide.\n\nThe approximately 40-foot-tall cross at the center of the case is located in Bladensburg, Maryland, about 5 miles from the Supreme Court. Sometimes called the \u201cPeace Cross,\u201d it was completed in 1925, and it honors 49 men from the surrounding county who died in World War I. A plaque on the cross\u2019 base lists the names of those soldiers, and both faces of the cross have a circle with the symbol of the American Legion, the veterans organization that helped raise money to build it.\n\nToday, responsibility for the cross falls to a Maryland parks commission that took over ownership and maintenance of it in 1961 because of traffic safety concerns. The massive concrete structure could be dangerous to motorists if it were to fall or crumble.\n\nThe monument\u2019s supporters say the Supreme Court has previously made clear that monuments, particularly longstanding ones, that incorporate religious symbolism to send a secular message don\u2019t violate the Constitution. They say the Bladensburg monument\u2019s history and context show that it falls into that category, that its message is a secular one of commemoration.\n\nThe monument\u2019s shape was chosen not for religious reasons but to mirror cross-shaped grave markers used for soldiers buried in American cemeteries overseas, backers note. And, in the decades since the monument was built, other memorials have been constructed nearby including a World War II memorial, a memorial honoring veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars and a 9/11 memorial.\n\nThe District of Columbia-based American Humanist Association has led the challenge against the monument. The organization and three area residents sued Maryland officials in 2014. They say that the cross \u201cdiscriminates against patriotic soldiers who are not Christian, sending a callous message to non-Christians that Christians are worthy of veneration while they may as well be forgotten.\u201d And they point out that other nearby memorials are smaller and across the street from the cross.\n\nWhile a trial court judge ruled the memorial was constitutional, an appeals court disagreed in a 2-1 ruling in October 2017. In urging the Supreme Court not to take the case, the American Humanist Association argued that the appeals court\u2019s ruling is specific to the Bladensburg memorial and doesn\u2019t threaten any other monuments.\n\nThe court also agreed to hear four other cases Friday. One case is a Navy veteran\u2019s lawsuit over compensation for illnesses allegedly caused by Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam. Another is an appeal from an African-American death row inmate in Mississippi who was convicted and sentenced by a jury with just one African-American after the prosecutor eliminated the five other prospective jurors who were black. The high court has previously ruled that prosecutors can\u2019t exclude jurors because of their race. The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld affirmed the conviction, despite evidence from four of inmate Curtis Flowers\u2019 five previous trials that the prosecutor improperly excluded jurors because they were African-American.\n\nThe new cases are expected to be argued this winter. The court also asked for re-argument in a property rights case the justices heard in October.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mark Sherman contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jessicagresko", "BC-APNewsAlert,16\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kershaw stays with Dodgers, agrees to $93 million, 3-year deal that could be worth $105 million.\n\nreldate", "BC-APNewsAlert,16\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kershaw stays with Dodgers, agrees to $93 million, 3-year deal that could be worth $105 million.\n\nreldate", "Kershaw stays with Dodgers, agrees to $93 million, 3-year deal that could be worth $105 million", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Federal prosecutors say a man pleading guilty in a racketeering case has admitted killing a 3-year-old Baltimore girl struck by a stray bullet on her front porch in 2014.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office announced Friday that 29-year-old Terrell Plummer and 25-year-old Tyrone Jamison pleaded guilty Friday to a federal racketeering conspiracy related to membership in the Old York Money Gang.

Henry has talked a very good game on the kind of running back he wants to be for the Titans. The 2015 Heisman Trophy winner knows it's time he starts proving it. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Derrick Henry possibly is running out of time with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nThe 2015 Heisman Trophy winner talked a month ago about needing to run better and be more physical. Three games later, nothing much has changed \u2014 for now. Henry is still the starter, though Dion Lewis is making a case for that spot. It\u2019s Lewis who is coming off the best rushing game this season by a Tennessee running back.\n\n\u201cWe all know, you guys all know, if you\u2019re inconsistent in this league, they\u2019ll find somebody to replace you,\u201d Henry said. \u201cSo I feel like the biggest thing is just being consistent during everything that I do. Being efficient, finishing runs, being physical, running hard. Like I said, I stood in front of y\u2019all and said all those things, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done those things.\u201d\n\nHenry is in his third season after being the Titans\u2019 third pick in the 2016 draft out of Alabama. Lewis is the free agent general manager Jon Robinson signed in March to a four-year deal.\n\nDuring the Titans\u2019 bye last week, Henry studied each of those 84 carries and evaluated himself. He found plenty he can do better by running like the 6-foot-3, 247-pound back he is. Henry is averaging a career-worst 3.3 yards per carry. Lewis leads Tennessee in rushing with 277 yards \u2014 4 more than Henry who\u2019s had 11 more carries this season.\n\nThe Titans (3-4) need an improved running game having lost three straight, and they rank 19th in the NFL averaging only 107.9 yards rushing per game. They had a season-high 164 yards rushing Oct. 21 in London, and Lewis was a big key running for a season-high 91 yards. Lewis finished with a career-best 155 yards from scrimmage.\n\nAsked about Henry, Titans coach Mike Vrabel said they have to find ways to clean up mistakes across the offense that have cost yards. That includes finishing runs better.\n\n\u201cThere are times if you look at yourself and say, \u2018Man, I could have done a better job.\u2019 I think that\u2019s what Derrick is doing,\u201d Vrabel said. \u201cI appreciate that mentality from him. He can do more and we all can do more.\u201d\n\nTennessee signed fullback Jalston Fowler on Monday to add another blocker to the offensive mix. The Titans visit Dallas (3-4) and know the Cowboys will be running the ball with Ezekiel Elliott who\u2019s second in the NFL with 619 yards rushing. That makes getting the run game working better crucial against a Dallas defense ranked third in fewest yards allowed and ninth against the run, giving up 96.3 yards per game.\n\nOffensive coordinator Matt LaFleur said the Titans\u2019 coaches and players still have plenty of confidence in Henry. But Henry has to make the most of his opportunities with the ball.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big back, and any time you\u2019re a big back, you want to make sure you\u2019re finishing runs,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a pretty good job of that. We\u2019ve just got to get him going. We\u2019ve got to get him going, and I think it\u2019s a matter of time before we\u2019re able to do it. But really it takes everybody. It\u2019s not just Derrick. It takes all 11.\u201d\n\nNotes: Both starting guards practiced fully Friday, including RG Josh Kline (ankle) who was limited Thursday.

Barrett was the lone freshman included in the Associated Press preseason All-America team. (Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nA federal trial revealed more details of a pay-to-pay recruiting scandal, darkening the cloud hanging over college basketball for a second straight season.\n\nBut will it make a difference? Outside of a handful of suspensions, the curtain pullback of the sport\u2019s worst-kept secret had little impact last year. The 2018-19 season could take a similar route.\n\nTwo trials are still coming and more details could emerge from a federal investigation into shady recruiting practices, so college basketball may still feel a major jolt.\n\nBut the sport is perhaps better than ever on the court. Scoring remains up, more star-in-the-making freshmen dot rosters across the country, blue blood programs have restocked and the mid-majors have more reason for optimism after Loyola-Chicago\u2019s Final Four run.\n\nUnless something monumental arises from the investigation or the NCAA, don\u2019t expect too much to change.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not the most-watched sport in America, I\u2019m not sure what is,\u201d West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said. \u201cYou have six games a night, so I think the state of our game is fine. If things happened, we all know they shouldn\u2019t have happened, but that doesn\u2019t affect the state of our game and the way people go about doing their business.\u201d\n\nCollege basketball was rocked before the 2017-18 season started when 10 people, including four assistant coaches from prominent programs, were arrested on accusations that they funneled up to six-figure payments to top-tier recruits to influence their choice of schools, apparel companies and agents.\n\nMore accusations came out during the season and a federal trial last month led to the convictions of three men on fraud charges. Testimony during the trial revealed more accusations of paying players by Arizona, Louisville, Kansas, Duke, Oregon and North Carolina State, among others.\n\nThe NCAA has created new rules based on recommendations by a commission headed by Condoleezza Rice in hopes of curtailing the pay-to-play practices, but may not punish any programs or coaches ensnared in the probe until after the final trial, which is scheduled for after the Final Four in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cJust like Wall Street, no matter how many regulations there are, there are always going to be people that when the stakes are high and there\u2019s a lot of money involved that don\u2019t follow the guidelines,\u201d Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin said. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate what the Rice Commission did and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. I get all that, but you\u2019re not going to stop it. If people don\u2019t want to do the right thing, you\u2019re not going to stop them.\u201d\n\nA few things to look for on the court during the 2018-19 men\u2019s college basketball season:\n\nTHE FRESHMEN: More high-level freshmen seem to have huge impacts every season and this year should be no different. Duke has three of the top freshmen on one team, with projected No. 1 NBA pick R.J. Barrett, projected rim wrecker Zion Williamson and Cam Reddish adding another five-star haul to Coach K\u2019s loaded recruiting class.\n\nIndiana coach Archie Miller got a huge boost toward getting the Hoosiers back to the NCAA Tournament by convincing Romeo Langford to stay in state.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s Nassir Little could be an NBA lottery pick after this season, Quentin Grimes is Kansas coach Bill Self\u2019s latest high-level freshman guard and Keldon Johnson may be the best player among coach John Calipari\u2019s latest stellar recruiting class.\n\nMID-MAJOR MARK: Mid-major programs should get a boost of confidence this year after watching UMBC beat Virginia to become the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 and Chicago-Loyola\u2019s improbable run to the Final Four.\n\nThis season has plenty of deep-run-potential mid-majors.\n\nNo. 7 Nevada has its highest preseason ranking and coach Eric Musselman has a loaded roster in Reno. Buffalo has five of its top six scorers back from a team that knocked off Arizona in the opening round of the NCAAs.\n\nMarshall and coach Dan D\u2019Antoni have plenty coming back after knocking off Wichita State in last year\u2019s opening round and Western Kentucky landed one of the nation\u2019s top freshmen in big man Charles Bassey. And never count out Loyola-Chicago and Sister Jean after what they did last year.\n\nTHE FAVORITES: Kansas is the preseason No. 1 for the third time behind a loaded roster that includes a stellar recruiting class and preseason All-American Dedric Lawson, a transfer from Memphis.\n\nNo. 2 Kentucky has a similar type of roster, with former Stanford forward Reid Travis now in Lexington to lead a young, talented team.\n\nNo. 3 Gonzaga reached the Final Four two seasons ago and may have a more talented roster this season, though it will have to play the first two months without do-it-all forward Killian Tillie due to an ankle surgery.\n\nNo. 4 Duke has all those talented freshmen, No. 5 Virginia has plenty of talent coming back and motivation after losing in the NCAA first round, and No. 6 Tennessee has the type of roster that could lead to the program\u2019s first Final Four.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga.

When words stop meaning anything, when truth doesn\u2019t matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBesides encouraging Democrats to vote, Obama also tried to bring Republicans to his side.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be Democratic or Republican to say we\u2019re not going to target certain groups based on what they looked like or how they pray,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be Democrat or Republican to know that climate change is real and threatens our futures and our kids\u2019 futures.\u201d\n\nDuring Obama\u2019s speech, a protester shouted that Obama should \u201cdenounce ANTIFA\u201d \u2014 the protesters who square off against neo-Nazis.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a halt to hostilities within 30 days.\n\nGuterres urged the coalition and the Houthis \u201cto overcome obstacles and resolve differences\u201d at U.N.-facilitated talks later this month.\n\n\u201cViolence must stop everywhere,\u201d preferably immediately, he said.\n\nBut the secretary-general stressed that the U.N.\u2019s immediate priority is to stop the bombing in populated areas and preserve critical infrastructure including in the key port of Hodeida, the main entry point for international aid and 70 percent of food imports that Yemen relies on.\n\nGuterres spoke following the coalition\u2019s announcement earlier Friday that it bombed an air base adjacent to the airport in the rebel-held capital Sanaa allegedly being used by the Houthis to launch drone and ballistic missile attacks into Saudi Arabia. Intense fighting was also reported in Hodeida province.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that no missiles or other forms of aggression are sent against Saudi Arabia, and it\u2019s very important to stop bombing in urban areas, and it\u2019s very important to preserve basic infrastructure,\u201d the U.N. chief said. \u201cThat is why we are appealing for the kind of military action that is taking place from both sides to end.\u201d\n\nHe said the United Nations is seeing more and more countries engaged in helping to create conditions for the warring parties to understand not only the need for a cessation of hostilities but for serious political discussions.\n\nThe diplomatic initiative is being driven by the increasing threat of famine, but also by international outrage over the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi which has put a spotlight on Saudi Arabia\u2019s role in the war in Yemen.\n\nRussia\u2019s U.N.

The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nDeCologero is the second Massachusetts mobster suspected in Bulger\u2019s beating.\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment.

Puskar, File)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Hue Jackson didn\u2019t lose his nerve.\n\nFired this week by the Browns after winning just three of 40 games in two plus-seasons, Jackson on Friday disputed owner Jimmy Haslam\u2019s assertion there was \u201cinternal discord\u201d on the coaching staff that made his dismissal \u2014 along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley\u2019s \u2014 necessary.\n\nDays after being let go, Jackson appeared on ESPN to defend his record, describe regrets and essentially audition for another job.\n\nOn Monday, Haslam, who has fired four coaches in six years, intimated that in-fighting between Jackson and Haley were at the root of his decision to make a change halfway through the season.\n\nJackson disagreed with his former boss and said he wanted to \u201cset the record straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think it was truly just about internal discord,\u201d said Jackson, who went 1-15, 0-15 and 2-5-1 with Cleveland. \u201cI think that\u2019s a strong word. I think you have disagreements with coaches \u2014 with Todd, with (defensive coordinator) Gregg Williams, with Amos Jones, who is also the special teams coordinator. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s internal discord. I think when you look at it, the organization made a decision to go in a different direction.\u201d\n\nJackson knows he didn\u2019t win nearly enough, and he has some misgiving about the way he handled things. Following a recent loss to Tampa Bay, a frustrated Jackson said he intended to \u201cdive in\u201d and help Haley. Jackson said he was only trying to help, but the comments widened a rift with Haley and sent a shockwave through the team\u2019s front office.\n\nJackson feels that ultimately the decision to let him go was to protect rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield, who may finally end the franchise\u2019s search for a long-term QB.\n\n\u201cI think when you really stop to look at it, it\u2019s truly really about Baker Mayfield,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI think they want to do everything they can to put him in a situation. You got the first pick of the draft, who I think is going to be a franchise quarterback who is going to be a sensational player, and he\u2019s not playing as well. So again, here is a perfect storm to move forward and move on. And I have to respect the decision that they made.\u201d\n\nJackson said he was the one who hired Haley, who spent the previous six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Jackson didn\u2019t want to relinquish play-calling duties \u2014 he was also Cleveland\u2019s offensive coordinator in his first two seasons \u2014 but he felt it would be better if he got help.\n\nJackson now admits he should have never \u201cgiven away the offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that Todd Haley was a proven offensive play-caller, veteran play-caller in our division. Why would you not?\u201d Jackson said of Haley\u2019s hiring. \u201cI mean, let\u2019s be honest, I knew I was on the clock. You can\u2019t be 1-15, 0-16 and think, you know you can go through the season and not win football games. I wanted to surround myself with guys that have done it, and done it at a high level, and Todd Haley was definitely one of those guys.\u201d\n\nJackson said he felt it was important to go public with his feelings just days after being fired.\n\n\u201cI want people to understand \u2014 I\u2019m human just like anybody else,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I didn\u2019t do enough. We didn\u2019t do enough to get the job done in Cleveland. So what am I supposed to do? I\u2019m not going to go crawl into a hole and say pull the covers.\u201d\n\nJackson knows his 11-44-1 record as a head coach doesn\u2019t make him attractive to lead a team.\n\n\u201cI hope the next opportunity for me is to go back and be a coordinator first and foremost,\u201d he said. \u201cGo back and put my name back to where it should be, among some of the best play callers in this league.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart, File)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Political activist Leah McElrath was reviewing her electronic ballot at a polling place in Houston when she was shocked to find Republican Ted Cruz listed as her choice in Texas\u2019 high-profile U.S. Senate race.\n\nMcElrath had voted a straight ticket for Democrats, but the machine had switched her vote in the Senate race to Cruz, the incumbent. She snapped a quick photo, which she later posted on social media after seeing others making similar complaints.\n\n\u201cThe main thing isn\u2019t why it\u2019s happening \u2014 if it\u2019s malice, malfunctioning or poor design,\u201d McElrath said. \u201cIt just needs to stop.\u201d\n\nThe vote changes in Texas are just one example in a long list of concerns about the voting process that have surfaced in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nOutdated equipment, confusion among election workers, polling place closures and efforts in some states to make voting eligibility more rigorous are among the reasons for many of the complaints. Another factor: Early voting across the country has been heavier than during the previous midterm election, in 2014.\n\nThe election also comes amid heightened concern over potential cyberattacks following Russian efforts in 2016 to target state election networks. There have been no indications so far of any significant problems revolving around election security, although state and federal officials say they remain vigilant.\n\n\u201cWith the highly anticipated midterm elections nearing, my colleagues and I have worked non-stop to secure election systems and protect our democracy,\u201d Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, who serves as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn California, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Friday urged voters to make sure they know their rights, including the ability to cast a provisional ballot that can be counted later once a voter\u2019s eligibility is determined.\n\nIn the Texas example, the problem has affected both parties, with Cruz supporters also reporting their votes were switched. State officials said the problems can occur when voters complete and submit ballots too quickly. The vote-changing also is connected to a certain type of all-electronic voting machine that does not provide a paper trail, something voting experts say is a major concern because there is no way to verify later that an electronic ballot correctly captured the voter\u2019s intent.\n\nFive states \u2014 Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, and South Carolina \u2014use such machines exclusively.\n\nA handful of voters in Guilford County, North Carolina, have reported problems similar to those in Texas. County officials there have attributed the issue to old technology and been encouraging voters to double check their choices before submitting their ballots.\n\nIn Georgia, civil rights groups have filed several lawsuits over voter access in the weeks leading up to the election as Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams face off in a close contest for governor.\n\nThe groups say Kemp, who oversees elections as secretary of state, has been too aggressive in removing people from the voter rolls and implementing the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d law, which flagged some 53,000 voter registration applications. They say the policy disproportionately affects black, Latino and Asian-American applicants.\n\nThe law requires information on the forms to match certain state and federal records. Kemp has said the concerns are overblown because those on the list can still vote if they bring a valid photo ID that substantially matches the information on file, something already required under the state\u2019s voter ID law.\n\nAlso in Georgia, a high rate of absentee ballots rejected by election officials in a suburban Atlanta county triggered lawsuits by the ACLU and other groups. They said voters are not being given enough time to fix problems with their ballots.\n\nA judge ruled that voters should have until the Monday after the election, when results are certified, to verify their ballot when it\u2019s been flagged for a mismatched signature.\n\nIn Kansas, groups are raising alarm about physical access to polling places. Voters in Dodge City will have to travel outside the city limits to visit their polling place on Tuesday. Election officials moved the city\u2019s lone polling place, citing construction at the previous site.\n\nConcerns of voter confusion stemming from last-minute court rulings have arisen in a handful of states, while fliers with inaccurate information about deadlines for absentee ballots have circulated in Missouri and Montana.\n\nThe good government group Common Cause is monitoring voting concerns around the country. Its president, Karen Hobert Flynn, said most of the problems reported to date are fairly typical.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting to see what else will come out,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nHartounian reported from Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nJUCHITAN, Mexico (AP) \u2014 As he traveled with several thousand other migrants through southern Mexico this week with dreams of making it to the U.S. border, Gerson Rivas didn\u2019t want the memory of the mother he left behind in Honduras to be carried only in his heart.\n\nSo he had her name, Esperanza, tattooed in rudimentary, flowing black script on his left forearm. The name in Spanish means \u201chope.\u201d\n\nRivas had the work done in the Mexican city of Juchitan by Jose Manuel de Jesus Sandoval, a 20-year-old Honduran who has done similar rudimentary tattoos for several other fellow migrants in the caravan that set out about three weeks ago.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly what you\u2019d see at a standard tattoo parlor. Sandoval works at night by the glow of cellphones, when the migrants are camped out, or by day with everyone crowded around to watch, his tattoo machine connected to a shared extension cord.\n\nHe said he has the basics \u2014 the machine, ink, gloves, alcohol and gel. Needles can be hard to come by, though, and Sandoval was adamant that he discards each one after a single use. One evening this week, he had run out of clean needles and had a line of clients waiting.\n\nClad in a blue tank top, with his unruly mop of hair dyed the color of straw sticking up from the top of his head, Sandoval has come to be known in the caravan as \u201cthe tattooist.\u201d\n\nHe charges the equivalent of about $5 per letter. That has helped him stay fed \u2014 even though locals along the route have sometimes donated food and water to the travelers.\n\nSandoval\u2019s informal know-how comes from eight months he spent in jail in the U.S ., after he was in a car accident and was discovered to be in the country illegally.\n\nHe joined the caravan in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, where he\u2019d been living for several years after being deported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried 12 times to make it (to the United States). I only made it once, when I was 17, but they put me in prison because of the accident,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to draw and tattoo.\u201d\n\nHis clients in the caravan are the first people he\u2019s ever done tattoos for.\n\nSandoval said he knows his criminal record will make it tough for him to enter the U.S., but he intends to try anyway because he has a daughter in Honduras he wants to support.\n\nAnother man in the caravan showed off his forearm with the name of his daughter, Yulisa, written in a rough but flowery cursive. Yet another got a small cross done on his hand. And a young woman had Rivas inscribe the name of her boyfriend, who was accompanying her in the caravan.\n\nTaking proper care of the tender skin around new tattoos is difficult on the journey, where the migrants often walk dozens of miles each day and bed down for the night outdoors.\n\nThe 19-year-old Rivas, who had the name of his mother, Esperanza, inked on his arm, said he only finished the sixth grade but has worked as a masonry assistant. Once he gets to the U.S., he hopes to be able to send money back home to his mother and the rest of the family in Honduras, where nearly two-thirds of the population of almost 5.5 million lives in poverty.\n\n\u201cFamily is the most sacred thing we have. That\u2019s why I tattooed the name of my mother \u2014 to remember her,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going in order to look for work to help them. We needed food.

On Friday, Nov. 2, the U.S. government issues the October jobs report. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a U.S. economic expansion now in its 10th year, hiring remains robust, growth has picked up and the outlook is a mostly bright one on the eve of congressional elections.\n\nOn Friday, the government reported that employers added a strong 250,000 jobs in October and that the unemployment rate remained 3.7 percent, the lowest level in nearly 50 years. Pay also rose at a healthy pace. Consumers are confident, spending freely, fueling brisk economic growth and encouraging employers to keep hiring.\n\n\u201cUnemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP!\u201d President Donald Trump tweeted Friday morning. \u201cThese are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!\u201d\n\nYet one surprising element of the midterm campaign season has been how little the sunny economic picture appears to be benefiting Trump and Republican congressional candidates. Polls show that while voters broadly approve of the economy, they give low ratings to Trump himself. Many appear motivated by non-economic factors. And nationally, voters prefer Democrats to Republicans in elections for the House, according to surveys of voters\u2019 generic preferences.\n\nHere are five gauges of the U.S. economy as Election Day nears:\n\n__\n\nWAGES REV UP\n\nMany employers have long complained that they can\u2019t find enough workers to fill jobs. But in recent months it appears they have finally taken the step economists have long recommended: Pay more. Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the sharpest year-over-year gain since 2009.\n\nInflation has also increased in the past year, eroding some of the value of that increase. And a storm-related drop in average wages a year ago, resulting from Hurricane Harvey, helped inflate October\u2019s gain. Still, the pay growth suggests that the benefits of a healthy economy are rippling out to more people.\n\n__\n\nMORE JOBS AT HIGHER PAY MEANS MORE PEOPLE WORKING\n\nWith the unemployment rate so low, many economists have expected hiring to decline as businesses face a dwindling supply of unemployed people. Yet that hasn\u2019t happened. Average monthly hiring this year is above the pace of 2017.\n\nThe vigor of the job market is helping lead some Americans who were neither working nor looking for work to begin seeking a job. (People who don\u2019t have a job aren\u2019t counted as unemployed unless they\u2019re actively looking for work.) In October, the proportion of Americans with jobs reached its highest level in 10 years.\n\nMany of employers\u2019 most recent hires had struggled through much of the nation\u2019s 10-year recovery from the Great Recession. The proportion of people without a high school diploma who are now working is the highest on records dating to 1992. And the proportion of teenagers with jobs is at the highest level in a decade.\n\n__\n\nCONSUMERS SPENDING FREELY\n\nMore jobs at higher pay have helped underpin a burst of consumer spending. The Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts have likely also contributed. Americans increased their spending by 4 percent in the July-September quarter, the biggest acceleration in nearly four years. That spending helped the economy grow at a 3.5 percent annual rate last quarter.\n\nYet Americans are still saving a decent chunk of their income, with little sign that most people are amassing a risky level of debt. Savings equaled roughly 6.4 percent of income in the third quarter, up from a low of 2.5 percent in 2005.\n\n__\n\nHOUSING IS A WEAK SPOT\n\nRising borrowing costs are weighing on home sales, providing a preview of what might happen in the economy more broadly as interest rates rise and make loans more expensive.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates to try to prevent the economy and inflation from expanding too fast. The Fed\u2019s credit tightening has led to higher rates for the average 30-year fixed mortgage \u2014 4.8 percent, up from 3.9 percent a year ago.\n\nAs mortgage rates have risen, coinciding with higher home prices, sales of existing homes have fallen for six straight months. The Fed is expected to raise rates for a fourth time this year in December, and economists expect at least two further hikes next year.\n\n__\n\nOTHER SHADOWS LOOM\n\nBusinesses are nearly as optimistic as consumers. But they aren\u2019t spending as rapidly. Corporate investment in machinery, computers and other equipment barely rose in the July-September quarter, after two quarters of solid gains.\n\nSpending on factories and other buildings fell. Some of the third quarter\u2019s weakness reflected lower spending on oil and gas drilling equipment as oil prices fell.\n\nBut it also suggests that the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts for businesses haven\u2019t spurred as much investment spending as the administration had predicted. More investment in machinery and computers would help make the workforce more efficient and spur faster growth.\n\nSurveys of manufacturers suggest that Trump\u2019s trade war with China may have caused some of them to delay purchases of new equipment. Higher tariffs on Chinese imports have raised costs for many manufacturers.\n\nFor all the positive news, these trends have caused many economists to forecast slower growth in the final months of this year and into 2019. The economy appears on track to expand 3 percent this year, the fastest since 2005. But Fed policymakers expect growth to slide to 2.5 percent rate next year and to 2 percent in 2020.", "Rep.

(AP Photo/Tony Dejak, File)\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) \u2014 A broad smile creeps across Mississippi State coach Vic Schaefer\u2019s face when he talks about having one more season with his \u201cAircraft Carrier.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of his affectionate nicknames for 6-foot-7 senior Teaira McCowan. She is part of a trifecta of players who represent a rarity in basketball, whether in the NBA or the men\u2019s and women\u2019s college games: A traditional center that can dominate a game playing with their back to the basket.\n\nBaylor\u2019s Kalani Brown and Iowa\u2019s Megan Gustafson round out the trio.\n\nMcCowan\u2019s imposing height and wingspan helped carry the Bulldogs to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA Tournament national championship game the past two seasons. She was an All-American last year after averaging 18.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and more than two blocks a contest.\n\n\u201cYou put her on the low block, there\u2019s not anyone better in the country,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cI think for us and what we do offensively, she\u2019s an absolutely perfect fit.\u201d\n\nThe sport is moving toward versatile post players who have perimeter skills that include shooting 3-pointers. McCowan, Brown and Gustafson are showing there is still a place in the game for old-school centers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a luxury,\u201d Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not very many of them anymore.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a coincidence that the Bears, Bulldogs and Hawkeyes enter the season with high expectations. Baylor is ranked No. 4 in the preseason rankings while Mississippi State is No. 6 and Iowa is No. 13.\n\nSchaefer and Bluder say there are many reasons why traditional centers aren\u2019t very prevalent anymore. They say it\u2019s simply hard to find a good 6-6 athlete who enjoys physical contact and will put in the time to learn the footwork and technical skills needed to play on the block.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s slow and tedious,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cTeaira played 10 minutes a game her freshman year, then as a sophomore she\u2019s sixth player of the year. Her third year, she goes from not being on the All-SEC team to being an All-American.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen often. She bypassed a lot of steps between her sophomore and junior years.\u201d\n\nMcCowan said being so tall comes with challenges that guards might not have. Once she figured things out, the payoff was huge.\n\n\u201cI think me just getting comfortable in my own body helped,\u201d McCowan said. \u201cThen it was just listening to my coaches, them giving me moves and information on what to do and it made things come along.\u201d\n\nBrown and Gustafson have had career trajectories that look a lot like McCowan\u2019s. The 6-7 Brown went from starting just one game her freshman year to averaging 20.1 points and 10.2 rebounds while shooting 65 percent from the field as a junior.\n\nBrown said she understands the appeal of having tall players become more versatile and play on the perimeter, but there\u2019s a fine line where suddenly posts aren\u2019t using their strengths.\n\nThe trio of McCowan, Brown and Gustafson certainly stick to what works. The three have combined for 3,042 shots in their careers and have just one 3-point attempt between them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not many of us,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSixth, seventh, eighth graders \u2014 I see a lot of (younger) big girls dribbling early or even dunking. But I still think we should do what we do best.\u201d\n\nGustafson went from averaging 10.7 points during her freshman year to 25.2 points, 12.8 rebounds and more than two blocks per game last season as a junior. At 6-foot-3, she doesn\u2019t have the same imposing height of McCowan and Brown, but uses quickness to dominate in the Big Ten.\n\n\u201cI love playing against girls who are as tall or taller than me, so I can really use my agility and speed,\u201d Gustafson said.\n\nGustafson said she\u2019s worked on adding an outside shot, but like the others, she knows \u201cwhat my strengths are.\u201d One of those includes adding a hook shot to her game, which she learned partially by watching old videos of former NBA great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nBluder said it\u2019s that kind of dedication to perfecting her craft that makes Gustafson so valuable. In a game that\u2019s moving toward inside-outside post players, the coach said there will always be room on the floor for a true center.\n\n\u201cWhen you find one,\u201d Bluder said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hidden jewel.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg contributed to this story.

He's back at practice this week, eager to make up for lost time but cognizant of the delicate nature of the injury. (AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn, File)\n\nEAGAN, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Since the Minnesota Vikings made him their top draft pick last year, Dalvin Cook has played in only seven of a possible 24 regular-season games.\n\nThat means the early lessons have been just as much about handling injuries and making the most of the inaction as they\u2019ve been about picking up the playbook and adjusting to NFL speed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been gaining knowledge from my teammates, all the older guys,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThe guys in my room have just been pushing me through it. I\u2019ve been learning through this whole process, and I\u2019m just trying to become a better player and better person.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been getting from the whole experience, and it\u2019s nothing negative. Yeah, I\u2019ve been injured and banged up, but I\u2019m just learning through the whole experience. Once I get back, it\u2019s going to be on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of attitude that pushed him through the grueling rehab after a torn ACL in his left knee, suffered in the fourth game of his rookie season against Detroit. He stayed ahead of schedule and was ready in time for the opener this year, contributing 95 total yards in his first performance under new offensive coordinator John DeFilippo, who eagerly sought to maximize the versatile and elusive Cook\u2019s impact as a ball carrier and a pass-catcher as soon as he was hired last winter.\n\nThis fall has, by some measures, been more frustrating because of the seemingly minor hamstring injury Cook experienced on a hot afternoon in Green Bay on Sept. 16. He was ruled out of the following game, listed as questionable to play at Los Angeles on Sept. 27 and lined up at tailback in a limited role that night. Cook was deemed questionable again to play at Philadelphia on Oct. 7 and against Arizona on Oct. 14, but he ultimately watched both of those games from the sideline, too.\n\nThen the Vikings decided enough was enough and kept him off the practice field for two full weeks. After sitting out against New Orleans, his fifth absence in the last six games, Cook returned to practice as a limited participant on Wednesday. He said he never had a setback. The injury simply didn\u2019t fully subside.\n\n\u201cWith these things, if you kind of keep stepping on them and keep doing what you\u2019re doing, they\u2019re just going to keep lingering along,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to kind of shut the body down. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so confident in our medical staff, because they\u2019ve got the right plan set up for me. We\u2019ve been going by what my body has for me daily. My body\u2019s been reacting to it good, so it was very important.\u201d\n\nCook was listed as questionable for the game against Detroit on Sunday when this week\u2019s injury report was announced after practice on Friday. With the bye week coming next, the Vikings could always play it safe and give him even more time to heal. Coach Mike Zimmer downplayed the significance of the bye in the decision.\n\n\u201cIf guys can play, they play,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how we do it around here.\u201d\n\nNo matter how many times Cook has tested the hamstring, there\u2019s no telling whether it\u2019s back to normal until that first carry.\n\n\u201cYou can practice. You can run around. You can run straight. You can do all that,\u201d Cook said. \u201cBut it\u2019s about going out there and the person chasing you and you turning your body and you twisting your body and having the twitch to do it. That\u2019s when hamstrings occur.\u201d\n\nOther players listed as questionable for Sunday were wide receiver Stefon Diggs (rib), left tackle Riley Reiff (foot), cornerback Xavier Rhodes (foot) and strong safety Andrew Sendejo (groin). Linebacker Anthony Barr (hamstring), left guard Tom Compton (knee) and backup running back Roc Thomas (hamstring) were ruled out.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Editorials from around New England:\n\n___\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nThe Bulletin\n\nOct. 27\n\nOver the summer, Otis Library Executive Director Robert Farwell used Narcan on a person who had overdosed inside the library, and may have saved the person\u2019s life. He took training on how to administer the opioid overdose-reversal drug less than a month earlier.\n\nFarwell said of his action: \u201cI did what I had to do. I was just happy I took the time to get the training.\u201d\n\nThe incident caused a ripple effect. When Norwich City Manager John Salomone learned Farwell was trained through a city grant, Salomone requested for training to be expanded. Norwich Youth and Family Services, a branch of Norwich Human Services, obliged. The agency received a $7,500 grant from the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut to provide training and Narcan kits to 100 people in Norwich.\n\nEvery city department in Norwich was offered training, included were Norwich Public Utilities and the city\u2019s five volunteer fire departments. Realizing the importance of Narcan training, most jumped on board. Norwich police, however, did not.\n\nTheir reasoning: American Ambulance and city fire officials respond to medical emergencies and often arrive before police. Capt. James Veiga, of the police department, has said he is unaware of any plan to train the city\u2019s officers in the use of Narcan in the future.\n\nCity Council President Pro-Tempore Bill Nash, a member of the Public Safety subcommittee and retired Norwich police officer, wisely questioned Norwich police\u2019s hesitation to invest in a tool that can help curb death.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the opioid epidemic isn\u2019t slowing down. There were 33 accidental overdose deaths in Norwich last year, including five in December, according to medical examiner statistics. Norwich had 126 deaths between 2012 and 2017 \u2014 staggering statistics for a city of its size. Even clearer \u2014 equipping law enforcement with Narcan is saving lives.\n\nLast week, Gov. Dannel Malloy announced that Connecticut State Police have saved nearly 300 lives since the inception of a program that equips troopers with Narcan.\n\nPrior to October 2014, state law allowed only licensed health care practitioners to administer the medication without being civilly or criminally liable for the action. In response to the nationwide increase in opioid-related deaths, Malloy signed legislation that year modifying the law and authorizing anyone to administer Narcan as long as they believe in good faith that the person receiving the medication is experiencing an overdose.\n\nSince law enforcement is frequently the first to arrive to the scene of an overdose, we don\u2019t accept Norwich Police Department\u2019s deference on implementing Narcan. Training officers to use and carry Narcan is a relatively simple task, and one that could potentially save lives. At the very least, it would serve the public well if even a few officers were trained in the use of it. Plainfield police also don\u2019t carry Narcan, citing the same reasons as Norwich.\n\nBut both departments should re-consider their stance. Consider it a public service. Farwell did, and he very well could have saved a life.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2PzzdMR\n\n___\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nThe Cape Cod Times\n\nNov. 1\n\nA report earlier this month that the Trump administration is moving toward a strict definition about what defines a person\u2019s gender should be unsettling, not just for members of the LGBTQ community, whom it clearly targets, but for anyone who believes in upholding the basic dignity of individuals. If enacted, the move would represent a significant step backward for a country that has up until recently rightly seen itself as a bellwether for human rights. Now, however, that proud heritage and tradition risks being undermined by forces that seem intent on dividing rather than uniting us.\n\nThis is hardly the first volley against the LGBTQ community by this administration. Last year, President Trump indicated that he would ban individuals who are transgender from serving in the military, despite a military-commissioned report that indicated that their presence in no way negatively affected military preparedness.\n\nThe administration also oversaw a rollback of Obama-era guidance to public schools that encouraged school officials to allow individuals who are transgender to use the bathrooms of the gender with which they identified. This, despite numerous reports indicating that transgender and gay students are disproportionately more likely to feel threatened and suffer from suicidal thoughts than the general teenage population.\n\nThen there was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who issued a memo indicating that existing civil rights laws did not protect transgender individuals from workplace discrimination.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nBut there is something about these new rules under consideration that strikes so deeply to the core of who someone is that it deserves an enhanced level of outrage. The proposal, which the New York Times reported is circulating at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, would define gender as an unchangeable biological condition set at birth. Any questions arising as to the true gender of an individual would be settled through the use of genetic testing.\n\nThis would, of course, create an easily defined binary world where everyone fits nicely into one of two boxes, marked with either an M or an F. It would allow certain individuals, in their narrow minds at least, to erase not only the concept of being transgender, but gender fluidity, and even the medical condition known as gender dysphoria, a state of discomfort that comes with identifying with a gender that one was not born as. It would also essentially erase the legal identity of an estimated 1.4 million transgender individuals living in the United States today.\n\nIt would not, however, erase the fact that these individuals are our family members, our friends, our spouses, and our fellow citizens. It would not erase the pain and suffering that many of them have faced as they have undergone years of self-searching and self-examination as they tried to deal with the fact that they were born into a body with which they do not identify. And despite everything that the Trump administration seems committed to achieving, it would not erase them as human beings.\n\nFortunately, a large and vocal coalition of human rights advocates have begun to coalesce around challenging this effort, should it move forward. But they cannot act alone in this regard. This proposal should outrage anyone who values the dignity of the individual; who believes that no one \u2014 especially the government \u2014 has a right to define who anyone else is; who believes that laws of this country are designed to protect everyone within it, regardless of the gender with which they identify.\n\nIn short, it is time to send a clear and unmistakable message to those within this government who believe that they can use ignorance and fear to define and divide us: You will not succeed, because if you come after one of us, or one group of us, you come after all of us.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Jzr1a2\n\n___\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nThe Providence Journal\n\nOct. 28\n\nA survey by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, released earlier this month, produced sobering results: Only 36 percent of Americans would be able to pass the citizenship test that is given to immigrants. Passing, by the way, requires a score of a mere 60 percent.\n\nAmericans, it turns out, are ignorant on any number of subjects regarding their country: the U.S. Constitution, American history, and the basic structure of our government.\n\nThe questions are not particularly difficult, by the way. They used to be what was known as common knowledge.\n\nLowlights from the Wilson survey include: Less than a quarter knew why the colonists rebelled against the British. More than half did not know how many justices sit on the Supreme Court. A whopping 72 percent could not name the 13 original colonies. Some 37 percent thought Ben Franklin was famous for having invented the light bulb.\n\nAnd a stunning 60 percent of respondents did not know which countries fought against the United States in World War II \u2014 a particularly striking finding, given that some Americans who experienced World War II are still alive.\n\nThe deplorable results of the survey do not appear to be an outlier: a 2016 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, for instance, found that only 26 percent of Americans could correctly identify the three branches of the U.S. government. The same poll found that 37 percent of Americans could not identify any of the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nWe shudder to speculate that more Americans could correctly answer questions about the love lives of the Kardashians.\n\nWidespread ignorance is depressing in and of itself. But as Arthur Levine, president of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation, noted, \u201cIt would be an error to view these findings as merely an embarrassment. Knowledge of the history of our country is fundamental to maintaining a democratic society, which is imperiled today.\u201d\n\nWith voters heading to the polls in a little more than a week \u2014 many have taken advantage of early voting \u2014 the problem seems ever more urgent.\n\nInterestingly, the Foundation reported widespread differences by age.\n\n\u201cThose 65 years and older scored the best, with 74 percent answering at least six in 10 questions correctly. For those under the age of 45, only 19 percent passed the exam, with 81 percent scoring a 59 percent or lower,\u201d it reported.\n\nThat suggests that the problem is the American education system: That, at some point, it made the utterly wrong-headed decision that teaching civics is no longer important. The results are plain to see: A 2017 survey by the National Education Association found that only 25 percent of U.S. students reach the level of \u201cproficient\u201d on the NEA\u2019s civics assessment.\n\nAmerican education has many purposes, including preparing students for the economy of the future. But that\u2019s not the only point: perhaps its most important mission is to prepare citizens for the monumentally important \u2014 and difficult \u2014 task of self government. It is self-evidently failing on that score.\n\nThe good news is, some 17 states have made passing the citizenship test a condition of high school graduation. (Neither Rhode Island nor Massachusetts has, though.) More states should do the same.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2P74CGQ\n\n___\n\nVERMONT\n\nRutland Herald\n\nOct. 31\n\nIt\u2019s OK to be white. That fact is not being disputed here or anywhere else. But that\u2019s not really the point, is it?\n\nThis past weekend, a number of signs with the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be White,\u201d appeared on the campuses of the University of Vermont and Champlain College in Burlington.\n\nThe message, which has clear ties to white nationalists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan that date back to the early 2000s, is part of a widespread online effort to stoke controversy and racial division. This current campaign began nearly a year ago as a meme on 4Chan, an online forum popular among online trolls and the alt-right. Since then, signs bearing the message have appeared on high school and college campuses around the United States and Canada.\n\nIn a vacuum, the statement \u2014 that being a white person is acceptable \u2014 isn\u2019t provocative. White people face no social penalty for their whiteness. No individual or group is waging a war against white people or white culture. There is no governmental threat to white civil liberties.\n\nHowever, the statement doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. White nationalist ties notwithstanding, the slogan has reemerged in a political moment when racial anxieties are dangerously high. In this context, the signs are a deliberately provocative act, and the creators of the meme know it.\n\nIndeed, the acknowledged goal of the signs is to trigger liberals and cause a media firestorm that will make them look like hypocrites. As one anonymous 4Chan user put it, \u201cNormies tune in to see what\u2019s going on, see the posters saying It\u2019s Okay to Be White and the media and leftists frothing at the mouth (sic) . Credibility of far left campuses and media gets nuked, massive victory for the right in the culture war.\u201d\n\nThat goal has been aided by conservative pundits who have disingenuously taken the message at face value. \u201cSo it\u2019s not OK to be white?\u201d they ask while ignoring the obvious intent of the message and obfuscating its irrefutable connection to racist groups.\n\nConservatives have played a similar game with the Black Lives Matter movement \u2014 a movement created to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice \u2014 in an attempt to make a false equivalency, asking, \u201cWhy is it OK to say, \u2018black lives matter,\u2019 but not \u2018white lives matter?\u2019 Why isn\u2019t it \u2018all lives matter?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut these are arguments made in bad faith, and the rank-and-file conservatives who accept and repeat them are being played. White people who are tempted to defend the \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be White\u201d message and accept the false implication that other groups believe it\u2019s not OK to be white, must resist the urge to take the bait. The campaign is nothing more than a cynical ploy designed to exploit people\u2019s white fragility \u2014 the stress that elicits a defensive response in white people when confronted with racial inequality or injustice.\n\nBy taking offense, genuine or feigned, white people have re-centered themselves as the victims in a conversation about race. Like the popular deflection of \u201cI don\u2019t see color,\u201d it is a product of privilege \u2014 the privilege white people have to get out of discussing race when the conversation becomes too inconvenient, uncomfortable or difficult.\n\nLikewise, liberals must be measured in their response. While racism is indeed alive and well here in Vermont, these signs are part of a national campaign that stretches far beyond our borders. In discussing this troubling incident both in person and online, it\u2019s unproductive and unhelpful to paint white people who are less woke than you with a broad brush. Doing so can alienate potential allies and gives the trolls exactly what they want.\n\nYes, it\u2019s OK to be white. But if your whiteness prevents you from being an ally to people of color \u2014 from hearing and validating their experiences, from defending them from insult and injury, from speaking out against inequity, inequality and injustice \u2014 that\u2019s not OK.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2AJN1fs\n\n___\n\nMAINE\n\nPortland Press Herald\n\nNov. 2\n\nMore than five years into the opioid epidemic, it\u2019s frustrating to see people arguing about the concept of harm reduction.\n\nThat\u2019s the notion that people with substance use disorder will not be able to do the hard work of recovery if they are dead. Gov. LePage says that the overdose antidote naloxone doesn\u2019t really save lives because some people go back to using drugs after they are revived. But even he can\u2019t deny that a timely dose of the medication can keep people from dying, giving them a chance to save their own lives.\n\nThe same logic applies to other harm-reduction approaches, including needle exchange programs and the still-controversial concept of safe injection sites. But still, as the body count rises, harm reduction is met with opposition from people who believe it\u2019s best to send a strong message that drug use is not only dangerous but also morally wrong and should never be abetted.\n\nIn frustration over this struggle, a group that calls itself \u201cthe Church of Safe Injection\u201d is running an unlicensed mobile needle exchange program, distributing naloxone and advice about substance-use disorder treatment along with clean needles. It may be in a legal gray area, but they are doing the right thing, clinically and morally.\n\nMaine averages about one drug overdose death a day, but that is just part of the problem.\n\nIn addition to the overdose deaths, cases of fatal diseases like AIDS and hepatitis C are surging, spread by the use of dirty needles. Every transmission of an infection puts another life at risk, and makes the road back from drug use much harder. Legal needle exchange programs are licensed and operating in Portland, Bangor and other cities, but there are not enough of them to meet the need. There are no legal safe injection sites in Maine, where drug treatment information is distributed along with clean needles and other products that keep users safer than they would be out on the street.\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal. It would be much better if every drug user were ready to enter treatment and there were enough room in treatment programs for them. But common sense should tell you that you don\u2019t need to worry about \u201csending the wrong message\u201d by preventing people from hurting themselves. People who can\u2019t stop doing something that they know could kill them are not going to be \u201cscared straight.\u201d\n\nIt would be great if there were no need for the Church of Safe Injection, but people are dying unnecessarily. As long as harm reduction remains politically controversial, there is a need that can\u2019t wait.\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2DjhraL\n\n___\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nPortsmouth Herald\n\nOct. 30\n\nOn Monday night, an estimated 500 people of every race, creed and color filled Temple Israel Portsmouth and locked arms literally and figuratively; we prayed and sang and declared in a way that left no room for doubt that ours is a community of love and mutual respect and that here, on the Seacoast, hate has no home.\n\nThe area\u2019s religious leaders called us to prayer and reflection in response to the worst attack on Jewish Americans in the history of this nation; the murder Saturday of 11 congregants of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the wounding of additional congregants and courageous police officers who raced to the scene to protect the innocent.\n\nHatred is trying to gain a foothold in this nation.\n\nPeople in prayer have been murdered in houses of worship in Pittsburgh, in Charleston, South Carolina, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in too many places.\n\nW.B.

(AP) \u2014 That 0-2 start to the Pac-12 season seems like ancient history to Utah now.\n\nThe No. 16 Utes (6-2, 4-2 Pac-12) have won four straight, topping 40 points in each of the wins, and sit alone atop the Pac-12 South heading in to Saturday\u2019s game at Arizona State.\n\n\u201cThey have got a senior-laden defense with a lot of experience over there,\u201d Sun Devils coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give up a lot of points, averaging about 16 points a game. They have done a nice job up there.\u201d\n\nThe Utes, in their 14th season under coach Kyle Whittingham, are 3-0 against Pac-12 South opponents. They lost to Washington and Washington State before reeling off wins over Stanford (40-21), Arizona (42-10), USC (41-28) and UCLA (41-10).\n\nArizona State (4-4, 2-3) is coming off one of its biggest wins under first-year coach Edwards, a 38-35 victory over USC in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThey have some weapons,\u201d Whittingham said. \u201cThey have a very good running back. Their quarterback is dynamic and athletic and their receivers are as good as there is in the country. We have a lot of challenges, particularly for our defense, coming up this week.\u201d\n\nUtah leads the Pac-12 and is third nationally in rushing defense at 81.1 yards per game. The Utes lead the conference and are seventh nationally in total defense (287 yards) and lead the nation in red zone defense (54.5 percent).\n\n\u201cThey are big and physical up front, especially with their defensive line,\u201d Edwards said, \u201cand their secondary is pretty active.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s Cody Barton had seven tackles, an interception and a pass breakup last weekend against the Bruins.\n\nHere are some things to consider when the Utes visit the Sun Devils.\n\nROLLING MOSS: Utah\u2019s Zack Moss rushed for 211 yards, a career best, in last weekend\u2019s win over UCLA.\n\nThe junior has rushed for 964 yards, third-most in the conference and seventh nationally. So he needs just 36 yards for his second consecutive 1,000-yard season. Moss is averaging six yards per carry.\n\nEdwards called Moss \u201ca really downhill back.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to dodge you, he\u2019s going to run over you and you better tackle him,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nHARRY PROBLEM: One of the Utes\u2019 biggest challenges is corralling N\u2019Keal Harry, who is coming off a big game at USC.\n\nConsidered one of the best receivers in the country, Harry had two highly memorable plays in that game. His one-handed grab of a pass from Manny Wilkins went viral on Twitter and he had an unlikely reverse-the-field 92-yard punt return for a touchdown.\n\nThe performance alerted much of the country to the talented receiver\u2019s abilities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if maybe the East Coast people don\u2019t know,\u201d Edwards said, \u201cbut I think anybody who watches football and pays attention to it, they know how good he is. When he\u2019s playing well and (running back) Eno (Benjamin) and our offensive line is blocking, and Manny has time, our offense can be productive. We have some explosive players.\u201d\n\nMULTI-PURPOSE COVEY: Utah has a do-everything receiver in Britain Covey, who is tied for third in the conference in receptions with 48 for 531 yards. He is the only non-quarterback in the Pac-12 to throw two touchdown passes this season, a 56-yarder against Arizona and a 7-yarder against UCLA. Covey has five games of at least 100 all-purpose yards this season.\n\n\u201cHe is probably one of the most intelligent players that I have ever coached or been around,\u201d Whittingham said, \u201cso he can be taught all of those various positions where he is in the backfield or the slot or involved in special plays.\u201d\n\nBENJAMIN VS.

Lieb)\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri voters have a long track record on proposed tax hikes best summarized by one word: No.\n\nYet organizers of the \u201cYes on D\u201d campaign to raise Missouri\u2019s gas tax by 10 cents a gallon believe this may be the year when voters finally consent.\n\nWith only days to go before Tuesday\u2019s election, there is no organized campaign urging people to vote \u201cno\u201d on Proposition D and not a penny dedicated to counteracting the nearly $5 million raised by supporters.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a majority of the people \u2014 and a large majority of the people \u2014 who feel there\u2019s a funding gap\u201d for Missouri\u2019s roads and bridges, said Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who\u2019s been traveling the state in support of the gas tax hike.\n\nThe question is \u201cjust what fix is right?\u201d Kehoe added.\n\nFour years ago, a majority of voters said \u201cno\u201d to a proposed three-quarters cent sales tax that would have raised an estimated $534 million annually for roads and bridges.\n\nIn 2002, voters resoundingly defeated a proposed half-cent sales tax and 4 cent fuel tax that would have raised an estimated $483 million annually for roads, bridges and other modes of transportation.\n\nIn fact, since voters approved a constitutional amendment in 1996 requiring all tax increases over a certain amount to go to a statewide vote, not a single general tax increase has passed.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 30 other states have raised transportation taxes or fees over the past six years, according to an Associated Press analysis. That includes California, where voters will be deciding Tuesday whether to repeal a 2017 law that raised gas taxes and vehicle fees to generate about $5 billion annually for transportation.\n\nPrior tax increases have faced trouble in Missouri from both the political right and left, with some opposed to giving more money to government and others concerned about the fairness of who would be taxed. The coalition behind this year\u2019s measure includes Republican Gov. Mike Parson, state business and agricultural groups, local government and school associations, the trucking industry, unions and construction contractors.\n\n\u201cFor the state of Missouri to move forward in the future, infrastructure has a critical role, and I think people are really starting to understand that,\u201d Parson said.\n\nThe group that opposed the 2014 transportation initiative no longer exists. It had cited concerns that the sales tax hike would have burdened low-income people while requiring essentially nothing from cross-country truckers who cause some of the greatest wear on roads.\n\nThis year\u2019s proposal focuses on highway users. It would raise the state\u2019s 17-cent-a-gallon fuel tax in annual 2.5 cent increments, starting next July, until it reaches 27 cents a gallon in July 2022. The full tax hike would cost an estimated $5 a month for an average motorist who drives 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year, according to the SaferMo.com committee backing the initiative.\n\nWhen fully implemented, it\u2019s projected to raise at least $288 million a year for the state road fund and $123 million for city and county roads. That would cover only a portion of what the Missouri Department of Transportation says is a $745 million annual funding gap in state road and bridge needs.\n\nMissouri\u2019s gas tax hasn\u2019t changed since 1996 and is now the second lowest nationally behind only the oil-producing state of Alaska.\n\nDemocratic St. Louis Alderwoman Cara Spencer, who was involved in the 2014 opposition campaign, is among those supporting this year\u2019s proposed tax hike.\n\n\u201cGasoline tax has some level of regressiveness to it, but you\u2019re at least taxing the users, and most importantly those truckers that go through\u201d the state, Spencer said.\n\nFormer Democratic state Sen. Joan Bray, who also was part of the 2014 opposition, said she remains opposed to this year\u2019s measure, partly because none of the revenue would go to mass transit or public transportation.\n\nBray voiced her opposition in a column published by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but she said many other activists are focused on races for U.S. Senate and Congress or ballot measures to raise the minimum wage, legalize medical marijuana and revamp legislative ethics and redistricting rules.\n\n\u201cI think this time people are so stretched doing so many other campaigns that organizing over this one got very, very low priority,\u201d Bray said.

The team said his timeline to return to basketball activity will be updated in about six weeks, which means he could be out even longer.\n\nThe 30-year-old Love played in Cleveland\u2019s first four games before the pain became intolerable. He underwent tests this week and said doctors were still trying to determine the best course of action. Love said the injury became so severe he was having trouble walking and it was affecting his game as he made only 32 percent of his shots in his four games.\n\nEarlier this week, Love said surgery had not been ruled out and the team\u2019s medical staff, with input from outside physicians, decided that was the best option for the injury to heal completely.\n\nLove\u2019s injury and extended recovery are going to make things even tougher on a team that is 1-7 and regrouping after coach Tyronn Lue was fired Sunday. Cleveland is trying to develop young players while staying competitive, but with Love out it\u2019s going to be even harder.\n\nLove signed a $120 million, four-year extension with the club last summer shortly after James left as a free agent.\n\nThe five-time All-Star as missed 45 games because of injuries over the past two seasons. He averaged 19.0 points and 13.5 rebounds before being sidelined by the injury.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a week for the Cavs, beginning with Lue\u2019s dismissal.\n\nAssistant coach Larry Drew asked the team to restructure his contract if he\u2019s going to be the team\u2019s \u201cinterim\u201d coach and fill in for Lue this season.

(AP) \u2014 Four-term Republican U.S. Rep. Lou Barletta is seeking to unseat second-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey in Pennsylvania.\n\nCasey is backed by labor unions, gay-rights organizations and environmental advocacy groups. Barletta is backed by business trade associations and anti-abortion groups.\n\nThe election is Tuesday. Also on the ballot are Libertarian candidate Dale Kerns and Green Party candidate Neal Gale.\n\nA look at where Casey and Barletta stand on eight key issues, from abortion to trade.\n\n___\n\nThis is Barletta\u2019s first try for U.S. Senate.\n\nBarletta, 62, grew up in Hazleton, the son of a construction company owner who was chairman of the city\u2019s Democratic Party. The youngest of four brothers, Barletta was the first in his family to go to college and studied elementary education at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania. Before he graduated, he left to try out for the Cincinnati Reds major league baseball team. He flunked his tryout, he said, because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t hit a curveball.\u201d\n\nHe returned to Hazleton to work for the family construction business before starting a highway line-painting business that, he said, was Pennsylvania\u2019s largest line-painting business and the sixth-largest in the nation when he sold it 15 years later. Barletta ran for Hazleton mayor, taking office in 2000. In 2002 and 2008, he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. House, losing both times to incumbent Democrat Paul Kanjorski, before winning in his third try in 2010. In the meantime, Barletta had become a nationally known figure in the fight against illegal immigration.\n\nAs mayor of Hazleton, he wrote ordinances designed to combat illegal immigration and to keep people in the country illegally from coming to Hazleton. Those measures were never enforced before being blocked by federal courts. Even so, they inspired similar municipal ordinances around the country.\n\nIn Congress, Barletta compiled a lifetime 63 percent rating by the American Conservative Union through 2017, which makes him one of the more moderate Republicans in the House. He became one of the first members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary campaign in 2016.\n\nBarletta is married and has four daughters.\n\n___\n\nThis is Casey\u2019s seventh time running for statewide office.\n\nThe son of the state\u2019s former two-term governor, Casey, 58, inherited his father Bob Casey Sr.\u2019s name and political legacy as a conservative Democrat, although he has since shifted some policy positions to fall in line with the party\u2019s mainstream. He grew up in Scranton as one of eight children, graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and received a law degree from The Catholic University of America.\n\nIn 1995, he ran for state auditor general, winning two terms. In the midst of that, he lost an expensive and hard-fought Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2002 to Ed Rendell before he went on to win a race in 2004 for state treasurer. He had just begun serving as treasurer when he ran against Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum in 2006 in a nationally watched campaign. Casey won convincingly by 17 percentage points. In 2008, Casey became one of the first Democratic senators to endorse Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in that year\u2019s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHe secured a second six-year term in 2012 against coal mining entrepreneur Tom Smith, winning by 9 points in a relatively low-profile contest.\n\nCasey has long been popular with labor unions and moderated his stance on gun rights after the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Casey has an 87.7 percent lifetime voting rating with Americans for Democratic Action, putting him in the middle of the pack of Democratic senators.\n\nCasey is married and has four daughters.\n\n___\n\nABORTION\n\nCasey says he opposes abortion rights, except in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger and opposes proposals to halt federal payments to Planned Parenthood. He voted in January for legislation to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBarletta says he opposes abortion rights, with exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Barletta voted to end federal payments to Planned Parenthood and voted in 2017 to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n___\n\nDEFICIT and TAXES\n\nCasey voted against Trump\u2019s tax-cutting legislation that became law last December. He said he would support legislation to turn tax cuts benefiting Americans in the top 1 percent of income into a \u201csubstantial\u201d tax cut for the middle class.\n\nBarletta voted for the tax-cutting legislation signed by Trump. In 2014, Barletta supported non-binding legislation designed to balance the budget in 10 years by terminating health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act and making sweeping budget cuts \u2014 including to Medicaid, Medicare, food stamps, Pell Grants and farm subsidies \u2014 while leaving Social Security untouched and shifting more money to the Pentagon and health care for veterans.\n\n___\n\nENERGY and ENVIRONMENT\n\nCasey opposed Trump\u2019s rollback of the Obama administration\u2019s 2016 carbon pollution regulations on power plants, called the \u201cClean Power Plan,\u201d which had been halted by court challenges. Casey also opposed the Trump administration\u2019s move to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, a United Nations accord on global warming in which countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity in the coming decades.\n\nBarletta supported Trump\u2019s rollback of the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d in favor of a proposal to broadly increase the authority given to states to decide how and how much to regulate existing coal power plants. He supported Trump\u2019s move to leave the United Nations accord.\n\nCasey wrote legislation to create federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Barletta opposes federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing.\n\n___\n\nGUN RIGHTS\n\nCasey supports background checks for online gun sales and purchases at gun shows; a ban on the manufacture and sale of \u201cmilitary-style\u201d firearms; a ban on allowing people on the terrorist watch list to obtain a firearm; and a federal limit on magazine capacity.\n\nCasey opposes federal reciprocity legislation to require every state to recognize and allow the use of concealed carry licenses or permits issued by other states.\n\nBarletta said he would support expanding background checks for online gun sales and purchases at gun shows. He is opposed to restricting the sale of weapons, magazines and bullets.\n\nHe supports federal reciprocity legislation.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nCasey supports the 2010 federal health care law, known as the Affordable Care Act or \u201cObamacare,\u201d and has opposed efforts to repeal it. Casey supports legislation to allow people 55 and over to buy into Medicare.\n\nBarletta voted multiple times to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act before 2017. In 2017, Barletta supported a bill known as the American Health Care Act, which would let states get federal waivers to permit insurers to charge higher premiums to some people in poor health and to ignore the standard set of benefits required by the 2010 law. The bill stalled in the Senate.\n\nBarletta has supported non-binding GOP legislation to shift future retirees into a subsidy-based Medicare insurance purchased on the open market.\n\n___\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nCasey backed a bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 that would establish a path toward citizenship for an estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States and double aid for border security.\n\nCasey opposed GOP legislation barring federal funds from sanctuary cities, which are jurisdictions that resist turning over immigrants living in the country illegally to federal authorities.\n\nCasey opposed Trump\u2019s decision to rescind an Obama-era policy called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which has protected from deportation some 700,000 people, called \u201cdreamers,\u201d who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or who came with families that overstayed visas. The move to rescind it is on hold in federal courts.\n\nBarletta opposes \u201camnesty\u201d for immigrants living in the country illegally and supported Trump\u2019s decision to rescind DACA.\n\nBarletta introduced legislation to cut off all federal funding to sanctuary cities and to fund the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn June, Barletta backed a House bill that offered no path to citizenship for \u201cDreamers,\u201d authorized border wall funds, made it harder for immigrant citizens to bring relatives to the U.S. and took steps to crack down on illegal immigration. The vote failed.\n\nCasey opposed the Trump administration\u2019s ban on certain travelers from seven countries, upheld by the Supreme Court in June. Barletta supports it.\n\n___\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nCasey authored legislation to increase the federal minimum wage, set at $7.25 an hour since 2007, to $12 an hour by 2020 and to index it to the annual change in median wages.\n\nBarletta said he would support an increase in the minimum wage but said he did not know by how much.\n\n___\n\nTRADE\n\nCasey supports the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imports from China. He also supports the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum, but his campaign said he has urged the administration to reach a quick resolution with allies like Canada and Mexico and to ensure that trade remedies don\u2019t inadvertently impact Pennsylvania businesses and workers.\n\nBarletta\u2019s campaign said he supports both sets of tariffs \u2014 on imports from China and on steel and aluminum \u2014 as a tool to negotiate better trade deals for American workers and to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices.", "President Donald Trump speaks during at a campaign rally at Huntington Tri-State Airport, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Huntington, W.Va.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump ordered troops to the border in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States and still about 900 miles away, with many dropping out. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the military\u2019s mission:\n\nWHAT TROOPS ARE INVOLVED?\n\nMore than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California. They are a mix of forces, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units.\n\nAs of Friday, one week after the Pentagon acknowledged that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had approved a Department of Homeland Security request for military support at the border, the troop deployment was still unfolding, with about 3,500 at staging bases in the Southwest. Of those, about 2,250 active duty troops are at staging bases in Texas, about 1,100 Marines are at Camp Pendleton in California and fewer than 200 are in Arizona. About 100 troops are actually on the border, at the port crossing near McAllen, Texas.\n\nMost of the troops are being used to facilitate the movement of border patrol agents, house them, feed them and provide some of their protection.\n\nWHAT IS THEIR ROLE ON THE BORDER?\n\nThe Pentagon is adamant that active duty troops will not do law enforcement, which they are forbidden from doing under the Posse Comitatus Act in the Constitution. Troops can\u2019t arrest people at the border. Their main job will be to support the Border Patrol.\n\nThis means the military will transport border patrol agents to and along the border, help them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assist them with communications and provide some security for border agent camps. The military also will provide the border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals, and temporary housing.\n\nWILL TROOPS BE ARMED?\n\nYes, many of them will be, mainly for self-protection.\n\nMilitary police at the border will be armed, although they will have non-lethal options for dealing with unexpected conflict. Pentagon officials say they are planning for a worst-case scenario of violence that could force soldiers to rely on their training to make split-second decisions to defend themselves or civilians. MPs might, for example, be dispatched to provide armed security for military engineers placing barricades at locations where there are no border patrol agents to provide protection.\n\nOne day after Trump suggested soldiers on the southwest border may open fire if migrants throw rocks at them, he insisted Friday that he meant that rock-throwers would be arrested. \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018shoot,\u2019\u201d he told reporters at the White House. Either way, his scenario of violence captures in a nutshell the risk of using active duty troops for domestic security: Their mission does not include confronting migrants, but some may be unable to avoid it.\n\nThe commander in charge of the military operation, Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, head of U.S. Northern Command, said earlier this week that handling migrants will be primarily the job of the Customs and Border Protection agency. But he acknowledged \u201cthere could be incidental interaction\u201d between migrants and soldiers. In light of that possibility, the soldiers \u201care going to be fully trained in how to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nLt. Col. Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the military will not disclose details of its rules on the use of force.\n\nDOES CONGRESS SUPPORT THIS MISSION?\n\nWith members of Congress focused mainly on Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, reaction has been mild. A group of senior House Democrats wrote a letter to Mattis on Thursday expressing opposition to the military mission and demanding answers on its cost. The deployment of active duty troops, they wrote, \u201conly exacerbates the potential to unnecessarily escalate the situation.\u201d\n\nChuck Hagel, a former Republican senator and Army combat veteran who served as defense secretary under President Barack Obama, told CNN the mission is \u201cfolly\u201d because there is \u201cno need, no threat.\u201d\n\nRetired Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, who preceded Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took double-barreled aim at the border mission. Writing on Twitter Thursday, he called the military mission a \u201cwasteful deployment of over-stretched Soldiers and Marines\u201d that would be \u201cmade much worse\u201d if they used force disproportional to the threat they face on the border.", "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence rallied several hundred fellow Republican conservatives Friday in hopes of pushing Senate candidate Josh Hawley in Missouri and governor candidate Kris Kobach in Kansas to narrow victories in states that President Donald Trump won handily two years ago.\n\nPence and other speakers highlighted low national unemployment and said the United States is stronger economically and militarily under Trump\u2019s leadership, as several others suggested that a Democrat-controlled Congress would seek to impeach Trump. They also portrayed Democrats as unwilling to fight illegal immigration, with Kobach saying that Democrats suffered from \u201copen borders psychosis.\u201d\n\nThe rally came on the day the U.S. government released figures for October showing strong job growth, higher wages and low unemployment.\n\nHawley, the Missouri attorney general, has wedded himself to Trump and the president\u2019s agenda in trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable Senate incumbents this year. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, is Trump\u2019s closest ally in his state and is in toss-up race with veteran Democratic state Sen. Laura Kelly.\n\nThe rally at a Kansas City, Missouri arena was sponsored by the American Conservative Union and the Family Research Council. It also was designed to boost congressional candidates, especially in Kansas, where Democrats hope to oust Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder in the Kansas City-area and flip another seat in eastern Kansas held by retiring Rep. Lynn Jenkins.\n\n\u201cYou look around this country and you can just feel it, can\u2019t you? Confidence is back. Jobs are coming back. In a word: America is back,\u201d Pence said. Later, he added, \u201cReally, it\u2019s a choice between resistance and results, and just like two years ago, we need Missouri and Kansas to vote for results.\u201d\n\nTouching on an issue that fires up conservatives, Hawley and other speakers criticized McCaskill for voting against the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His confirmation was nearly derailed when California college professor Christine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh assaulted her when they were both teenagers, which he strongly denied.\n\nHawley called McCaskill \u201cpart of the smear campaign\u201d against Kavanaugh, though the Missouri senator does not serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee and cited reasons other than Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations in voting against him.\n\nThe issue resonates with Shauna Hasek, a 40-year-old social worker and Republican whose husband is the mayor of Harrisonville, Missouri. She wore elephant earrings and a shirt with a quote attributed to Ronald Reagan: \u201cEvil is powerless if the good are unafraid.\u201d Laughing, she said, \u201cSo I should say, Claire is powerless if Josh is not afraid.\u201d\n\nShe called McCaskill\u2019s vote against Kavanaugh \u201ca big deal\u201d as she waited in line to get into the arena.\n\n\u201cAs a woman, yes, I support women and their movement, if something really did happen to them, but you also, again, have to have evidence,\u201d Hasek said.\n\nImmigration also was on the minds of rally participants. The crowd chanted \u201cBuild the Wall!\u201d at one point in reference to Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nKobach has built a national profile as an advocate of tough immigration laws, has advised Trump\u2019s campaign and the White House on homeland security issues and has made enacting state policies against illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign for governor. He drew noticeably louder applause and cheers at the rally than Hawley.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats, I\u2019ve said, are in the third stage of open borders psychosis,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cThey\u2019re not content to cheer for the illegal aliens already here. They\u2019re cheering for more illegal aliens to come into the country.\u201d\n\nKelly has said combatting illegal immigration requires comprehensive legislation from Congress and contends Kobach\u2019s policies would hurt the state\u2019s agricultural economy, particularly in western Kansas. But Kobach has ramped up his focus on immigration at the end of his campaign, expressing his concern about a caravan of several thousand migrants moving slowly through Mexico.\n\nSo has Trump, and in his rally speech, Pence called the caravan \u201cnothing more than an assault on our country\u201d and suggested that it had been organized by \u201cleftist groups\u201d in Central America, as well as human traffickers.\n\nThe rally opened with prayers in remembrance of the 11 people gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue last week, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Pence called the attack \u201cunspeakable,\u201d adding, \u201cIt was evil.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna .", "FILE - In this Jan. 20, 2018 file photo, Women's March demonstrators walk past the White House in Washington.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Gender politics have been a defining issue of this election cycle, beginning back with the mobilization by women against the victory and inauguration of President Donald Trump.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether the #MeToo movement \u2014 and the controversy that sometimes surrounds it \u2014 will translate into political success for either party on Tuesday.\n\nMore women than ever before won major party primaries for Congress and governor this year, giving women the chance to significantly increase their numbers in office. They\u2019re donating more money to political campaigns, too, and they\u2019ve become a well-established force in the 2018 elections.\n\n\u201cI feel very good about where women are going to be,\u201d said Christina Reynolds, the vice president of communications for EMILY\u2019s List, a group dedicated to supporting Democratic women in politics. \u201cI think regardless of what happens, women have shown that they are no longer happy with other people representing them and speaking for them.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans, too, feel the focus on gender politics could benefit them. The fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court galvanized their voters, they say, and could be a factor in races including the close re-election campaign for Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.\n\nIn races across the country, female congressional candidates are running in record numbers. And it's not just candidates who will affect the outcome of this year's election. Women voters could make a big difference in tight House races. (Nov. 2)\n\nMeanwhile, #MeToo\u2019s impact has had ripples in other races, too. In Minnesota, Rep. Keith Ellison is fending off allegations of abuse from an ex-girlfriend that have turned the race for state attorney general on its head. Ellison has denied those allegations. In the same state, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat, and Karen Housley, a Republican, are fighting over the seat that Smith was appointed to after Al Franken resigned following allegations by women that he touched them inappropriately.\n\nLike most midterm elections, the 2018 campaign is also a referendum on the incumbent president. And among women, who vote historically at higher rates than men, Trump\u2019s standing is still bleak. In the latest NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll, 49 percent of women said that they disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance, compared with 44 percent of men. And 51 percent of women overall said that Trump would be a major factor in their vote.\n\n\u201cWomen have been energized for a long time, and it\u2019s connected to Donald Trump,\u201d said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser for MoveOn.org and a veteran of four Democratic presidential campaigns. \u201cWe are in this really awful time where people are just tired and ready and there\u2019s been such an energy around electoral politics, for at least a year since the Women\u2019s March.\u201d\n\nRepublican women say they, too, can lay claim to a share of the energy, particularly in the weeks since the bruising fight over Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. Alice Stewart, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns, said it\u2019s critical that the #MeToo movement \u201cstay strong and continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has done a lot of good to hold men in power and men who have committed these acts accountable,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIn terms of significance, it is greater than the midterm elections.\u201d\n\nBut, Stewart added, in the case of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the movement was \u201ctemporarily hijacked for certain groups for their own gain,\u201d a tactic that she believes ended up hurting Democrats.\n\n\u201cIn that instance, it backfired. It galvanized Republicans. It made them unite behind Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d she said. \u201cI say it backfired in that it reignited the intensity of Republicans due to the levels that the Democrats would go to, to turn the confirmation process into such a character assassination.\u201d\n\nBut women who opposed Kavanaugh said the energy from recent protests in Washington and elsewhere over his nomination would fuel Democratic women in 2018 and beyond.\n\nKelley Robinson, the national organizing director for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, remembered standing on the Supreme Court steps, addressing a rally after Kavanaugh was confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt that kind of wave of sadness, of grief and of anger that I felt in front of that large group,\u201d she said.\n\nRobinson said she believes that voters \u2014 and particularly women \u2014 will remember that fight. Every senator that voted for Kavanaugh, Robinson said, \u201cthey sided with folks that disbelieved, that mocked survivors and sided against women.\u201d\n\nSarah Sherman, who founded Vote MeToo PAC to support female candidates this year, said that after the Kavanaugh vote she personally felt \u201creally steamrolled, but we peeled ourselves off the pavement\u201d to continue to fight on behalf of women.\n\nThe fight was \u201cdefinitely something that has galvanized Republicans,\u201d she said. But she also said there may be women \u2014 some survivors of assault themselves \u2014 who will be propelled to the polls by the Women\u2019s March, the Kavanaugh battle and in rebuke to the Trump presidency who go unseen.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re walking in there, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself to anyone. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself to your boss,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still have your vote.\u201d\n\nSome women said that while #MeToo is not explicitly aimed toward electing more women or driving female voters to the polls, the movement and the new wave of women in politics share the same fuel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about ways of approaching the same basic problem: A group of people who have not seen themselves reflected in the power system is stepping up and saying, \u2018This isn\u2019t working for me. I want to push back against the status quo because otherwise, I won\u2019t be protected or fought for,\u2019\u201d said Amanda Litman, a co-founder of Run For Something, which helps left-leaning millennials run for office.\n\nAt its core, the #MeToo movement is a cultural movement, and cultural movements often far outpace national politics, said Shaunna Thomas, a co-founder of Ultraviolet, which advocates for women\u2019s rights. She noted that November\u2019s elections are the first \u201csince women around the country started demanding that sexual abusers be held accountable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn electoral outcome at this stage is a lot to expect of a movement that is about challenging patriarchy -- it\u2019s a huge goal,\u201d offered Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, we want fewer women to be sexually assaulted or raped or harassed. What we\u2019re demanding is a world where women have control over their own bodies, their own minds. That\u2019s a project that goes far beyond needing to build and exercise electoral power.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "The Latest: Trump says he\u2019ll meet China\u2019s Xi at G-20 meeting\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 9, 2017, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping participate in a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China.

The junior quarterback was under observation after a hard hit in the second half of the Arizona loss. He was not yet formally named starter for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nHe has thrown for 2,069 yards and 20 touchdowns with six interceptions on the season.\n\nReceiver Dillon Mitchell, who also was being monitored for a concussion, had not returned to practice by Wednesday. He\u2019s got 48 catches for 677 yards and four touchdowns for the Ducks this season.\n\nUCLA\u2019S QUARTERBACK? Last weekend against Utah, Wilton Speight made his first start since the season opener, pressed into duty by Dorian Thompson-Robinson\u2019s injured shoulder. Speight passed for 164 yards and ran for another 30.\n\nKelly wasn\u2019t revealing his starter for Oregon, and wouldn\u2019t even go so far as to say Thompson-Robinson would start if he was healthy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a hypothetical guy, so there\u2019s no reason to make any predictions on this or that.

(AP) \u2014 Some county election officials in Kansas are undermining nonpartisan efforts to help voters at polling sites who may be having problems voting, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas said Friday.\n\nIts Kansas Election Protection Program helps voters who encounter obstacles at polling sites such as finding their names are not on voter rolls or who may be confused about such things as voter ID requirements, provisional ballots or finding their correct polling location. The ACLU wants to put up signs near polling places with a phone number people can call for help.\n\nState Attorney General Derek Schmidt issued an Oct. 22 opinion saying that such nonpartisan voter assistance programs that are within 250 feet of polling places do not constitute \u201celectioneering\u201d for candidates and are therefore allowable. But the ACLU says some county clerks not following the attorney general\u2019s opinion.\n\nBut the attorney general\u2019s decision came down too late for them to mobilize on-site election volunteers to help voters at polling locations across the state during the Nov. 6 general election, something the group did during this year\u2019s primary election, said Ellen Glover, field director for the ACLU of Kansas.\n\nMost of the pushback to its Kansas Election Protection Program is in Johnson County, the state\u2019s most populous county. Other counties that have pushed back on the voter assistance efforts have included Lyon County as well as Ford County, where the sole polling site for Dodge City voters has drawn national attention.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why some of the county clerks and poll workers are so opposed to people getting help when they encounter problems voting,\u201d Glover said, adding its election hotline and the observers deployed during the primary simply ensure votes from eligible citizens are counted.\n\nJohnson County Election Commissioner Ronnie Metsker said he was trying to maintain a \u201cclear zone\u201d free of any distraction outside the polling site entrance, not to harm any organization.\n\n\u201cWe are talking 250 feet \u2014 after that it is a free country,\u201d Metsker said.\n\nMetsker sent an Oct. 30 letter to the ACLU telling them they cannot post signs with the voter help hotline number within 250 feet of any polling location or on county property because of the possibility of electioneering by the person being interviewed.\n\nRather than get into \u201ca petty fight\u201d over the distance, the ACLU plans to have volunteers in Johnson County post the voter assistance hotline number on signs that are more than 250 feet away from polling places, Glover said.\n\nThey have volunteers who will be posting signs with hotline number near polling sites at 15 counties.

(Boston Police/The Boston Globe via AP)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Sending Boston crime boss James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger to a troubled federal penitentiary that housed other New England mobsters was like giving him a \u201cdeath sentence,\u201d a prison workers\u2019 union official said Friday.\n\nBulger, who ran the largely Irish mob in Boston in the 1970\u2032s and \u201980\u2032s and ratted on the New England Mafia, was killed Tuesday just hours after his arrival at USP Hazelton, the third killing in six months at the remote prison in West Virginia, where workers and advocates have long been warning about dangerous conditions .\n\nThe 89-year-old should never have been transferred to Hazelton, said Jose Rojas, who represents workers at the Florida prison where Bulger was previously held.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t send someone like Whitey Bulger there. Number one, because he\u2019s high profile, and number two because he\u2019s a snitch,\u201d Rojas said.\n\n\u201cSomebody dropped the ball when they designated him to Hazelton ... It\u2019s a death sentence,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal law enforcement official has told The Associated Press that disciplinary issues prompted Bulger\u2019s transfer from the Coleman prison in Florida, where he was serving a life sentence for participating in 11 killings. The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to release details.\n\nIn February, Bulger threatened an assistant supervisor at Coleman, telling her \u201cyour day of reckoning is coming,\u201d said Rojas, who works at the prison. Bulger received 30 days in disciplinary detention, he said.\n\nBureau of Prisons officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. They previously declined to comment on why Bulger was moved.\n\nTwo Massachusetts mobsters are under suspicion in Bulger\u2019s killing, authorities say, but no charges have been filed.\n\nA law enforcement official said Friday that one suspect is 44-year-old Paul J. DeCologero, who was part of an organized crime gang led by his uncle on Massachusetts\u2019 North Shore called the \u201cDeCologero Crew.\u201d The official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation.\n\nA former federal investigator told the AP that Fotios \u201cFreddy\u201d Geas, a Mafia hit man who is said to hate \u201crats,\u201d is also a suspect. That official likewise refused to be named, citing the ongoing probe into Bulger\u2019s death.\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment. Federal officials have only said they are investigating Bulger\u2019s death as a homicide.\n\nDeCologero was convicted in 2006 of racketeering and witness tampering charges for a number of crimes. Authorities say he bought heroin that was used to try to kill 19-year-old Aislin Silva, who his uncle wanted dead because he feared she \u201cwould betray the crew to police.\u201d\n\nThe heroin didn\u2019t kill her, so another man broke her neck, dismembered her and buried her remains in the woods.\n\nJeanne Kempthorne, an attorney who represented DeCologero on his appeal, said she had no reason to believe DeCologero had any animus toward Bulger. DeCologero is supposed to be released in 2026, online records say.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time seeing a motive,\u201d Kempthorne said.\n\nThe other suspect, Geas (JEE\u2019-us), was a close associate of the Mafia and acted as an enforcer, but was not an official, \u201cmade\u201d member because he is Greek, not Italian.\n\nGeas and his brother were sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for their roles in several violent crimes, including the 2003 killing of Adolfo \u201cBig Al\u201d Bruno, a Genovese crime family boss in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nAnother mobster ordered Bruno\u2019s killing because he was upset he had talked to the FBI, prosecutors said.\n\n___\n\nLavoie reported from Richmond, Virginia.

Septic tank laws certainly are an unlikely means of grabbing power.\n\nFerebee was charged in 2015 over allegations his rural Hill City property\u2019s septic system lacks a permit, required to prevent septic tanks from leaking into streams and watersheds.\n\nFerebee believes the nature of his landholding makes it exempt, and he has repeatedly challenged the law\u2019s legality. Over the years, city and county governments have rejected the departing Pennington County commissioner\u2019s complaints, as have the state Water Management Board and voters \u2014 Ferebee lost to fellow Republican Ron Rossknecht by 32-points in the June primary election. So far, judges have also rejected his arguments.\n\nThis country affords wonderful freedoms \u2014 limited by well-considered rules like those that keep your sewage from making others sick.\n\nOne of those cherished freedoms is the right to tilt quixotically at windmill giants \u2014 or in Ferebee\u2019s case, septic tank laws. After eight years of defeats in his ongoing political and legal campaigns, most people would recognize a lost cause for what it is. A law is a law, and if you can\u2019t convince others to change it, you live within it. Flout the law, and you must pay the fine. Speeders, thieves and frauds confront this lesson daily. Contest a violation and you also pay the court costs.\n\nUnless you\u2019re George Ferebee, and you can convince a small, publicly funded board of cronies to back your quixotic campaign.\n\nOn Oct. 9, the nine-member board of the West Dakota Water Development District, which collects a total of about $200,000 annually from property taxpayers west of the Cheyenne River in Pennington County, voted 6-3 to commit up to $7,500 to fight local regulation of septic systems. The board\u2019s mission is to protect water resources, and it\u2019s hard to see how funding one man\u2019s legal challenge does that.\n\nThis wasteful mistake isn\u2019t on Ferebee. He can pick fights and pay the consequences. This inappropriate and misguided use of public funds is on the six members of the board who flushed up to $7,500 down the drain. Luckily, voters will get a chance to pass judgment on their action Tuesday.\n\nEven West Dakota board member Jeannette Deurloo, who opposes the septic tank rules and admits Ferebee recruited her to the water board, describes the $7,500 authorization as an improper use of public funds to support a private legal fight.\n\n\u201cThis is not the purpose of what we\u2019re here for,\u201d said Deurloo. \u201cThis is not in our bylaws that we finance legal aid to citizens.\u201d\n\nThree of those who voted in favor of financially backing Ferebee\u2019s crusade \u2014 Ken Moss, Michael Mueller and Ernest Getty \u2014 face challengers at the polls next Tuesday.\n\nFor years, Ferebee has promoted himself as a warrior against wasteful public spending.

Chief Justice David Gilbertson recalled Zinter as immersing himself into every case with detailed research because he believed in the case\u2019s importance to someone. Gilbertson and Zinter were the only two justices based out of Pierre full time. Zinter was appointed the 45th Supreme Court justice in 2002 and previously served as a circuit judge for 20 years. Over the years, Zinter and the other justices heard cases during Supreme Court sessions at Mount Marty College and the University of South Dakota. Zinter became a quadriplegic following an accident, but continued his law career and inspired others with his example.\n\n\u2014 On The Alert\n\nTHUMBS UP to a new type of alert that will be issued by the National Weather Service: a Snow Squall Warning. According to the NWS, this refers to \u201csudden white-out conditions that move in and move on quickly. They typically only last 15 to 30 minutes and often cause flash freezing of road surfaces in addition to the whiteout conditions. If a Snow Squall Warning is issued for your area, it is best to avoid or delay motor travel until the squall passes through.\u201d While perhaps not as sweeping as, say, a blizzard, snow squalls can created dangerous situations with very little (if any) notice; if you\u2019ve driven through one, you know how hazardous they can be. Hopefully, these warnings can aid travellers \u2014 and maybe prevent bad situations from happening.\n\n\u2014 Vandalism\n\nTHUMBS DOWN to the vandalism at the Apostolic Faith Church in Vermillion. A suspect has been identified and faces charges in last weekend\u2019s vandalism of the church. The Vermillion Police Department announced the case was solved as authorities identified and interviewed the suspect, who was not named in the Facebook post. The VPD was working with the Clay County state\u2019s attorney regarding possible charges. Authorities don\u2019t believe a threat exists to anyone at this time. The Rev. Greg Robinson, the church\u2019s pastor, discovered the vandalism when he and his son arrived at the church to prepare for services. A dry-erase board contained an apocalyptic message, and the church contained the smell of gas. The authorities were alerted, and services were moved to a parishioner\u2019s home. Robinson, who is black, told the Press & Dakotan that he suspected race may be connected to the vandalism.\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s Time\n\nAs is our pessimistic custom (sorry, but it\u2019s been a long week, plus it\u2019s election season), THUMBS DOWN in advance to those people who forget to move their clocks back at 2 a.m. Sunday for the start of Standard Time. Yes, it can be a pain, but at least you get an extra hour of sleep out of it, so it\u2019s a nice reward.

It was held at the Mike Durfee State Prison, a medium-security facility in Springfield, S.D. Given South Dakota\u2019s ultra-low unemployment numbers, and the fact that former inmates who land good jobs are much less likely to re-offend, this is a great idea. About 325 inmates met with 15 potential employers during the event, which was held after the success of the prison\u2019s first job fair held last April. Putting former inmates to work at jobs that pay a living wage is a win-win situation. Companies desperate for workers benefit, and the state will likely have fewer repeat offenders heading into an already-crowded prison system.\n\n\u2014 Thumbs up: Speaking of unemployment...\n\nWatertown\u2019s jobless rate sat at 2.8 percent in September, which is a pretty low number. But in October, it fell by nearly a half-percentage point to 2.4 percent. Only Huron, Pierre and Sioux Falls had lower numbers among the state\u2019s 10 largest cities. The numbers show that the economy in South Dakota is doing well, and highlight the fact that we need to keep workforce development on the front burner. With so few workers available, many companies that want to expand may have difficulty doing so.\n\n\u2014 Thumbs down: Follow the money\n\nWe reported this week that campaign spending on the race for the South Dakota governorship is around $10 million. But the time the campaign is over, the candidates in all likelihood will have spent more than during any previous governor campaign in state history. The big problem is that much of that money comes from out-of-state sources. Why would non-South Dakotans pony up millions of dollars in an effort to get a particular candidate elected to Pierre? We believe it\u2019s more about pushing a particular political ideology than electing the best person for the job. When you see all of the negative ads, remember that it isn\u2019t always South Dakotans paying for them. And most importantly, don\u2019t let them determine how you cast your vote,\n\n\u2014 Waiting to see: Out with Molly, in with Rocco\n\nWe don\u2019t usually hedge our bets, but we\u2019re not sure which direction this thumb should go. We\u2019re talking about the Minnesota Twins\u2019 recent announcement that they are replacing manager Paul Molitor with young Rocco Baldelli. Molitor was a hometown hero with a Hall of Fame ring, and Baldelli is a 37-year-old with no managerial experience. We liked Molitor and were surprised with the move, despite the Twins disappointing season. We are, however, willing to give the kid a chance and see what he can do. The last time the Twins hired a manager in his mid-30s, things worked out pretty well. His name was Tom Kelly, and he led the Twins to a pair of World Series championships before retiring. Let\u2019s hope Baldelli can come close to matching TK\u2019s success.", "Teen pleads no contest in slaying of Ohio woman, 98\n\nMEDINA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 A 17-year-old boy has pleaded no contest in the strangulation death of a 98-year-old Ohio woman.\n\nThe Medina Gazette reports a judge found Gavon Ramsay guilty of aggravated murder, gross abuse of a corpse and other charges Friday after his plea.

Messitte to put the case on hold while they appeal his decision to a higher court in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThat effort failed.\n\n\u201cThis is another major win for us in this historic case,\u201d said District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine in a statement. \u201cOur next step is to proceed with discovery. We will soon provide the court a new schedule to begin the process of getting information about how President Trump is profiting from the presidency.\u201d\n\nMessitte wrote in a sometimes blistering 31-page opinion that the president did not sufficiently meet the requirements for an appeal midway through the ongoing case.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the president, unhappy with the court\u2019s reasoning and conclusion, merely reargues that his interpretation of the emoluments clauses should apply instead of the one the court gave,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court sees no point in stating again why it concluded as it did.\u201d\n\nBut, Messitte said, merely disagreeing with the court doesn\u2019t constitute a required \u201csubstantial\u201d reason for such an appeal.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco told The Associated Press that the department \u201cdisagrees with and is disappointed\u201d by Messitte\u2019s ruling. She added: \u201cThis case, which should have been dismissed, presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review.\u201d\n\nJustice lawyers had objected to any discovery on a sitting president in his official capacity because of separation of powers concerns, in order to avoid a \u201cconstitutional confrontation\u201d between two branches of government. They argued that the \u201cpublic interest is decidedly in favor of a stay because any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President\u2019s performance of his constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nThe president could try to seek a writ of mandamus to have the appeal heard by a higher court. That would be an \u201cextraordinary remedy,\u201d according to the Justice Department\u2019s website, that \u201cshould only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a move with a demanding standard for petitioners that would partly rest on showing Messitte\u2019s decisions to be clearly wrong.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Maryland and the District of Columbia, have said they plan to move forward quickly with discovery, seeking information and financial records that would primarily come from third parties rather than the government.\n\nA clue as to what they may request can be found in the preservation subpoenas they filed more than a year ago with 23 Trump-related entities, including The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, The Trump Organization, the Mar-a-Lago Club, Inc., and entities related to his D.C. hotel and its management, among others.\n\nThe subpoena requires the majority of documents to be preserved from Jan. 1, 2015 on an ongoing basis. The court filings cite document categories for preservation, including those from Nov. 8, 2016 onward concerning \u201cmarketing to foreign or domestic governments, including members of the diplomatic community.\u201d Other noted categories for preservation include documents that would identify guests of the hotel and those who have rented event space, details on all finances, \u201coperating leases, permits, licenses, tax payments or credits to or from foreign or domestic governments.\u201d\n\nA schedule of legal discovery is due in 20 days and it could begin quickly thereafter, depending on what is agreed to by all parties.\n\nThough the case has been narrowed to focus on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, \u201cthat hotel is a nexus for a far-flung web of foreign and domestic emoluments,\u201d said Norman Eisen, chairman of the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is co-counsel with the two jurisdictions.\n\nThe emoluments clause has never been fully tested in an American courtroom. Two other lawsuits accusing the president of violating the emoluments clause are also being heard in other federal courts. Neither has reached the discovery stage.\n\nThe plaintiffs have argued that Trump \u2014 who has declined to divest from his assets as president \u2014 is capitalizing on the presidency and causing harm to businesses trying to compete with his Washington hotel, which is just steps from the White House.\n\nThe Justice Department has said earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, don\u2019t qualify as emoluments. Its attorneys have argued that under Maryland and D.C.\u2019s interpretation, no federal official would even be able to own stock from a foreign company that provides profits or collects royalties.\n\nMessitte pushed back in his opinion Friday against any delaying tactics by the president and his Justice Department lawyers.\n\n\u201cThere is genuine concern on the part of plaintiffs, indeed the court shares it, that if the president is permitted to appeal the court\u2019s decisions in piecemeal fashion, ultimate resolution of the case could be delayed significantly, perhaps for years\u201d especially because it\u2019s likely the president would appeal any negative decisions up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThat, as a matter of justice, cannot be countenanced.\u201d\n\n__\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams", "FILE -- In this Oct. 17, 2018 file photo Public Policy Institute of California CEO and debate monitor Mark Baldassare, center, applauds at the end of the debate between California Sen.

De Leon received the California Democratic Party's endorsement in his bid to unseat Feinstein, but she remains the favorite heading into Election Day. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, file)\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Kevin de Leon got a burst of national attention last summer when the California Democratic Party endorsed him for U.S. Senate over incumbent Dianne Feinstein. It seemed it could be the spark the former state Senate leader needed to make headway against a Goliath of California politics.\n\nBut de Leon never parlayed the endorsement into significant campaign cash to boost his name recognition among California\u2019s nearly 20 million voters. State and national Democratic activists largely stayed laser-focused on efforts to flip U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Feinstein blunted some of de Leon\u2019s argument that she\u2019s not tough enough against President Donald Trump when she became the target of Republican ire during confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nNow, with many early votes already cast and Election Day near, the 85-year-old Feinstein appears headed for a fifth full term in the seat she has held since 1992.\n\n\u201cA lot of things would have had to line up for anybody to defeat Feinstein,\u201d said Eric Schickler, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nDe Leon, 51, squeaked through a field of 32 candidates in the June primary to face Feinstein. California is one of just a handful of states that allows two members of the same party to face off in a general election.\n\nNeither had won the party endorsement ahead of the primary. But when the roughly 330-member executive board gathered in July, de Leon came out ahead. He has been more of a fixture at state party events than Feinstein over the years, building up a cache of goodwill, and members of the executive board tend to be the most progressive in the party.\n\nThe endorsement earned de Leon a spot on official party mailers and allowed him to open a joint political action committee that could accept bigger donations than his campaign.\n\nBut that committee brought in just $374,000, a fraction of what\u2019s needed to buy television advertisements in California. In his campaign account, de Leon raised $1.6 million as of mid-October. Feinstein has raised nearly $9 million and lent herself millions more.\n\nOther high-profile endorsements for de Leon didn\u2019t come with much cash either.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer, who has committed spending more than $120 million to elect Democrats this cycle, donated $5,400 to de Leon\u2019s campaign and another $10,000 to the PAC, but he never ran any independent ads on his friend\u2019s behalf. Two major unions, the California Labor Federation and Service Employees International Union California, also endorsed de Leon but did not do major spending on his behalf, although they campaigned for him through door-knocking and direct mail.\n\nInstead, the groups spent big on U.S. House candidates and ballot measures.\n\n\u201cRight now the activism in California is focused on flipping the House,\u201d said RL Miller, a de Leon supporter who is on the party executive board that endorsed him.\n\nWhen Democratic voters, particularly younger or Latino voters who may not have cast ballots for Feinstein in past elections, learn about his record, they want to support him, his supporters say. But getting that message out in a state as massive as California is tough without money.\n\n\u201cNobody is in political love with her and Kevin inspires people,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t met 40 million people.\u201d\n\nFeinstein\u2019s supporters think otherwise, pointing to her long and popular history with California voters, not just the party\u2019s most faithful activists. Among Democrats, she counts support from labor hero Dolores Huerta, powerful women\u2019s groups like Emily\u2019s List and Planned Parenthood, and Democratic giants including former President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stand by Dianne Feinstein. She has stood by us, she has stood by women,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, which works to elect pro-abortion rights, Democratic women.\n\nShe has angered the base on occasion, particularly by suggesting last year that people should have patience with Trump. Some immigrant groups also protested outside her office last year, arguing she wasn\u2019t doing enough to protect young people who are in the country illegally.\n\nFeinstein says passing comprehensive immigration reform will be her chief priority if re-elected. She sparred with Trump and Republicans during the Kavanaugh fight when they accused her of strategically leaking a letter from a California constituent accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. Trump supporters even chanted \u201clock her up!\u201d about the senator at a rally. Kavanaugh denied the allegations, and Feinstein has denied that she leaked the letter to the press.\n\n\u201cTo hurt her, what you would have needed is a massive amount of money spent on negative ads,\u201d Schickler said. \u201cIt helps that Feinstein hasn\u2019t really given them a lot of weapons.\u201d\n\nFeinstein campaigned little in California during the summer and early fall; her aides blamed the Senate schedule in Washington. But she\u2019s spent the final weeks at events around the state made to showcase how she has helped California.\n\nShe received a hero\u2019s reception at a Democratic women\u2019s event in Sacramento on Thursday before visiting an Air Force base to view planes she helped procure for California firefighters. She recently ran a statewide television advertisement highlighting her support from newspapers around the state.\n\nDe Leon, meanwhile, is zeroing in on Southern California with stops planned in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties where he\u2019ll sell his message that California needs a new voice in Washington. If nothing else, the party endorsement signaled that Democrats want fresh faces, his spokesman Jonathan Underland said.\n\n\u201cI think people have gotten the message that he is the future of the California Democratic Party,\u201d Underland said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Feinstein acknowledged the power of incumbency she enjoys.\n\n\u201cI remember when I first started it was really hard,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "16 exposed to carbon monoxide at hotel, taken to hospital\n\nJACKSONVILLE, N.C.

Jerry Brown joins a rally on behalf of a campaign against a repeal of the gas tax on Friday Nov. 2, 2018 in Palo Alto, Calif. Proposition 6, which would repeal an increase in gas tax and vehicle fees for transportation projects in California. (AP Photo/Janie Har)\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Jerry Brown made a rare appearance on the 2018 campaign trail Friday, joining a final push against an effort to roll back a gas tax hike he championed to pay for highway repairs, an important component of his legacy as he prepares to leave office.\n\nBrown, a Democrat, gave a 90-second speech during a rally at a park near notoriously congested Highway 101, which links Silicon Valley to San Francisco and the Central Valley.\n\nHe said the initiative, which Republicans hope will drive their voters to the polls, was cooked up by \u201cshady politicians\u201d who want to fool Californians.\n\n\u201cProp. 6 is a scheme and a scam put on the ballot by some partisans, actually, they\u2019re acolytes of Donald Trump,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the best interests of California in mind.\u201d\n\nThe leading faces of the campaign against the measure have been firefighters and construction workers, dozens of whom attended the rally, holding signs and chanting \u201cNo on 6.\u201d They say transportation upgrades are badly needed for jobs as well as public safety.\n\nCarl DeMaio, a conservative San Diego radio host who made an unsuccessful run for Congress in 2014, is leading the campaign for Proposition 6. It would repeal increases in gas taxes and vehicle fees that Brown backed last year to fund an expected $52 billion in transportation projects over a decade.\n\nDeMaio and other supporters of the repeal say the hikes are overkill for an already expensive state where working families struggle to get by.\n\nIn a statement issued shortly after Brown\u2019s appearance, Proposition 6 campaign spokesman Dave McCulloch dismissed the governor\u2019s comments as distracting, calling them \u201cfalse partisan rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThe Yes on 6 campaign announced Friday an attention-grabbing event in car-centric Southern California: $50 gas cards for drivers who show up at certain stations on Monday and win a drawing.\n\nMcCulloch said anyone can sign up to win the cards as long as they are a registered voter and regardless of their opinion on the ballot measure.\n\nGiving away prizes isn\u2019t illegal for political campaigns. Jay Wierenga, a spokesman for the Fair Political Practices Commission, said he could not comment on specific cases but \u201cgenerally speaking campaign funds can be used for any political, legislative or governmental purpose.\u201d\n\nUntil Friday, Brown has worked largely behind the scenes to raise money for the campaign against the repeal. He also recorded phone messages and a television ad.\n\nBrown historically is very selective about which causes and candidates to back and has stayed out of efforts to boost Democratic turnout in key congressional races.\n\nHis brief appearance could be his last campaign event as an elected officeholder. Brown will leave his job in January and is the only person to serve as governor of California in separate eight-year stretches.\n\nHe first served from 1975 to 1983, then was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.\n\nBrown led a successful campaign in 2012 to pass higher sales and income taxes for schools. Two years later, he fronted a campaign for a big water-project bond and in 2016, led a parole-overhaul initiative.\n\nWhile Brown says he has no plans to run for office again, he\u2019s certain to come back if needed to protect other parts of a legacy that includes dramatic reforms on climate issues and criminal justice as well as transportation.\n\n\u201cThe governor has raised tens of millions of dollars to defeat Proposition 6 and his war chest will certainly be needed for the battles to come,\u201d said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for Brown.\n\nWestrup said Brown, who has about $15 million remaining in his campaign account, may have to fend off possible challenges to signature policy reforms such as a 2016 parole measure.\n\nCritics also want to kill another project dear to the governor \u2014 a high-speed rail line intended to run between San Francisco and Los Angeles that has been beset by delays and legal hurdles.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed to this story.", "FILE - In this June 6, 2017 file photo, Kelly Odom, of Union Beach, N.J., watches election results on her phone at New Jersey Lt.

They\u2019re competing aggressively to provide immersive digital experiences, particularly for people impatient to know how the news affects them personally.\n\nCable news networks will have wall-to-wall television coverage Tuesday, while ABC, CBS and NBC have set aside their entire prime-time lineups. After ABC said last week it would start its coverage at 8 p.m. ET, both CBS and NBC \u2014 which had planned 9 p.m. ET starts \u2014 also added the extra hour to avoid being left behind.\n\n\u201cWe have two programs, one on CNN television and one on CNN digital, and it\u2019s a very different experience,\u201d said Sam Feist, the network\u2019s Washington bureau chief.\n\nThe element that makes a midterm election more challenging for television increases the importance of the online plans. A presidential election provides an overarching national story to carry the night. Although President Trump will surely be on the minds of many voters Tuesday, there is no national election.\n\nSo the digital site that can do the best job of keeping people up-to-date with real-time results in a manner that easily lets them go granular to find races in their own communities will have a big edge. That\u2019s been a focus at several networks; an ABC News app for the first time will allow viewers to look at results on a county-by-county level.\n\nThe stakes are high. CBS News\u2019 web site had its most-visited day ever on Election Day 2016 and \u201cwe\u2019re expecting a really big day this year,\u201d said Christy Tanner, executive vice president and GM of CBS News Digital.\n\nFeist said CNN\u2019s investment in improving its digital election operation since the 2014 midterms has been \u201castronomical.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we have become a lot more sophisticated in what the online experience is than we were even five years ago,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at Fox News.\n\nThe New York Times and Washington Post are also emphasizing up-to-the-minute vote count online. The Post\u2019s artificial intelligence system promises instant analysis of voting trends, including comparisons of past vote totals, and will live-stream video of its own election night show.\n\nNBC News, which offers separate television shows on the network and on MSNBC, will also provide reports on its Facebook page from local journalists in all 50 states. Network executives were struck earlier this year when conversations with an Alabama reporter revealed his knowledge of precinct-by-precinct trends that proved prescient in the U.S. Senate special election, said Rashida Jones, NBC News senior vice president in charge of election coverage.\n\nThe network wanted to tap into this local experience, she said.\n\n\u201cIt really allows us to get out in America and not tell the story from the studio in New York,\u201d Jones said.\n\nMore detailed local coverage will also be a feature of the CBSN live stream on election night, Tanner said. CBS\u2019 digital stream \u2014 from a studio side-by-side with the television studio in the network\u2019s newsroom \u2014 reaches an audience by average 20 years younger than the TV broadcast.\n\n\u201cThey are looking for knowledge, as opposed to opinion, in the news coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nFox News is touting its partnership with The Associated Press on a new system that surveys the electorate on the issues facing the country. \u201cWe have more than we can possibly share on television and the (digital) experience should be a lot richer for it,\u201d Stirewalt said.\n\nDigital operations will double down on forecasting, even though the failure of pollsters and prognosticators to foresee Trump\u2019s victory became the media story of the 2016 election night. Fox News and The New York Times will both make election meters, which put percentages on the chances of each party to control the House and Senate, a prominent feature online.\n\nCNN digital will rely heavily on Harry Enten to forecast races while Enten\u2019s former boss at the FiveThirtyEight blog, Nate Silver, is getting a more prominent role at ABC News.\n\nIn general, the news executives don\u2019t fault election meters for predicting Hillary Clinton had an 80 to 90 percent chance of winning in 2016, but in how people wrongly interpreted them as saying she was a sure thing.", "", "", "", "CHAMPAIGN, Ill.

Coach Lovie Smith\u2019s team has also lost three straight games and five of six.\n\nMinnesota (4-4, 1-4 Big Ten) has hopes of reaching its first bowl game under coach P.J. Fleck. Last year, the Gophers went 5-7 and missed out. After Illinois, they have back-to-back home games against Purdue and Northwestern before the regular-season finale at rival Wisconsin, where they have not won since 1994.\n\nRedshirt freshman Tanner Morgan will get the start again at quarterback for Minnesota after an excellent performance in beating Indiana last week in his first career start. True freshman Zack Annexstad won the job in fall camp, hurt his ankle in the third game, played through it rather ineffectively and then suffered an unspecified midsection injury in a loss at Nebraska on Oct. 20.\n\nMorgan had the first 300-yard passing game last week for the Gophers since 2015, and may have secured the starting role even if Annexstad gets healthy.\n\n\u201cZack is still banged up a little bit, and I think Tanner being healthy, and he\u2019s earning opportunities he\u2019s earned the right to play,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like you have a starter that\u2019s 30-2 that you\u2019re saying, OK, when he gets hurt he comes back, even if he\u2019s 85, 90 percent we\u2019re going to play him because he gives us the best chance to win.\u201d\n\nILLINI WOES\n\nDefensive coordinator Hardy Nickerson resigned last Sunday, citing health issues out of his control, after overseeing one of the worst units in the nation.

Rivers, who had wrested the starting job away from senior AJ Bush, suffered a concussion in a loss to Maryland last week and is expected to miss the Minnesota game. Bush is expected to start at quarterback on Saturday. Freshman Matt Robinson will provide backup if Rivers remains sidelined due to concussion protocol.\n\nRunning back Mike Epstein, who along with Reggie Corbin has provided the few offensive bright spots this season, is likely out with an unspecified foot injury.\n\n\u201cMike is getting better,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how much better with Mike, but when you miss another game, you know something is going on.\u201d\n\nSophomore running back Ra\u2019Von Bonner looks to get more playing time for Illinois (3-5, 1-4) in Epstein\u2019s absence.\n\nSKILLED GOPHERS\n\nMinnesota junior Tyler Johnson leads the Big Ten with 807 receiving yards and is also tied for the conference lead with eight touchdowns. With four games remaining, he needs 319 yards to break Ron Johnson\u2019s all-time single season record of 1,125 yards in 2000. With four straight 100-yard games, Johnson has also matched Eric Decker\u2019s program record.\n\n\u201cIt actually means a lot to be able to do that, put my name in the books like that, but one thing about me is I\u2019m just going to continue to work hard and never get complacent,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMohamed Ibrahim is expected to return as the starting tailback on Saturday after being held out of the last game because of an undisclosed injury. Despite playing in only five games, the redshirt freshman leads the team with 464 rushing yards.\n\nGETTING DEFENSIVE\n\nSmith will call the defensive plays for Illinois in the absence of Nickerson, whom Smith has known and worked with since 1996, including their time in the NFL. Assistant Rob Wright will coach the linebackers and Smith said other staff will take on additional duties.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan in place for what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved with the defense, and I\u2019ll call the plays defensively this week.\u201d\n\nSTILL A CHALLENGE\n\nIllinois is still reeling from a 63-33 shellacking at Maryland last weekend, while Minnesota is coming off the impressive 38-31 win over Indiana. Despite being favored by nearly 10 points over Illinois, Fleck says he understands the challenge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to going on the road and playing a good Illinois team that has a lot of athletes.\u201d He said. \u201cThere are athletes all over the place, whether you\u2019re talking about their defense or their quarterback.

(AP) \u2014 Voters in the heart of Pennsylvania\u2019s rolling dairy farms and Amish countryside have rarely seen a Democrat mount a competitive campaign for Congress \u2014 until now.\n\nFrom all appearances, first-time candidate Jess King is giving freshman Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker a fight to the finish in Tuesday\u2019s midterm election in this heavily conservative district on Pennsylvania\u2019s southern border.\n\nDrawn by her Mennonite faith into a career of nonprofit anti-poverty work, King said she isn\u2019t necessarily running against President Donald Trump.\n\nFor sure, she doesn\u2019t like Trump, calling him inflammatory and divisive.\n\nBut, she said, she is trying to tap into issues where she and Trump voters can agree, whether on the need for health care, a level economic playing field or a government that is responsive to people, not corporate campaign contributions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t talk about Trump so much because it\u2019s not helpful, in that it becomes another element of the division, and shame is not a tactic that works,\u201d King said in an interview in her bustling downtown Lancaster campaign office. \u201cYou know, to shame people into, \u2018hey, you were wrong in your vote,\u2019 or \u2018hey, you should have done something else,\u2019 or \u2018hey, I think less of you.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t work, so we don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nKing, 44, is endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and has gone toe-to-toe with Smucker in fundraising without accepting corporate campaign contributions or getting help from Democratic Party organizations.\n\nSmucker, 54, acknowledges the race is competitive. Two polls in recent weeks have shown a single-digit race and Republicans are not disputing that finding. Still, Smucker says Republicans are getting engaged and happy with the last two years, and will vote to ensure the seat remains in Republican hands.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to win this thing, but sure, it is definitely a competitive race and we\u2019re going to need all the Republicans to come out and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Smucker said in an interview.\n\nLast week, Vice President Mike Pence came to campaign and raise cash for Smucker, who began airing attack ads that King says are full of lies about her.\n\nSmucker suggests she wants to legalize heroin and abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She doesn\u2019t. He said she\u2019s for open borders. She\u2019s not.\n\nThe ads show Smucker in a plaid shirt, call him a central Pennsylvania native and suggest that \u201csocialists\u201d from San Francisco and New York are funding King\u2019s campaign. King does not call herself a socialist and much of Smucker\u2019s campaign contributions also are from outside the district.\n\nSmucker also has roots in the Mennonite faith. He was one of 12 children born into an Old Order Amish family and later attended Lancaster Mennonite High School. He now attends a Lutheran church. He went on to run a family-owned construction business before serving in the state Senate for eight years.\n\nFor her part, King calls herself a 12th-generation native of the area, which is accustomed to hard-fought Republican primaries, not hard-fought general elections.\n\nRepublicans have a 100,000-voter registration advantage in the district, and Trump won it by 26 points in 2016.\n\nBut the county is growing fast and, with it, the area\u2019s Republican registration edge is shrinking. Meanwhile, Democrats say Smucker\u2019s echo of Trump\u2019s hard-edged anti-immigrant message is landing with a thud in an area where the big Mennonite population has long been active in resettling refugees from across the globe.\n\nAs a child, for instance, King remembers her church resettling families from Vietnam, Ukraine and elsewhere.\n\nKing emphasizes door-knocking and town halls, and has found volunteers in the Mennonite community. Her campaign manager and field director grew up in the Mennonite church where her husband was pastor, and she\u2019s known them since they were politically active teenagers demonstrating against the Iraq war.\n\nHer reach into the Mennonite community \u2014 she went to Lancaster Mennonite High School and Eastern Mennonite University \u2014 even amazed her when she traveled around to parades last month.\n\n\u201cI would see people that I grew up with, went to high school with, knew from college, like family friends, relatives, you name it,\u201d King said. \u201cIt is crazy. It\u2019s kind of hard to paint the picture of how interwoven the fabric of this community is, especially when you grow up Mennonite.\u201d\n\nShe plays down Trump in her campaign, but it is the president, in part, that drove her decision to run. The tax-cutting bill advanced by Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would, she feared, benefit the wealthy and do nothing to advance anti-poverty efforts.\n\n\u201cI knew I needed to do something,\u201d King said. \u201cI was open to what that was going to be, but I certainly didn\u2019t see it as a run for congress. But it\u2019s working out all right.\u201d", "1 of 5 This photo provided by the state's attorney's office in Prince George's County, Md., shows Michael Ford, charged with attacking a Maryland police station while his two brothers videotaped the shootout, which led to an officer mistakenly killing an undercover detective.

(Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office via AP)\n\nUPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) \u2014 A man who attacked a Maryland police station while his brothers videotaped the shooting was convicted of murder Friday in the death of an undercover detective, whom a fellow officer mistakenly shot and killed.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about three hours before convicting 25-year-old Michael Ford of second-degree murder in the March 2016 friendly-fire killing of Prince George\u2019s County police Detective Jacai Colson, Prince George\u2019s state\u2019s attorney office spokesman John Erzen confirmed. Ford also was convicted of first-degree assault and weapons charges.\n\nErzen said Ford was found not guilty on six counts of attempted first-degree murder. With the other counts, Erzen said Ford faces up to 600 years in prison, with 65 of those on the handgun charges alone.\n\nFord testified Wednesday that he was trying to get himself killed by police when he fired his handgun nearly two dozen times outside the station and didn\u2019t intend for anyone else to be harmed.\n\nBut a prosecutor argued Ford\u2019s actions created a \u201ccombat zone\u201d and caused Colson\u2019s death even though he didn\u2019t fire the fatal shot.\n\nColson exchanged gunfire with Ford before Officer Taylor Krauss shot the plainclothes narcotics detective, mistaking him for a threat. Krauss testified that he never saw Colson hold up a badge or heard him identify himself as a police officer before shooting him once in the chest.\n\nCounty prosecutor Joseph Ruddy said Ford had gone on a \u201ccombat mission,\u201d firing 23 shots from a handgun in nearly four minutes. He didn\u2019t hit anyone, but bullets he fired struck two passing vehicles and an ambulance, according to Ruddy.\n\n\u201cThat was no suicide mission. That was a mission to kill cops,\u201d he said in the trial\u2019s closing arguments.\n\nDefense attorney Antoini Jones told jurors that Ford was wounded and had been \u201cneutralized\u201d on the ground before Krauss fired the shot that killed Colson.\n\nFord\u2019s two younger brothers recorded cellphone videos of the ambush after dropping him off at the station in Landover, a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of the videos shows Ford screaming obscenities and shouting, \u201cDo something!\u201d in between shots.\n\nFord, then 22, dictated his last will and testament on video minutes before his brothers dropped him off at the station.\n\nA judge ruled before the trial that Ford couldn\u2019t present an insanity defense despite his serious mental health issues.\n\nFord said he was hearing voices in his head on the day of the shooting. He said he retrieved a gun from a safe in his car and held it to his head.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t pull the trigger,\u201d he said.\n\nA police detective testified in 2016 that Ford\u2019s brothers agreed to film the shooting so the video could be sent to WorldstarHipHop.com, a website known for posting users\u2019 violent videos. Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Angela Alsobrooks has said the cellphone videos were an attempt to gain fame.\n\nFord\u2019s brothers, Malik and Elijah, pleaded guilty to charges related to the shooting and await sentencing hearings.\n\nA grand jury declined to indict Krauss on any charges related to Colson\u2019s shooting. Colson\u2019s parents sued Krauss and Prince George\u2019s County, accusing Krauss of recklessly firing his rifle.\n\nFord is black, and so was Colson; Krauss is white. Colson and Krauss had worked in the narcotics unit together and sat at connecting desks.\n\nJones, Ford\u2019s attorney, told jurors that Colson didn\u2019t match the gunman\u2019s description apart from their race. At the start of the trial, Jones said the evidence will show the detective was shot \u201cbecause he was black.\u201d\n\nFour officers, including Colson and Krauss, fired their weapons during the chaotic shootout on March 13, 2016, police said. Ford shot out the police station\u2019s glass door before firing at and \u201cbarely\u201d missing officers who responded, according to a police report.\n\nFord\u2019s attorney asked him why he opened fire outside the police station.\n\n\u201cBecause I wanted to die,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd I knew the police kill black men with no problem.\u201d\n\nColson was a four-year veteran of the department and 28-year-old native of Boothwyn, Pennsylvania.", "This Sunday, Oct. 28, 2018 photo shows Ike, a pack llama that escaped from a guided hike in Yellowstone National Park in August, seen southwest of Yellowstone Lake.

The ad is narrated by an Omaha voter who says he\u2019s a Republican and supported President Donald Trump, but won\u2019t vote for Bacon.\n\nA look at the ad\u2019s claim:\n\nTHE CLAIM: \u201cHe voted to let insurers deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d - TV ad that began running Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The ad is partially true. The key word in the claim is \u201cdeny.\u201d Bacon\u2019s vote would not have allowed insurers to outright deny someone with a pre-existing condition, but it would have allowed them to raise prices, which could have the same effect by making coverage too expensive.\n\nBacon\u2019s vote last year for the GOP-backed American Health Care Act would have eliminated some protections made law in President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Bacon also criticized the ACA in 2016 when running for Congress and supported a 2017 budget bill that paved the way to overturn it.\n\nThe ACA introduced a number of new health insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The law prohibited insurers from denying coverage based on a person\u2019s medical history or refusing to cover someone\u2019s pre-existing condition.\n\nThe bill Bacon backed would have allowed states to lift the Affordable Care Act rule that prohibited insurers from charging higher premiums for those with pre-existing conditions, making health insurance unaffordable for some. Under that bill, states could have also allowed insurers to sell lower-cost policies that covered fewer services.\n\nThat would have significantly weakened protections for pre-existing conditions, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization. Insurers, she said, often look for ways to skimp on coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cBefore the ACA, insurers had multiple strategies for avoiding people with pre-existing conditions: insurers could turn you down, could charge you more or exclude your pre-existing condition,\u201d Pollitz said. \u201cFor insurance to work for people with pre-existing conditions, there have to be airtight protections.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 275,000 Nebraska residents over the age of 65 have a pre-existing condition, according to the foundation. Most Americans with pre-existing conditions didn\u2019t have issues getting health insurance before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage because they were insured through their employer or the state government. Federal rules forbid employer health plans from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions prior to the federal overhaul.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.

(AP Photo/Pavel Golovkin)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The amateur boxing federation struck down a proposed amendment on Friday that would have allowed the body\u2019s president to take an extended leave of absence, dealing a blow to the interim leader\u2019s election campaign.\n\nThe amendment was proposed in an effort to calm tensions with the International Olympic Committee, which has objected to the candidacy of businessman Gafur Rakhimov.\n\nRakhimov, who has been running AIBA on an interim basis since January, is one of two candidates in Saturday\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe IOC has said Rakhimov regaining the presidency could put AIBA\u2019s place in the Olympics at risk.\n\nRakhimov is on a U.S. Treasury Department sanctions list for alleged links to organized crime and international heroin trafficking. The sanctions bar U.S. citizens and companies from doing business with him. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nAIBA executive director Tom Virgets said Rakhimov was planning a lawsuit to demand he\u2019s removed from the list.\n\n\u201cThe actual court piece itself is relatively short. It\u2019s getting on the docket and getting a date to be heard is what has been taking some time,\u201d Virgets said. \u201cHe is very optimistic, based on what his lawyers have said, that he could see this in the very near future.\u201d\n\nThe amendment which would make it easier to take an extended absence fell two votes short of a two-thirds majority. Rakhimov had hinted he\u2019d use the measure if elected to step aside while mending relations with the IOC, but also keeping AIBA voting rights.\n\nAnother high-profile measure to give vice presidencies to people who invest $10 million was adjourned without a vote.\n\nRakhimov, who is from Uzbekistan, is running against Serik Konakbayev of Kazakhstan for the AIBA presidency.\n\nRakhimov presented himself on Friday as AIBA\u2019s savior, saying he restructured $40 million of debt and lifted a threat of bankruptcy since becoming interim president. Rakhimov said two major debts to investors had been converted into sponsorship deals, but didn\u2019t say how.\n\n\u201cI was able to get most of the credit against AIBA waived,\u201d Rakhimov said, adding that \u201cto think that we almost had to dissolve our organization and file for bankruptcy is unthinkable.\u201d\n\nAIBA still faces a huge debt following the 11-year reign of former president C.K. Wu, who stepped down last year. AIBA banned him for life last month for \u201cgross negligence and financial mismanagement.\u201d\n\nAccounts presented on Friday showed negative equity of $19 million as of June after years of heavy spending and an opaque failed commercial venture. Its assets are valued at less than $4 million after years in decline.\n\nVirgets said the negative equity \u201cis an ugly, ugly figure but it is the reality of AIBA.\u201d\n\nBesides Rakhimov\u2019s alleged ties to criminal groups and AIBA\u2019s finances, the IOC has complained about the association\u2019s refereeing and judging after more controversial bouts at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nVirgets said AIBA was cracking down on doping with increased drug-testing, and this year had resolved 38 long-running doping cases, some going back to 2010. However, he said the fighters involved wouldn\u2019t be named, even if they had failed drug tests.\n\n\u201cThose cases that we were resolving from years ago, other than to mention the fact that we have closed the cases, we have no intention of making it public who those individuals are,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IOC has said it could keep boxing on the 2020 Olympic program but remove a role for AIBA, though it\u2019s not clear how that might work.\n\nAIBA\u2019s financial woes could deepen if it loses its cut of Olympic TV money. The IOC has suspended payments to AIBA and did not let Rakhimov attend the Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires last month.\n\nKonakbayev is positioning himself as the IOC-friendly candidate.\n\n\u201cIf (Rakhimov) wins, the IOC will take a tough decision which won\u2019t make us happy,\u201d Konakbayev told The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cWe could lose participation as an Olympic sport in the Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Deliberations were set to resume on Monday.\n\nThompson faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder. He could also be convicted of the lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide.\n\nThis is the second time a jury takes Thompson\u2019s case. His first trial in June ended with a hung jury.\n\nProsecutors said Thompson was quickly in control of Hernandez after the two got into a confrontation when Thompson saw Hernandez urinating outside a Denny\u2019s restaurant in Sheldon in May 2017. His wife, Chauna Thompson, 46, arrived later to help her husband subdue and restrain Hernandez. She was off-duty at the time and was later fired by the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDuring closing arguments, prosecutor John Jordan played cellphone video and 911 calls in which witnesses can be heard pleading for Thompson to let go of Hernandez and Hernandez can be heard gasping for breath.\n\nJordan said that during the altercation, Hernandez signaled with his hand that he was no longer resisting but Terry Thompson kept Hernandez in a chokehold for another three minutes and 36 seconds until Hernandez went limp.\n\n\u201cTerry Bryan Thompson did not kill John Hernandez because he had to. He killed him because he wanted to,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nDefense attorney Scot Courtney portrayed Hernandez as the aggressor, saying he was drunk and belligerent and never stopped fighting Thompson until he passed out.\n\nThompson was only trying to have dinner with his kids when he was attacked by Hernandez and had no intention of killing him, Courtney said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 He says, \u2018stop\u2019\u201d to Hernandez, Courtney said.\n\nHernandez died at a hospital three days after the confrontation.

(Craig Sherod Photography/AcelRx Pharmaceuticals via AP)\n\nTRENTON, N.J. (AP) \u2014 U.S. regulators on Friday approved a fast-acting, super-potent opioid tablet as an alternative to IV painkillers used in hospitals.\n\nThe decision by the Food and Drug Administration came over objections from critics who fear the pill will be abused. In a lengthy statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said there will be \u201cvery tight restrictions\u201d placed on its distribution and it is intended only for supervised settings like hospitals.\n\nThe tiny pill was developed as an option for patients who pose difficulties for the use of IVs, including soldiers on the battlefield. The pill from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals contains the same decades-old painkiller often given in IV form or injection to surgical patients and women in labor.\n\nGottlieb noted the pill was a high priority for the Department of Defense, which helped fund testing, because it wanted a way to provide fast pain relief to injured soldiers. The tablet, placed under the tongue with a dispenser, starts reducing pain in 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nA panel of FDA advisers had earlier voted 10-3 in favor of the pill called Dsuvia (duh-SOO\u2019-vee-uh). But in a rare response, the panel\u2019s chairman joined critics in urging the FDA to reject it. The chairman, Dr. Raeford E. Brown Jr., who couldn\u2019t attend the meeting and didn\u2019t cast a vote, predicts that the pill will be abused inside and outside medical settings and cause overdose deaths.\n\nThe pills contain sufentanil, a chemical cousin of the opioid fentanyl.\n\nGottlieb said the drug will carry a boxed warning and won\u2019t be available at drugstores for patients to take home. Acknowledging the criticism, he said he\u2019s asked FDA staff to \u201cevaluate a new framework\u201d for the approval of new opioid drugs that will clearly outline how the agency considers benefits and risks.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t sidestep what I believe is the real underlying source of discontent among the critics of this approval \u2014 the question of whether or not America needs another powerful opioid while in the throes of a massive crisis of addiction,\u201d Gottlieb\u2019s wrote.\n\nSidney Wolfe of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, a consumer group, called Gottlieb\u2019s statement \u201cempty rhetoric\u201d and said the agency missed a big opportunity when it approved the pill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThis drug is doomed. It\u2019s dangerous and it will kill people.\u201d\n\nThe Redwood City, California-based company expects the pill to be available early next year at a price of $50 to $60 per pill.\n\nIn one study, the pill provided about the same pain relief to patients as IV morphine. Common side effects with Dsuvia included nausea, vomiting, constipation and decreased blood oxygen levels. Those occurred slightly more often with the pill than for study participants given morphine.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A. Johnson on Twitter: @LindaJ_onPharma\n\n___\n\nAP Medical Writer Carla K.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Somewhere along the line, Washington and Stanford\u2019s anticipated showdown for the Pac-12 North title got sidetracked. Or better yet, sideswiped.\n\nFor the Cardinal, it was a pair of unexpected home losses to Utah and Washington State. For the Huskies, it was road stumbles at Oregon and, shockingly, at California.\n\nNow Saturday\u2019s matchup in Seattle has become an elimination game instead of the premiere matchup it was supposed to be. The loser will be saddled with three conference losses and will need a lot of help to catch No. 10 Washington State by the end of the regular season.\n\nThe Cardinal (5-3, 3-2 Pac-12) are already in the position of needing extra help after losing to Washington State last week. A third conference loss would essentially eliminate any hopes of a division title.\n\nWashington\u2019s situation isn\u2019t as precarious but a loss would be a huge blow. The Huskies (6-3, 4-2) still have a matchup with Washington State in the regular-season finale. A win Saturday plus a win over Oregon State in two weeks could mean the Apple Cup rivalry game will be a winner-take-all affair for the second time in three seasons.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a huge disappointment for Stanford and Washington to be in this position. In a sign of how much luster has come off what was supposed to be one of the biggest Pac-12 North games of the season, the Huskies and Cardinal are being relegated to the Pac-12 Network.\n\nWashington\u2019s biggest question will be how it reacts after last week\u2019s offensive slog in a 12-10 loss to California that included the benching of starting quarterback Jake Browning in the second half. The Huskies have been regressing offensively in recent weeks, but should be getting a boost with the possible return of running back Myles Gaskin after he missed the past two games with a shoulder injury. Washington might also see the season debut of talented tight end Hunter Bryant, who has yet to play due to an offseason knee injury.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting in there every week figuring out how do we make this a little bit better. We will make progress,\u201d Washington coach Chris Petersen said.\n\nStanford\u2019s biggest question will be the status of running back Bryce Love, who has rushed for only 413 yards and three touchdowns while dealing with a lingering ankle problem. Love had 71 yards rushing last week against Washington State, but carried just six times.\n\nHere are other things to watch as the Huskies and Cardinal meet with both teams unranked for the first time since 2008:\n\nMORE TACKLES: Washington LB Ben Burr-Kirven continues to lead the country in tackles with 122, 38 more than he had all last season in 13 games. Burr-Kirven has recorded at least 13 tackles in six of Washington\u2019s nine games. Burr-Kirven had 14 last week against California.\n\n\u201cWhen I watch tapes of his high school games, all he does is tackle everybody. Since he\u2019s been at Washington, all he\u2019s done is tackle everybody. Call him a tweener or call him a safety-linebacker, the guy is a great football player,\u201d Stanford coach David Shaw said.\n\nTHROW IT UP: With Love\u2019s lingering injury, the Cardinal have put more of the offense in the hands of quarterback K.J. Costello and his assortment of big wide receivers and tight ends. Costello is averaging 270.6 yards per game passing and ranks in the top 20 nationally in yards passing, touchdowns and completion percentage.\n\nHe may get a chance to challenge a Washington secondary that\u2019s had very few quarterbacks throw downfield on it this season. The Huskies are allowing just 171.7 yards passing per game and only three teams \u2014 Auburn, UCLA, Oregon \u2014 have thrown for more than 200 yards against Washington.\n\nESTABLISH THE RUN: Washington was held under 100 yards rushing last week for the first time since it lost at Arizona State last season. The Huskies had 91 yards rushing against California; they had 91 yards rushing a year ago against Arizona State.\n\nGetting Gaskin back would be a big boost, as would finding ways to get speedy Salvon Ahmed going. Ahmed had eight carries for (minus)-2 yards against California.\n\nTURNOVER TIME: When Stanford forces turnovers, it wins. When the Cardinal don\u2019t, they lose. It\u2019s not often that simple, but that\u2019s been the case for Stanford this season. In their five wins, the Cardinal have forced 12 turnovers. In their three losses, they\u2019ve forced zero.\n\nStanford has committed six turnovers in the three losses.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "In this Oct. 30, 2018 photo, Democratic Sen.

(AP) \u2014 In a big win for medical marijuana producers in New Mexico, a district judge has ruled that a state-imposed limit on the number of plants they can grow as part of their licensed operations is arbitrary and not based on reliable data.\n\nJudge David Thomson, in a ruling made public Friday, invalidated the 450-plant limit that the state Department of Health imposes on producers. The judge also set a four-month deadline for the agency to study the issue and establish a new plant limit that complies with legislative mandates that guide New Mexico\u2019s medical marijuana program.\n\nThe ruling stems from a lawsuit that alleged the agency wasn\u2019t fulfilling its obligations to ensure an adequate supply of medical marijuana.\n\nThere have long been concerns about shortages as the population of licensed patients has grown exponentially. As of the end of September, there were nearly 59,000 active patients.\n\n\u201cIn essence, DOH is using its regulatory authority in a manner and with an end toward impeding the purpose of the act,\u201d the judge wrote. ?\u201cFurther, its regulatory mandate of 450 plants is not based on fact or reliable data and is not rationally related to its regulatory authority. More importantly, it impedes the ability to assure medical patients have an adequate supply.\u201d\n\nThe department said Friday it was reviewing the ruling and considering its next steps.\n\n\u201cOur focus will always be on ensuring that patients have safe access to medicine,\u201d agency spokesman Paul Rhien wrote in an email.\n\nDuke Rodriguez, head of the state\u2019s largest producer, Ultra Health, said the Legislature\u2019s intent was to allow for the beneficial use of medical marijuana to all qualified patients in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we can now have a program fully committed to the public health benefits of cannabis availability and affordability \u2014 better health over the politics of the past,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by Ultra Health and Nicole Sena, who uses cannabis oil and medical marijuana products to treat her daughter\u2019s rare form of epilepsy. Sena has said the treatments call for a significant amount of cannabis material and that she has a hard time finding a licensed producer who can provide enough.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the state\u2019s limit on the number of plants per producer has resulted in barriers to supply and ultimately patient access.\n\nThe ruling notes that the Health Department has not revisited the plant limit since 2014 despite the increase in patients. The department has argued that based on a 2013 survey producers had room to grow by improving the yield of their plants.\n\nThe judge found that the market for medical marijuana has changed since then and the department has not accounted for those changes.\n\nAs for patients, they must meet at least one of 21 conditions to qualify for a medical marijuana card. Of the patients enrolled as of the end of September, slightly more than half of them listed post-traumatic stress disorder as a condition. Other conditions include severe chronic pain and cancer.", "Man charged in deaths of 2 people in Ferguson arrested\n\nFERGUSON, Mo.

(AP) \u2014 Georgia must make it easier for voters flagged as potential noncitizens to prove their U.S. citizenship at the polls, a federal judge ruled Friday in an injunction ordering the state to change its procedure just four days before Election Day.\n\nA spokeswoman for state Attorney General Chris Carr did not immediately say whether the state would appeal. Spokeswoman Katie Byrd said state attorneys were reviewing the order.\n\nThe injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Eleanor L. Ross addresses a specific issue that arose from a broader lawsuit by civil rights groups who in October filed a broader challenge to Georgia\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d verification process. The state requires identification information on voter registration applications to precisely match information already on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration.\n\nSome mismatches are triggered by variations in a name, like a dropped hyphen, or because of data entry errors. Other people are flagged as potential noncitizens, often because the state driver\u2019s license database hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect their naturalization. Roughly 51,100 Georgians have been flagged as ineligible to vote because of such registration problems.\n\nThe judge ruled the state unfairly burdens about 3,100 possible voters whose registration was flagged for citizenship issues, because only a deputy registrar is allowed to clear them to vote a regular ballot when the voters show proof of citizenship at the polls. She ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers, in addition to deputy registrars, to clear flagged voters who show proof of citizenship.\n\nSecretary of State Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s top elections official and the Republican nominee for governor, issued a statement saying advocates filing a last-minute lawsuit had forced the state \u201cto waste time and taxpayer dollars for the judge to tell us to do something that we already do.\u201d\n\nBut the judge said Georgia\u2019s process for clearing voters with flagged registration didn\u2019t treat those with citizenship issues equally. She noted those flagged for issues other than citizenship could be cleared by any poll worker \u2014 not just a deputy registrar \u2014 after showing a photo ID.\n\n\u201cThis raises grave concerns for the Court about the differential treatment inflicted on a group of individuals who are predominantly minorities,\u201d Ross\u2019 order said. \u201d... The election scheme here places a severe burden on these individuals.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit says the \u201cexact-match\u201d policy disproportionately affects black, Latino and Asian-American applicants trying to register. It was filed against Kemp as he\u2019s locked in a tight, nationally watched race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\nKemp\u2019s office has been allowing voters flagged over citizenship issues to cast ballots after showing proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport, at the polls. In cases where a deputy registrar isn\u2019t available to clear the voter in person and can\u2019t be reached by phone, flagged voters were to be given provisional ballots marked with a poll worker\u2019s note that the voter showed proof of citizenship.\n\nCristina Correia, a lawyer for the state, said at a hearing on the issue Monday that those provisional ballots would be counted with no further action required by the voter.\n\nJulie Houk, a lawyer for the civil rights groups, said that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. She told the story of a recently naturalized citizen who went to a Fulton County early voting location where there was no deputy registrar present. The poll manager didn\u2019t send the man\u2019s citizenship proof to a deputy registrar to clear the flag, Houk said, and he wasn\u2019t offered a chance to vote on a provisional ballot to be counted as a regular ballot.\n\nThe judge said in her order that the man\u2019s troubles voting came \u201cafter he had already submitted proof of citizenship with his voter registration application.

Supporters of the ethics ballot question are counting on lingering frustration over state lawmakers' repeal of a similar measure last year to help pass the November initiative.(AP Photo/James Nord)\n\nBROOKINGS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 After watching South Dakota Republicans undo government ethics rules that voters had just imposed, Jennifer Krauel was angry enough to volunteer for a new anti-corruption ballot measure that lawmakers couldn\u2019t overturn.\n\nIn a college town north of Sioux Falls, Krauel reminded welder David Scheibel of the ethics rules\u2019 repeal. Republican lawmakers contended the law was likely unconstitutional, and they replaced it with other provisions \u2014 some called them workable, others called them weaker. But Scheibel, a 62-year-old Republican, was receptive to Krauel\u2019s pitch, calling the legislators\u2019 move a \u201cslap in the face.\u201d This year\u2019s measure would be cemented in the state constitution \u2014 safe from legislative tinkering \u2014 and would hamstring lawmakers\u2019 power to cast aside citizen laws.\n\n\u201cThis is existential for our democracy,\u201d Krauel, a registered Democrat who voted for the 2016 measure and started volunteering for the new campaign after its repeal, told The Associated Press. \u201cThis one really matters. I mean, let\u2019s stop this nonsense now because I don\u2019t want to have to do it again.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota, which in 1898 became the first state to adopt citizen initiatives, is the \u201cposter child\u201d of a conflict between citizens and state legislatures over ballot questions, said Josh Altic, ballot measures project director at Ballotpedia, an organization that compiles electoral data.\n\nIt was one of several states where lawmakers brushed aside or changed 2016 voter measures. Lawmakers also came back with new rules on ballot question campaigns and proposed making the state constitution harder to change. Meanwhile, supporters of the measure known as Amendment W turned in enough signatures to put the ethics rules to voters \u2014 a shift that would hem in the Legislature\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cAs far as ... initiative proponents sort of striking back, I guess you might say, there\u2019s nothing like what South Dakota has on the ballot,\u201d Altic said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers decried the campaign to pass the original measure as deceptive and challenged its constitutionality in court. A judge had put the law on hold before they scrapped it, and lawmakers followed up by creating an ethics commission and limiting lobbyist gifts to public officials.\n\nActivists are counting on lingering anger to help pass Amendment W, which would tighten campaign finance and lobbying restrictions, establish a more powerful state ethics board and prevent the Legislature from changing voter laws \u2014 or the ballot question system \u2014 without a public vote.\n\nOpponents say it would undermine the constitution, making the ethics board a new branch of government without checks and balances. A summary of the measure from the state attorney general says it would likely be challenged on constitutional grounds.\n\nA recent poll found more people supporting the measure than opposing it, but a lot of respondents were still undecided. Support was about even among Republicans and Democrats.\n\nFrustrated lawmakers are seeking their own changes. The Legislature is asking residents to raise the threshold for approval of constitutional amendments to 55 percent, from the current simple majority. Also, House Speaker Mark Mickelson gathered thousands of signatures to put a question on the ballot to bar out-of-state money for initiatives.\n\nMickelson said lawmakers are simply seeking to protect the rights of South Dakota residents to pass their own laws.\n\n\u201cThe initiative process is a very cool thing. I\u2019m using it myself,\u201d Mickelson said.\n\nAmendment W supporters have a huge money advantage, raising about $615,000 to opponents\u2019 roughly $190,000. Major contributors in support of the amendment include Washington-based political action committee End Citizens United; the Massachusetts-based anti-corruption organization Represent.Us; and filmmaker J.J.

(Craig Sherod Photography/AcelRx Pharmaceuticals via AP)\n\nTRENTON, N.J. (AP) \u2014 U.S. regulators on Friday approved a fast-acting, super-potent opioid tablet as an alternative to IV painkillers used in hospitals.\n\nThe decision by the Food and Drug Administration came over objections from critics who fear the pill will be abused. In a lengthy statement, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said there will be \u201cvery tight restrictions\u201d placed on its distribution and it is intended only for supervised settings like hospitals.\n\nThe tiny pill was developed as an option for patients who pose difficulties for the use of IVs, including soldiers on the battlefield. The pill from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals contains the same decades-old painkiller often given in IV form or injection to surgical patients and women in labor.\n\nGottlieb noted the pill was a high priority for the Department of Defense, which helped fund testing, because it wanted a way to provide fast pain relief to injured soldiers. The tablet, placed under the tongue with a dispenser, starts reducing pain in 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nA panel of FDA advisers had earlier voted 10-3 in favor of the pill called Dsuvia (duh-SOO\u2019-vee-uh). But in a rare response, the panel\u2019s chairman joined critics in urging the FDA to reject it. The chairman, Dr. Raeford E. Brown Jr., who couldn\u2019t attend the meeting and didn\u2019t cast a vote, predicts that the pill will be abused inside and outside medical settings and cause overdose deaths.\n\nThe pills contain sufentanil, a chemical cousin of the opioid fentanyl.\n\nGottlieb said the drug will carry a boxed warning and won\u2019t be available at drugstores for patients to take home. Acknowledging the criticism, he said he\u2019s asked FDA staff to \u201cevaluate a new framework\u201d for the approval of new opioid drugs that will clearly outline how the agency considers benefits and risks.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t sidestep what I believe is the real underlying source of discontent among the critics of this approval \u2014 the question of whether or not America needs another powerful opioid while in the throes of a massive crisis of addiction,\u201d Gottlieb\u2019s wrote.\n\nSidney Wolfe of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, a consumer group, called Gottlieb\u2019s statement \u201cempty rhetoric\u201d and said the agency missed a big opportunity when it approved the pill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge mistake,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cThis drug is doomed. It\u2019s dangerous and it will kill people.\u201d\n\nThe Redwood City, California-based company expects the pill to be available early next year at a price of $50 to $60 per pill.\n\nIn one study, the pill provided about the same pain relief to patients as IV morphine. Common side effects with Dsuvia included nausea, vomiting, constipation and decreased blood oxygen levels. Those occurred slightly more often with the pill than for study participants given morphine.\n\n___\n\nFollow Linda A. Johnson on Twitter: @LindaJ_onPharma\n\n___\n\nAP Medical Writer Carla K.

Oregon adopted the law in 1987 to prevent law enforcement from detaining people who are in the U.S. illegally but have not broken other laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that law enforcement agencies like the Multnomah County jail refuse to work with ICE to promote public safety by holding criminals accountable and providing justice and closure for their victims,\u201d said Tanya J.

Brandon White, a spokesman for the Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\n\u201cIt is disingenuous to make this claim when they failed to follow the process for even entering the civil detainer information into any law enforcement database.\u201d\n\nRodriguez Lorenzo was reported missing Tuesday, and authorities determined her body had been found a day earlier in rural suburbs of Portland. Investigators learned she was last seen with her husband arguing at a party, according to a probable cause affidavit.\n\nDetectives went to question Gallo-Gallardo at his job and he confessed to the killing, the affidavit said.\n\nAn autopsy found Rodriguez Lorenzo died from blunt-force head trauma and multiple stab wounds.\n\nICE has now placed a hold on the suspect with the Clackamas County jail where he\u2019s being held on the murder charge.", "Man cited for pile of barrels leaking chemicals in creek\n\nROCKY TOP, Tenn.

Mia Love and Democrat Ben McAdams \u2014 residents and candidates will have to wait to find out who won because the state recommends counties wait three days before posting more results.\n\nThe lieutenant governor\u2019s office asks county clerks to follow a vote release schedule created in 2016 that includes a lag until a Friday afternoon dump of results. The delay is designed to allow county clerks time to tally ballots in an organized and proper manner without being hounded by campaigns and news organizations to release votes every day, said Justin Lee, state director of elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re far more concerned with making sure the counties have the time get it right, than to get it done fast,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe proliferation of mail-in voting \u2014 now occurring in 27 of the 29 counties \u2014 has created more work for county clerks because mail-in ballots that get dropped at polling places or sent by mail close to Election Day must be verified and counted in a time-consuming process, Lee said. More than two-thirds of the votes are expected to come from mail-in ballots, he said.\n\nMost states release voting results as they come in, said Wendy Underhill, director of elections at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Utah appears to be in the minority in delaying it, though there may be advantages to a more cautious approach, she said.\n\nThe three states that only have voting by mail \u2014 Oregon, Washington and Colorado \u2014 release results daily after the election. In Colorado, the secretary of state updates the vote count at least daily, although votes are counted and submitted at varying speeds depending on county.\n\nUtah counties are not required to follow the vote release schedule. Salt Lake County Clerk Sherrie Swensen says she plans to release votes one day earlier, on Thursday. Her county accounts for about four-fifths of registered voters in Love\u2019s district. Swensen said there\u2019s no way her office could provide an updated count by Wednesday.\n\nBut \u201cwe don\u2019t want to hold everything until Friday,\u201d Swensen said.\n\nUtah County, which has the second-largest portion of voters in Love\u2019s district, with 14 percent, will wait until Friday because protecting the integrity of the election is most important, County Clerk Bryan Thompson said.\n\n\u201cI understand that everyone wants to know, but if we have issues and there are mistakes, that calls things into question,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nTwo other counties have 1 percent of the voters in the district: Juab and Sanpete counties. Juab County will do another release Wednesday, said county clerk Alaina Lofgran. Sanpete County will wait until the following Tuesday, Nov. 13, because of a lack of staffing, County Clerk Sandy Neill said.\n\nEven if people are clamoring for more votes in the Love-McAdams race, which could decide control of Congress, Lee said the state won\u2019t deviate from its plan.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we don\u2019t care,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI\u2019m being a little flippant with that, but I mean, nothing matters even for Congress\u2019 perspective until we do an official certification of results.\u201d\n\nState and counties don\u2019t certify results until the official vote canvass two weeks later, but news organizations such as The Associated Press regularly call races on Election Night based on statistical models, demographics, the number of absentee ballots and political issues that may affect the outcome of races.\n\nLee said he thinks voters are better served by getting large dumps of votes rather than a trickling of votes to avoid tight races appearing to flip back and forth.\n\n\u201cNo matter how often we release them, it seems like people want them more often,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI think what people would like to see, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s practical or feasible, is a live stream of results.\u201d\n\nThere was little criticism of the delayed vote count.\n\nKatie Matheson of Alliance for a Better Utah, a left-leaning watchdog group, said election officials are smart to do their due diligence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stake in these races,\u201d Matheson said. \u201cTaking the time to make sure the info they have correct is important.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Love and McAdams said they have no complaints about the schedule.\n\nVote-watchers can expect a big release of counted early ballots shortly after polls close Tuesday at 8 p.m., which could be enough for the AP and other news outlets to call several races, including Mitt Romney\u2019s bid to win the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring Sen.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst)\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 Europe-wide stress tests show that big banks would come through a theoretical financial crisis in better shape than in the last such test two years ago.\n\nBut several analysts said the test didn\u2019t mean Europe could sound the all-clear about potential trouble from Italian banks and government finances.\n\nNone of the 48 tested banks, covering about 70 percent of the EU banking sector by assets, fell short of a capital yardstick used in earlier exercises, although this year\u2019s exercise does not give pass-fail grades. That bar was easily cleared by all four Italian banks and by Deutsche Bank, which is trying to return to profit after three years of losses.\n\nItalian banks are in focus because of their large holdings of government bonds, which lost value due to fears that Italy\u2019s new populist government will run bigger deficits.\n\nThe results showed that, on average, banks across Europe were left with capital padding of 10.3 percent of their assets, measured as their common equity tier one ratio. That is a widely used measure of bank financial strength and ability to cope with losses on investments and loans that don\u2019t get repaid.\n\nThis year\u2019s average strength compared to 9.4 percent in the 2016 stress test of 51 banks under a different scenario.\n\nThis year\u2019s scenario, run by the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and national supervisors, involved a bigger shortfall in economic output than last time in 2016. Banks faced a 2.7 percent fall in economic output over three years, plus a ferocious bear market in stocks and steep declines in house prices. The scenario attempts to capture some of the known risks to the European economy, including those associated with Britain leaving the European Union and a big drop in sky-high home prices in Sweden.\n\nThe stress tests are part of a broader effort to strengthen banking regulation and the banking system in the European Union in the wake of the Great Recession global financial crisis a decade ago, and the eurozone debt crisis that peaked in 2011-2012. Bad banks played a role in the eurozone debt crisis in Ireland, which was forced to seek a bailout from other eurozone governments after guaranteeing the liabilities of failing banks.\n\nAlthough the results are not pass-fail, all the banks exceeded a 5.5 percent capital yardstick used in an earlier test. The results of the test will now be digested by the European Central Bank\u2019s banking supervisory arm. That process could result in weaker banks being asked to raise money or take other steps to improve their finances.\n\nSeveral analysts said the test did not fully capture the risks to Italian banks from potential falls in the value of Italian government bonds. A dispute between Italy\u2019s government, which wants to spend more, and the European Commission, which wants to enforce rules against excessive debt and deficits, has emerged as a potential new crisis for the 19-nation eurozone.\n\nAnalysts at credit-rating agency DBRS said the scenarios for falls in the prices of Italian bonds were \u201crelatively soft\u201d compared to the plunges seen in the 2011-2012 crisis for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.\n\nJack Allen, senior European economist at Capital Economics, said that \u201cthese stress tests shouldn\u2019t be taken as a sign that the country\u2019s lenders could with stand a crisis sparked by doubts about debt default and/or currency redenomination,\u201d which would happen if Italy were to leave the shared euro currency union.\n\nThe Italian banks and their strength ratios under the stress scenario were: UniCredit, 9.3 percent, Intesa Sanpaolo, 10.4 percent, Banco BPM, 8.5 percent, and Unione di Banche Italiane, 8.3 percent. The Italian Central Bank said their average loss of 3.9 points was in line with the test average.\n\nDeutsche Bank saw its capital buffer fall to 8.1 percent. Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said in a statement that the result showed that \u201cour risk profile is strong, but our profitability is not. This is exactly where our focus is now.\u201d Deutsche Bank says it aims to turn a profit this after slashing expenses and risky investments after three straight years of annual losses.", "EAST LANSING, Mich.

Damon Evans will continue as AD and Wallace Loh is slated to remain University president after announcing on Tuesday he will retire in June.\n\nLoh\u2019s surprise assertion that he will step down was merely one facet of a strange week for the program:\n\n\u2014 Canada surrendered the reins of the team to Durkin, who was reinstated as head coach Tuesday after being on administrative leave since Aug. 11.\n\n\u2014 One day later, Durkin was fired .\n\n\u2014 One day after that, James Brady, chairman of the University System of Maryland board of regents, quit the post after the board received harsh criticism from students, players and state politicians for its decision to reinstate Durkin.\n\n\u2014 At practice on Tuesday, during Durkin\u2019s brief return, the team\u2019s disharmony came to a head when a fight between the players broke out. According to the Baltimore Sun, backup punter Matthew Barber, who has criticized the culture of the program, was struck by a teammate who supported Durkin.\n\n\u2014 The athletic director has said he will investigate the incident.\n\nEven with the embarrassing developments, Canada has the Terrapins (5-3, 3-2 Big Ten) one victory away from becoming bowl eligible heading into the matchup with the Spartans (5-3, 3-2).\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee Canada will be part of the program if the school decides to clean house and bring in a new coach for 2019, but for now, he\u2019s just trying to keep this fragmented team together.\n\n\u201cOur players are focused on each other,\u201d Canada said. \u201cWe have really closed off our room and said it\u2019s about us.\u201d\n\nIn a season dedicated to McNair, who died of heatstroke in June, the Terrapins have already won more games than last year and are coming off a 63-33 rout of Illinois.\n\n\u201cYou look at Maryland right now, you look at their offensive personnel, they have a very explosive football team,\u201d Spartans coach Mark Dantonio said. \u201cA lot of big-play guys, 700-plus yards this past week and really, a lot of guys making a lot of plays.

That massacre in Sutherland Springs, and another Texas mass shooting at Santa Fe High School near Houston about six months later, aren't the race's top issues. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The one-year anniversary of a Texas church shooting that was the deadliest in U.S. history falls on the eve of next week\u2019s midterm deciding the state\u2019s hotly contested race between Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke.\n\nYet the candidates seldom reference the tragedy on the campaign trail.\n\nA gunman with an AR-15 style rifle rampaged through a rural church outside San Antonio on Nov. 5, 2017, killing 25 people. That massacre and another mass shooting that left 10 dead about six months later at a high school near Houston hardly ever come up in the Texas race, even amid a spirited debate about gun control.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s considered old news. Mass shootings aren\u2019t like the big thing anymore,\u201d said Diana Earl, a volunteer activist for the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America whose 22-year-old son, Dedrick, was shot and killed in 2016, following an argument over burnt ashes landing on the shooter\u2019s car. \u201cWe\u2019ve failed to keep it as a priority.\u201d\n\nCruz frequently criticizes his opponent as being anti-Second Amendment, and O\u2019Rourke argues that Texas should lead national discussions on assault weapons bans and universal background checks. But such debate almost seems independent of the tragedies rather than driven by them.\n\nA dispute with his mother-in-law prompted Devin Patrick Kelley to open fire during Sunday services at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the victims was pregnant. More than half those killed were children.\n\nOther attacks struck deeper political chords. Student activism following February\u2019s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida prompted Republican Gov. Rick Scott to sign legislation raising the age limit to buy a rifle from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on rifle purchases. However, the Republican running to replace Scott, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, says he would have vetoed those.\n\nLast week\u2019s synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh has laid bare fresh political divides, but more attention has been focused on whether President Donald Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric helped stoke hatred that encouraged violence than gun control.\n\nAsked if the synagogue attack would spark renewed calls for gun control, Cruz mentioned the Sutherland Springs anniversary saying, \u201cSadly, Texas has experience of our own with violence and murder in places of worship.\u201d But he used it to argue for a different policy response.\n\n\u201cEvery American ought to be free to worship according to your faith, your conscience, free of some lunatic trying to harm you, some lunatic trying to murder you,\u201d Cruz told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cWe need to do much more to get murders off the street before they commit murder to make sure that bad guys, that felons and fugitives, that they don\u2019t have access to firearms.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke often draws applause when he mentions not taking donations from the National Rifle Association, or any outside political group, and for suggesting that Texas should be a gun control trailblazer.\n\n\u201cTell me a state that has a prouder, longer, richer heritage of responsible gun ownership,\u201d he said during a town hall in Houston. \u201cWhat better state, then, to lead the national conversation on how we protect more lives?\u201d\n\nStill, the Democratic challenger doesn\u2019t mention Sutherland Springs much so close to election.

In former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election year, 1.46 million people hit the polls early, only about 5 percent higher than this year.\n\nThe 2014 midterm elections drew less than half as many early and absentee voters as this year. The 2014 ballot also offered voters little to get excited about, while 2018 includes high-profile, open races for Senate and governor.\n\nIn the Senate race, Democratic former Gov. Phil Bredesen\u2019s campaign has pointed to early totals in Democratic areas and other counties where he performed well in his re-election for governor in 2006, when he won every county. Turnout has topped 162,200 in Nashville\u2019s Davidson County, only 7 percent off from 2016 levels. Memphis\u2019 Shelby County topped 188,600, about 22 percent below 2016.\n\nRecent polls have shown U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn taking a lead.

Bredesen has said a few thousand people without weapons slowly making their way to the border of the U.S., the strongest country in the world, are \u201cnot some huge national emergency like suddenly Russia decided to threaten us with nuclear weapons or something.\u201d\n\nBlackburn\u2019s ad follows the lead of Trump, who has floated the idea that the caravan contains gang members and \u201cMiddle Easterners,\u201d while later acknowledging there was no proof of those claims. Blackburn\u2019s ad insinuates those groups are in the caravan, in addition to \u201cknown criminals\u201d and \u201cpossibly even terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe strategy has drawn scrutiny from Republican Sen. Bob Corker, whom Blackburn and Bredesen hope to replace. Corker called on Washington to stop using immigration as a \u201cpolitical football every time we have an election\u201d and solve the problem legislatively.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it.

Blackburn and the GOP have looked to undermine that message by tying him to national Democrats. Bredesen, meanwhile, has tried to keep his distance from his party by pledging not to support Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and saying he would have supported Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation.\n\n\u201cIf you like Washington the way it is \u2014 partisan shouting, finger-pointing, special interests \u2014 I\u2019m not your guy,\u201d Bredesen says in the ad.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

In the past year, dozens of convicted felons have alleged they had drugs planted on them or were otherwise framed after refusing to pay ex-Sgt. Ronald Watts or his tactical team. In many cases, prosecutors discovered police misconduct that made them doubt the validity of the convictions, and judges have followed their recommendations to vacate them.\n\nSince early 2016, there have been at least 50 felony drug convictions tied to Watts vacated.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The midterm elections are just around the corner, but efforts to \u201cget out the vote\u201d don\u2019t mean much if voters unexpectedly find themselves unable to get out of their hospital bed on Election Day.\n\nDozens of doctors, nurses and volunteers at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania have been working together on an initiative called the \u201cPenn Votes Project,\u201d a way to help patients still have their voices heard despite their hospitalization. They\u2019re part of a growing number of health centers tackling the issue.\n\n\u201cEvery citizen of the United States has the right to vote and we think getting ill shouldn\u2019t impair that process,\u201d said Dr. Judd Flesch, a pulmonary medicine specialist who heads up the program.\n\nFor those in the hospital unexpectedly, that process isn\u2019t exactly simple.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the patient first needs to apply for an emergency absentee ballot. Then a physician must sign off on the application acknowledging that the patient will be unable to head to the polls. The application must be notarized, taken to City Hall and approved. The patient\u2019s ballot then must be taken back to the hospital, where the patient fills it out. It then gets returned to City Hall to be counted.\n\n\u201cIt would be a pretty big burden on the patient\u2019s family or friend to go through all the steps,\u201d said Erin Hollander, a Penn medical student and volunteer coordinator for the voting project.\n\nThe hospitals are tapping into their resources at the medical school and at Penn Law School to create a program that does all that legwork for patients.\n\nIt started with a campaign to raise awareness that the voting program was launching, with staffers wearing buttons, flyers appearing on food trays, commercials on the in-house TV channel. On Thursday, the application process got underway, with law students ferrying the paperwork back and forth as the patients\u2019 agents.\n\nNeil Deininger, a law school student coordinating the legal side of the project, has a personal interest in the program: On Election Day in 1992, his mother missed out on voting because she was giving birth to him.\n\n\u201cShe recalls that my sister sent a letter to Bill Clinton saying \u2018my mom couldn\u2019t vote for you because she was in hospital having my brother,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe Penn hospitals aren\u2019t the only health centers to help patients who can\u2019t get to the polls, but organizers hope their program can serve as a model that other institutions can replicate.\n\nKelly Wong, an emergency medicine resident at Rhode Island Hospital, was helping admit patients just before the 2016 presidential election and many were disappointment that they\u2019d be unable to vote.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell them, because I didn\u2019t know that patients could vote,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter researching the laws, she was surprised to learn most states offer the option. She and several residents at other hospitals recently launched a website called Patientvoting.com , meant to organize publically available information on emergency medical absentee voting by state.\n\n\u201cI think it is just something that if we were never told, we can never share it with our patients,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer Adaeze Okwerekwu and James McKenzie are both residents in adult psychiatry at Cambridge Hospital, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe two launched an initiative in 2016 called the Social Justice Campaign that focuses on issues affecting their patient population, addressing everything from immigration to politics.\n\nBefore the 2016 presidential election, they were struck by hospital patients who expressed frustration about being unable to vote, Okwerekwu said, and made helping patients vote a priority.\n\nAs in Pennsylvania, patients in Massachusetts must appoint someone to serve as a proxy to get all the documents in order.\n\nBecause their operation is small, Okwerekwu said she and McKenzie typically are tapped to be the patients\u2019 proxies, creating lots of work for them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we ended up literally driving all over creation in the days leading up to the (2016) election,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis should be an active duty of the health care system,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got rights and they don\u2019t go away just because you are sick or injured.\u201d", "FILE- In this Aug. 17, 2018, file photo, Chicago Cubs starter Cole Hamels pitches to a Pittsburgh Pirates batter during the first inning of a baseball game in Pittsburgh.

He was healthy at the end of last season, but the contending Cubs ran out of time in terms of bringing him back.\n\nChicago also claimed infielder Jack Reinheimer off waivers from the New York Mets. The 26-year-old Reinheimer hit .167 in 21 games with New York this year.\n\nHamels gives manager Joe Maddon a deep group of starting pitchers as the Cubs try for their fifth consecutive playoff appearance. Jon Lester, Kyle Hendricks, Jose Quintana and Yu Darvish also are expected to return, with Mike Montgomery and Tyler Chatwood waiting in the wings.\n\nHamels, a former first-round pick, made his major league debut with Philadelphia in 2006. He is 156-114 with a 3.40 ERA in 13 big league seasons.\n\nHe was working on perhaps the worst season of his career when Chicago got him from Texas for right-hander Eddie Butler, minor league pitcher Rollie Lacy and a player to be named. He was 5-9 with a 4.72 ERA in 20 starts with the last-place Rangers at the time of the trade, but the Cubs felt a change of scenery and a pennant race might help him get back on track.\n\nThey were right.\n\nHamels had an instant impact with Chicago, going 4-0 with a sparkling 0.79 ERA in his first five starts with the team. He was unbeaten with the Cubs until he was hit hard in a loss at Arizona in his 10th start on Sept. 19.\n\nWhen the NL wild-card game went into extra innings, Hamels made just his second major league relief appearance and responded with two scoreless innings in Chicago\u2019s 2-1 loss to Colorado. He is 7-6 with a 3.41 ERA in 17 career playoff appearances.\n\nThe option completes the deal Hamels signed with Philadelphia in July 2012, bringing the total value to $158 million for seven years.\n\nHamels struck out 13 while pitching a no-hitter at Wrigley Field in his final start with Philadelphia in 2015. He was traded to Texas six days later, and helped the Rangers to two AL West titles.\n\nEarlier this week, the Cubs exercised their $6.25 million option for Pedro Strop and fellow reliever Brandon Kintzler picked up his $5 million player option.\n\nStrop, one of the baseball\u2019s most consistent relievers since he was acquired in a July 2013 trade with Baltimore, went 6-1 with 13 saves and a 2.26 ERA in 60 appearances last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball coverage: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Patricia Linder speaks with a reporter about the U.S. House of Representatives race in District 7 in middle Tennessee on Friday, Sept. 21, 2018, in Franklin, Tenn.

(AP) \u2014 Patricia Linder is the kind of undecided voter Democrats are looking for.\n\nThe Tennessee retiree lives just outside Nashville in Williamson County, the type of suburban territory where Democrats have made gains in other states since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. As Democrats around the country push hard to take over the majority of the seats in a Republican-held Congress, they also believe they can lay the groundwork here to have a fighting chance in future races \u2014 including 2020, when Trump is expected to seek re-election.\n\nWhile many of Linder\u2019s neighbors are entrenched Republicans, she\u2019s receptive when campaign volunteers come to make a pitch for Democratic congressional candidate Justin Kanew, who\u2019s running for an open seat against Republican Mark Green, a state senator and former Army doctor.\n\nMichele Bewley, a volunteer for the progressive voting advocacy group Indivisible, tells Linder, 68, that Kanew is approachable and will look out for regular folks.\n\n\u201cJustin sounds like he\u2019s in good shape,\u201d said Linder, a registered Democrat who has voted Republican before and is impressed with Green\u2019s military service. \u201cI want somebody that I can talk to. It will be a tough decision.\u201d\n\nWilliamson County boasts a good public school system and a country-club feel from its subdivisions with large homes and manicured lawns, upscale stores, clean streets and low crime. Republicans point to the high quality of life here, saying the local economy has flourished on their watch.\n\nDemocrats know they face an uphill battle for a Nov. 6 victory in the 7th District, one of three races for open House seats currently held by Republicans, but they hope misgivings about Trump run deeper than it may appear.\n\nKanew, a film producer and former \u201cAmazing Race\u201d contestant, and Green are vying for seat vacated when Republican Marsha Blackburn decided to run for U.S. Senate after 16 years in the House.\n\nTwo other House seats in solidly Republican districts also are open in Tennessee \u2014 one in Knoxville, the other dominated by rural voters in north Tennessee. The GOP predicts a sweep, but Democrats think their efforts now will pay future dividends.\n\nWilliamson County Democrats have been sidelined for years, and considered non-entities in future elections, said Kreis White, a lawyer who decided to help the dormant party.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll find the phone booth where the Williamson County Democrats meet, see what they\u2019re up to,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHe found them, and ran for county commission in August \u2014 the first time in 20 years that Democrats presented a large field of candidates for Williamson County office. None won, but they showed energy and created a jumping off point, Democrats say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about November. It\u2019s about 2020. It\u2019s about 2024. It\u2019s about building a deeper bench,\u201d Bewley said\n\nWilliamson is one of 19 counties in District 7, which also includes Clarksville and a wide swath of rural Tennessee. With their socially conservative towns, where residents are worried about access to good jobs and health care, the poorer rural counties reflect a sharp contrast to tony Williamson County.\n\nSome of the Democrats\u2019 hope lies in the county\u2019s population growth and a pool of inactive, potential voters. That includes young parents who have been busy raising children and finding their place in the community.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while for people to feel like they do have roots, like they have a place and they have a voice in that,\u201d Bewley said.\n\nThe District 7 candidates offer those voters a clear contrast.\n\nKanew supports Medicaid expansion and universal health care coverage. Green is a former Army surgeon and cancer survivor who helped the state Legislature block Republican Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan. Green says the Affordable Care Act is \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nGreen is endorsed by prominent conservatives Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum. He withdrew from consideration for U.S. Army secretary last year after facing criticism over negative remarks about Muslims, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans. Green called the attacks \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and accused Democrats and the media of orchestrating a \u201chit job\u201d on his nomination.\n\nKanew hasn\u2019t accepted political action committee campaign donations, which shows he won\u2019t be beholden to Trump or anyone else, he said.\n\n\u201cThe real dividing line in this country is not between Democrat voters and Republican voters,\u201d Kanew said. \u201cIt\u2019s between special interests and the people, the special interests who control our politicians.\u201d\n\nGreen notes that Kanew moved to Tennessee a couple of years ago, and has never held public office. He calls Kanew a socialist for his views on health care and other issues.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Bernie Sanders-light,\u201d Green said.\n\nWhite, the 61-year-old lawyer-turned-candidate, is hoping energized younger Democrats will carry the ball forward.\n\n\u201cWhat should the party do?

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Turkish fianc\u00e9e of Jamal Khashoggi called Friday for President Donald Trump\u2019s help in pressuring Saudi Arabia to reveal the location of the slain journalist\u2019s body, even as she criticized the U.S. administration for its dealings with the kingdom.\n\nHatice Cengiz made her appeal in a video message to a memorial in Washington where friends and activists marked one month since Khashoggi\u2019s death and paid tribute to his advocacy for democratic change in the Arab world.\n\nCengiz urged Trump to support Turkey\u2019s request for Saudi Arabia to extradite those it has detained in connection with the killing of the 59-year-old columnist for The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI would like him to support Turkey\u2019s efforts in trying to bring light to this situation and to discover the whereabouts of his body,\u201d said Cengiz, who was waiting outside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 when the journalist went inside to obtain paperwork for their planned marriage, never to re-emerge.\n\nCengiz lamented that without his body, Khashoggi\u2019s loved ones had been unable to hold funeral prayers for him. \u201cOur pain is still as fresh as the first day,\u201d she said.\n\nIstanbul\u2019s chief prosecutor announced Wednesday that Khashoggi was strangled immediately after he entered and that his body was dismembered and removed from the consulate.\n\nOne month after his murder, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was memorialized by writers, politicians and civil rights activists in Washington. (Nov. 2)\n\nTurkey is seeking the extradition of 18 suspects so they can be put on trial in Turkey. They include 15 members of an alleged Saudi \u201chit squad\u201d that Turkey says was sent to Istanbul to kill Khashoggi, who lived in exile in the United States and had written critically of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSome of those implicated in the killing are close to the prince, whose condemnation of the killing has failed to ease suspicions that he was involved. Saudi Arabia has changed its narrative about Khashoggi\u2019s killing several times, but has recently acknowledged that Turkish evidence shows it was premeditated.\n\nOn Thursday, State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters Khashoggi\u2019s remains should be located and returned for a proper burial.\n\nSpeaking at Friday\u2019s memorial at a Washington hotel, Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents the northern Virginia district where Khashoggi had been based for the last year of his life, said that since the killing, Saudi Arabia has \u201cblatantly concocted a series of lies\u201d in its attempt to cover up what happened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one lie left to be addressed and that\u2019s the involvement of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia himself,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nOther speakers called for the United States not to balance its strategic and military interests against the necessity of seeking justice for the journalist\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let the criminals behind this off the hook. We can\u2019t ignore this because we want to sell more weapons,\u201d said Ahmed Bedier of United Voices for America, a U.S.-based civil society group.\n\nTrump has condemned Khashoggi\u2019s killing in strong terms but has also defended U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which is the biggest foreign customer for American weaponry.\n\nWriting in The Washington Post on Friday, Cengiz said the United States should be leading the international community in seeking justice for Khashoggi. She contended that the Trump administration has \u201ctaken a position that is devoid of moral foundation\u201d because of fears of \u201cupsetting deals or economic ties.\u201d", "CONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 New Hampshire officials are predicting turnout will top half a million voters for the first time in a midterm election Tuesday.\n\nSecretary of State William Gardner made his prediction Friday as he and Attorney General Gordon MacDonald outlined how the state is getting ready for Election Day. Thousands of trained volunteers will be working across the state at more than 300 polling locations, they said, each of which will be inspected Tuesday by attorney general\u2019s office staff.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to have an election that is consistent with New Hampshire\u2019s tradition of fair elections, well-executed elections and elections that have a high degree of voter turnout,\u201d MacDonald said. \u201cWe encourage all to come out and vote.\u201d\n\nThe election comes as the issue of voting rights has spilled over from the Statehouse to the courthouse. A flurry of court rulings in recent weeks focused on a 2017 law that requires new voters to provide more documentation if they register within 30 days of an election. The law will be in effect Tuesday, but penalties for not complying will not be enforced.\n\nA more recent law change ending the state\u2019s distinction between domicile and residency doesn\u2019t take effect until July. For now, out-of-state college students and others who consider the state their domicile can vote without being subject to residency requirements, such as getting a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license or registering their cars.\n\nSupporters of that law argue those who participate in elections should be subject to the same rules as residents, while opponents argued that the bill amounts to a poll tax that will discourage voting. Gardner said the state has to strike a balance between making it easy to vote and maintaining a trustworthy system. He argues New Hampshire has done that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about suppressing the vote. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about people having to pay poll taxes or people having to register their motor vehicles or get their driver\u2019s licenses,\u201d Gardner said Friday. \u201cI can say unequivocally that you don\u2019t have to worry about paying a poll tax. You don\u2019t have to worry about all these other things. It is easy to vote and anyone who shows up at a polling place in this election who is 18 and qualified to vote can vote.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office is setting up a hotline to assist voters and local election officials Tuesday.

(AP) \u2014 More redrawing of North Carolina legislative boundaries would be required next year if Friday\u2019s ruling by state judges striking down four state House districts stands.\n\nA three-judge panel Friday agreed with advocacy groups and voters that several alterations to Wake County districts last year violated North Carolina\u2019s constitutional prohibition against mid-decade redistricting.\n\nThe four districts are being used in Tuesday\u2019s election, but the ruling won\u2019t stop those races and could be appealed.\n\nIn their unanimous decision, the trial court judges told Republican mapmakers to fix the problems and approve a new Wake County House map by July 1 \u2014 or sooner if next year\u2019s legislative session ends before that date \u2014 for use in 2020 elections.\n\nThe plaintiffs want those districts returned to how they were initially drawn in 2011.

The U.S. Supreme Court received briefs this week from groups asking that they hear partisan gerrymandering claims.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling \u201cbrings us closer to the day that, for the first time this decade, the voice of the voters and not politicians\u2019 illegal manipulations will determine the outcome of elections,\u201d Allison Riggs with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, the plaintiffs\u2019 chief attorney, said in a release.\n\nThe current litigation originates from a 2016 federal court decision throwing out nearly 30 legislative districts in 2016. The legislature redrew the lines in August 2017, making changes to most Wake County districts.\n\nThe same federal court, with the help of an outside expert, later made more edits but said GOP lawmakers made alterations beyond what was required in Mecklenburg and Wake counties, citing the state prohibition. But the U.S. Supreme Court said last June the lower court wasn\u2019t supposed to rule on those questions, and allowed the GOP\u2019s additional changes in the two counties to remain.\n\nMeanwhile, the state NAACP, League of Women Voters, other groups and voters sued in state court over the four Wake districts \u2014 the case before Superior Court Judges Paul Ridgeway, Joseph Crosswhite and Alma Hinton.\n\nTheir ruling Friday declared the configuration of Wake County House districts violated the state constitution because altering Districts 36, 37, 40 and 41 \u201cwas not necessary to comply with federal law.\u201d\n\nRep.

(Shelley Mays/The Tennessean via AP)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 After four decades with only six executions, Tennessee is on schedule to execute three inmates this year.\n\nEdmund Zagorski died in the electric chair Thursday night after a last minute appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was declined. His death followed that of Billy Ray Irick\u2019s in August. David Earl Miller\u2019s execution is scheduled for Dec. 6.\n\nThe surge comes as legal challenges to the state\u2019s lethal injections protocols have hit a wall, at least temporarily.\n\n\u201cAs litigation plays out one state at a time, what we\u2019ve seen is individual states going on execution sprees,\u201d said Robert Dunham. He is the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which does not take a stand on the death penalty but is critical of the way it is applied.\n\nZagorski, 63, had been on death row for 34 years and seen three execution dates come and go before his Thursday electrocution. Miller, 61, has been on death row 36 years.\n\nAt least two things have made executions rare in Tennessee. Stringent legal protections for death penalty cases mean appeals can drag on through years, even decades. But even after the appeals are exhausted, challenges to execution methods have added more delays.\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court 2015 decision made those challenges harder by requiring inmates who object to one method of execution to show there is a readily available alternative that is more humane.\n\nThat condition caused a lethal injection challenge by Zagorski and other Tennessee inmates to fail last month. But it hasn\u2019t yet had a big effect nationally, where the trend in executions is downward.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center there have been 20 executions so far this year compared to 98 in 1999.\n\n\u201cEveryone says the dam is about to break and there\u2019s going to be a surge in executions,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cYou would think that if lethal injection litigation ends, you might see more executions. That could be the case, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\nOne reason is that fewer people are being sentenced to death. Nationally there has been an 85 percent drop in death sentences since the 1990s, Dunham said. Also, several states in recent years have either abolished capital punishment or imposed moratoriums. Washington\u2019s Supreme Court struck down the death penalty there just last month.\n\nBut national trends could not keep Zagorski from dying in the electric chair.\n\nKelley Henry, in the federal public defender\u2019s office in Nashville, fought for years to keep Zagorski alive. On Thursday night, she served as a witness to his death.\n\nHenry was nodding, smiling and tapping her heart just before the execution. Asked about her actions, Henry said afterward: \u201cI told him when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.\u201d\n\nShe said Zagorski told her the last thing he wanted to see was her smiling face, and so she made an effort to smile at him before a shroud was put over his face. Then Henry quietly wiped away tears.\n\nZagorski was executed for murdering Jimmy Porter and John Dotson in 1983. Prosecutors said he lured the two men into the woods with a promise to sell them marijuana, then shot them, slit their throats and robbed them.\n\nAccording to his rejected clemency petition, Zagorski reformed in prison, where he never had a single disciplinary infraction and was well liked among the staff.\n\nHenry said the inmate told prison staff before the execution, \u201cI don\u2019t want any of you to have this on your conscience. You\u2019re doing your jobs and I\u2019m all good.\u201d\n\nBut Dotson\u2019s daughter, Kim Dotson Rochelle, told The Tennessean, Zagorski never apologized to her family, even after he was strapped into the electric chair.\n\nZagorski\u2019s final words were, \u201cLet\u2019s rock.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no remorse for what he did. He was smiling just like he was when he was caught,\u201d Rochelle wrote in a text message to The Tennessean Thursday night. \u201cThat\u2019s why he got just what he deserved.\u201d", "Sure, the heavyweight championship is on the line at UFC 230.\n\nBut for Daniel Cormier and challenger Derrick Lewis, their biggest beef is over chicken.\n\nTheir chicken challenge goes back to July when the fighters shared the dais after they both fought on the same pay-per-view card. Cormier was feeling great after he flattened Stipe Miocic and won the heavyweight crown. Lewis also won and continued his ascent into contention.\n\nThe fighters joked for a while before Lewis could finally find a reason to dislike Cormier: \u201dHe disrespected that Popeye\u2019s chicken on a commercial a few years ago .\u201d A shirtless Cormier had starred in a parody video of \u201cAll About That Bass ,\u201d and danced with drumsticks out of a Popeye\u2019s box. Lewis mimicked Cormier\u2019s moves from the video at the news conference and both fighters erupted into laughter.\n\nThis kind of hype wasn\u2019t exactly brimming with the nastiness of Conor McGregor throwing a hand truck at a bus to get at his foe.\n\nBut Lewis (21-5) showed he\u2019s no chicken when comes to accepting title fights on short notice: He\u2019s fighting Cormier for the belt Saturday at Madison Square Garden just one month after knockout win at UFC 229.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got into the octagon into this quicker before I made it into UFC,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a problem at all. I just had to stay longer in the gym.\u201d\n\nCormier (21-1, 1 no-contest) fights for now as both the UFC heavyweight and light heavyweight champ, though his days as a dual champion are numbered no matter the outcome against Lewis. Cormier will be stripped of his light heavyweight title and the 205-pound crown will go to the winner of the Jon Jones-Alexander Gustafsson bout at UFC 232 on Dec. 29 in Las Vegas.\n\nCormier was a bit of a surprise main eventer in a card that has been shuffled because of injuries and the dire need to find a quality main event at MSG. He broke his right hand in the Miocic fight and had been posturing for a potential fight against former heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar.\n\nBut with UFC desperate for a worthy main event, Cormier was offered a payday he could not refuse. Plus, the allure of putting his name on the top of the marquee for a title defense at MSG appealed to his ego.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s massive to me to headline the Garden,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cStuff like that means something to me, which is a bit dangerous because the UFC knows, if they dangle the carrot, they know they can get me to bite by putting all that historical stuff in front of me. Legacy matters to me.\u201d\n\nThe 33-year-old Lewis also can\u2019t wait to get to the Garden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where all the famous fighters put down their mark in the sport,\u201d he said.\n\nLewis fights weeks after he took 129 significant strikes (78 to the head) in his win against Alexander Volkov. He\u2019s won eight of his last nine fights (three straight) on the strength of his significant knockout power that makes him a threat should he connected on that one devastating punch.\n\nBut Cormier has solidified himself as one of MMA\u2019s greatest fighters and most dominant wrestlers. Cormier has never lost to anyone except Jones, the star-crossed former light heavyweight champion who beat him twice. The second bout last year was changed to a no-contest when Jones failed a doping test that kept him out of the sport for 15 months.\n\nCormier said a KO was the only way he could lose.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a real nice, fun-loving guy but when he gets in there, he tries to knock your head off,\u201d Cormier said.\n\nLewis has also cashed on some notoriety that came from a PG-13 answer as to why he stripped off his shorts inside the cage after beating Volkov. His defense of Popeye\u2019s caught the eye of the fried chicken chain and one of the franchises is offering free food should Lewis win .\n\nCormier retaliated in the fast-food fight by throwing his weight behind burger joint Carl\u2019s Jr. Carl\u2019s changed its handle to \u201cDaniel Cormier fan account\u201d and tweeted, \u201dDMs are open DC let\u2019s shake this out .\u201d\n\nWith a diet of burgers and chicken, Cormier weighed in at a career-high 251.2 pounds for the fight. And he\u2019ll be keeping an eye on his waistline \u2014 the one he expects to still be wrapped with the title belt after Saturday night.\n\n_____\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CHARLESTON, W.Va.

Dobbins and Mike Weber, Ohio State\u2019s lack of success on the ground is perplexing. Purdue held the Buckeyes to 76 yards rushing. Neither of the backs has had a 100-yard rushing day since Dobbins picked up 121 against TCU in week three.\n\nMeyer said the bye week was spent working on that as well as making sure the right play is called, offensive linemen are getting a push and running backs are breaking tackles once open.\n\nHUSKERS RUN GAME ROLLING\n\nSenior Devine Ozigbo has emerged as the workhorse of the Nebraska offense.

In starting the past five games, he\u2019s averaging 124 yards and 9.3 yards per carry.\n\nThe Huskers are averaging 220.6 rushing yards a game, an increase of more than 110 yards from the 2017 season.\n\nBUCKEYE DOMINANCE\n\nOhio State has not punted in either of the last two games against Nebraska. While outscoring the Huskers by a combined 118-17, the Buckeyes had 20 full possessions and scored 16 touchdowns and kicked two field goals.\n\nIn last year\u2019s 56-14 win, the Buckeyes scored touchdowns on their first eight possessions and then, perhaps in an act of mercy, turned over the ball on downs on an incomplete pass at the Nebraska 20 late in the game.\n\nIn the 62-3 win in 2016, the Buckeyes had eight touchdowns and two field goals and lost a fumble in 11 possessions.\n\nQB CLUB\n\nNebraska freshman Adrian Martinez was recruited by Ohio State and hosted during his official visit by none other than Haskins.\n\nNebraska is looking more and more like a good fit for the dual-threat QB from Fresno, California. He\u2019s completing two-thirds of his passes and has 11 passing touchdowns. He has rushed for another 408 yards and four touchdowns.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s played in some tough environments,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on a Nebraska quarterback, I\u2019ve lived that. Playing in those loud stadiums against really good teams, he\u2019s already had a chance to do that. He\u2019s going to get another chance Saturday because we\u2019re playing in a great place to play college football and a loud stadium against a really good team.\u201d\n\nOn the other sideline, Haskins has emerged as a Heisman Trophy candidate and is threatening to break the school\u2019s single-season passing records.

Peterson ranks fifth in rushing with 587 yards, has four touchdowns, and is surrounded on the stats sheet by guys who weren't even in high school when Peterson broke in for Minnesota in 2007. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger, File)\n\nOf all the NFL seasonal awards, the one shaping up as the closest and most intriguing is for Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nHow could it not be with the likes of Aaron Rodgers and Adrian Peterson , who have won league MVP honors, plus three-time Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt and Colts quarterback Andrew Luck as front-runners?\n\nQuite a few big names are back in action after curtailed 2017 seasons, among them Carson Wentz, Odell Beckham Jr., David Johnson and Deshaun Watson. Unless they have spectacular second halves of the schedule, though, the attention belongs on that impressive quartet of Rodgers, Peterson, Watt and Luck.\n\nAll four have had a significant impact, perhaps most notably Peterson, the previous non-quarterback to win the league\u2019s MVP award (in 2012) and the only non-QB to take it since LaDainian Tomlinson in 2006. Remember, Peterson, 33, was available to everyone as a free agent before the Redskins reached out.\n\nHe has paid them back by ranking fifth in rushing with 587 yards, has four touchdowns, and is surrounded on the stats sheet by guys who weren\u2019t even in high school when Peterson broke in for Minnesota in 2007.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s embodied kind of a little bit of what we want to be about not only as an offense but as a team,\u201d says Redskins quarterback Alex Smith. \u201cI just think the way he\u2019s played on that edge \u2014 physical, relentless. I think that\u2019s what we want to be about, not only as an offense, but a football team playing with that kind of an edge all the time. That kind of physicality certainly helped set the tone for us quite a few times this year.\u201d\n\nWashington leads the NFC East at 5-2 even though its passing game ranks 26th. Credit a strong defense and the work of \u201cAll Day.\u201d\n\nThat moniker would certainly fit Watt, too. No one puts in more effort on the field \u2014 and Watt has put in the same level of diligence recovering from not one but two major injuries. He played a total of eight games in 2016-17.\n\nHis return to the Texans started slowly, as did Houston with three straight defeats. Then Watt began dominating, and the Texans (5-3) began winning. They now lead the AFC South, and Watt is tied for the conference lead with eight sacks while stopping the run as well as any edge rusher around.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not where I want to be yet,\u201d Watt says; that\u2019s a scary thought for opponents. \u201cI still have plenty of growth and plenty of things to work on. But I didn\u2019t make it to Game 8 in either of the last two seasons so I\u2019m happy with that ...\n\n\u201cLike I\u2019ve always said the whole time, I don\u2019t blame anybody who didn\u2019t know if I was going to be the same again because there were times I didn\u2019t know. So, I can\u2019t sit here and get too mad at people who thought I might be washed up or thought I might be done. Because I was sitting in that same boat when I was sitting at home with a cast on my leg and not being able to walk, and thinking: \u2018Man, will I be the same again?\u2019\u201d\n\nCertainly, Luck could have asked that same question after missing 2017 with a shoulder problem. It\u2019s never truly been clear if the injury was misdiagnosed or mistreated, or that Indy simply was fooled by the length of time its starting quarterback would need to recover.\n\nBut recover he has, and even with a paucity of skill position talent around him, Luck is looking very good. He has thrown for 23 touchdowns, second only to Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, who has tremendous talent at wideout and running back to work with. Luck is moving well and, most significantly, his arm strength is excellent.\n\nThen there\u2019s Rodgers, who might have grabbed last year\u2019s comeback award had he returned from his collarbone problems and revived Green Bay\u2019s season, getting the Packers into the playoffs. But it didn\u2019t play out that way last December, and he finished the season on injured reserve.\n\nSo he definitely qualifies in this category, and he has also battled a knee issue most of the season. Yet Rodgers has been at his MVP form even as the rest of the Packers struggle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the best or is tied for the best on the planet,\u201d 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan says. \u201cHe always has been. He\u2019s the man. I know he\u2019s not 100 percent, everyone knows that, but he seems to be a little bit better each week.

The stones there are monuments of artistic expression, lore and, in some cases, even a dark levity.\n\nBob Drinkwater \u201chad never set a foot in a cemetery\u201d as a University of Massachusetts student in the spring of 1968, when a friend suggested he join her and some friends who were going to do some gravestone rubbings at the North Amherst Cemetery.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine what it was, but why not? I went along,\u201d recalls Drinkwater, who wound up taking his first archeology course the following term and eventually changed his major from English to anthropology.\n\nDrinkwater, who\u2019d been bitten by the gravestone bug, became a member of the Greenfield-based Association for Gravestone Studies, attending its organizational event in Dublin, N.H. in 1976, at the height of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration, \u201cwith lots of interest in all things colonial,\u201d the amateur Amherst archeologist recalled.\n\n\u201cPeople came from out of the woodwork who were unbeknownst to each other who were very interested in old gravestones, each whittling in their own corner,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they got together, it lit a spark.\u201d\n\nWithin a year, many of them formed the association, which today has about 1,000 members \u2014 largely around New England and the Northeast, but also around the nation and the world. The association, whose trustees are around the Northeast, but also in Texas, Louisiana, Oregon, Canada and elsewhere, has been based in Greenfield for more than 20 years.\n\nMembers \u2014 who have since also formed local chapters \u2014 include other archeologists, art historians, social historians, stone conservationists, carvers, professionals and amateurs, art lovers and social history buffs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s everything you can think of\u201d on the agenda of the association\u2019s \u201ccemetery camp\u201d annual conferences, which attract anywhere from 100 to 150 enthusiasts from as far away as Australia each June in different locations around the country.\n\nAndrea Carlin of Greenfield, who with Drinkwater is co-chair of the Western New England chapter, is drawn to the \u201ckookier\u201d aspects of cemeteries, she said. These include pet cemetery memorials and tombs of people whose last name have something to do with food, often accompanied by a carving of a melon or a hamburger, for instance.\n\nMost members have academic interests, Carlin said, although \u201cwe do have a few \u2018goth\u2019 members, and members will trade photos of their favorite hobbies or interests.\n\n\u201cWe are very unique,\u201d said the association\u2019s board president, Elise Ceregna of Wakefield, explaining that members include writers, historians, English professors and conservators, as well as hobbyists, all drawn by an interest in ritual burial and how we memorialize our loved ones \u2014 \u201canything that reflects human culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just such a wide variety of topics that people can get interested in or look at,\u201d Ceregna said.\n\nTopics at last year\u2019s annual conference, in Danbury, Conn., ranged from \u201c199 Cemeteries to See Before You Die\u201d and \u201cThe Allure of Cemetery Tourism\u201d to \u201cWhat Should We Do About Confederate Monuments?\u201d and \u201cThe Necropolis Railway of Sydney, Australia.\u201d (Next year\u2019s conference will be held in Boiling Springs, N.C.)\n\nThe association also publishes its annual Markers journal, with articles such as \u2018\u201cGothic\u2019 Cast-Iron Gravemarkers of New Hampshire (And Beyond)\u201d and \u201cMuslim Gravestones in Detroit: A Study in Diversity.\u201d It also publishes a quarterly bulletin, which last winter-spring featured, \u201cGravestones of the Famous and Infamous,\u201d including \u201cHere Lies Buried the Body of John Belushi: \u2018I may be gone, but Rock and Roll lives on.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter finding Peter Spaulding\u2019s broken gravestone at the edge of Mount Hope Cemetery in Leverett, TaMara Conde, who operates Historic Gravestone Services, repaired it and put it back next to his wife\u2019s marker.

Those visits gave her a \u201crespect and love for stonework,\u201d which she has turned into her profession of doing gravestone restoration around the country.\n\nConde, who operates Historic Gravestone Services, said, while repairing stones at Leverett\u2019s Mount Hope Cemetery, \u201cTo me, they\u2019re all mysteries. That\u2019s one of the things we love about it. You go in, and there\u2019s the husband and the first wife, the second wife . But they\u2019re not always clearly marked. So you have to kind of go in and figure out what the story was \u2014 he was 86 and she died in childbirth, and she was only 32. And wait a minute! That\u2019s wife number two or three!\u201d\n\nConde, who\u2019s followed the trail of names on the headstones from Boston up to Portland, Maine, and then across to Oregon \u2014 like Lyman, Bagg, Sedgewick and Clark \u2014 said, \u201cThere\u2019s so many aspects\u201d of gravestones, from the artistic and structural, to the historic and geological, that the wonder can go on for all eternity.\n\nEven the small Leverett cemetery, tucked away on Chestnut Hill Road, where she used tiny red flags to mark stones dating back to the early 1800s that she\u2019s straightening, cleaning or repairing, is filled with silent stories of deep connections, like the broken grave marker of Peter Spaulding that she found at the graveyard\u2019s edge. Conde repaired the stone and returned it beside the grave of Spaulding\u2019s wife.\n\nOften, she said, money to do the work comes from Community Preservation Act funding that the towns\u2019 historical commissions can access.\n\nThere\u2019s a deep fascination that draws Conde and countless other antiquities aficionados to ancient cemeteries like Mount Auburn near Boston, the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France, or those of the San Francisco, Calif., necropolis suburb, Colma, as well as to the hundreds of graveyards that dot New England\u2019s towns and cities.\n\nConnected by websites and by the Greenfield-based association, Conde said, \u201cWe now know we exist, so we don\u2019t feel so isolated. We felt like we were the only ones, and thought we must be weird.\u201d\n\nCeregna added that whether it\u2019s, \u201cobjects, beliefs, popular culture, literary culture, visual culture \u2014 it\u2019s a huge menu of all sorts of areas of possible interest.

Additionally, he is working on an article about the more than a dozen professional and amateur carvers of Franklin County.\n\nAmong them were John Locke who worked in Whately and Deerfield from the 1770s to mid-1790s; Solomon Ashley of Deerfield who was active from about 1780 to 1810; Jonathan Allen of Bernardston, active from the mid-1790s to the 1820s; Bernardston\u2019s Chapin brothers, who worked from around 1810 to the 1840s; and Hopkins Woods, whose signed or initialed works appear in Sunderland, Ashfield, Whately, Deerfield, Conway and Hatfield.\n\n\u201cAs long as they were doing all of the work by hand, idiosyncrasies abounded,\u201d said Drinkwater, who offered a talk last month in Sunderland about its Riverside Cemetery. \u201cThe trick is to recognize the way they carved a face or wings, an urn, hands or certain letters. Everyone had a slightly different way of doing it, and some of them had very different ways of doing it. A lot of these guys were self-taught, so they would settle on a particular way of making an \u2018A\u2019 or the tail on a lowercase \u2018y.\u2019\u201d\n\nSamuel, Seth and Caleb Chapin cut slate from Bernardston\u2019s West Mountain quarry, while other carvers made use of metamorphic sandstone from New Salem, schist from Ashfield and sandstone from other parts of the Pioneer Valley.\n\nThen came the marble gravestones from a belt that stretched northward from around Danbury, Conn. to Vermont\u2019s Champlain Valley.\n\n\u201cFolks in Berkshire County got it into their heads they had a gold mine in those marble quarries and they could make a small fortune if they started shipping it,\u201d Drinkwater said.\n\nBy the 1780s, the first commercial quarries began operation, and the opening of the Erie Canal in the 1820s and the railroads in the 1850s and \u201960s made it available for shipment around the country. Ceregna noted that the development of pneumatic drills for quarrying resulted a shift from marble to granite for headstones.\n\nBut before that commercialization, gravestones sold locally for $5 to $10, Drinkwater said.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to inscribing it, they usually charged by the letter. If you were long-winded, you paid more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTHIS MONUMENT IS ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF Lieut Lemuel Delano, who died Dec. 21, 1792,\u201d reads one Riverside Cemetery stone, signed by Samuel Daugherty of Whately, who also engraved its $15 price, along with this inscription:\n\n\u201cLife how short, Eternity, how long.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Greenfield, Mass.)

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 There was so much promise for Duke and Miami.\n\nDuke was 4-0 and found its way into the AP Top 25. Miami started the season ranked No. 8, won five of its first six games and looked again to be the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s Coastal Division.\n\nAnd then things went bad \u2014 in a hurry.\n\nThe good times seem long ago for the Blue Devils (5-3, 1-3) and the Hurricanes (5-3, 2-2). Duke has dropped three of its last four games, and Miami has lost two straight to put its hopes of successfully defending the Coastal crown in serious jeopardy.\n\n\u201cBoth teams need a win,\u201d Miami coach Mark Richt said.\n\nThe Hurricanes are taking plenty of heat from their fan base these days, but if they need some positivity they need to look no further than to Duke coach David Cutcliffe.\n\nHe said Miami is \u201cprobably a football team without a weakness,\u201d and lauded the Hurricanes\u2019 defense as potentially the best in the country.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re as talented as anybody\u2019s seen anywhere,\u201d Cutcliffe said. \u201cSo what we have to do is minimize any errors, which is obvious, and we also have to play at an extremely high level.\u201d\n\nThe root of Miami\u2019s problems right now is its offense, and the struggles there are renewing calls from some fans on social media about Richt\u2019s playcalling.\n\nThose concerns about the offense had Richt playing defense.\n\n\u201cI respond to it in that there\u2019s nothing wrong with the plays being called, quite frankly,\u201d Richt said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong is we haven\u2019t executed well enough. If anybody got in the room with us and saw what we were doing and how we\u2019re doing it and why we\u2019re doing it, if they knew football, they\u2019d know we have to do a better job executing of what we call, quite frankly.\u201d\n\nDuke\u2019s defense forced a total of nine turnovers in its five wins \u2014 and zero in the three losses.\n\n\u201cIt has to become important to everybody in the organization to create turnovers and take care of the football,\u201d Cutcliffe said.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what to know going into Saturday night:\n\nBREAKING POINT\n\nMiami has held the lead for 6.6 percent of the time in its last three games \u2014 all of that coming in the final 11:52 of the massive comeback against Florida State \u2014 and hasn\u2019t scored first in any of its last seven games against ACC opponents going back to last season. Out of the 28 quarters in those seven games, Miami has held the end-of-period lead only eight times.\n\nCOMPARING SCORES\n\nComparing scores is a silly method of deciding whether one team should beat another, especially in the Coastal Division. Duke exemplifies why that method is futile. The Blue Devils beat Georgia Tech by 14 and lost to Virginia Tech by 17. So naturally, Georgia Tech beat Virginia Tech by 21 points. The only shared opponent Miami and Duke have so far this season is Virginia; the Hurricanes lost to the Cavaliers by three, the Blue Devils lost by 14.\n\nFIRST TO 20\n\nThe magic number on Saturday might be 20. Miami is 5-0 when it scores 20 points or more, 0-3 when it does not. Duke is 5-1 when it scores 20 or more, 0-2 when it does not.\n\nRIGHT AT HOME\n\nMiami has won its last eight ACC home games, by far the Hurricanes\u2019 best such streak since entering the conference in 2004. Before this current run started in 2016, Miami \u2014 somewhat unbelievably \u2014 had never won more than three consecutive ACC home contests. Miami actually started 17-18 in its first 35 ACC home games, and has gone 17-6 in those games since. Duke hasn\u2019t won at Miami since 1976, losing its last six trips.\n\nIT ALL CHANGED\n\nThe third anniversary of Miami\u2019s eight-lateral, shouldn\u2019t-have-counted kickoff return for a touchdown to beat Duke in 2015 was this week. Fortunes seemed to change on that play. Duke had won 25 of 34 games (.735) going into that game and has gone 18-21 (.462) since. Miami had won 22 of its last 40 games (.550) before that night in Durham, North Carolina, and has gone 28-12 (.700) since.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary in Durham, North Carolina contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "This undated photo provided by Southeast Ohio Regional Jail shows Rev.

Authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the Roman Catholic priest taking a now-pregnant altar girl to a wedding reception last year and whether the diocese responded appropriately when officials learned about the outing. Foxhoven was charged this week with sexual battery after informing the Steubenville diocesan bishop about his relationship with the 17-year-old. (Southeast Ohio Regional Jail via AP)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Authorities are investigating whether a Roman Catholic diocese in Ohio responded appropriately last November when it learned that a priest for two of its parishes had taken a now-pregnant altar girl to a wedding reception, Athens County Prosecutor Keller Blackburn told The Associated Press.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s office on Tuesday charged the Rev. Henry Christopher Foxhoven with eight counts of sexual battery for his relationship with the girl, who is 17. He is being held on a $1 million bond and doesn\u2019t have an attorney.\n\nRevelations about Foxhoven\u2019s behavior have shaken Catholics in the two small former mining towns where Foxhoven ministered, Blackburn said. The story began to unravel Oct. 26 when the 45-year-old priest and the teen told her parents she was two months pregnant. A spokesman for the Diocese of Steubenville said Foxhoven called Bishop Jeffrey Montforton the next day to tell him about the relationship.\n\nSpokesman Dino Orsatti said a diocesan attorney immediately called the Athens County Sheriff\u2019s Office to report what Montforton had learned. Foxhoven was ordered to move out of his parish residence at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Glouster and to stay out of that village and Buchtel, where he was pastor at St. Mary of the Hills.\n\nThe Athens County Sheriff\u2019s Office searched the residence Monday and found used condoms and a positive pregnancy test kit.\n\nBlackburn said his office received a call after the news broke from an out-of-town guest at last year\u2019s wedding reception who said she saw Foxhoven inappropriately touching the girl. The diocese sent a letter to Blackburn\u2019s office this week saying when it learned last November about the reception, it suspended the priest for a week and ordered him to receive counseling for \u201cboundary issues.\u201d\n\nThe diocese did not contact authorities when it learned about the outing. Orsatti said in an email that Foxhoven denied acting inappropriately and said the teen needed a ride to the reception.\n\n\u201cThe parents never filed a complaint and there were no complaints filed against Foxhoven,\u201d Orsatti said.\n\nUnder Ohio law, institutions such as churches, schools have a duty to report allegations of physical or sexual abuse of a minor.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, the church did everything right,\u201d Blackburn told the AP. \u201cI hope they did the right thing last year.\u201d\n\nFoxhoven became the pastor of Holy Cross around four years ago. Blackburn said the teen served as an altar girl and was \u201cheavily involved\u201d in the small parish.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s office is investigating when sexual contact between the teen and Foxhoven began. Blackburn said that if contact occurred before she turned 16, Ohio\u2019s age of consent, Foxhoven could face additional charges such as unlawful conduct with a minor or gross sexual imposition.\n\nBlackburn said Foxhoven \u201cgroomed\u201d the girl.\n\n\u201cHe took her at a young age and used religion to the point where she fell in love with him,\u201d he said.\n\nMontforton on Friday released a statement to the AP that said: \u201cThis is a devastating and heart-wrenching time for the diocese. The victim and the victim\u2019s family deserve our thoughts and prayers. The diocese is grieving over the admitted actions of Father Foxhoven.\u201d\n\nMontforton asked that anyone with information that could assist the investigation contact authorities.\n\nBlackburn said no one else has stepped forward to accuse Foxhoven of wrongdoing.\n\nThe diocese on Wednesday released the names of 16 priests and one seminarian it said had been credibly accused or had admitted to sexually abusing minors dating back to 1944 when the diocese was formed.

He was 91. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu, file)\n\nHONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Legendary Hong Kong film producer Raymond Chow, who introduced the world to Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan and even brought the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the big screen, has died at age 91.\n\nHong Kong\u2019 secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, said in a statement Friday that Chow \u201chelped nurture a pool of Hong Kong talents and brought them to the international stage.\u201d\n\nChow was a journalist who became a publicist for Shaw Brothers Studios, which churned out hundreds of films and popularized the kung fu genre. Studio founder Run Run Shaw soon moved Chow to the production side of the business after Chow complained that the movies \u2014 made on low budgets and short schedules \u2014 weren\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cI said I did not think I could keep my job because the pictures were so bad,\u201d Chow told Asiaweek magazine in 1983. Frustrated with Shaw Brothers\u2019 assembly-line ethic, he created his own production company, Golden Harvest, in 1970.\n\nHe soon outmaneuvered his gigantic old employer to grab the actor who would become synonymous with kung fu movies. Chow signed Bruce Lee in 1971 after seeing him on a Hong Kong television variety show.\n\n\u201cFacing you on the screen, you feel his presence is very strong, very powerful,\u201d Chow told The Associated Press in 2005.\n\nGolden Harvest signed Lee to a three-picture deal, with each breaking all Hong Kong box office records.\n\nThose movies were followed by \u201cEnter the Dragon,\u201d the first Chinese martial arts film to be produced by a major Hollywood studio, Warner Bros. It cost $500,000 and earned $40 million at the box office. Tragically, Lee died days before the film\u2019s release in 1973.\n\nLee\u2019s death left a void for kung fu heroes in Hong Kong\u2019s film industry that young performers were eager to fill. Chow signed one of them, a former stuntman named Jackie Chan, in 1979.\n\nChan\u2019s first taste of success in Hong Kong had come the year before with the film \u201cDrunken Master.\u201d After signing with Chow, he made a number of increasingly popular Chinese-language action-comedy movies that made him a superstar in Asia.\n\nChow invested plenty of time and effort introducing Chan to Western audiences. He arranged for Chan to spend time in Los Angeles learning English and star in his first English-language film, 1980\u2032s \u201cThe Big Brawl,\u201d which flopped. A year later, Chow gave him a minor role alongside top Hollywood names in \u201cThe Cannonball Run.\u201d But it was 1995\u2032s \u201cRumble in the Bronx\u201d that catapulted Chan to worldwide fame. The film was released on 1,700 screens in North America and grossed $32.4 million, becoming the most successful Hong Kong film released in the U.S. Three years later, Chan teamed up with Chris Tucker in 1998\u2032s \u201cRush Hour,\u201d becoming a Hollywood A-list actor.\n\nChan acknowledged the debt he owed to Chow\u2019s grooming.\n\n\u201cMr. Chow gave me a chance to follow my dreams,\u201d he told Variety in 2000. \u201cI think today that without Golden Harvest, there is no Jackie Chan.\u201d\n\nGolden Harvest also helped bring to the silver screen another set of unlikely martial arts characters, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which began as a comic book and then became an animated kids\u2019 TV show with a cult following. Intrigued by the name, Chow agreed to produce a live-action movie based on the four crime-fighting, human-sized turtles after Hollywood rejected the idea.\n\nThe movie about the pizza-eating, surfer-lingo-spouting terrapins named after Renaissance artists became a worldwide smash.\n\nChow said that he made his choice based on a \u201cgut feeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very weird, very unique and very interesting. ... You have to be unique these days to be a big success.\u201d\n\nChow was born in Hong Kong to a nationalistic father skeptical of Western influences. Following his father\u2019s wishes, he completed his secondary and university studies in Shanghai.\n\nAs a journalist, Chow worked at English-language news outlets in Hong Kong, including United Press, which later became United Press International; The New York Times; and Voice of America.\n\nChow, an avid bridge player, told Forbes in 1990 about the business lessons he learned playing cards.\n\n\u201cWhen you are fortunate, you try to take advantage. And when you get a bad hand, you just try to watch yourself, minimize your losses, so that you don\u2019t get killed.\u201d\n\nGolden Harvest made its last film in 2003.

(AP) \u2014 The small device soared to nearly 250 feet, cruising and hovering over the part of town where a tornado was believed to have landed late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt was a drone, which was being used late Thursday morning to assess the path and damage of the suspected twister by taking hundreds of photographs.\n\nLocal firefighter Samuel Nelson, who has a drone business in Lakeville where he lives, was operating the drone in the Mansfield Avenue (Route 140)/Reservoir Street area near Norton Reservoir.\n\nNelson had been approached by Fire Chief Paul Schleicher about using one of his three drones for the storm investigation, and he was all in.\n\nSchleicher, Police Chief Brian Clark and Fire Capt. Jason Robbins accompanied Nelson to the area, launching the drone from property at 50 Mansfield Ave., near where some of the worst damage took place Tuesday.\n\nMost of the damage was downed trees, limbs and utility wires, but a garage was heavily damaged as was a pickup truck.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the extent of the damage,\u201d Nelson said after viewing the damage in person and through photos from the drone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we typically see around here and I see from the air, so it was definitely interesting to see.\u201d\n\nExperts with the National Weather Service, which has its regional office in Norton, visited Wednesday and declared a tornado had landed in the area.\n\nNelson used information from the weather service and damage reports from firefighters and police to program a flight path or grid for the drone.\n\n\u201cI ended up making a map,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nThe drone flew for about 20 minutes but in that time it was able to take 256 photos.\n\n\u201cIt went very well,\u201d Nelson said, adding of the photos, \u201cthey\u2019re looking good. We were able to look at the path and extent of the damage and how the area recovered.\u201d\n\nIt took a few hours to process the photos and compile them into a compilation photo. He has to put his data processing skills to work for that.\n\nNelson hopes to sell some of the photos to the weather service.\n\nThe weather service is still investigating and reviewing its findings but has estimated wind speeds from the tornado it determined touched down on Freeman Street and traveled northeast to Reservoir Street ranged from 90 to 95 mph. Those speeds place the tornado on the low end of the spectrum for such storms.\n\nLast month, Nelson used his drones for three days to help the National Transportation Safety Board view home, building and gas transfer station damage in the Merrimack Valley caused by natural gas explosions.\n\n\u201cUsing them locally is kind of interesting,\u201d Nelson said of Thursday\u2019s work.\n\nNelson had served on the Plainville Fire Department for 14 years before joining the Norton Fire Department a few years ago.\n\nIt was with the Plainville department that he started a search and rescue drone program that was one of the first Federal Aviation Administration- authorized drone programs in Massachusetts.\n\nNelson has been a licensed FAA commercial remote pilot for two years. That allows him to fly unmanned, small fixed wing aircraft that can cover miles of territory for about an hour at a time.\n\nHe is also a member of FAA\u2019s SafetyTeam, or FAASTEAM.\n\nAs for his drone business, Aerial Integration Consulting, started in June 2017 and which provides services to government agencies and others, Nelson said \u201cit\u2019s been extremely busy and successful.\u201d\n\nOne client is the Massachusetts Department of Transportation\u2019s Aeronautics Division.\n\nLast March, he assisted the division assessing storm flooding damage in the Quincy area and had to get clearance to fly drones in Logan Airport airspace.\n\nNelson has been flying drones for about 20 years, long before they became popular with hobbyists and professionals and the technologically savvy.\n\n\u201cI started flying remote controlled helicopters and planes as a preteen,\u201d Nelson said, and that hobby combined with an interest in photography made drone flying a natural step. \u201cI loved it,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2EQ4wim\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The (Attleboro, Mass.)

(AP) \u2014 Tennessee insists it isn\u2019t dwelling on its blown lead from a week ago or looking ahead as it takes a break from Southeastern Conference competition to face Conference USA program Charlotte.\n\nThere\u2019s too much at stake.\n\nAfter squandering a 21-9 second-half lead in a 27-24 loss at South Carolina last week, Tennessee must win three of its last four games to become bowl eligible .\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to focus on our game plan this week and focus on Charlotte,\u201d Tennessee linebacker Daniel Bituli said. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good team. If we were to focus on these upcoming games, it would really derail us.\u201d\n\nTennessee (3-5) has done a good job of avoiding these types of pitfalls against Group of Five teams. The Vols have won their last 29 home games against teams that aren\u2019t part of the Power Five.\n\nCharlotte owns a 4-4 record this season after going 1-11 a year ago. Tennessee coach Jeremy Pruitt says his team won\u2019t take this 21-point underdog lightly.\n\n\u201cIf somebody\u2019s looking at it that way, they\u2019re not ready to play,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThese guys have a better record than we do. If you look at them statistically, they\u2019re better than us in probably every statistical category. They have 85 guys on scholarship just like we do. We\u2019ll have to be at our best to give ourselves a chance to have success Saturday.\u201d\n\nTennessee gets the opportunity Saturday to work on its rushing offense and run defense - two areas that have proved troublesome this season.\n\nThe Vols rank last in the SEC in yards rushing per game (141.1) and yards per carry (3.6). They also are 11th in rushing yards allowed per game (169.8) and are 13th in yards allowed per carry (4.8).\n\nCharlotte\u2019s task is to avoid getting intimidated by a setting unlike anything the 49ers have encountered before.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t let the environment affect you,\u201d Charlotte coach Brad Lambert said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s so big. We\u2019ve been to Louisville (in 2016). We\u2019ve been to Kentucky (in 2015). We went to Kansas State (in 2017), which is extremely loud. But they aren\u2019t necessarily as big a stadium as this. This will be the biggest stadium by far that our kids have played in. It will be kind of a shock to them, I\u2019m sure, when they walk in.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch Saturday when Tennessee hosts Charlotte.\n\nPREMIER PICKER\n\nCharlotte linebacker Juwan Foggie has a school-record six interceptions to lead all Football Bowl Subdivision players , and he\u2019s scored on two interception returns. He will try to get a seventh interception against Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano, who hasn\u2019t been picked off in his last 105 attempts. Guarantano has thrown only two interceptions all season.\n\nBIG RECEIVERS\n\nLambert says he\u2019s concerned by the size of Tennessee receivers Marquez Callaway and Jauan Jennings. The 6-foot-2 Callaway has 27 catches for 372 yards. Jennings is 6-3 and has 26 receptions for 335 yards and three touchdowns. Charlotte\u2019s starting cornerbacks are 5-11 D.J. Anderson and 5-9 Nafees Lyon.\n\nFORMER HURRICANE\n\nCharlotte quarterback Evan Shirreffs is a graduate transfer from Miami. Shirreffs will be making his third start since taking over for Chris Reynolds, who underwent season-ending ankle surgery last month.\n\nON THE RUN\n\nSEC teams generally enjoy major physical advantages in matchups with Conference USA teams, but Charlotte\u2019s stats suggest the Vols may not be able to run wild this week. Charlotte is ranked sixth among all FBS teams in run defense and is allowing 3.1 yards per carry and 89.8 yards rushing per game.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR LeMAY\n\nCharlotte running back Benny LeMay has rushed for 745 yards while averaging 5.3 yards per carry. He also has 16 catches for 226 yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee", "FERNDALE, Mich.

(AP) \u2014 Florida State started the year with optimism from the arrival of a new coach and a national ranking, while North Carolina State earned its own spot in the AP Top 25 after a 5-0 start.\n\nNow both the Seminoles and Wolfpack are trying to regroup from confidence-dinging losses entering Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nThe Seminoles (4-4, 2-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) arrive in Raleigh after a 59-10 loss to No. 2 Clemson, an ugly loss on several levels: It was the program\u2019s worst at Doak Campbell Stadium and the questions about effort and discipline that lingered afterward.\n\nFlorida State\u2019s leading receiver Nyqwan Murray and reserve linebacker Zaquandre White are suspended for the first half of Saturday\u2019s game against the Wolfpack (5-2, 2-2) after throwing punches at Clemson players in separate incidents during the loss. There\u2019s also uncertainty at quarterback, where the status of every-game starter Deondre Francois is in question after getting banged up against Clemson.\n\nFirst-year FSU coach Willie Taggart hasn\u2019t specified the nature of Francois\u2019 injury, other than to say he thought he hit his head on the ground during the Clemson game. James Blackman, who took over as the starter in 2017 after Francois was injured in the season opener, got at least some first-team reps in practice while Francois did little during open sessions of practice.\n\n\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see him do anything, but he\u2019s still day to day,\u201d Taggart said.\n\nFlorida State hasn\u2019t had a losing season since 1976 and has played in a bowl game every season since 1982. A loss at N.C. State, where the Seminoles have won two straight meetings, will put those streaks in jeopardy with No. 3 Notre Dame, No. 13 Florida and No. 24 Boston College still on the schedule.\n\nN.C. State suffered its own lopsided loss to the Tigers, a 41-7 road loss on Oct. 20. The Wolfpack then lost at Syracuse 51-41, a two-game stretch that exposed weaknesses in a defense that had gotten off to a good start in overcoming the loss to veteran talent to the NFL.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve beaten two really good ACC teams and we\u2019ve lost to two good ACC team,\u201d Wolfpack coach Dave Doeren said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got five games left. ... And at the end of the year, you can look back and be proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished or disappointed. You don\u2019t want regret.\u201d\n\nYet the Wolfpack still can pursue the program\u2019s second 10-win season, the other coming in 2002 with a program-record 11 wins.\n\nHere are some other things to know about Saturday\u2019s FSU-N.C. State game:\n\nINJURY QUESTIONS\n\nN.C. State missed injured key players last week, including starting offensive tackle Justin Witt, starting cornerback Nick McCloud and No. 2 running back Ricky Person Jr. Doeren expressed confidence Monday that they would all be back this week, though he was noncommittal on their status after Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\nSTOPPING HARMON\n\nWolfpack receiver Kelvin Harmon is an NFL prospect with the size and skill to make contested catches . Like the rest of the Wolfpack, he had a bad game at Clemson, then came back with 11 catches for 247 yards \u2014 the No. 2 single-game total in program history \u2014 and two touchdowns against the Orange. If Harmon gets in a groove with quarterback Ryan Finley again, FSU\u2019s defense could have a tough time getting off the field.\n\nLOST PRODUCTION\n\nMurray has 40 catches for 536 yards and three touchdowns, so the Seminoles will miss him as a threat for the first half. \u201cI would say it\u2019s an opportunity,\u201d receiver D.J. Matthews said.\n\nGROUND GAME\n\nN.C. State could help itself by getting its rushing attack going again. The Wolfpack\u2019s rushing total had increased for the first five games to a season-high 225 yards against Boston College, but the production has fallen off with 104 yards against Clemson and 68 yards against Syracuse. While Reggie Gallaspy has run for touchdowns in two straight games, North Carolina State missed Person\u2019s big-play potential .\n\nBURNS\u2019 PRESSURE\n\nFlorida State defensive end Brian Burns is tied for the ACC lead with nine sacks to lead a pass rush that ranks 15th in the Bowl Subdivision ranks by averaging 3.13 sacks per game. The Wolfpack will have to keep Burns away from Finley.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Bob Ferrante in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap", "WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Sixty-eight years later, the story sounds like something out of \u201cPoltergeist.\u201d\n\nOn May 11, 1950, a thousand people jammed traffic outside 14 Douglas St. to see the three-family house shake, its windows rattle, walls crack and ceiling plaster crumble.\n\nStrange rumblings accompanied by a heavy pounding noise had rattled the house at intervals every spring for three years, the Worcester Telegram reported at the time.\n\nNo cause could be found for the mysterious phenomenon, which affected no other house on the street.\n\n\u201cShaking House a Mystery and Headache to Tenants,\u201d read the headline on the front-page story in the Worcester Telegram on May 13, 1950.\n\n\u201cSHOWS WINDOWS THAT RATTLE\u201d was the caption on an accompanying photo of a neighborhood girl pointing to the first-floor apartment. \u201cPOINTS TO CRACK\u201d read the description under a picture of a neighbor showing a damaged wall in a third-floor bathroom.\n\nEven The Boston Globe took notice. \u201cPolice Assigned to Ghost-Hunt in Worcester\u201d read the headline in an item in the Globe on May 12, 1950, which noted two officers had been posted to the scene that Thursday after teenagers threw rocks at the \u201chaunted house.\u201d\n\nWere \u201cpoltergeists\u201d to blame, as the Globe, tongue-in-cheek, wondered? Or did the vibrations that shook 14 Douglas St. have a more down-to-earth explanation?\n\nThe truth is shrouded in the mists of time. But of the possible explanations that present themselves, one involves the supernatural, and the other decidedly does not.\n\nPrompted by a letter from a woman who once lived next door, and had grown up hearing ghost stories about the place, the Telegram & Gazette set out to investigate what the paper in 1950 called \u201cWorcester\u2019s mysterious house\u201d at 14 Douglas St.\n\n?(This) has long been a mystery to my family,\u201d Lauren King of Greer, South Carolina, wrote. Ms. King explained that her great-uncle, a Worcester fireman named Michael Hallahan, lived with his wife, Nora, in the first-floor apartment at 14 Douglas St. when the unusual events took place.\n\nMs. King\u2019s grandmother, Elizabeth Hallahan, a Worcester police officer\u2019s widow, lived next door at 16 Douglas St., where Ms. King was raised in the late 1960s and \u201970s.\n\n\u201cAs you can well imagine, they are all deceased now and all that\u2019s left is the speculation and ghost stories that have come along the way,\u201d Ms. King, now 61 and a nurse in Greenville, South Carolina, wrote.\n\nThe Telegram on Saturday, May 13, 1950, described a remarkable scene on Douglas Street, where the three-family at No. 14 had \u201cquivered\u201d as if \u201cshaken by a giant hand.\u201d Two nights before a crowd estimated at 1,000 had come from across the city to view the house, the paper reported. The next day, perhaps 500 had watched \u201cas experts conducted an exhaustive three-hour search for the cause - and went away still baffled.\u201d\n\nEach disturbance lasted about a minute. The quakes knocked pictures from the wall and dishes from the shelves. A third-floor resident, Mrs. Arthur Singleton, told the Telegram she had seen a bed on the first floor jump off the floor while a \u201cspasm\u201d was in progress. She said closed doors strained as if someone were trying to rip them from their hinges.\n\nResidents said radios in the house emitted peculiar whistles during the poundings, which usually occurred between 9 p.m. and midnight, though sometimes between 5:30 and 10 a.m. The shaking incidents were reported over three years beginning in the spring after the frost had left the ground. The vibrations were plainly visible from the outside in daylight, the Telegram reported.\n\nThe city\u2019s public works commissioner watched the shaking and couldn\u2019t explain it, the paper reported. Gas, electric company, and water and sewer bureau crews likewise were at a loss to explain the mystery, as were engineers who checked the foundation of the house and found nothing amiss.\n\nMs. King said she grew up with stories about the house being targeted by an angry ghost - in the family\u2019s telling, that of her great-grandmother, fireman Michael Hallahan\u2019s mother, Mary Daly Hallihan, who died in 1928 unreconciled to her son\u2019s choice of a wife.\n\n\u201cThe story that I got from my grandmother and my aunt and uncle - they were all Irish, and full of whatever - (was) that Michael\u2019s mother, who was from Ireland, didn\u2019t like the woman he was going to marry,\u201d Ms. King said in a phone conversation this past week.\n\n\u201cShe told him straight out, \u2018If you marry this woman, I swear if there\u2019s any way to come back, I\u2019m gonna come back and haunt you.\u2019 This was the story in our family, that Grandmother Hallihan came back and haunted them because he married the wrong woman.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to marry Lizzie Monahan, who lived across the street on Douglas Street. (Instead) he married this girl from Ireland, Nora Maroney. They didn\u2019t like her and there was a lot of family fighting and all that. I heard this story so many times.\u201d\n\nMary Daly Hallihan and her husband, Patrick, are buried in the family plot in St. John\u2019s Cemetery in Worcester. (The stone notes the spelling of their name as Hallihan, changed to Hallahan by subsequent generations.) A black-and-white photo from the 1920s depicts the rough-hewn couple wearing stern expressions and looking, in this picture anyway, quite capable of haunting a house.\n\nWas Grandmother Hallihan behind the unexplained banging and shaking?\n\nThe family of the house\u2019s owner in 1950 offers a more mundane - but head-scratching, in its own way - explanation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not as haunted as you think it is,\u201d said Randy Chavoor, a retired Worcester Fire Department district chief, whose late grandmother, Victoria Chavoor, owned the three-family at 14 Douglas St. at the time of the disturbances. \u201cFrom what I was told,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cit\u2019s not as exciting as it sounds.\u201d\n\nWhere university engineers were unable to find the cause of the shaking, Chavoor family members say, a plumber later did - behind the medicine cabinet in the wall of the first-floor apartment.\n\n\u201cAccording to my cousin, someone put a washing-machine motor inside the wall,\u201d Chief Chavoor said. \u201cShe\u2019s 99 percent sure, though she doesn\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble, that it was the first-floor person, who wanted to buy the house from our grandmother. There was some type of motor, he evidently put power to it, and it was enough to shake the whole house.\u201d\n\nIt was said among the Chavoor family that the man on the first floor wanted to buy the house, and that perhaps he was trying to make the place appear haunted to get the price down. \u201cMy cousin believes that\u2019s what the whole thing was,\u201d Chief Chavoor said. \u201cShe thought it was a washing-machine motor.\u201d\n\nOther family members confirmed this was their understanding of what happened. The cousin, who asked that her name not be printed, was 10 years old in 1950, and recalled walking up from the mom-and-pop store the family operated at the corner of Grand and Douglas streets to see the house shake. She said she had heard that certain residents of 14 Douglas donned sheets and stood in the windows when a crowd gathered outside, drawn by word of the latest shaking.\n\nSo was Worcester\u2019s mystery house a hoax? \u201cMike and Nora moved over to Heard Street, and there was no more shaking, so I don\u2019t know,\u201d the Hallahans\u2019 niece, Ms. King, acknowledges.\n\nIn the years since there have been no reported recurrences of the odd vibrations. The current owner of 14 Douglas, Juana Manzano, who lives on the second floor, this past week had no ghost stories to tell. Down the block at Guertin\u2019s Cafe at 139 Grand St., a bartender who said she lived at 16 Douglas for a time could recall nothing unusual about the house next door.\n\nNeither could Ms. King, who said as a teenager she sometimes baby-sat at 14 Douglas and could remember \u201cno shaking or anything like that.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s not convinced by the story about a motor in the wall.\n\nMs. King cites accounts of beds jumping off the floor, water coming out of toilets and dishes breaking. \u201cWould a washing-machine motor do that?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy that at all.\u201d\n\nPeople tend to embellish, she said, but nonetheless, an old neighbor who lived at the end of the street and whose account she found reliable told her: \u201cYou could see the house rocking.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I still think it\u2019s the grandmother.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2yEtf3t\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), http://www.telegram.com", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NFL kicked off its \u201dSalute to Service \u201d campaign to honor the nation\u2019s military, veterans and their families by pledging to donate up $5 to its nonprofit partners for every use of the hashtag Salute To Service through Nov. 19.\n\nThe league will quadruple its offering to $25 for every use of the designated hashtag on Veterans Day Nov. 11.

(AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech hopes it\u2019s finally found its groove. North Carolina has been close \u2014 but that\u2019s not good enough for the Tar Heels.\n\nThe surging Yellow Jackets visit the Tar Heels on Saturday looking to move closer to bowl eligibility and keep alive their longshot hopes in their topsy-turvy division race.\n\nGeorgia Tech (4-4, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won three of four to move back to .500 after a 1-3 start that put some pressure the Yellow Jackets. Their famed triple-option offense ran all over Virginia Tech last week, rolling up 465 yards rushing in a 49-28 rout of the Hokies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to play for,\u201d coach Paul Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re still alive in the conference. We\u2019re trying to play to get bowl eligible. There\u2019s a ton to play for.\u201d\n\nFor North Carolina (1-6, 1-4), there\u2019s no more margin of error. In order to earn bowl eligibility for the first time since 2016, the Tar Heels must win their remaining four games \u2014 then find a replacement for the game with UCF that was canceled because of Hurricane Michael, and win that one, too.\n\nThey\u2019ve been close lately, but haven\u2019t been able to close out a victory in more than a month.\n\nSince their 37-point loss at Miami, they\u2019ve lost twice by three points apiece \u2014 once in overtime at Syracuse, another when Virginia Tech scored the winning touchdown with 19 seconds left following a critical fumble.\n\nCoach Larry Fedora acknowledged that there\u2019s \u201cplenty of frustration.\n\n\u201cWe talk about it as a team. We talk about how close we are and the difference between winning and losing and what we need to do,\u201d Fedora said. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy with what\u2019s going on. Everybody\u2019s searching, and everybody\u2019s looking at me. I\u2019m the leader of this team, and ... I\u2019m responsible for giving them answers.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch when Georgia Tech visits North Carolina on Saturday:\n\nROTATING QBS\n\nJohnson says senior captain TaQuon Marshall will start at quarterback while Tobias Oliver also will play after putting up big numbers against the Hokies. Oliver rushed for three touchdowns in his first start at QB. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the game plan,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cTobias has played well whenever he has gone in. I think he has played in every game and he\u2019ll play Saturday at some point. It doesn\u2019t really change. We don\u2019t change a whole lot of what we do depending on who\u2019s at quarterback.\u201d\n\nNO PASS\n\nGeorgia Tech\u2019s only pass attempt against Virginia Tech was an incompletion by Oliver. It was the first time since Nov. 26, 1977, when the Yellow Jackets beat Georgia 16-7, that they did not complete a pass. It was the 18th time since 2002 that a FBS had no completions and those teams that did it were 14-4.\n\nFORCED TURNOVERS ON THE RISE\n\nFirst-year defensive coordinator Nate Woody has produced more forced turnovers for Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets have forced 17 turnovers this season, including nine interceptions. Their 2017 total through 11 games was only 10. \u201cThere are games we\u2019ve played better than some other games,\u201d Johnson said of the adjustment to Woody\u2019s 3-4 scheme. \u201cI think overall what we\u2019re doing is sound and I think it\u2019s repetition and the more they do it the better they\u2019ll get at it.\u201d\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAY\n\nUNC\u2019s offense had largely been a mess entering its open date, but the Tar Heels have moved the ball more effectively the past three weeks. They had a season-high 522 yards against Virginia Tech, then had 500 more against Syracuse before sputtering for much of the second half at Virginia. And quarterback Nathan Elliott has four touchdowns with no interceptions in the past two games.\n\nSLIDING\n\nThe Tar Heels are in the midst of a major slide that began in the final month of the 2016 season. That team was ranked 15thin the AP Top 25 and had won 18 of 22 games, including a 13-2 record against ACC teams, entering a trip to Duke. But dating to that loss, North Carolina has lost 13 of 18 games and gone 2-13 against league opponents.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Markets Right Now: Stocks end a strong week slightly lower\n\nFILE- In this Oct. 24, 2018, file photo specialist Gregg Maloney, left, and trader Timothy Nick work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Fla. In the past, Florida's top races were tug-of-wars over taxes and education and insurance. This time around the governor's race is a proxy battle between President Donald Trump, who brought GOP gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis to prominence, and Democrats who oppose him. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida is emerging as an epicenter of the nation\u2019s polarizing politics in the final days of the 2018 campaign.\n\nIn the closely contested campaign for governor, President Donald Trump and GOP nominee Ron DeSantis have used what has been called racially coded language to slam Democrat Andrew Gillum. The battles for the governor\u2019s mansion and a key U.S. Senate seat are playing out in communities still recovering from a killer hurricane and one of the nation\u2019s deadliest school shootings.\n\nVirtually every hot-button cultural issue tearing at the nation \u2014 including guns, race and the environment \u2014 is unfolding in a deeply personal way here.\n\nThat\u2019s a sharp change in a state where elections notoriously come down to the wire. Politicians in both parties traditionally focus on winning over moderate voters, especially those living along Interstate 4 in the shadow of Disney World, to eke out a win. Not so in the Trump era as each side scrambles to mobilize its strongest supporters.\n\n\u201cThis election is truly a choice between results and resistance,\u201d Trump told a crowd during a rally in southwest Florida. \u201cThis is really an election between greatness and gridlock.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s visit is just one of two stops planned this week to bolster DeSantis and Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nThe Democrats are out in force in the Sunshine State, as well. Former President Barack Obama visited Democratic-vote-rich South Florida on Friday, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders visited college campuses mid-week, urging students to vote for Democratic nominee Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor who could become the state\u2019s first black governor.\n\nSpeaking to a crowd of about 3,000 in Miami, Obama warned voters not to get bamboozled by misinformation while Republicans allow polluters to poison the environment, give tax cuts to billionaires and take healthcare away from millions.\n\n\u201cWe need leaders who will actually stand up for what\u2019s right regardless of party,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLeaders who represent the best of the American spirit. Patriots who will stand up for anyone whose fundamental rights are at stake.\u201d\n\nDuring his stop at the University of Central Florida, Sanders railed at Trump and contended he was coming to the state because he is worried that DeSantis will lose the governor\u2019s race. DeSantis, a former congressman, won the GOP primary over a much-better-funded opponent largely based on Trump\u2019s backing.\n\n\u201cI say to Donald Trump: This country has struggled with discrimination of all kinds for too many years,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe say to Trump today, \u2019We are not going backwards into more discrimination. We are going forward to celebrate our diversity.\u201d\n\nThe ramped-up campaign rhetoric in the closing days shows signs of bringing a surge of voters with it.\n\nThis election is on pace to significantly surpass the turnout of Florida\u2019s past five midterm elections, stretching back two decades. By Friday, nearly 4.1 million people had either voted by mail or at an early voting location.\n\nElection Day will wrap up a bitter campaign season that witnessed the battle between DeSantis and Gillum veer into racial politics and heated exchanges over a long-simmering FBI investigation involving Gillum\u2019s home city.\n\nRight after the primary, DeSantis said Florida voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum, a comment Democrats contend was racially charged. Trump also called Gillum a \u201cthief\u201d and corrupt, a move the mayor says is meant to reinforce negative stereotypes of black men.\n\nThe Gillum campaign, meanwhile, cut ties with a Democratic Party vendor and a campaign volunteer caught on video calling Florida a \u201ccracker\u201d state and saying the campaign was taking advantage of \u201cwhite guilt.\u201d\n\nThe Senate race between Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has taken a back seat to the governor\u2019s race, but it too has centered largely on name-calling and insults lobbed in tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of negative television ads. Scott has painted Nelson as an ineffective career politician, while Nelson has labeled Scott untrustworthy because of questions about how the multimillionaire governor has handled his finances while in office.\n\nFor months, Scott had kept his distance from Trump and even disagreed with the president on items such as the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. But he joined Trump in southwest Florida and plans to be with him again Friday in Pensacola. For some voters, that may prove to be all the difference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a huge Rick Scott supporter,\u201d said Allison Chiddo, a West Palm Beach resident who attended Trump\u2019s Estero rally. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the swamp. ... I\u2019m not going to sit here and BS you. I don\u2019t trust either one. I\u2019m going to vote the way Trump sees it.\u201d\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s mid-week rally, DeSantis took the stage, where he bashed Gillum as a \u201cfailed mayor\u201d who was \u201changing out with Bernie Sanders.\u201d DeSantis also railed at Gillum for saying that Trump should be impeached.\n\nGillum, during a stop this week at a bayside restaurant in Destin, barely mentioned Trump or DeSantis but still got in a jab.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s on the other side of us, I am always going to be team Florida, so whether it\u2019s Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis, if you come after Florida, if you come after Floridians, you\u2019re gonna have to go through me,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in Estero, Mike Schneider in Orlando and Brendan Farrington in Destin contributed to this story.", "MANCHESTER, Vt.

The Wildcats (3-5, 1-4) are coming off a 51-14 loss at Oklahoma that was their fourth loss in five games.\n\nBoth TCU and K-State have to win at least three of their last four games just to be bowl eligible. That means one of them is going to have to win its last three games to get to six wins.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Norman is tough to shake off,\u201d Wildcats center Adam Holtorf said. \u201cThere definitely is some anger and frustration in what happened. We didn\u2019t execute, we didn\u2019t compete, it was a tough loss to take. So there is some anger, but we\u2019re trying to channel that in the right ways to motivate ourselves and try and get better.\u201d\n\nTCU has actually lost five of its last six games, with the only win in that stretch 17-14 at home over Iowa State after a field goal in the final minute.

The National Transportation Safety Board said the autonomous driving system on the Volvo spotted Herzberg about six seconds before hitting her, but did not stop because the system used to automatically apply brakes in potentially dangerous situations had been disabled. A Volvo emergency braking system also had been turned off.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to really work to regain that trust and to work to help move the entire industry forward,\u201d Noah Zych, Uber\u2019s head of system safety for self-driving cars, said in an interview. \u201cWe think the right thing to do is to be open and transparent about the things that we are doing.\u201d\n\nAmong the other precautions, San Francisco-based Uber will keep the autonomous vehicle system engaged at all times and activating the Volvo\u2019s automatic emergency braking system as a backup.\n\nIn addition, Uber is requiring more technical training and expertise of employees sitting behind the wheel of the vehicles, according to a 70-page safety report the company released Friday.\n\nThe report comes after the ride-hailing company shut down autonomous vehicle testing to do an internal review of its safety procedures, as well as an outside review by risk management firm LeClairRyan.\n\nAlthough the report covered all the main bases, Uber should have gone even further given its self-driving car killed Herzberg, said Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant law professor at the University of South Carolina who has been studying the issues affecting autonomous vehicles. In its most glaring omission, Uber didn\u2019t accept responsibility for Herzberg\u2019s death \u2014 the first involving a fully autonomous vehicle, he said.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m looking for more from Uber than from other companies, and I suspect that governments may be as well,\u201d Walker Smith said.\n\nUnder Pennsylvania\u2019s voluntary autonomous guidelines, the Transportation Department has until Nov. 13 to approve or deny Uber\u2019s application, or to ask further questions.\n\nPennsylvania law at present doesn\u2019t allow testing of autonomous vehicles without human backup drivers. Google\u2019s Waymo already is carrying passengers in the Phoenix area without human drivers, and General Motors\u2019 Cruise Automation expects to do that next year.\n\nPittsburgh officials can\u2019t legally prevent testing, but they are in safety talks with Uber and four other entities that have permits to test autonomous vehicles, said Karina Ricks, the city\u2019s director of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure.\n\nFor instance, the city wants to limit self-driving vehicle speeds to 25 miles per hour in urban settings, even if the posted speed is higher.\n\n\u201cLower rates of speed give more time for the vehicle and the safety driver to react and prevent a crash,\u201d said Ricks, who characterized the talks as fruitful.\n\nPittsburgh is home to Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle development center, making it a logical choice for the resumption of robotic car tests.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging with the city, with the officials, and are very eager, I think, to ensure that we make a return to the road in self-driving mode in consultation and close partnership with them,\u201d said Miriam Chaum, head of public policy for Uber\u2019s self-driving vehicles.\n\nLater it will discuss bringing its self-driving cars back to Arizona, California and Toronto, Ontario, its other test sites.

(AP Photo/Melinda Deslatte, File)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Candidates vying to be Louisiana\u2019s secretary of state have talked about voting security, #MeToo issues and controversies over new voting machines. But the race to be the state\u2019s top elections official is defined more by difficulties raising the money to reach voters.\n\nMost contenders on Tuesday\u2019s ballot have limited dollars for outreach and advertising in a race attracting little interest from donors, despite being the only statewide seat up for grabs this year. Several major candidates have poured their own money into campaign efforts to try to stay viable. Many have focused on personal contact at local events and forums and smaller expenses like direct mail or digital advertising, rather than broad TV-based campaigns.\n\nThe seat is open because Republican Tom Schedler resigned in May in a sexual harassment scandal. Whoever wins will fill the final year of his term and run for re-election in 2019.\n\nWith nine contenders, the only thing that seems certain is no one will win the secretary of state\u2019s job in the primary. A December runoff between the top two vote-getters is expected to decide the winner. Polling shows large numbers of undecided voters.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nGOP candidates include Kyle Ardoin of Baton Rouge, Schedler\u2019s chief aide who is working as interim secretary of state; Turkey Creek Mayor Heather Cloud; former state Sen. A.G. Crowe of Pearl River; state Rep. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge; and state Rep. Julie Stokes of Kenner.\n\nThough he\u2019s only been in the top job for five months, Ardoin is running as an incumbent, saying he has the experience to keep the office on track during an important upcoming election year and won\u2019t require \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nCloud describes her success in a voter fraud lawsuit as giving her a unique perspective to focus on voting integrity. Crowe said he wants voter fraud to be a felony crime in Louisiana. He\u2019s also described his background in building a records management company, saying more needs to be done to bolster the secretary of state\u2019s work overseeing state archives.\n\nEdmonds and Stokes have focused more heavily on office controversies, with Edmonds saying the agency \u201chas a black eye\u201d and he\u2019d restore integrity to operations. He\u2019s criticized work to replace Louisiana\u2019s 10,000 voting machines.\n\nThe voting machine contract award was thrown out by the state\u2019s top procurement official, who said the work needs to be rebid because the secretary of state\u2019s office mishandled part of the bid process. Ardoin defends the selection work as fair and properly done.\n\nStokes said she will re-establish trust in the office and ensure every employee feels it\u2019s a safe place to work, a reference to allegations Schedler sexually harassed one of his workers. Stokes, a certified public accountant, said she\u2019d start the job with a full audit of operations and spending.\n\nArdoin and Stokes are the top fundraisers in the race.\n\nDEMOCRATS\n\nDemocratic candidates include Gwen Collins-Greenup, a lawyer and notary from Clinton, and Renee Fontenot Free of Baton Rouge, a top aide to two prior secretaries of state who most recently worked in the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nCollins-Greenup has raised only about $2,700 for her campaign, but she\u2019s been active participating in candidate forums and local events. She\u2019s said she wants to expand the office\u2019s business registration and development efforts and improve voter outreach.\n\nFree, endorsed by the Louisiana Democratic Party, has focused on her experience in the secretary of state\u2019s office, including running an election in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and helping to choose voting machines, without the type of controversy surrounding the current selection work.\n\nOTHER CANDIDATES\n\nTwo other contenders \u2014 Thomas Kennedy III, a Republican from Metairie, and Matt Moreau, a Zachary man with no party affiliation \u2014 have reported little to no fundraising and haven\u2019t attended the major campaign forums.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The desecration of a Brooklyn synagogue with anti-Semitic graffiti has prompted the cancellation of a political event with a star of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cBroad City.\u201d\n\nPolice say epithets such as \u201cKill All Jews\u201d were found in the halls and stairwells at Union Temple at around 8 p.m. Thursday.\n\nThe audience was sent home shortly after \u201cBroad City\u2019s\u201d Ilana Glazer was to start interviewing activists and politicians at the Prospect Heights synagogue\u2019s theater.\n\nThe vandalism happened days after a gunman killed 11 Jews in Pittsburgh.

(AP) \u2014 The rocks in the middle of the Wisconsin defense have had to deal with ripples around them on the field.\n\nInside linebackers T.J. Edwards and Ryan Connelly remain steady playmakers as injuries shuffle the rest of the lineup.\n\nNext up is a game without Olive Sagapolu, who has a right arm injury, when the Badgers host Rutgers on Saturday. The space-eating nose tackle regularly draws double teams that free up Edwards and Connelly to make plays.\n\n\u201cJust the main thing we can do is keep guys confident, encourage guys,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where coaches are putting those guys on the field for a reason, and they trust in them so we have to do the same.\u201d\n\nSagapolu\u2019s replacement will be freshman Bryson Williams, giving the Badgers (5-3, 3-2 Big Ten) an all-freshman starting front alongside ends Matt Henningsen and Kayden Lyles \u2014 two players who have also stepped into starting roles because of injuries.\n\nThe defensive line last year was stocked with experienced, athletic seniors. The changes up front are among the reasons why the Badgers\u2019 typically stout run defense ranks just 12th in the Big Ten this year (170.4 yards per game).\n\nThrough it all, Edwards and Connelly still make big plays.\n\nEdwards, the runner-up last year for the Butkus Award for the nation\u2019s best linebacker, has a team-high three sacks and is tied for the team lead with two interceptions. Connelly, a Butkus Award semifinalist this year, has a team-high 57 tackles, including a career-high 14 last week.\n\nThe good news for the banged-up Badgers is that they have a good chance to win again on Saturday, after a loss last week to Northwestern knocked them out of first in the West Division. Rutgers is the lowest-scoring team (15.1 points) among the 129 major college football schools.\n\nThe only winless school in Big Ten play, the Scarlet Knights (1-7, 0-5) are coming off a bye week. They can take some solace from a closer-than-expected, 18-15 loss at home two weeks ago to Northwestern.\n\nThe Wildcats then went out and defeated Wisconsin 31-17 last week at Ryan Field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said probably over and over and over, and nobody really wants to probably believe me, is I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far away,\u201d Rutgers coach Chris Ash said.\n\nQB CLEARED\n\nWisconsin quarterback Alex Hornibrook has been cleared to return from the concussion protocol after missing the loss to Northwestern. The drop-off from Hornibrook, a third-year starter, to sophomore Jack Coan, who was making his first collegiate start, was evident. The Badgers didn\u2019t have much of a medium-to-long passing game, and a botched handoff to Jonathan Taylor led to a turnover.\n\nGOOD FOOTING\n\nThe punting job is in good hands at Rutgers with sophomore Adam Korsak. He was added this week to the watch list for the Ray Guy Award, which goes to the nation\u2019s best college punter. Korsak, who has averaged 43.0 yards per attempt, boomed a school-record 79-yard punt two weeks against Northwestern.\n\nSCARLET RIGHT?\n\nGiving up 18 points to Northwestern represented progress for Rutgers, which allowed an average of 40.8 points over its first six losses. Ash, a former defensive coordinator at Ohio State, has taken a larger role in defensive planning over the last couple games.\n\n\u201cThe calls are the calls. I don\u2019t care who makes the calls,\u201d Ash said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the preparation. It\u2019s about the attitude and the energy we bring defensively.\u201d\n\nSECONDARY MATTERS\n\nThe Badgers will play again without safety Scott Nelson, though the other starting safety, D\u2019Cota Dixon, was listed as questionable. There have been growing pains all year in the defensive backfield, which also has freshmen Faion Hicks and Rachad Wildgoose starting at cornerback. Still, Wisconsin has allowed just one passing touchdown and made six interceptions over its last three games.\n\nFORWARD THINKING\n\nA Badgers team that was a chic pick to make the College Football Playoff at the beginning of the season now needs help just to win the West. Coach Paul Chryst just wants his players to keep focusing on small steps and winning the next game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all mature,\u201d offensive lineman Michael Deiter said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s going on, we\u2019ll bounce back.

Ellen Chaffee disagrees.\n\n\u201cScandal is in the eye of the beholder,\u201d said Chaffee, co-chairwoman of North Dakotans for Public Integrity, a bipartisan group sponsoring the initiative. \u201cThere are a lot of people who think $37,000 is a lot of money.\u201d\n\nChaffee was referring to Gov. Doug Burgum\u2019s repayment of costs after he attended this year\u2019s Super Bowl as a guest of a Minneapolis utility. The utility, Xcel Energy, offered perks including tickets to a rock concert, private parties, meals and other events.\n\nChaffee, a Democrat, and co-chairwoman Dina Butcher, a Republican, believe there have been other such incidents over the years that have gone unreported. They think there should be an independent ethics commission to review those cases. Opponents argue the proposal is poorly worded and there are enough safeguards in place to monitor government, including a new policy recently released by Burgum.\n\n\u201cMost of the things they are purporting to do with the measure are already in state law,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Shannon Roers-Jones, an attorney from West Fargo. She cited regulations on foreign contributions, personal use of campaign funds and reporting requirements for donations.\n\nBurgum\u2019s office unveiled its ethics policy in mid-October, which spokesman Mike Nowatzki said \u201cwas in the works at Gov. Burgum\u2019s request well before the Super Bowl\u201d and addresses similar situations \u201cgoing forward.\u201d The edict covers conflicts of interest, gifts, expenses and political activities involving the governor, lieutenant governor and all governor\u2019s office employees.\n\nChaffee said she welcomes the move but it \u201cdoes not meet state government\u2019s serious need for objective, professional ethics guidance and accountability across the board.\u201d Butcher said that while Burgum didn\u2019t do anything illegal he was likely \u201cfollowing previous examples\u201d and \u201cperhaps his predecessors enjoyed those types of things.\u201d\n\nOpponents are worried that the law would hurt people who don\u2019t hold office. Roers-Jones said the \u201coutrageously broad disclosure language\u201d would require invasive reporting from advertisers, subscribers, parishioners and donors.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union also opposes the measure, saying it is poorly written and risks restricting political speech and advocacy. The Greater North Dakota Chamber, the state\u2019s largest business organization, has worked against the measure. The Chamber said it is too broadly worded and would be difficult to comply with.\n\nThe measure would also restrict lobbying, including forcing public officials to wait two years after leaving office to become a lobbyist. Chaffee noted that when she tried to find out about spending by lobbyists, the reports were not available online and she had to pay $118 for hard copies that were sent through the mail.\n\n\u201cThe people deserve to know who is spending money to influence their votes and the behavior of their public officials,\u201d Chaffee said. \u201cThey have made it too difficult for citizens to access that.\u201d\n\nDennis Cooley, professor of ethics and philosophy at North Dakota State University, said people complaining about how the measure is written are being \u201ca little bit dishonest\u201d because they are not offering an alternative. The Legislature has rejected several attempts by Democratic lawmakers to establish an ethics commission, including in the last session.\n\n\u201cThere were huge opportunities to write this in a way that worked and it wasn\u2019t done,\u201d Cooley said.\n\nRoers said she could have gotten behind the measure if it just asked whether residents liked the idea of an ethics commission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a question of how it\u2019s done,\u201d she said. \u201cThis just takes that idea and jumps off a cliff with it.\u201d", "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 An Iowa attorney has filed documents in state court challenging the validity of Gov.

Scott Walker is suddenly pushing state officials to revoke professional licenses for four former priests defrocked for sexually abusing children after his campaign criticized Democratic challenger Tony Evers for not doing enough to protect students.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Friday that the priests served in the Milwaukee Archdiocese. After they were forced out, they earned state licenses to enter professions including social work, nursing, alcohol and drug counseling, and funeral home work.\n\nPeter Isley, a founder of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, is urging Walker to call for an investigation into the how the priests were able to secure state approval to work in those professions.\n\nAsked about the priests earlier this week, Walker said he knew nothing about them. On Thursday, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said regulators with the state Department of Safety and Professional Services have lodged complaints against them and the governor thinks they should lose their licenses.\n\n\u201cUltimately, that decision is left up to the boards that are legally charged with overseeing them,\u201d Evenson told the Journal Sentinel.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign has been ripping Evers, the state public schools superintendent, for not doing enough to keep students safe.\n\nThe campaign launched an ad in September criticizing Evers for not revoking the license of a Middleton teacher who was caught watching pornography in his classroom and making sexually suggestive comments to co-workers in 2008 and 2009.

These are just rankings,\u201d second-year Houston coach Major Applewhite said. \u201cThese are the entertainment dollars right now; these aren\u2019t real. This is what people want to get involved with, talk about, like and retweet, but it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nHigh-scoring Houston, which has won five in a row, is instead focused on trying to get another step closer to claiming a spot in the American Athletic Conference championship game.\n\nWith quarterback D\u2019Eriq King accounting for 39 touchdowns (28 passing, 11 rushing), the Cougars have scored more than 40 points in all eight games this season \u2014 a school record and the nation\u2019s longest active streak. They shot into the Top 25 after a 21-point win at previously undefeated USF last week.\n\nThis is the first time the Cougars have been in the Top 25 under Applewhite. They went to SMU two years ago when Tom Herman was still their coach, and a 38-16 loss dropped them all of the way out of the AP poll from 11th. They got ranked once more that season, only to lose again.\n\nSMU has lost 18 of its last 19 games against ranked teams. The Mustangs have lost all six since that win over Houston two years ago by an average margin of three touchdowns.\n\nSince an 0-3 start in coach Sonny Dykes\u2019 first season, the Mustangs have won three of five.

He won a U.S. House seat in 1994, when Republicans gained control of Congress halfway through Democrat Bill Clinton\u2019s first term as president. When Republican Sen.

They\u2019re out to avoid a repeat.\n\nNotre Dame looks to remain unbeaten and in line for a playoff berth when it visits Northwestern on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cWe just need to be focused on the right things on and off the field,\u201d receiver Miles Boykin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we learned from last year.\u201d\n\nThe Irish (8-0) are off to their best start since the 2012 team went undefeated all the way until a lopsided loss to Alabama in the BCS championship game. When the College Football Playoff rankings came out this week, they were No. 4.\n\nAs good as that all sounds, Notre Dame found itself in a similar spot a year ago. And things didn\u2019t go the way the Irish wanted after that.\n\nThey were No. 3 in the first two playoff rankings en route to an 8-1 start, only to go 2-2 the rest of the way \u2014 starting with a blowout loss to Miami. Now, they\u2019re one of four remaining unbeaten FBS teams along with No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Clemson and No. 9 Central Florida.\n\n\u201cI think we just deviated from our process, looking too far into the future,\u201d center Sam Mustipher said of 2017. \u201cI am sure last year at this time we were saying, \u2018We\u2019re focused on now, this is what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 But I remember last year when the first playoff rankings came out, we had the TVs and everyone was watching. We were sending out tweets and videos of what we came in at.\u201d\n\nBut this year?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that because we know the only ranking that matters is the last one,\u201d Mustipher said.\n\nNotre Dame has won its first eight games for the 10th time in the past 68 years. Three of those teams (1966, 1973 and 1988) won championships, and if they are going to stay in the running, they can\u2019t afford to stumble against Northwestern.\n\nThe Wildcats (5-3) have won four in a row since a three-game slide to grab the lead in the Big Ten West. They\u2019re stepping out of conference play at an unusual time to take on one of the top teams in the nation.\n\n\u201cWhat a great opportunity,\u201d coach Pat Fitzgerald said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing to lose so our guys are gonna, I think, prepare really well. And I think they\u2019re gonna be excited for the challenge.\u201d\n\nROLLING \u2019CATS\n\nNorthwestern is coming off a 31-17 victory over short-handed Wisconsin and leads the Badgers, Purdue and Iowa by 1 1/2 games in the Big Ten West. Though this week\u2019s matchup won\u2019t impact the division standings, a win would still be huge for the Wildcats. They haven\u2019t beaten a top-five opponent since the 1959 team opened with victories over No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 5 Iowa. Northwestern\u2019s coach back then? Ara Parseghian, who went on to lead Notre Dame to two national championships.\n\nBOOK IT\n\nNotre Dame quarterback Ian Book has been on quite a roll since he replaced Brandon Wimbush. He\u2019s 5-0 as the starter and leads all FBS quarterbacks with a 76.5 completion percentage in his six games. Book was particularly good in last week\u2019s 44-22 rout of Navy in San Diego, completing 27 of 33 passes for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nIMPRESSIVE RUN\n\nFreshman Isaiah Bowser appears to be settling in as the Wildcats\u2019 No. 1 running back with back-to-back 100-yard games. He has run for 225 yards and his first three touchdowns the past two weeks after getting just two yards on two attempts in his first three games. He followed up a breakout outing against Rutgers with 117 yards and a TD against Wisconsin. The Wildcats struggled running the ball for a few weeks after Jeremy Larkin was forced to stop playing football because of a spinal issue. He ran for 346 and five touchdowns in three games before retiring.\n\nCATCHING ON\n\nBoykin seems to have benefited from the quarterback change at Notre Dame. The 6-foot-4 senior has 28 catches for 409 yards and six touchdowns with Book starting the past five games. He figures to be challenged by cornerback Montre Hartage, who has just one interception but 12 pass breakups.\n\nSERIES SPEAKING\n\nThough they have a 37-9-2 edge in a series that dates to 1889, the Irish have dropped the past two games to the Wildcats, both at home. Northwestern beat Notre Dame 43-40 on Nov. 11, 2014, and 17-15 on Sept. 2, 1995, when Fitzgerald was a star linebacker for the Wildcats. This is the first trip to Evanston for the Irish since a 48-0 romp on Sept. 25, 1976. And they\u2019re the first top-three team to visit Ryan Field since No. 1 Ohio State in 2006.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this Oct. 25, 2018 file photo, Maryland Gov.

(AP) \u2014 Maryland\u2019s popular Republican governor is earning enough support from Democrats and black voters in the state\u2019s largest jurisdictions to narrow the pathway to an upset sought by a challenger who led the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization.\n\nDemocratic challenger Ben Jealous, a former national president of the NAACP, needs big support from Democratic strongholds in the suburbs of the nation\u2019s capital and Baltimore to become Maryland\u2019s first black governor.\n\nBut Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is getting votes from black voters as well as white Democrats crossing party lines and splitting their tickets, according to pre-election polling and interviews with voters. A win for Hogan would make him the first Republican governor re-elected in Maryland since 1954 \u2014 and only the second in the state\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to vote for Ben Jealous, because I am a Democrat, but he just didn\u2019t show me that he had enough experience,\u201d said Karen Johnson, a 48-year-old federal government employee who is black, adding that she decided to \u201cstay with what is working,\u201d after she voted early in Prince George\u2019s County, one of the nation\u2019s most affluent black-majority counties.\n\nKaren Johnson\n\nAs Democrats hope for a \u201cblue wave\u201d nationwide, early voting turnout has been higher so far in Maryland \u2014 where Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 \u2014 than it was in the 2014 gubernatorial race. The Jealous campaign believes higher turnout will add up to victory in a state where President Donald Trump is unpopular, even if Hogan has the advantages of incumbency and a fundraising edge.\n\nKevin Harris, a senior adviser to the Jealous campaign, said Friday that voters are still learning about Jealous, and he\u2019s confident Democrats will support him on Election Day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of voters who still don\u2019t know Ben and are making up their minds about him,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not unusual to find early voters who say they made an exception for Hogan on an otherwise straight Democratic ballot.\n\nMileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes field Politics Center at Goucher College, said a \u201cblue wave\u201d may have trouble materializing in Maryland, where Democrats already control the state\u2019s U.S. House seats 7-1. Hogan has also put a lot of distance between himself and Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not a lot of places for the blue wave to go in Maryland,\u201d Kromer said.\n\nIn Baltimore, which is about 64 percent black and heavily Democratic, Ursula Guthrie said she didn\u2019t feel like she knew Jealous, despite his leadership of the Baltimore-based NAACP from 2008 to 2013.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know who Jealous is as a person in the same way that I know who Hogan is,\u201d said Guthrie, an early voter who was supporting a Republican for the first time.\n\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released last month found Hogan\u2019s support from black voters has more than doubled since his 2014 campaign, from 14 percent to 33 percent, while Jealous received support of 57 percent of black voters. A Washington Post poll last month found Hogan with an overall double-digit lead over Jealous.\n\nMuch of Maryland\u2019s rural areas are Republican. That makes success for Democrats in statewide races largely dependent on support in the state\u2019s heavily populated and Democratic areas, including Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery counties.\n\nIn Montgomery County, the state\u2019s most populous jurisdiction with more than 1 million residents, several Democratic voters interviewed recently said they were picking Hogan. Jean Harris, who was one of them, said she didn\u2019t know much about Jealous.\n\n\u201cWhen you find someone who is doing and fulfilling the needs of the people \u2014 because that is what the job is about \u2014 you have a tendency to stay with that, rather than to venture off into someone new that you don\u2019t have much status and information about,\u201d said Harris, who\u2019s 80.\n\nSome voters said they picked Hogan due to his character and personality, rather than particular issues. They cite his experience battling cancer and efforts at bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job. He\u2019s an honest man, and I feel comfortable with him,\u201d said Susan Hanenbaum, a 76-year-old Democrat in Potomac who voted for Hogan. \u201cI think he\u2019s a fair person, and I think all the issues will be dealt with appropriately.\u201d\n\nGregory Miller\n\nJealous, in his first run at elected office, has a platform of progressive issues including universal prekindergarten and a higher minimum wage. He has been endorsed by leading liberals on the national stage, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who rallied with him recently.\n\nHe also has been far behind Hogan in fundraising, hurting his ability to advertise.\n\nStill, the Jealous platform resonated with Gregory Miller, a 69-year-old Bethesda resident. He cited Jealous\u2019 emphasis on education and proposal for Medicare for all.\n\n\u201cI like the governor now, but I just think some things need to be changed \u2014 that he could help the whole state better,\u201d Miller said.\n\n___\n\nThis article has been corrected to show that the Washington Post-University of Maryland poll was released in October, not November.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David McFadden contributed to this report in Baltimore.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) \u2014 A Goodwill worker collecting clothes and other items at a Texas sorting center was surprised to find an albino python clinging to the side of a bin.\n\nThe python was huddled in a pile of clothes when the worker discovered it Thursday at the center in Fort Worth.\n\nManager James Murphy says it\u2019s not clear if the snake slithered away from its owner and was accidentally dropped off or if its donation was intentional.\n\nThe python had a serpentine journey: It arrived at one of nearly 40 Goodwill donation drop-offs in the area before being transported to the Fort Worth sorting center.\n\nGoodwill staffers will care for the python until the owner claims it or a permanent home is found.", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Time is running out for Massachusetts voters who want to cast an early ballot.\n\nThe early voting period for the Nov. 6 election is ending on Friday.

Sheldon Whitehouse is touting his record in the Senate in the hopes of earning a third term while Republican challenger Bob Flanders says he could get more done for the state.\n\nRhode Island voters will choose between Whitehouse and Flanders on Tuesday. Whitehouse, a Democrat, has successfully pushed for legislation and funding to address the nationwide opioid epidemic. He\u2019s one of the leading voices in the Senate to do more to address climate change and President Donald Trump signed a bill he helped write to address marine debris in October, praising the bipartisan effort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proven fighter with the ability also to make bipartisan progress,\u201d Whitehouse said in a recent interview. \u201cI think to be effective in the Senate, you\u2019ve got to be able to stand and fight and fight hard, but also realize when there\u2019s a bipartisan opportunity and take it.\u201d\n\nFlanders, a former state Supreme Court justice, says he could be more effective in Washington as a Republican and as a problem-solver. He\u2019s critical of Whitehouse\u2019s focus on climate change.\n\nFlanders has been telling voters, \u201cWe need a climate change in Washington.\u201d\n\nA September poll showed Whitehouse with a double-digit lead. Whitehouse has raised $6.5 million in this election cycle and spent $5.3 million, according to federal filings. Flanders raised about $1.1 million and spent most of it, records show.\n\nIf re-elected, Whitehouse said his top priorities would be protecting people\u2019s health care, getting rid of anonymous \u201cdark money\u201d spending in political campaigns, pushing to get a bill passed to charge a fee for carbon pollution, continuing to tackle the opioid crisis and undoing features of the Republican tax bill that worsen income inequality.\n\nHe said he\u2019s proud of the legislation he wrote creating a fund to help coastal communities address the challenges they face as the consequences of climate change. In response to his opponent\u2019s criticism, he suggested Flanders look at the maps of what Rhode Island will look like if climate change isn\u2019t addressed soon.\n\n\u201cI try to keep a really strong focus on the Rhode Island economy and jobs in all of this,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change, for instance, is not just a big deal in some global sense, but it\u2019s also really affecting the fishing communities.\u201d\n\nWhitehouse, of Newport, says Flanders would align with Republicans in support of policies that aren\u2019t good for Rhode Island.\n\nFlanders, of East Greenwich, says he\u2019s running because he is frustrated with career politicians in Washington who don\u2019t work together to solve the nation\u2019s problems. The only elected office Flanders held was as a town councilman.\n\nFlanders said he\u2019s a problem-solver. He points to how he helped Central Falls, Rhode Island after it declared bankruptcy as the state-appointed receiver.\n\n\u201cWe really do need a climate change in the sense that we\u2019ve got to get away from the hyper-partisanship that prevails in Washington today that\u2019s not helping the country,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cUntil we elect people that have a different mindset about working with each other, we\u2019re not going to change.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Flanders said he\u2019d champion a bipartisan plan to make health care more affordable and lower prescription drugs costs. Flanders said that would involve preserving some parts of the Affordable Care Act, such as allowing parents to keep children on their health insurance policy until they turn 26 years old. He said he\u2019d also focus on investing in infrastructure and on immigration reform, with better vetting and better border security.\n\nFlanders said he has always been an independent-minded Republican and that he would say when he disagrees with President Donald Trump. He agrees with Trump on reducing taxes but strongly disagrees with the family separation policy.\n\nWhitehouse is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Flanders has said Whitehouse\u2019s questions were disrespectful during the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

We\u2019ve just got to move on and try to win the rest of these games.\u201d\n\nMissouri would like to get its first league win.\n\nThe Tigers lost a heartbreaker at home last week to Kentucky, rallying from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter before losing on a touchdown pass on the final play \u2014 an untimed down that followed a questionable pass-interference penalty.\n\n\u201cOur kids have responded great,\u201d coach Barry Odom said.\n\nBoth teams hope to get more from their quarterbacks.\n\nDrew Lock picked apart Florida\u2019s secondary in 2017, throwing for three touchdowns, but the projected first-round draft pick hasn\u2019t fared nearly as well against SEC defenses this season. Lock has completed 50 percent of his passes for 732 yards, with one touchdown and five interceptions, in losses to Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Kentucky.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Feleipe Franks has been more efficient, although he has six turnovers in the last four games.\n\nFranks has thrown an interception in four straight games and lost fumbles in the last two.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one or two plays I\u2019d like to have back, especially like the turnovers, just silly mistakes like that that they\u2019re not like me,\u201d Franks said. \u201cThat\u2019s just something I need to fix.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know about when Missouri plays at Florida on Saturday:\n\nKEY MATCHUP\n\nThe Tigers looked like one of the best defenses in the league last week, especially against the run. Led by three experienced linebackers, including sophomore captain Cale Garrett, they held Kentucky to 91 yards on the ground and 2.6 yards a carry. Florida is at its best when it\u2019s able to run the ball with Jordan Scarlett and Lamical Perine. The Gators scored a combined 46 points in the three games (Kentucky, Mississippi State, Georgia) in which they failed to gain 200 yards on the ground.\n\nSEEKING SACKS\n\nFlorida has just two sacks in its last two games, a concern for a team that notched six against Mississippi State and five against LSU. Getting to Lock is part of the game plan, but Mizzou ranks second in the SEC and 19th nationally in sacks allowed (1.25/game). The Tigers have five returning offensive line starters who could pose problems for Florida pass-rushers Jachai Polite and Jabari Zuniga. Polite and Zuniga have combined for 17 \u00bd tackles for loss, including 11 \u00bd sacks this season.\n\nNOVEMBER HOMESTAND\n\nThe Gators are playing the first in a three-game homestand in November. It\u2019s a stretch that will determine which bowl they land and how many \u201cstadiums\u201d they have to run in the offseason . First-year coach Dan Mullen makes his team run the Florida Field steps for each home loss. The Gators already have one ahead and don\u2019t want another.\n\nHOMECOMING GAME\n\nIt\u2019s Florida\u2019s homecoming. The Gators are 25-4 in homecoming games since 1989, including a 40-14 victory against Missouri in 2016.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "PARIS (AP) \u2014 Paris Saint-Germain says midfielder Marco Verratti was stopped by police this week for driving over the alcohol limit.\n\nPSG says Verratti was \u201csubjected to a roadside check in his car, which showed a blood alcohol level higher than the limit allowed for drivers on probation\u201d after recently obtaining their driver\u2019s license.\n\nPSG says the Italy international \u201cmade a spontaneous apology to the coach and the management of Paris Saint-Germain\u201d and will be \u201cdeprived of a portion of his monthly ethics bonus.\u201d\n\nThe incident, which happened late Tuesday or early Wednesday, comes with PSG facing a crucial match at Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "WAHPETON, S.D.

The president has traveled to North Carolina twice to stump for Baptist minister Harris in the 9th District and 13th District Rep. Budd, most recently last week in Charlotte. (AP Photo/Chuck Burton, File)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The GOP nominee for a historically Republican congressional seat in North Carolina finds himself in an unusual situation: behind in money and overmatched on the airwaves.\n\nBut Southern Baptist minister Mark Harris , one of three Republicans fighting to retain North Carolina congressional districts amid a surge in Democratic energy and fundraising, is banking on the force that is Donald Trump to help him extend the party\u2019s 55-year streak in the 9th District.\n\nThe president has traveled to North Carolina, which he won in 2016, twice since August to stump for Harris and 13th District first-term Rep. Ted Budd . Both are locked in tight races against Democrats outraising them and portraying themselves as moderates who won\u2019t succumb to partisan strife on Capitol Hill.\n\nHarris and Budd \u201cwill be incredible fighters and have been. They\u2019ve been fighting all their life for great things, and they\u2019re fighting for your interests,\u201d Trump said while appearing with the two men at a Charlotte rally last week. He called Harris rival Dan McCready an \u201cextreme liberal\u201d and Budd challenger Kathy Manning \u201ca lefty.\u201d\n\nAlong with the Raleigh-area 2nd District, the seats are among the scores of competitive House districts nationwide that will decide whether Democrats retake the chamber. Winning at least one of these North Carolina seats would signal a good night for the national party. Seven other Republican congressional seats in the state, along with three held by Democrats, aren\u2019t considered very competitive.\n\nNorth Carolina is considered a swing state in presidential campaigns, but Republicans have dominated state politics due partly to redistricting. Federal courts have twice ruled GOP mapmakers illegally manipulated the lines in 2016 through political data to ensure Republicans retained a 10-3 margin in the congressional delegation. Republicans disagree, and the map remains in place while the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether to hear the case.\n\nWhether or not lines are ruled unlawful, the three districts were expected to be more competitive during midterms, when the party out of the White House historically makes gains, Duke University political science professor David Rohde said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised Republicans are in a difficult position,\u201d Rohde said. Gerrymanders aren\u2019t designed to create a lot of safe seats for the prevailing party, he added, but rather many districts with marginal advantages.\n\nIn the 2nd District, three-term Rep. George Holding is outraising his Democratic challenger. But outside groups aligned with rival Linda Coleman are running ads questioning Holding\u2019s health care votes and acceptance of special-interest campaign money.\n\nThe most favorable-looking seat for Democrats is the 9th, represented by Republicans since 1963. Conservative and affluent Charlotte-area precincts have helped the GOP retain the seat since an era when the state\u2019s congressional delegation was mostly Democratic. Still anchored by Charlotte, the district now extends to rural counties near South Carolina and toward Fort Bragg. Trump won the district in its current configuration by 12 percentage points in 2016.\n\nDemocrats found an apt candidate for the socially-conservative district in McCready, an Iraq War veteran who featured his baptism in the waters of the Euphrates River in a commercial. He declares he won\u2019t back Nancy Pelosi for House speaker.\n\nMcCready recalled his Marine platoon in explaining his political views. \u201cWe never cared about where you came from, who your parents were, the color of your skin or your political party,\u201d he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together. We\u2019re all Americans first. That\u2019s what I think they\u2019re missing up in Washington.\u201d\n\nMcCready\u2019s campaign got a boost when Harris upset Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger in the primary. Harris then had to start fundraising from scratch, while McCready has raised $4.9 million through mid-October, according to campaign finance reports. Harris has raised over $1.8 million.

Fitzpatrick will start for the Buccaneers on Sunday against the Carolina Panthers after Jameis Winston was benched. (AP Photo/Gary Landers, File)\n\nA look at some key fantasy football questions going into Week 9:\n\nWHICH UNDER THE RADAR PLAYERS HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR A BIG GAME THIS WEEK?\n\nYou\u2019ve got options at quarterback. Ryan Fitzpatrick starts for Tampa Bay against the Panthers, who have given up two TDs to QBs in six straight games. Fitzpatrick threw 11 TDs in his first three starts of the season and another two last week when he replaced Jameis Winston. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco threw for 363 yards and two TDs earlier this year against the Steelers and gets them again this week. Pittsburgh has improved but has allowed the fifth most fantasy points per game to quarterbacks.\n\nAt running back, Houston\u2019s Lamar Miller has improved with 233 yards rushing and two TDs the past two weeks. He faces the Broncos on Sunday, who have allowed the second second most rushing yards and third most rushing TDs to RBs.\n\nDanny Amendola has averaged eight targets and scored at least 10 points in point-per-reception leagues in each of the three games started by Miami quarterback Brock Osweiler. The Dolphins face the Jets this week, who have given up the sixth most fantasy points per game to wideouts and five touchdowns to slot receivers.\n\nJets tight end Chris Herndon has seven catches the past three weeks \u2014 but three touchdowns.\n\nWHICH PLAYERS HAVE UPSIDE BASED ON THE REST OF THE SEASON?\n\nCleveland\u2019s Nick Chubb has a great schedule ahead if new offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchen takes advantage of Chubb\u2019s skills. Four of seven games left are against teams that are top five in fantasy points allowed to running backs, making him a ripe trade target.\n\nDak Prescott got a big upgrade at WR when the Cowboys traded for Amari Cooper. He also has a QB friendly schedule for a good part of the rest of the fantasy football season. Prescott faces the Falcons (second in FPPG to QBs) in Week 11 and the Saints (third in FPPG to QBs) in Week 13. Then in the fantasy playoffs he gets the Colts and Buccaneers. Prescott is a good trade acquisition in two-quarterback leagues and potential streamer in one-QB formats.\n\nWHO HAS THE MOST LONG-TERM UPSIDE AFTER THE FLURRY OF NFL TRADES?\n\nThe Broncos trading away Demaryius Thomas opens up all kinds of opportunities for rookie WR Courtland Sutton. He already led the Broncos in end zone targets, and Sutton will see an overall uptick in targets going forward. He has a favorable matchup Sunday against a Texans pass defense that has been depleted by injuries. He won\u2019t come cheap, but his long-term potential upside makes him a player to target in trades in keeper or dynasty leagues.\n\nHOW ABOUT THOMAS?\n\nDeAndre Hopkins is unquestionably the No. 1 receiver for the Texans. But Will Fuller, whom Thomas is replacing, was averaging a little over six targets per game. Look for Thomas to be targeted similarly with an improved chance of scoring.\n\nHOW DOES GOLDEN TATE FARE AFTER BEING TRADED TO PHILADELPHIA?\n\nTight End Zach Ertz is QB Carson Wentz\u2019s favorite target. Look for Tate\u2019s per-game target average to take a slight hit. He\u2019ll still play most of his snaps from the slot, which means he\u2019ll continue to be a busy receiver. Tate already had a bye with the Lions and gets another this week because of the trade.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 9 lineup advice and tips, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "Chatham University students hug during a visit Thursday, Nov. 1, 2018, to a makeshift memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue dedicated to the 11 people killed Oct. 27 while worshipping, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

(AP) \u2014 A recent Environmental Protection Agency ruling clears the path for Arkansas farmers to use the herbicide dicamba on soybeans and cotton, ending a state-wide ban on the weed killer\u2019s use.\n\nThe federal agency on Wednesday announced the decision to allow the spraying of the herbicide for the next two years, despite concerns from some farmers and scientists who say it can drift and damage other crops and vegetation, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.\n\nArkansas banned in-crop use of dicamba this year after the state\u2019s Plant Board received nearly 1,000 complaints of crop damage last year. The ban began in April and ran through October.\n\nThe ban sharply divided farmers and prompted a lawsuit from herbicide maker Monsanto.\n\nArkansas farmers who want to use dicamba have said the herbicide is essential to curb the spread of pigweed, which has become resistant to other herbicides. But critics argue that the weed killer destroys vegetation and ecosystems.\n\nArkansas was the only state to implement a dicamba ban, but many states have set restrictions on its use.\n\nThe EPA also added new restrictions on Wednesday, including that only \u201ccertified applicators\u201d can spray dicamba over the top of crops. The agency also ruled that in-crop use of dicamba must cease 45 days after planting for soybeans and 60 days after planting for cotton.\n\nSome critics have said that the EPA\u2019s new rules fail to address the herbicide\u2019s \u201cvolatility\u201d and ability to damage susceptible crops.\n\nNathan Donley, a scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the EPA\u2019s \u201creckless re-approval of this dangerous poison ignores damage to crops, natural areas and backyard gardens of millions of acres.\u201d\n\nThe Arkansas Plant Board can now accept the EPA\u2019s regulations or pass other restrictions.

The casino is seeking an internet gambling license in Pennsylvania, part of a growing crossover between casinos in the neighboring states to compete in each other's online and sports betting markets. (AP Photo/Wayne Parry)\n\nATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) \u2014 For decades after it began offering legal gambling in 1978, Atlantic City had the East Coast market pretty much to itself. And its failure to realize that situation would one day end nearly put it out of business once competition showed up.\n\nNow, two of the fastest-growing areas of New Jersey\u2019s gambling market \u2014 internet gambling and sports betting \u2014 will soon get some competition next door from Pennsylvania.\n\nBut this time, at least some Atlantic City casinos and their parent companies are hedging their bets by competing in both states.\n\nMGM, which owns Atlantic City\u2019s Borgata, and the Golden Nugget are among companies seeking internet gambling licenses in Pennsylvania once it begins there sometime next year. They were the applicants for Pennsylvania\u2019s remaining online licenses this week, seeking five of the 11 still available there.\n\nA Pennsylvania casino, SugarHouse, already competes online in New Jersey through a licensing affiliation with the Golden Nugget.\n\nAnd Pennsylvania gambling regulators recently gave a sports betting license to Harrah\u2019s Philadelphia, owned by Caesars Entertainment, which operates three Atlantic City casinos as well.\n\nDavid Schwartz, director of the University of Las Vegas Nevada\u2019s Center for Gaming Research, said gambling companies are smart to operate on both sides of the border.\n\n\u201cRegional diversification is a sound strategy, particularly in the online arena,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this market, convenience is a major factor, so the ability to gamble at home rather than traveling across state lines is a major factor. In that case, licensure in multiple jurisdictions makes a great deal of sense.\u201d\n\nThat is particularly true for internet and sports betting, which in New Jersey are restricted to those physically present within the state. The same restrictions will apply to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Golden Nugget says it wants to compete in Pennsylvania despite its 54 percent tax rate on internet slots and 16 percent for table games. Thom Winter, senior vice president and general manager of online gambling for the Golden Nugget called the Keystone State \u201ca natural next step for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take a long-term approach to online gaming and believe that we can replicate our New Jersey success in other jurisdictions,\u201d he said.\n\nInternet gambling and sports betting are the two bright spots in what until fairly recently had been a dismal Atlantic City gambling market. Due in large part to competition from Pennsylvania casinos, five Atlantic City casinos shut down between 2014 and 2016; two have since reopened as the Hard Rock and the Ocean Resort.\n\nOnline gambling, which began in New Jersey in Nov. 2013, and sports betting, which started in June of this year, have provided new revenue streams to help the casinos recover from their previous struggles.\n\nOver the first nine months of this year, internet gambling has brought in nearly $216 million, an increase of 17.6 percent over the same period last year. And each month, online gambling increases at a double-digit pace from a year earlier.\n\nSports betting is also taking off in New Jersey; since it began in mid-June, over $336 million worth of bets has been placed. Pennsylvania is taking notice; the state has approved sports betting licenses for five casinos thus far: Parx, Harrah\u2019s, SugarHouse, Rivers and Hollywood. Parx also received approval for sports betting at the Philadelphia Turf Club, their off-track betting facility.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s first sports bets could be taken within the next few weeks.\n\n___\n\nFollow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC", "Los Alamos lab is under new management\n\nSANTA FE, N.M.

No. 11 Kentucky not so much.\n\nBut the Wildcats must deal with the sudden spotlight of playing the program\u2019s most important game in a generation.\n\nThe Southeastern Conference\u2019s Eastern Division title is on the line in Saturday\u2019s Top 25 nationally televised matchup between Georgia (7-1, 5-1 SEC, No. 6 CFP) and Kentucky (7-1, 5-1, No. 9 CFP). It\u2019s the schools\u2019 first meeting since 2007 with both teams ranked.\n\nIn Lexington, discussion of Kentucky\u2019s most significant football game since the 1970s has almost overshadowed buzz about the second-ranked Wildcats men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s upcoming opener Tuesday against hated rival Duke. Kentucky football coach Mark Stoops likes being part of the conversation but said earlier this week he wouldn\u2019t discuss the potential impact with players.\n\n\u201cI probably need to calm them down,\u201d the coach joked.\n\nNot that Stoops needed to remind his players of what\u2019s on the line.\n\n\u201cWe know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d junior linebacker Kash Daniel said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s riding on this game, and obviously it is a motivating factor. With big games like this it\u2019s important to go into it thinking it\u2019s just a normal game, because if you try to overdo it, mistakes happen.\u201d\n\nBut he added, \u201cthis is obviously the biggest game I\u2019ve ever played in.\u201d\n\nOff to their best start since 1977, the Wildcats are riding the momentum of an improbable 15-14 win at Missouri that has put them on the brink of their first division title. They held the Tigers without a first down in the second half and enter with the nation\u2019s top scoring defense (13.0 points per game) along with the SEC\u2019s No. 2 unit overall (295.3 yards).\n\nKentucky faces a Georgia squad that seeks to go unbeaten against the division for the second straight season. The Bulldogs are also riding an emotional wave after beating rival Florida 36-17 last week in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThey want a return to the conference championship game to maintain their national title hopes, but doing so means beating Kentucky for the ninth straight time. Georgia coach Kirby Smart warns that could be more difficult this fall.\n\nThough his \u2019Dawgs appear to have the same old offensive bite with quarterback Jake Fromm (16 touchdowns) and a formidable running back tandem in D\u2019Andre Swift and Elijah Holyfield, Smart is reminding players they\u2019re facing a completely different Wildcats team.\n\nMessage received.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a four-quarter game because that is the kind of team they are,\u201d Bulldogs junior tight end Isaac Nauta said of Kentucky. \u201cThey are a great team that is going to keep fighting. You know, they have a chance to go to Atlanta as well. They are going to be pumped up and ready to go.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch as Georgia and Kentucky settle the SEC East:\n\nBALANCE AND POINTS\n\nQuarterback Terry Wilson\u2019s season-high 267-yard passing performance and game-winning TD at Missouri finally showed the Wildcats can throw the ball. Now it\u2019s a matter of carrying it over and mixing with SEC rushing leader Benny Snell Jr. (935 yards) to achieve the needed balance against a Georgia defense ranked just behind Kentucky at (306.1 yards). Kentucky will definitely need to score more than the 14 points it has averaged the past three games.\n\nPINPOINT PASSER\n\nFromm has completed 67.4 percent of his passes for 1,649 yards and 16 touchdowns, including 240 yards and three TDs last week against the Gators. The sophomore\u2019s completion rate has put him within reach of breaking Hutson Mason\u2019s school season mark of 67.9 set four years ago.\n\nFIERCE LINEBACKERS\n\nWildcats senior linebacker Josh Allen has been all over the field this season and thrived in the pass rush with a SEC-best 10.5 and 14.5 tackles for loss. He\u2019s had help from Daniel (54 stops) and Jordan Jones (46), but the corps will face their toughest task in slowing Fromm along with Holyfield and D\u2019Andre Swift, who have combined for more than 1,000 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. Daniel and Jones will play somewhat one-handed with each nursing injuries.\n\nALMOST AUTOMATIC\n\nGeorgia kicker Rodrigo Blankenship has converted all 36 extra-point attempts and made 13 of 15 field goals for 75 points. He\u2019s 1 of 2 from 30-39 yards and 6 of 7 from 40-49 and has made his lone chance from 50-plus yards.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "GURNEE, Ill.

Grant Delpit and the LSU defensive backs welcome the challenge on Saturday. (AP Photo/Butch Dill, File)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 As quarterback sensation Tua Tagovailoa tries to envision what awaits him and top-ranked Alabama at LSU\u2019s Tiger Stadium, he could use recent history as a guide.\n\nEven during this decade of dominance, the Crimson Tide hasn\u2019t so much thrived as survived at deafening Death Valley, where a crowd exceeding 102,000 is expected for the historical rivals\u2019 83rd meeting on Saturday night.\n\nT.J. Yeldon\u2019s last-minute touchdown on a screen lifted Alabama to a dramatic, comeback win in 2012. LSU appeared to have the 2014 game in Tiger Stadium locked up, but a personal foul pushed the Tigers back as they neared a game-sealing score. They wound up missing a field goal, and Alabama responded with a tying kick to set up its overtime triumph . In 2016, it took a 21-yard scramble by Jalen Hurts to break a scoreless tie in the fourth quarter.\n\nOdds makers apparently expect the Tide to have it easier this time, listing Alabama (8-0, 5-0 SEC, No. CFP) as a two-touchdown favorite at No. 4 LSU (7-1, 4-1 SEC, No. 3 CFP).\n\nTagovailoa has been that good , passing for 2,066 yards and 25 touchdowns without an interception despite taking fewer than 60 percent of Alabama\u2019s offensive snaps.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s quick with the ball. He\u2019s quick with the release. He\u2019s smart,\u201d LSU coach Ed Orgeron said. \u201cHe can throw the ball deep. He can run the football. This is a very dangerous football player. I believe he\u2019s the best player in the country.\u201d\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow, a graduate transfer from Ohio State, hasn\u2019t been nearly as prolific, but he has largely produced as needed while drawing praise for his poise, toughness, decision-making and leadership. Although Burrow\u2019s passing stats \u2014 1,544 yards and six TDs \u2014 rank near the bottom of the SEC, he has demonstrated he can fire or finesse throws into tight windows, throw deep and run.\n\n\u201cJoe has played very, very well,\u201d Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \u201cPeople try to stop the run, and they make a lot of explosive plays on people \u2014 probably have as good a balance as anybody we\u2019ve played this year.\u201d\n\nAlabama has won every game by 22 or more points. Sometimes much more \u2014 with Tagovailoa resting on the sidelines during anticlimactic fourth quarters.\n\nIf there is any knock on Alabama, it\u2019s that the Tide hasn\u2019t been tested. No. 22 Texas A&M is the only currently ranked team Alabama has beaten. Three weeks ago, Georgia entered Death Valley unbeaten and ranked second \u2014 and lost by 20 .\n\n\u201cYou come into Tiger Stadium, it\u2019s loud, you\u2019re going to be under some stress,\u201d said Orgeron, who\u2019d be a hero in his native state if he presides over the end of Alabama\u2019s seven-game winning streak in the series. \u201cPlay our defense, you\u2019re going to be under some stress.\u201d\n\nSaban said his players \u201crealize the challenge that they have against a very good LSU team, who had some very impressive wins this year.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how they respond playing a very good team on the road.\u201d\n\nSome other things to now about the Top 25 Alabama-LSU showdown:\n\nWHITE\u2019S PLIGHT\n\nSaban said LSU\u2019s Devin White is \u201cas good a linebacker as there is anywhere.\u201d\n\nBut during the first half, LSU must endure the absence of their Butkus Award candidate, who was flagged for targeting in the fourth quarter of the Tigers\u2019 last game when he leveled Mississippi State quarterback Nick Fitzgerald. Some analysts questioned the call and LSU protested the partial-game suspension , but to no avail. White ranks third in the SEC in tackles with 76, including seven tackles for loss, a sack and a forced fumble. He also has six quarterback hurries and two fumble recoveries.\n\n\u201cThat is a big loss for them,\u201d Tagovailoa said.\n\nHURTS & SMITH\n\nThe status of Alabama backup quarterback Jalen Hurts, who\u2019s played in every game, is uncertain for the game with a high ankle sprain sustained against Tennessee. Receiver DeVonta Smith missed the Tennessee game with a hamstring injury but has been practicing this week.\n\nSENSATIONAL SECONDARY\n\nLSU leads the nation with 14 interceptions. The Tigers\u2019 secondary \u2014 starring Thorpe Award candidates Grant Delpit at safety and Andraez \u201cGreedy\u201d Williams at cornerback \u2014 sounds eager to see how it stacks up against Tagovailoa and Co.\n\n\u201cI think we match up to them,\u201d said Delpit, who has five interceptions and four sacks. \u201cWe\u2019re playing very well this year and we can affect the quarterback.\u201d\n\nHEADING HOME\n\nAlabama has six starters and a handful of backups from Louisiana, and linebacker Mack Wilson thinks he knows which one is most fired up. Fellow linebacker Dylan Moses, a Baton Rouge native.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready to smash somebody,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nThe six include defensive end Isaiah Buggs, defensive back Shyheim Carter, tight end Irv Smith Jr., DeVonta Smith and placekicker Joseph Bulovas.

But I want to be ranked there at the end of the year.\u201d\n\nUtah State faces a Rainbow Warriors team that started out torrid, but has fallen on tough times with three straight losses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough to win over there, because there are a ton of distractions,\u201d Wells said of the long trek to Honolulu. \u201cThis is a team in Hawaii that, man, what a really good quarterback.\u201d\n\nThat would be in reference to Cole McDonald, who\u2019s thrown 30 TD passes this season. The sophomore with the dreadlocks has been a big reason why Hawaii has been a surprise after being picked to finish second-to-last in the West Division. If the Rainbow Warriors win Saturday, they secure a winning regular-season mark for the first time since 2010.\n\n\u201cWe have to work really hard in order to get what we want accomplished,\u201d Hawaii offensive lineman J.R. Hensley said. \u201cTake the task at hand and get going this week.\u201d\n\nThe Aggies are led by quarterback Jordan Love, who earned the league\u2019s player of the week honors after throwing for a career-best 448 yards and four TDs against New Mexico.\n\n\u201cHe could be the best quarterback in the conference. He\u2019s really smooth,\u201d Hawaii coach Nick Rolovich said. \u201cI\u2019m really impressed with the kid.\u201d\n\nThings to know in a series that Utah State leads 9-6:\n\nEIGHT IS ENOUGH: The Aggies are tied with Temple for the most non-offensive touchdowns this season with eight. They have four on special teams and four more by the defense. Last week against New Mexico, safety Shaq Bond had a 100-yard interception return for a score. In addition, returner Savon Scarver has returned two kickoffs for TDs, one that went 100 yards and another for 99. \u201cAlmost every single game we\u2019re getting one,\u201d Wells said. \u201cThat usually creates momentum and our offense has fed off of it.\u201d\n\nSEVENTH HEAVEN: A little information on the seven-game winning streak by the Aggies: On offense, they\u2019re averaging 52 points and 489 total yards. The defense has limited teams to 20 points and forced 19 turnovers. For that, the defense credits facing Love and the explosive offense each day in practice. \u201cPreparing against Jordan a lot helps us on Saturdays,\u201d senior safety Jontrell Rocquemore said.\n\nFIRST & GOAL: The Aggies are a perfect 8-for-8 in grabbing a lead at the end of the first quarter this season. They\u2019ve outscored teams by a 110-29 margin in the opening 15 minutes. For added measure, they hold a 238-72 lead in the first half.\n\nHANGING 10: Hawaii is 10-42 all-time against ranked teams, which includes a 9-25 mark at home. The Rainbow Warriors\u2019 last win over a team in the polls was Oct. 16, 2010, when they beat No. 19 Nevada at Aloha Stadium.\n\nJOHNNY BE GOOD: Junior receiver John Ursua has 14 receiving TDs for the Rainbow Warriors this season. The native of Hawaii ranks second in the nation with 1,083 yards receiving as he forms quite a combination with McDonald. Ursua was looked at by Utah State. He served a two-year mission in Paris. \u201cBesides the quarterback, he\u2019s what makes it go,\u201d Wells said. \u201cHe\u2019s dynamic ... He\u2019s a great player.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore college football coverage at http://collegefootball.ap.org and www.Twitter.com/AP_Top25", "WOLFEBORO, N.H.

The Trump administration is announcing the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The Trump administration is announcing the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. (AP Photo)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday restored U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, but carved out exemptions for eight countries that can still import oil from the Islamic Republic without penalty.\n\nThe sanctions take effect Monday and cover Iran\u2019s shipping, financial and energy sectors. They are the second batch the administration has re-imposed since Trump withdrew from the landmark accord in May.\n\nThe 2015 deal, one of former President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest diplomatic achievements, gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, which many believed it was using to develop atomic weapons. Trump repeatedly denounced the agreement as the \u201cworst ever\u201d negotiated by the United States and said it gave Iran too much in return for too little.\n\nBut proponents as well as the other parties to the deal \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union \u2014 have vehemently defended it. The Europeans have mounted a drive to save the agreement without the U.S., fearing that the new sanctions will drive Iran to pull out and resume all of its nuclear work.\n\nFriday\u2019s announcement comes just days before congressional midterm elections in the U.S., allowing Trump to highlight his decision to withdraw from the deal \u2014 a move that was popular among Republicans.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Trump tweeted what looks like a movie poster image of himself that takes creative inspiration from the TV series \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with the tagline \u201cSanctions are Coming, November 5.\u201d\n\nIn a statement issued Friday night, Trump said, \u201cOur objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions are \u201caimed at fundamentally altering the behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d He has issued a list of 12 demands that Iran must meet to get the sanctions lifted that include an end to its support for terrorism and military engagement in Syria and a halt to nuclear and ballistic missile development.\n\nPompeo said eight nations will receive temporary waivers allowing them to continue to import Iranian petroleum products as they move to end such imports entirely. He said those countries, which other officials said would include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday.\n\nThe waivers will be valid for six months, during which time the importing country can buy Iranian oil but must deposit Iran\u2019s revenue in an escrow account. Iran can spend the money but only on a narrow range of humanitarian items.\n\nPompeo defended the oil waivers and noted that since May, when the U.S. began to press countries to stop buying Iranian oil, Iran\u2019s exports had dropped by more than 1 million barrels per day.\n\nHe said the Iranian economy is already reeling from the earlier sanctions, with the currency losing half its value since April and the prices of fruit, poultry, eggs and milk skyrocketing.\n\nSome Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere said Friday\u2019s move should have gone even further. They were hoping for Iran to be disconnected from the main international financial messaging network known as SWIFT.\n\nWith limited exceptions, the re-imposed U.S. sanctions will hit Iran as well as countries that do not stop importing Iranian oil and foreign firms that do business with blacklisted Iranian entities, including its central bank, a number of private financial institutions, and state-run port and shipping firms, as well as hundreds of individual Iranian officials.\n\n\u201cOur ultimate aim is to compel Iran to permanently abandon its well-documented outlaw activities and behave as a normal country,\u201d Pompeo told reporters in a conference call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nMnuchin said 700 more Iranian companies and people would be added to the sanctions rolls. Those, he said, would include more than 300 that had not been included under previous sanctions.\n\nIsrael, which considers Iran an existential threat and opposed the deal from the beginning, welcomed Friday\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. President, for restoring sanctions against an Iranian regime that vows and works to destroy the Jewish state,\u201d Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer said in a tweet.\n\nMnuchin defended the decision to allow some Iranian banks to remain connected to SWIFT, saying that the Belgium-based firm had been warned that it will face penalties if sanctioned institutions are permitted to use it. And, he said that U.S. regulators would be watching closely Iranian transactions that use SWIFT to ensure any that run afoul of U.S. sanctions would be punished.", "NORMAN, Okla.

(AP) \u2014 Lewis Bennett has insisted he never knew what happened to his wife, who disappeared at sea last year during their sailing honeymoon. That is apparently about to change.\n\nCourt documents filed Friday in Miami federal court indicate Bennett, 41, has accepted a plea deal in the May 2017 disappearance of Isabella Hellmann, 41, who vanished as the Florida couple sailed off the Bahamas. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office filed a new affidavit charging Bennett with involuntary manslaughter, saying he killed Hellmann \u201cwithout malice,\u201d and dropped second-degree murder charges. In turn, Bennett is now scheduled to change his not-guilty plea at a Monday hearing. Such activity typically occurs when a plea deal has been reached.\n\nProsecutors declined to comment Friday and Bennett\u2019s public defender, Vanessa Chen, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. Hellmann\u2019s sister also declined to give an immediate comment.\n\nBennett, a mining engineer with dual British and Australian citizenship, had told the FBI and British journalists that he and Hellmann, a real estate agent, took their 37-foot catamaran, Surf Into Summer, for a belated honeymoon Caribbean cruise after they had been married three months. They left their infant daughter, Emelia, with her family.\n\nAs the catamaran passed the Bahamas on the return to Florida, Bennett sent out an emergency radio signal. When the Coast Guard found him on a life raft three hours later, he told rescuers he had left Hellmann on deck as he retired for the night to their cabin. He said he was jolted awake when their craft hit something. He said Hellmann was gone when he went outside and his attempts to find her failed. He said the catamaran was sinking, so he abandoned it.\n\n\u201cI have got nothing to hide,\u201d he later told The Daily Mail, a British newspaper, adding Hellmann was \u201cmy soulmate.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard spent seven days searching and found the catamaran, though it sank before it could be recovered. They did not find Hellmann.\n\nSixteen days after the disappearance, Bennett went to the home of Hellmann\u2019s parents to get his daughter, a heated meeting that ended with her sister accusing him of killing Hellmann, according to a Boca Raton police report. He took Emelia to Great Britain, where she was last reported living with his relatives. Bennett visited Cuba, saying he hoped maybe Hellmann had been rescued and taken there.\n\nHe soon filed a motion with the Florida courts asking that his wife be declared dead. That would have given him possession of the condominium and other items that belonged solely to her. A judge rejected it.\n\nInvestigators long doubted Bennett\u2019s story. The FBI says an inspection of the catamaran before it sank showed portholes below the waterline had been opened and damage to the twin hulls appeared to have been caused from the inside. Also investigators found Bennett on the life raft with $100,000 worth of coins stolen from a yacht he had worked aboard in 2016.\n\nBennett was arrested last year on that charge and pleaded guilty, getting a seven-month sentence. While serving that sentence, he was charged in February with Hellmann\u2019s death and has remained jailed.\n\nHe faces a possible eight-year sentence on the involuntary manslaughter charge and deportation.\n\nThe Palm Beach Post first reported the filing of the new information.", "A hearse carrying the body of Thai billionaire and Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha arrives at Debsirindrawas Temple in Bangkok, Thailand, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018.

His lawyers pointed to probation sentences received by retired Gen.

They said they would be satisfied with a sentence within federal sentencing guidelines, which called for zero to six months in prison.\n\nU.S. District Judge Liam O\u2019Grady expressed some frustration about the lack of answers on motive and imposed a 90-day sentence. He said he felt the guidelines were not sufficiently severe for this type of crime.\n\nRegis apologized for his actions but offered no reason for his crime. He worked as a government contractor assigned to the CIA between 2006 and 2016. He admitted copying classified information into dozens of personal notebooks and conducting unauthorized searches of classified databases.\n\nAccording to court documents, FBI agents found 60 notebooks containing classified information when they searched his home.\n\nRegis\u2019 defense lawyer, Cary Citronberg, said after Friday\u2019s hearing that his client \u201chad no nefarious purpose.

Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for criticism.\n\nTrump came to Indiana to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun, a former state representative and businessman who is putting up a stiff challenge to Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly.\n\nTrump said Donnelly, a first-term senator, was ineffective and referred to him as \u201cSleepin\u2019 Joe.\u201d While Donnelly has sought to highlight his cooperation with Trump on issues such as immigration, he voted against last year\u2019s tax cuts and this year voted against Trump\u2019s choice of Brett Kavanaugh to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBraun said, \u201cLet\u2019s retire Joe Donnelly.\u201d\n\nIn response, Donnelly said he looked forward to welcoming Trump again next year \u201cafter I\u2019m re-elected on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nTrump has scheduled seven more rallies \u2014 in Montana, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri \u2014 through Election Day.\n\nFriday\u2019s Indiana event received an added jolt from Vice President Mike Pence, who represented Indiana in Congress and as governor, and Bobby Knight, the Hall of Fame former head coach of the Indiana University men\u2019s basketball team.\n\nAt an airport rally earlier Friday in Huntington, West Virginia, Trump opened the final sprint to the midterms by defending his decision to tweet a video warning of people crossing into the U.S. illegally at the border with Mexico.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 A Japanese journalist who returned from more than three years of captivity in Syria apologized Friday to the government and said he was kidnapped as soon as he crossed the border because of a \u201csilly mistake\u201d before he even started reporting.\n\nJumpei Yasuda faced a crowd of reporters in Tokyo for the first time since gaining freedom last week. He said he went to Syria on June 22, 2015, to see for himself the reality and how the conflict affected ordinary people, including women and children, as well as soldiers in areas controlled by anti-government groups. His plan was to follow up his earlier reporting in Syria.\n\nYasuda, a respected journalist known for his coverage of conflict zones, said he made a bad decision while crossing into Syria when his local escort suddenly changed plans and Yasuda followed a pair of unknown guides instead. As they walked into Syria, the pair grabbed him, pushed him into a car, took his luggage away and kept him in a house.\n\n\u201cIt was an unthinkable silly mistake,\u201d he said, adding that he is fully accountable for his suffering.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who assisted in securing my release and those who worried about me, I deeply apologize and would like to express my sincere appreciation,\u201d Yasuda, wearing a dark suit and tie, said as he bowed deeply. \u201cI am also sorry that the Japanese government had to get involved because of me.\u201d\n\nHe was kidnapped by an al-Qaida branch known at the time as the Nusra Front, though the group never revealed its identity to him. A war monitoring group said Yasuda was recently held by a Syrian commander with the Turkistan Islamic Party, which mostly comprises Chinese jihadis in Syria. Yasuda said he was held earlier this year at a prison run by Uighurs who called themselves \u201cTurkistans\u201d \u2014 one of several places he was moved to during his 40-month captivity. He believes he was mostly in Idlib in northwestern Syria.\n\nYasuda detailed his life in captivity during a more than 2 \u00bd-hour news conference. He said he was allowed to keep a diary \u2014 one of his limited freedoms but a crucial record of his survival.\n\nNonetheless, his living conditions were harsh. He said he was harassed and tortured, even for making a noise. At a multistory facility, he was held in a solitary cell where he had to stay still within a tiny space. He had to keep his knees constantly bent and hardly had space to roll over while asleep. He said they punished him for creating noise, for example by turning off a fan in extreme summer heat. One of his captors told him the facility was in an area called Jabal Zawiyah.\n\nYasuda\u2019s release came suddenly. On Oct. 22, his captors said he was heading home, and the next day they drove him to a meeting point where they handed him over to Turkish authorities. They removed his blindfold as they arrived at the immigration center in Antakya in southern Turkey. Yasuda said he didn\u2019t know how his release was won.\n\nWhile the public generally welcomed Yasuda\u2019s safe return, some criticized him as a fearless troublemaker. In a country where those who act independently are often considered selfish and receive little sympathy when they fail after defying government-issued cautions, some people on Twitter demanded that Yasuda apologize for causing trouble. Past hostages have faced similar criticism upon returning home.\n\n\u201cI humbly accept criticisms and suggestions,\u201d Yasuda said. \u201cNaturally, I receive the blame and attention because my actions caused trouble. But I hope people would take another step and think what is happening in Syria. And hopefully, the authorities would investigate my captors,\u201d he said. He also said the role of journalists in conflict zones is still crucial for the world to know the truth, and that he hopes his example can lead to a discussion of how safety and the quality of conflict zone reporting can be improved.\n\nRei Shiva, a journalist who has covered Iraq, Lebanon and other areas of the Middle East, said many reporters who cover conflict zones are not doing it just for money or fame, but want to see the situation themselves and tell the world about it. He said journalists who ignore government travel warnings become targets of bashing in Japan because many people are too unquestioning of government directives.\n\n\u201cAre we supposed to run away every time the government issues a travel advisory? Then there will be no way of knowing anything,\u201d Shiva said. \u201cBecause people in Japan don\u2019t feel strongly about their right to know, there is a lack of respect for journalists who fight for it.\u201d\n\nYasuda started reporting on the Middle East in the early 2000s and went to Afghanistan and Iraq. He was taken hostage in Iraq in 2004 with three other Japanese, but was freed after Islamic clerics negotiated his release. He worked as a cook in Iraq for nearly a year as part of his research for a 2010 book about laborers in war zones. He also wrote articles about his 2004 captivity.\n\nSyria has been one of the most dangerous places for journalists since the conflict there began in March 2011, with dozens killed or kidnapped.\n\nAsked if he will return to conflict zones after his suffering, Yasuda said his plans are still blank.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "FILE - In this June 10, 2018 file photo, Bruce Springsteen performs at the 72nd annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall, in New York.

He tightens his telescope on its tripod and fiddles with each leg, seeking level ground on the brick sidewalk.\n\nThe 87-year-old in a blue beret and Nordic sweater pulls his advertising from a green milk crate. It\u2019s a small cardboard sign that reads, \u201cTONIGHT \u2014 THE MOON.\u201d\n\nAnd it bears the slogan he\u2019ll repeat as tourists gawk and bargoers stumble past: \u201cHAV-A-LOOK!\u201d\n\nThis is night No. 2,858 for Heyn, known as Baltimore\u2019s \u201cStreetcorner Astronomer.\u201d And he says it\u2019s his last.\n\nHe\u2019s part scientist, part street performer, having beamed glimpses of Saturn, Jupiter and elusive comets to Baltimore sidewalks for nearly 31 years.\n\nOver that time, he\u2019s gained five grandchildren and lost 5 inches of height, and neck pain now prevents him from lugging around his instrument alone. Tonight, he has the help of his 16-year-old neighbor, a tall, thin boy named Miles Barnes.\n\nFrom the open door to the Admiral\u2019s Cup, the wails of a band covering Pearl Jam spill out just before 7:30 as Heyn starts his night of work.\n\n\u201cIs there something special about the moon tonight?\u201d one woman asks as she passes.\n\nHeyn responds, \u201cIt\u2019s always this beautiful.\u201d\n\nWould Baltimore have its own streetcorner astronomer without Miss Wicker? Heyn traces his passion for the stars to her Garrison Junior High School classroom, and an assignment to look for the Big Dipper.\n\nHe remembers finding it, standing on its handle in the twilight. It was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen.\n\nA red leather-bound star atlas, copyright 1937, fed his curiosity as a teen. Once World War II ended and telescopes became commercially available again, his father bought him his first one, a Mogey with a 3-inch lens.\n\nHis astronomy career wasn\u2019t meant to be, just yet \u2014 he sold the telescope to pay for a road trip out west with his buddies. That started what Heyn calls his 16-year hiatus from astronomy. He tried college for a year, served in the Korean War, got married, had three children.\n\nBut he started looking skyward again in the 1960s, photographing meteor showers and traveling to watch solar eclipses. He bought a new 3-inch telescope in 1978, and traded it up for an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain three years later.\n\nBouncing light off a series of mirrors, it could spot objects near and far. With battery power, it rotated to follow them across the sky.\n\nOne cool November night in 1987, he decided to take it out for a spin.\n\n\u201cI was divorced. I didn\u2019t have much social life,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI said, why not? I\u2019ll take my telescope down to Fells Point.\u201d\n\nBy 8 o\u2019clock on Heyn\u2019s last night, the clouds finally part, revealing a bright, nearly full moon. Casey Buto, 23, peers into that same Schmidt-Cassegrain, which Heyn affectionately calls the Fells Point Hubble.\n\n\u201cDamn, that\u2019s incredible,\u201d the new Upper Fells Point resident says as he studies the craters.\n\nLike so many of Heyn\u2019s customers over the years, Buto and his friend Taryn Ward, who\u2019s visiting from Rochester, N.Y., have never met anyone like the old man. Buto says he always thought about buying a telescope and learning astronomy, but never did, and now he\u2019s in awe.\n\nThe band moves on to Coldplay.\n\nJasmine Wilborne is the next to look, and she\u2019s ecstatic to share the opportunity with Sharmaine Johnson, 16, recently matched with Wilborne in a big sister program. Wilborne once looked through a telescope she found at Goodwill, but is thrilled at how much better the view is from Heyn\u2019s observatory.\n\n\u201cMarvel of space is something that should be passed down the generations because it\u2019s absolutely beautiful, the universe we are in,\u201d the 27-year-old Pen Lucy resident says. \u201cI\u2019m happy someone like him is keeping that alive.\u201d\n\nA girl in head-to-toe gold sequins looks over as she walks by, but keeps going.\n\nThe hundreds of nights that followed that first trip to Fells Point are all documented in two fat binders Heyn keeps on a shelf in his Waverly home. He recorded accounts of each one on the same Olympia manual typewriter, including the location, weather, points of astronomical interest, any notable visitors and, always, his take for the night \u2014 even a calculation of his hourly wage.\n\nHis careerlong earnings, collected in a hat he learned to secure to the base of his telescope, total nearly $200,000. In 2016, Parade magazine included him in its feature \u201cWhat people earn.\u201d His receipts that year: $6,423.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother Heyn if some people aren\u2019t interested in having a look, but when they do, every cent helps.\n\n\u201cHow about if they look and don\u2019t pay?\u201d he jokes. \u201cThat\u2019s the fate of a street performer.\u201d\n\nHe worked for a time as a teacher at a school for troubled youth, but quit soon after he started telescoping at age 56. Apart from a short stint at the Maryland Science Center and his Social Security checks, the streetcorner tips are what he\u2019s lived on \u2014 frugally.\n\nPress clippings fill a third binder on Heyn\u2019s shelf, documenting the recognition he\u2019s received over the years.\n\nA handful of quirky profiles in the early years. Stories about his legal battle, handled by pro bono lawyers, to set up his act at Harborplace. The news of his discovery that Baltimore\u2019s compass-aligned street grid was laid out slightly off kilter.\n\nHeyn and his telescope even earned a spot in a book: \u201c100 Things To Do in Baltimore Before You Die.\u201d\n\nHis letters have been published often in Sky and Telescope magazine, a bible for amateur astronomers. One ran in this year\u2019s August issue about a recent marriage proposal at his telescope. The couple had met Heyn on their first date.\n\nThe magazine even blessed his naming of an obscure constellation near Sagittarius, four stars in the shape of a kite. It published a small map bearing its name: Herman\u2019s Cross.\n\n\u201cAnd that, to me, makes it official,\u201d Heyn says.\n\nMichael Gambuto, taking a friend from Rhode Island out for a night in Fells Point, spots Heyn about a quarter to 9. He won\u2019t miss another chance to chat with the streetcorner astronomer he first met as a Towson State University student two decades ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been partying down here forever,\u201d Gambuto says. \u201cHalloweens vomiting all over the place, you name it, and he\u2019s always been out here. It\u2019s incredible that he\u2019s still out here.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old says the astronomer\u2019s contributions are immeasurable.\n\nHeyn\u2019s \u201cevery bit a part of Baltimore as the statues,\u201d Gambuto says \u2014 someone who \u201cstokes the flames of curiosity\u201d in the city.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only visitor this night with strong memories of Heyn. Peter Davidson spotted him earlier, texting his wife and friends about it. They shared a special night decades ago that Heyn\u2019s telescope was a big part of. The memories are extra special as one of Davidson\u2019s friends deals with Alzheimer\u2019s, and as he himself recovers from cancer surgery.\n\nHe comes back to the corner for second visit, just to snap a picture.\n\nIf Heyn has a legacy, it\u2019s not just those memories. He hopes that some of the children who have stretched their necks to look into his telescope have gone on to study science or astronomy, but he can\u2019t be sure.\n\nHe knows of a handful of people he inspired to become amateur astronomers themselves, including Steve Rifkin, an information technology manager at the Johns Hopkins University, and Teresa Palomar, a former Western High School math teacher.\n\nHowever much money Heyn collected, many of his visitors say his services were priceless. Nothing compares to seeing the heavens with your own eyes.\n\nPlanetary astronomer Heidi Hammel met Heyn in July 1994, after a week of 20-hour days at the Space Telescope Science Institute observing a comet strike Jupiter. Watching the event through the Hubble Space Telescope was a once-in-a-career opportunity. But it wasn\u2019t until a dinner trip to Fells Point that its magnitude really hit her in the chest.\n\nShe looked in Heyn\u2019s telescope and saw black spots across Jupiter\u2019s massive surface.\n\n\u201cIt changes people to look through a telescope and see it with their own eyes,\u201d says Hammel, now executive vice president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy. \u201cI think it triggers something in your brain, or reaches you on a different emotional level.\u201d\n\nAbout 9:30, clouds approach and the weather starts to turn colder. Ed Lauer walks up to the telescope. He plays in the Juneways, the band at the Admiral\u2019s Cup that provided the soundtrack to much of Heyn\u2019s last night.\n\n\u201cGood to see you!\u201d Lauer exclaims.\n\nHeyn tells Lauer he decided earlier this year to retire, and that he agreed to set up on Thames Street one last time with a Baltimore Sun reporter and photographer. Lauer begs him to at least keep coming out once in a while, when the weather gets warm.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are going to miss you,\u201d Lauer says.\n\nHeyn has heard that sentiment a lot this night. Lisa Breslin, a dean at McDaniel College, offers to pick him up next time, and leaves her number. Other visitors look hopefully to Miles, Heyn\u2019s neighbor, calling the boy Heyn\u2019s apprentice. Heyn, at least for now, says he\u2019s had such a great time, he\u2019ll consider it.\n\nBy 9:40, clouds block out the moonshine, and Heyn decides it\u2019s time to call it a night. The next band at the Admiral\u2019s Cup starts up the drumbeat of the Strokes\u2019 \u201cLast Nite.\u201d\n\nA vicious wind picks up as Miles lifts the telescope from its base, lays it in a bed of green foam and shuts the metal case. Heyn collects his signs, hat and the embossed Post-It notes he\u2019s always handed out, saying \u201cI Saw the Moon\u201d or \u201cI Saw Mars in Fells Point.\u201d They pile it all into the back of Heyn\u2019s Subaru.\n\nThe wind is so strong, it knocks over a trash can. Heyn says that he\u2019s never seen such a sudden gale in so many years on Baltimore streets.\n\n\u201cWell, this has been an evening to remember,\u201d he says. \u201cBoy, we got out of there just in time.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "Central American migrants, part of the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, begin their morning trek, in Donaji, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Nov. 2, 2018. The migrants had already made a grueling 40-mile (65-kilometer) trek from Juchitan, Oaxaca, on Thursday, after they failed to get the bus transportation they had hoped for.

Miguel Angel Yunes announced that authorities there would be providing not only humanitarian assistance but also offering mass transportation for the migrants.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that they be able to move soon from Veracruz toward another place,\u201d Yunes said in a video message released in the evening.\n\nCaravan organizers told the migrants that they would be leaving around 5 a.m. for the capital in dozens of buses, apparently enough to accommodate the several thousand people in the group.\n\nBut soon afterward, Yunes released a second video saying that because Mexico City\u2019s water system was undergoing maintenance and much of the city would be without water over the weekend, it would not be correct to send the migrants there.\n\nInstead he offered to take the migrants to another city in Veracruz until the problem in Mexico City is resolved.\n\nThousands of Central American migrants resumed their slow trek through southern Mexico on Thursday, shifting their route toward the Gulf coast, a path closer to the Texas border.

Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church and the Interior Ministry say Islamic militants have ambushed three buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, killing at least seven and wounding a dozen more. (AP Photo/Mohammed Hakim)\n\nMINYA, Egypt (AP) \u2014 Islamic militants on Friday ambushed three buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, killing seven and wounding 19, according to the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Interior Ministry.\n\nAll but one of those killed were members of the same family, according to a list of the victims\u2019 names released by the church, which said among the dead were a boy and a girl, age 15 and 12 respectively.\n\nThe local Islamic State affiliate which spearheads militants fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, according to SITE, a U.S.-based group that monitors and translates militants\u2019 statements. It said the attack was revenge for the imprisonment by Egyptian authorities of \u201cour chaste sisters.\u201d It did not elaborate.\n\nIt said the attack left 13 Christians killed and another 18 wounded, but it was not immediately possible to independently verify the claim or reconcile the discrepancy in the number of dead and wounded given by the group and the church.\n\nThe Islamic State has repeatedly vowed to go after Egypt\u2019s Christians as punishment for their support of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. As defense minister, el-Sissi led the military\u2019s 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. It has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Christians dating back to December 2016.\n\nEl-Sissi, who has made the economy and security his top priorities since taking office in 2014, wrote on his Twitter account that Friday\u2019s attack was designed to harm the \u201cnation\u2019s solid fabric\u201d and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. He later offered his condolences when he spoke by telephone with Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt\u2019s Orthodox Christians and a close el-Sissi ally.\n\nIn a somber message of his own, Tawadros said in a video clip released by the church that the latest attack would only make the Christians stronger. \u201cWe also pray for the assailants. They are misled because all the grief, pain and frustration they cause will achieve absolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nThe attack is likely to cast a dark shadow on one of el-Sissi\u2019s showpieces \u2014 the World Youth Forum \u2014 which opens Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and hopes to draw thousands of local and foreign youth to discuss upcoming projects, with Egypt\u2019s 63-year-old leader taking center stage.\n\n\u201cThey want to embarrass el-Sissi and show that the state is unable to protect the Copts,\u201d said Fr. Begemy Naseem Nasr, the priest of the church of Saint Mary in Minya. \u201cEgypt is the target here and we all know that.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s attack is the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years, indicating that security measures in place since then are either inadequate or have become lax. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. It is also the latest by IS to target Christians in churches in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and Tanta in the Nile Delta north of the capital.\n\nThose attacks left at least 100 people dead and led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and Church-linked facilities. They have also underlined the vulnerability of minority Christians in a country where many Muslims have since the 1970s grown religiously conservative.\n\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said Friday\u2019s attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year\u2019s attack.\n\nThe Interior Ministry maintained that only one bus was attacked, but the latest statement by the church said three buses were targeted and put the death toll at 7 and the wounded at 19, including two in critical condition.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country\u2019s 100 million people, complain of discrimination in the Muslim majority country. Christian activists say the church\u2019s alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection but failed to end frequent acts of discrimination that boil over into violence against Christians, especially in rural Egypt.\n\nIn Minya, the scene of Friday\u2019s attack, Christians constitute the highest percentage of the population \u2014 about 35 percent \u2014 of any Egyptian province. It\u2019s also in Minya where most acts of violence, like attacks on churches and Christian homes and businesses, take place.\n\nChristians there often claim that the local police is soft on Muslims accused of attacking Christians and, in their pursuit of keeping the peace between the two communities, insist on resolving differences through tribal-like reconciliation meetings rather than rule of law.\n\nFriday\u2019s attack comes at a time when the church is still reeling from the July killing inside another desert monastery of its abbot. Two monks, one of whom has been defrocked, are on trial for the killing of the abbot, Bishop Epiphanius.\n\n___\n\nHendawi reported from Cairo.", "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 The price of heating oil is holding steady in Maine at a rate that is higher than it was a year ago.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Energy Office said on Thursday the average statewide cash price is now $3.02, which is the same as last week.

Thanks to gains over the previous three days, the S&P 500 index finished with its biggest weekly increase since March.\n\nApple, the world\u2019s largest technology company, forecast weak revenue in the current quarter and startled investors by saying it will stop disclosing quarterly iPhone sales. That pulled technology stocks lower. Other high-growth stocks held up well after the U.S. and China said they had made some progress in trade talks, and Asian indexes surged on reports that China\u2019s government plans to cut taxes.\n\nThe Department of Labor said employers added 250,000 jobs in October, with no sign that hiring was going to slow down. The proportion of Americans with jobs is at its highest level since January 2009, and hourly wages also grew by the most since then. Along with high consumer confidence, those are all good signs for economic growth and consumer spending in the months to come.\n\nBond yields surged following the strong jobs report as investors bet on continued economic growth, which would push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly.\n\n\u201cIt clearly was a good report,\u201d said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nGrowth in wages, while stronger than anything that\u2019s been reported recently, was about what investors were expecting, Lefkowitz said. That\u2019s important because investors are still sensitive to signs that inflation could flare up, forcing the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. If inflation grows moderately, as it appeared to in October, that\u2019s not as likely.\n\nThe S&P 500 index slid 17.31 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,723.06.

They skidded in October, suffering their worst monthly loss in seven years.

McElrath and some other Texas voters reported voting machines flipped their straight-ticket selections to the other party in key races during early voting. (Leah McElrath via AP)\n\nRejected voter registrations, malfunctioning voting machines, confusion among election workers. These problems and more have surfaced during early voting ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. A rundown of voting problems so far around the country:\n\nVOTING MACHINES\n\n\u2014 Some Texas voters reported that balloting machines changed their straight-ticket selections to the other party in key races during early voting. State officials said the problem was connected to Hart eSlate voting machines, which are used in about 30 percent of counties statewide. They said problems can occur when voters complete and submit ballots too quickly. The machines do not provide receipts, but voters see a screen that shows their choices and can make changes before submitting their ballot.\n\n\u2014 A handful of voters in Guilford County, North Carolina, reported their ballot decisions on touchscreen voting machines were recorded incorrectly during early voting, which began Oct. 17. County elections director Charlie Collicutt attributed the issue to old technology (the voting machines were bought in 2006) and encouraged all voters to double check their choices before they submit their ballots. Election experts have warned that aging voting equipment can result in failures and other issues.\n\nPOLLING PLACES:\n\n\u2014 A group of students from a historically black university in Prairie View, Texas, filed a lawsuit over a lack of early voting locations on campus or anywhere in the city during the first week of early voting. After the lawsuit was filed by five Prairie View A&M University students, Waller County elections officials added a day of early voting in Prairie View, which is predominantly black, for the first week and expanded hours during the second week.\n\n\u2014 When voters in Dodge City, Kansas, head to their polling place this year, they will have to leave the city. Election officials have moved the lone polling place outside city limits, citing construction at the previous polling site. Voting rights groups already were upset that there was only one polling place for the city\u2019s 13,000 registered voters. They also worry about low turnout among Hispanics, who represent 60 percent of Dodge City\u2019s population.\n\n\u2014 Some voters in Barton County, Kansas, will have to travel 18 miles to get to their nearest polling site after officials cut the number of voting locations from 23 during the state primary to 11 for Tuesday\u2019s general election. County Clerk Donna Zimmerman says the polling places were consolidated to save money.\n\n\u2014 After facing national criticism, election officials in a majority black county in rural south Georgia reversed course and withdrew a plan to eliminate seven of the county\u2019s nine voting locations. An independent consultant had recommended the consolidations in Randolph County, noting the seven polling places did not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The consultant was later fired. County officials say they lack the money to make the necessary changes to comply with the ADA.\n\nABSENTEE BALLOTS\n\n\u2014 A federal judge has ruled that Georgia election officials must provide time for voters to fix their absentee ballots when the signature on the ballot does not match the one on file with their local election office. The ACLU and other civil rights group had sued the state after reports that a suburban Atlanta county had rejected a high rate of absentee ballots compared to other large counties in the metro area. Under the judge\u2019s order, voters would have almost a week to verify their identity and have their ballot counted.\n\n\u2014 Some 10,000 voters received mailers from the Missouri Republican Party with incorrect information about when their absentee ballots are due. GOP officials blamed the issue on a miscommunication between the party and the vendor that printed the postcards. Absentee ballots are due on Election Day.\n\n\u2014 In Montana, an undetermined number of voters received a mailer from the Republican National Committee that included an error about the state\u2019s absentee ballot deadline. The RNC plans to send new mailers and call voters to provide clarification that ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nVOTER REGISTRATION\n\n\u2014 A judge has ordered Tennessee\u2019s largest county to allow people with incomplete voter registration applications to fix any problems and vote on Election Day. Groups including the Tennessee Black Voter Project had submitted more than 36,000 registrations to the commission, but officials said about 55 percent were invalid because they were incomplete, were duplicates from previously registered voters or had come from convicted felons.\n\n\u2014 In Georgia, some 53,000 voter registration applications \u2014 the vast majority of which were submitted by black residents \u2014 are considered pending by the secretary of state\u2019s office because they ran afoul of the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d law. The law requires information on the forms to precisely match records with either the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. On Friday, a federal judge ruled that election officials must make it easier for voters whose registrations are pending to prove they are U.S. citizens when they go to the polls. They must bring a valid photo ID that substantially matches the information on file.\n\n\u2014 In Missouri\u2019s St. Louis County, 253 people who recently registered to vote were mistakenly sent letters telling them they were ineligible. Officials say about 150 of them called and were added to the voter role. Election Director Rick Stream said election workers processing forms that arrived after the state\u2019s Oct. 10 deadline were confused. Forms postmarked or signed by Oct. 10 should have counted, regardless of when they arrived. Officials say they are working to notify those affected. Stream initially estimated that about 600 people had received the erroneous letters.\n\nVOTER ID\n\n\u2014 Voters in Arkansas will have to show a photo ID after the Arkansas Supreme Court on Oct. 11 upheld a state law approved last year. Voters who come to the polls without a photo ID will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot if the voter signs a sworn affidavit or returns to the election office by noon the following Monday with his or her ID. The provisional ballot will be counted as long as the county election commission doesn\u2019t invalidate it on other grounds.\n\n\u2014 Voters in Missouri who do not bring a valid photo ID to the polls will not have to sign a sworn statement after a state judge set aside that requirement. The Oct. 9 ruling by Judge Richard Callahan also prevents the state from advertising that a photo ID is required to vote. Instead, voters who do not have a proper photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they show some other form of identification, such as a student ID card, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck that contains a home address.\n\n\u2014 Voters in North Dakota will be required to provide a photo ID with a street address in order to vote on Election Day. Members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians had sued over the requirement, arguing that street addresses aren\u2019t always assigned on reservations and the requirements discriminate against Native Americans. Earlier this year, a federal judge issued an injunction that would have allowed voters to use identification with a post office box, but that was later blocked on appeal. The Spirit Lake Sioux tribe has since filed another lawsuit challenging the street address requirement.\n\nVOTER REQUIREMENTS\n\n\u2014 A panel of federal judges has ruled that people in Ohio who had been removed from the list of registered voters for not casting ballots over a six-year period will be able to participate in Tuesday\u2019s election. A divided 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel granted an emergency motion sought by voting-rights groups.\n\n\u2014 Voters who recently moved to New Hampshire will have to submit additional documentation after the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that had placed the requirement on hold. The law requires voters who had moved to the state within 30 days of an election to provide proof they intend to stay.\n\nHOW TO GET HELP\n\nVoters who encounter problems at the polls can seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice at (800) 253-3931 or the nonpartisan Election Protection coalition at (866) OUR-VOTE.\n\n___\n\nCompiled by Associated Press writer Christina A.

They say factoring in race hurts Asian-Americans.\n\nBut others in the Asian community say that a race-blind process relying solely on academic scores would also hurt Asian-Americans. Southeast Asians, for example, who largely came over as refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, are under-represented in higher education.\n\n\u201cThe narrative right now is very focused on a very specific segment within the Asian-American community that does not represent the larger Asian-American community,\u201d said Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center .\n\nThe center signed on to a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund , siding with Harvard\u2019s use of what the university calls a \u201cholistic\u201d review of an applicant.\n\nThe case brought by Students for Fair Admissions could wind up before a newly re-constituted and more conservative U.S. Supreme Court, which only narrowly re-affirmed the use of race in college admissions two years ago.\n\nHere are some of the issues surrounding Asian-Americans and affirmative action:\n\nWHO ARE ASIAN-AMERICANS?\n\nThere are at least 18 million people in the U.S. who are of Asian descent from about 20 countries. Asian-Americans are about 6 percent of the U.S. population, but make up nearly 23 percent of this year\u2019s freshman class at Harvard , 22 percent of the same class at Princeton , and are the fastest growing minority in the country.\n\nChinese-Americans are the largest sub-group with at least 4.3 million people, followed by Indian-Americans at 4 million and Filipino-Americans at 3 million.\n\nChinese started migrating to the country in the 19th century as labor for the growing West. More recent waves include refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, as well as highly skilled workers from China and India.\n\nThe following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.\n\nThe term \u201cAsian-American\u201d was coined by young civil rights activists marching alongside Latinos and African Americans for social justice in the 1960s.\n\nEllen D. Wu, a history professor and director of the Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University in Bloomington, says that political identity has now evolved largely into a demographic designation for \u201ca very diverse group.\u201d\n\nWHAT IS THE ASIAN AMERICAN COALITION FOR EDUCATION?\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions filed the lawsuit against Harvard in 2014. Actively supporting it is the Asian American Coalition for Education , which filed federal complaints in 2015 alleging discrimination. The coalition\u2019s president is Yukong Zhao, a corporate strategist who immigrated to the U.S. from China in 1992 to pursue a master\u2019s degree in business.\n\nZhao is part of a new generation of wealthier Chinese immigrants who are active on social media and opposed to affirmative action.\n\nConservative strategist Edward Blum, who is president of Students for Fair Admissions, was behind the last affirmative action admissions case, which accused the University of Texas of discriminating against white students. Blum lost that case at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nDOES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HELP OR HURT ASIAN-AMERICANS?\n\nDepends on who you ask.\n\nJulie J. Park, author of \u201cRace on Campus: Debunking Myths with Data\u201d and past consultant to Harvard in the lawsuit, says under-represented Asians such as Cambodians and Hmong can get a boost from a review that goes beyond test scores. The same goes for lower-income Asian-Americans whose grades may not reflect their potential. Park also says colleges want students with different backgrounds so Asian-Americans may be more coveted in fields or colleges with few Asians. It depends on the situation.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions, on the other hand, argues the system in place at Harvard puts unfair weight on race, primarily at the expense of academically talented Asian Americans. It also alleges that Harvard intentionally uses a vague \u201cpersonal rating\u201d to reject Asian-American applicants in favor of students from other racial backgrounds.\n\nSupporters of affirmative action say it\u2019s possible that Harvard is biased against Asian-Americans, but that doesn\u2019t mean race-conscious policies should be scrapped.\n\nWHY ARE ASIANS CALLED THE \u201cMODEL MINORITY\u201d?\n\nThe stereotype of Asian-Americans as hard-working, educated and free of societal problems started in the 1960s. Wu, the history professor, says it was a way for whites to establish a racial order that was defined, most importantly, by not being black.\n\nAsian-Americans were also responsible for perpetuating the myth, she said, adding that the \u201cconsequences of that have long functioned to justify anti-black racism and anti-black policies.\u201d\n\nIS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH?\n\nOverall, the numbers look good for Asian-Americans. Their household median income is $83,000, compared with $60,000 for the U.S. More than 50 percent have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, compared with 32 percent for the country, according to the 2017 American Community Survey put out by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBut there are large disparities within the group.\n\nFor example, while 75 percent of Indians held a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, only 16 percent of Laotians and 20 percent of Cambodians had done so. Among Chinese, the figure is 55 percent.\n\nIndian households have the highest median income at $114,000 while at the other end are Burmese households, at $40,000. About 6 percent of Filipino individuals live in poverty, compared with 21 percent of Nepalese and 31 percent of Burmese.\n\n---\n\nAP Data Journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed from Los Angeles.", "Iowa governor\u2019s race has GOP asking if Democrat is too rich\n\nIn this Oct. 19, 2018, photo, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds speaks during a rally for U.S. Rep. David Young, R-Iowa, in Des Moines, Iowa. Even before Fred Hubbell defeated a field of five other Democrats to win the party's nomination for Iowa governor in June he was criticized for his inherited wealth by Reynolds and state GOP officials. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Coming from Republicans, whose party celebrates wealth and praises President Donald Trump for his ability to turn a profit, the criticism of wealthy Iowa Democratic governor candidate Fred Hubbell has been a bit jarring.\n\nRepublican Party of Iowa Chairman Jeff Kaufmann led the way, with the mocking refrain that \u201cPrince Frederick just got it all handed to him.\u201d\n\nOn primary election night, Hubbell\u2019s opponent, GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds, joined in by arguing, \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t that Fred Hubbell has been rich his entire life, it\u2019s that he has no idea what it\u2019s (like) not to be.\u201d\n\nThe claim obviously plays to Reynolds\u2019 strength, given her humble roots growing up in a blue-collar family in a town of 700. Why not contrast her everyday experiences with Hubbell, whose ancestors built incredible wealth by helping create modern Des Moines and whose family home overlooking downtown now serves as the governor\u2019s mansion?\n\nWhat\u2019s harder to determine is if the strategy will work in an era where rich men hold governorships across the country and the president talks about his real estate holdings and luxurious golf courses.\n\nCount Steve Jarding as skeptical. The former campaign manager for Democratic candidates, who now lectures on public policy at Harvard University, said candidates once feared being accused of using their wealth to buy elections but that there\u2019s now little shame in being rich.\n\n\u201cAs people get polarized and as more voters get turned off, the only voters left standing are the people that would absolutely die for one party or the other,\u201d and they don\u2019t care about such issues, he said. \u201cThe rest of the people have tuned out.\u201d\n\nAt least 11 current governors have wealth in the millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars. Most are Republicans, including those in Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, Florida and Tennessee, but at least two Democrats \u2014 in Minnesota and Pennsylvania \u2014 also come from gold-plated backgrounds.\n\nUsually, it\u2019s Democrats who try to turn that wealth into a disadvantage. Occasionally it might make a difference, most notably in the 2012 presidential campaign between millionaire Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama. In that race, there were questions about whether someone rich enough to have a car garage elevator in his home understood the needs of regular Americans.\n\nIn neighboring Nebraska, Democratic governor candidate Bob Krist has picked up the issue and begun calling millionaire incumbent Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts \u201cWall Street Pete,\u201d noting he\u2019s the son of billionaire TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts. Because of his wealth, Krist said, Ricketts doesn\u2019t see that a tax plan he backed would mean big savings to corporations and the rich but only $25 initially to an average homeowner.\n\n\u201cThanks for the pizza night, Pete. Hope you enjoy the yacht,\u201d Krist said.\n\nRicketts\u2019 campaign quickly responded that the governor doesn\u2019t own a yacht.\n\nChicago-based political consultant Michael Schrimpf, who has worked on campaigns for Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, both wealthy Republican businessmen, said that since about 2010 voters began placing more value on political outsiders than the net worth of a candidate.\n\n\u201cPeople are just fed up with career politicians and I know with Rauner and Doug Burgum they both said they\u2019re going to work for free. They\u2019re not doing this because they need a job,\u201d Schrimpf said.\n\nHubbell, 67, said in an interview that the personal attacks are no surprise.\n\nReynolds, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a positive record to run on, so we knew they were going to try to tear me down.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how much questions about his money have hurt Hubbell \u2014 polls indicate a close race \u2014 there\u2019s no denying the upside of personal wealth.\n\nThe record $18 million Hubbell has raised includes $6.4 million of his own money. Reynolds, the former lieutenant governor who moved up when Gov. Terry Branstad became the U.S. ambassador to China, has raised nearly $11 million.\n\nIowa Republican political consultant Craig Robinson said the ability to pump your own cash into a campaign early really helps in places like Iowa where, instead of fundraising, a candidate can go from small town to small town shaking hands in cafes, town halls and neighborhoods.\n\nFor many candidates, \u201cthe fundraising alone can be a fulltime job,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter college, Hubbell worked at New York law firms before settling back in Iowa and taking the helm of family-owned companies. He\u2019s served on numerous corporate and community organization boards. A trust he and his wife created has given millions of dollars to charities.\n\nHe said voters don\u2019t ask about his inheritance or income.\n\n\u201cThey want to know if you\u2019re listening to them,\u201d he said.\n\nReynolds, 59, the first woman to serve as Iowa governor, was a four-term county treasurer before being elected to the Iowa Senate. She served as lieutenant governor from 2011 until May 2017. She contrasts her background as the daughter of a farmer and factory worker who as a teenager worked as a waitress at a department store and as a grocery store checker.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know if he understands that,\u201d she said of Hubbell. \u201cI\u2019ve been there so I understand the impact of the decisions that I make and really how hard it is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow David Pitt on Twitter: https://twitter.com/davepitt", "Rochester police arrest suspect in fatal shooting last month\n\nROCHESTER, N.Y.

Since then, Wickremesinghe has stayed at Temple Trees, insisting he is still the legitimate prime minister and controls a majority in Parliament.\n\nPalitha Range Bandara, a lawmaker from Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Party, told the House speaker on Friday that he had been offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio to cross over to Rajapaksa\u2019s new government.\n\nMahindananda Aluthgamage, a lawmaker from Rajapaksa\u2019s party, denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have such money to offer anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nKabir Hasheem, the UNP chairman and, until last week, the government\u2019s minister of highways and road development, said other lawmakers had described similar offers, but that the majority in Parliament was holding out.\n\nOn Friday, 119 lawmakers in the 225-member Parliament signed a letter urging Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to reconvene the body immediately.\n\nRajapaksa said Thursday that Sirisena would summon lawmakers as soon as Nov. 5. Since Monday, Sirisena has handed out 14 Cabinet posts, including to five lawmakers who defected from Wickremesinghe\u2019s coalition, and made Rajapaksa finance minister.\n\nAt Temple Trees, all but two dozen of the more than 1,000 security guards usually stationed there have withdrawn. The government has kept about 15 plainclothes guards to protect the sprawling complex itself, while 10 others have remained to guard Wickremesinghe.\n\nSupporters and young Buddhist monks wandered freely through the complex, making a violent eviction of Wickremesinghe unlikely.\n\nRajapaksa, Sri Lanka\u2019s president from 2005 to 2015, is credited by Sri Lanka\u2019s Sinhalese ethnic majority with ending a 25-year civil war with the Tamil Tigers, a militant group of minority Tamils fighting for independence.\n\nStill, even after persuading lawmakers to lift term limits, Rajapaska lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities. Since then, he and his brothers Basil Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, his former defense secretary, have been working to reclaim power. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Sri Lanka People\u2019s Front), the party they formed in 2016, swept local elections in 2018, an embarrassing defeat for Wickremesinghe\u2019s United National Front, a coalition formed with Sirisena in 2015 to defeat Rajapaksa.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s government was also sharply criticized last year after handing over operations of a port Rajapaksa had developed with Chinese loans to a Chinese company. The ousted prime minister said Friday it was an open-bidding process.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese were giving the loans and had been given the first option. And if you\u2019re not satisfied, give it to others. We did that and we found that there was a very good offer by China Merchants. But remember similarly we also had an airport without airplanes and again we followed the same procedure,\u201d he said, adding that his government had been negotiating with an Indian airport operator for that concession.\n\nKehaliya Rambukwella, a spokesman for the new government and Rajapaksa\u2019s former media minister, said the government would renegotiate the 99-year lease for the port, which Rajapaksa\u2019s supporters deride as an outright sale.\n\nAlthough supporters of both Rajapaska and Wickremesinghe claim to have the support of a majority in Parliament, Rambukwella said Sirisena was exploring sidestepping the question altogether by dissolving the legislature ahead of the 4 1/2-year period stipulated by Sri Lankan law.\n\n\u201cIf Ranil (Wickremesinghe) gets a vote of confidence, the president said that within one hour, he\u2019ll resign, which means he will dissolve the government,\u201d Rambukwell said.\n\nJehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, said the events of the past week have established a dangerous precedent for Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cWithout an election, there has been a change of government, a very fundamental change of government, and yet there is no election. There is no possibility of democracy in this situation,\u201d Perera said.", "A cake in the likeness of Princess Diana, with sons Prince Harry, left, and Prince William on display during Cake International, The Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating and Baking Show, at the NEC in Birmingham, England, Friday Nov. 2, 2018.

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko)\n\nMOSCOW (AP) \u2014 The leaders of Russia and Cuba vowed Friday to expand what they called their \u201cstrategic\u201d ties and urged the United States to lift its blockade of Cuba.\n\nIn a joint statement issued after their talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban counterpart Miguel Diaz-Canel denounced U.S. \u201cinterference into domestic affairs of sovereign nations\u201d and spoke in support of closer integration between Russia and Latin American nations.\n\nDiaz-Canel, who replaced Raul Castro in April in a historic changing of the guard in Cuba, hailed the \u201cbrotherly\u201d ties between Russia and Cuba and invited Putin to visit next year.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union poured billions of dollars in supplies and subsidies into Cuba, its staunchest Latin American ally. But ties withered after the 1991 Soviet collapse as Russia, hit by an economic meltdown, withdrew its economic aid to Cuba.\n\nPutin, who visited Cuba in 2000 and 2014, has sought to revive ties with the old Caribbean ally.\n\nFollowing the Kremlin talks, Putin and Diaz-Canel vowed to expand political, economic and military ties between Russia and Cuba.\n\nCuba\u2019s defense minister, Leopoldo Cintra Frias, is set to visit Moscow later this month to discuss specific plans for military-technical cooperation.\n\nSergei Storchak, Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister, said Russia could offer Cuba a 38 million-euro ($43 million) loan to help fund its military modernization.\n\nSoviet warships and military aircraft regularly used Cuban bases during the Cold War, and Cuba hosted a Soviet electronic spying outpost in Lourdes, near Havana.\n\nPutin closed the Lourdes intelligence facility in 2001 as he sought to establish warmer ties with the United States during his first presidential term. But U.S.-Russian relations have steadily worsened, plunging to post-Cold War lows after Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, and the Kremlin has sought to rebuild ties with Cuba.\n\nIn remarks apparently directed at the United States, Putin and Diaz-Canel criticized the use of unilateral sanctions as a destabilizing factor in global affairs.\n\nThe U.S. economic embargo, initially imposed in 1958 and subsequently expanded, has remained in place. Russia, in its turn, faced an array of crippling U.S. and EU sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\nPutin said he and Diaz-Canel discussed expanding economic ties, including Russia\u2019s participation in the modernization of Cuban railways.\n\nThe Russian leader also mentioned Russian companies Rosneft and Zarubezhneft tapping for oil off Cuba and a contract for the Inter RAO energy company to build new generator units at a Cuban power plant.", "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Four small earthquakes a few minutes apart shook farmland and wilderness in northern San Benito County, east of Monterey Bay.

(AP) \u2014 Two Marquette residents have filed suit against Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri in relation to a property tax investigation into a Republican U.S. congressman.\n\nThe Mining Journal of Marquette reports that a writ of mandamus was filed in Gogebic County Circuit Court on Oct. 5 to compel Khouri to conduct a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive audit\u201d of 1st Congressional District Rep. Jack Bergman\u2019s eligibility to maintain his current principal residency tax exemption on property he owns in Watersmeet.\n\nMarquette attorneys Brian Bloch and Robert Anderson filed the suit on behalf of Marquette residents William Jorns, a retired psychologist and U.S. Army veteran, and William Davis, who was listed as a Marquette County delegate for the Democratic Party in the August primary election, according to a Marquette County Clerk\u2019s Office document.\n\nThe principal residency exemption, or PRE, exempts homeowners from paying up to 18 mills of the school tax portion of real property taxes.\n\nUnder the Michigan statute a principal residence is identified as \u201cthe one place where a person has his or her true, fixed and permanent home to which, whenever absent he or she intends to return and that shall continue as a principal residence until another principal residence is established.\u201d\n\nThe suit alleges that the state treasurer\u2019s office has not done an in-depth PRE audit, including a comparison of utility usage at Bergman\u2019s Watersmeet Township residence to a home he owns in St. Francisville, Louisiana.\n\nA Michigan Department of Treasury report published on Dec. 28 lists the 2017 property tax rate in Watersmeet Township at 44.94 mills, but with the homestead exemption the tax rate falls to 27.23 mills.\n\nThe difference can mean hundreds or even thousands of dollars shaved off an annual property tax bill. But the dollar amount Bergman is saving is not the point of the suit, Bloch said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are not claiming that Jack Bergman is not following the rules, but that the rules have been written to allow for this type of abuse,\u201d Bloch said. \u201cAs a result, the people of Michigan have been denied their ability to choose their representation in Washington.\u201d\n\nIn cases where the PRE exemption of a property is either being challenged or audited, the department conducting the investigation sends a letter and questionnaire to the owner to verify residency.\n\nA copy of the letter sent from Gogebic County Treasurer Lisa Hewitt to Bergman on Sept. 11, which was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, required Bergman to prove that he is a Michigan resident, the owner or one of the co-owners of this property, occupies the property as his principal residence and he is not claiming a homestead exemption or similar exemption in any other location, whether in Michigan or another state.\n\nBergman confirmed the receipt of the letter during a phone interview on Oct. 17, indicating he provided copies of tax records, utility bills, his driver\u2019s license and copies of canceled checks as proof of residency, and his PRE status at the Watersmeet residence had been upheld.\n\n\u201cI got a letter from the Gogebic County treasury, and they sent me a letter back that said, \u2018We have reviewed all your material, and you\u2019re valid,\u2019\u201d Bergman said. \u201cSo, as far as Gogebic County goes, I met their 30-day guideline.\u201d\n\nBergman said the Watersmeet residence has been his home of record for more than 20 years.\n\n\u201cThis is campaign shenanigans,\u201d Bergman said. \u201cI am an elected representative of the 1st District in Michigan and my home base is here.\u201d\n\nThe Bergmans do meet the basic Michigan Department of Treasury guidelines for proof of residency based on the documents he provided, which included DirecTV bills and five individual We Energies bills ranging from January 2016 to July 2018, he holds a Michigan driver\u2019s license, and is registered to vote in Watersmeet. He also provided his 2018 estimated property tax assessment for his home in St. Francisville, Louisiana, where he does not claim either a PRE or a homestead property tax exemption.\n\nMichigan Department of Treasury Deputy Public Information Officer Ron Leix declined to comment on the case.\n\n\u201cThe Michigan Department of Treasury cannot respond to inquiries about the lawsuit because it\u2019s still in progress,\u201d Liex wrote in an email on Monday.\n\nWhile some counties rely on the state treasury to audit their PRE requests, Gogebic County has opted to audit their own PRE exemptions and have the authority to deny principal residency exemption claims for the current year as well as the three preceding years.\n\nTreasurer Hewitt said the county is overseen by and is periodically audited by the state treasury.\n\nThe writ of mandamus is asking for an in-depth audit of the property\u2019s utility use at the Watersmeet residence versus the utility use at Bergman\u2019s Louisiana home.\n\n\u201cThe best explanation of what the Legislature meant by the term \u201cprincipal residence\u201d comes from the decisions of the highest court in Michigan to decide these cases, being the Michigan Court of Appeals, which has required an assessment of the actual time spent residing in a subject dwelling-measured by utility usage in comparison with another dwelling used by the subject taxpayer,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nPetoskey resident Richard Wiles, who is named in the suit for evidentiary purposes only, launched an investigation into the Watersmeet address as well as a storage facility also owned by Bergman on South Cisco Lake Road after the August 2016 primary election.\n\nWiles said in an email that he began looking into the matter after Bergman defeated Tom Casperson, who, according to Wiles, had raised questions about Bergman\u2019s residency on his campaign Facebook page.\n\nAfter visiting both of the Bergman properties, Wiles reported his findings to the Gogebic County treasurer and to Patrick Huber, the manager of Michigan Department of Treasury Property Exemption Section, the complaint states.\n\nIn response to Wiles\u2019 inquiry, Huber refused to deny the existing PRE on the Bergman cottag because both Jack and Cynthia Bergman \u201care registered to vote and do vote in Watersmeet Township.\u201d\n\nBloch and Roberts contend a 2013 Michigan Court of Appeals ruling in the case of Drew v. County of Cass sets a more stringent standard for property owners claiming PRE exemptions.\n\n\u201cIn his 2016 decision, Mr. Huber failed to consider the pronouncements of the Michigan Court of Appeals that PRE determination should be based on the actual time spent by a landowner residing at a dwelling measured by utility usage rather than on cursory issues, such as where the landowner votes,\u201d the writ states.\n\nA subsequent request for PRE audit was submitted by Anderson to the Gogebic County clerk and Watersmeet Township Assessor on July 25. In an email to Hewitt, he specifically asked that the Bergman PRE claim be investigated using a utility bill comparison.\n\nReferencing Drew vs. County of Cass, Anderson wrote: \u201cThe Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals found in favor of the county because \u2018to accomplish the task (of proving that you occupy a home as your true, fixed permanent home) there would be substantial use of utilities.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnderson\u2019s request included an affidavit from Jorns, who, after visiting Watersmeet Township five times since 2016, \u201cprovides substantial investigative evidence that Jack and Cynthia Bergman do not in fact have any significant ties to Watersmeet Township and do not maintain a principal residence anywhere in Watersmeet Township.\u201d\n\nThe Gogebic County treasurer has issued PRE denials in the recent past. An MLive article updated on Sept. 28, 2017, shows that the county issued 51 PRE denials in 2016, 47 of which were because the property was not owner-occupied.\n\nWhen asked about a possible comparison of utility usage between his Watersmeet and St. Francisville residences, Bergman said his goal is transparency.\n\n\u201cI have no problem with anyone shining a light on all my activities. I am perfectly happy to stand in the spotlight,\u201d Bergman said. \u201cFor anyone to impune my integrity, it\u2019s deceitful and shame on them. We know better than that in this country.\u201d\n\nBloch said the case is less about politics and more about doing the right thing by Michigan residents and school districts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about counties with multimillion-dollar summer homes getting (bilked) out of property taxes,\u201d Bloch said, \u201cand fixing our broken and corrupt system where rules are being written by the rich to benefit the rich.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Mining Journal, http://www.miningjournal.net", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in restive southwestern Cameroon, chopping off their fingers because the men had defied an order to stay away from the farms, authorities said Friday.\n\nThe attack is the second of its kind in less than a week by the militants, who have responded violently to a government crackdown on separatist activities in the English-speaking parts of the country.\n\nDavid Epie, a 43-year-old worker at a rubber plantation, says armed men attacked him and three of his co-workers on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cI do not know the fate of one of our workers who tried to escape and was shot on the leg,\u201d said Epie, who lost several fingers.

English speakers make up 20 percent of the population and have long complained of being marginalized by the French majority.\n\nThose grievances erupted into conflict in 2016 when militant separatists took up arms following a series of protests by teachers and lawyers who cited discrimination in their fields of employment.\n\nThe militants have vowed to destabilize the English-speaking regions of Cameroon to win independence for the areas. Earlier this week an American missionary died in another restive part of the country after he was shot in the head amid fighting between armed separatists and soldiers in northwestern Cameroon.\n\nThe separatists consider the state-run banana, palm oil and rubber plantations in southwestern Cameroon to be legitimate targets. Vehicles, tractors, buildings and warehouses owned by the state\u2019s Cameroon Development Corporation have been torched and some staff members have been kidnapped.\n\nMeanwhile, 10 separatist leaders appeared in court Thursday in the capital of Yaounde, the first time they have been seen in public in Cameroon since their arrests 10 months ago in neighboring Nigeria. The suspects include Ayuk Tabe Julius, the man who proclaimed himself president of what he called the English-speaking republic of Ambazonia.\n\nThe Cameroonian government has called them terrorists and said they would answer for their crimes under a 2014 anti-terrorism law which says that anyone who uses weapons against the government will face a military tribunal.

Miller's new standup special, \"Fake News _ Real Jokes,\" debuts online Tuesday, Nov. 6. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Dennis Miller is embarking on a journey of reinvention, one starting with a quick U-turn from his new standup special.\n\n\u201cFake News-Real Jokes,\u201d out Tuesday on Amazon, Google, iTunes and other streaming platforms and as an album, will be followed by a self-described \u201cmental exercise\u201d to see what it\u2019s like to ease away from political humor and try something on the lighter side.\n\nMiller cites the example of Orson Bean, 90, the droll actor-comedian who was a game-show and late-night staple in the Johnny Carson \u201cTonight\u201d era, and whom Miller calls a friend.\n\nThe simple goal is \u201cjust be funny and not talk about the issues as much,\u201d said Miller, who turns 65 on Saturday.\n\nThat might be easier said than done for a man who made his name as a smart-aleck \u201cWeekend Update\u201d anchor on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d from 1985-91 and later gained favor with conservatives sharing his post-Sept. 11 perspective in his act and in \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d appearances. He now hosts a podcast and has a syndicated radio feature.\n\nMiller, who describes himself as \u201csocially liberal, fiscally conservative,\u201d mused that Hollywood might be eyeing a makeover of its own after the midterm elections. The five-time Emmy winner also discussed his work M.O. in an interview with The Associated Press and showed he couldn\u2019t resist tweaking an activist-actress. Remarks were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nAssociated Press: It\u2019s been several years since your last standup special was released. Why is this the right time for a new one?\n\nMiller: Well, this is my ninth, and I\u2019d like to do 10 in my life, I think that\u2019d be good. Nobody\u2019s going to touch George (Carlin, who did 14). But if I did 10 I\u2019d be close to second and that would mean something to me. Specials are hard to do \u2014 once you\u2019ve done one, you\u2019re fried.\n\nAP: What is it about the process of honing a routine that takes it out of you?\n\nMiller: I don\u2019t get to hone as much as I used to because \u201cused to\u201d would be on the road 100 days a year when you were young, or in comedy clubs because you live in L.A. I don\u2019t live near L.A. and I don\u2019t go out that much anymore. So I have to listen to it at home, read it at home and then try to find myself a comedy club or small venue where I can go up around five times over the course of a weekend. Then I try to put a half-dozen dates together in theaters.\n\nAP: I\u2019ve heard you try out jokes on Twitter.\n\nMiller: I put a joke up once, that for Trump to receive a welcome in California right now he\u2019d have to come in illegally, and it got 50,000 likes. Well, that\u2019s not akin to laughter, obviously, once 50,000 people do that like thing you think I\u2019ve got a good joke there.\n\nAP: Are you frustrated when you finish a special and there\u2019s an event that might be a tempting target, such as Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings?\n\nMiller: Too much of the country is so fractious right now that I\u2019m not as interested in it as some people are. And certainly in the postmortems, it doesn\u2019t sound like joke central to me. It\u2019s almost like social media is a speed trap waiting for people to have some sort of wisdom about an event that\u2019s highly polarizing. And then at least half the country jumps on the other half, and that seems tedious to me. I would say I was surprised to see that Alyssa Milano was back on TV.\n\nAP: You said we live in a time when people on the left keep a \u201cpretty tight watch\u201d on what\u2019s being said. Does that view make you more cautious in writing your material?\n\nMiller: I did a special and I\u2019m proud of it. I thought it was funny, and I dabbled in the real world. But I think you better make two-thirds of the special just generically funny, funny for all, and then you can put your opinions out there. I\u2019ve been on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 and (audiences) know me as a current-events guy, so you have to say something. But there are certain jokes now I would excise from a show because you\u2019d be in a complete fecal storm? Yeah, there are.\n\nAP: There are few conservative voices heard in the entertainment industry. Why do you think that is?\n\nMiller: I don\u2019t know the reason, but I know the actuality. There\u2019s a decent chance that Donald Trump is going to be the president for the next six years. Some people are going to say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s impossible.\u2019 OK, go ahead and say that, but I\u2019m telling you there\u2019s a chance. You might have to find a counterintuitive way to (approach) Donald Trump if he\u2019s the president for the next, what, 2,200 days.\n\nAP: What are the odds of that happening in Hollywood?\n\nMiller: I think a lot of people on the left think there\u2019s a blue wave coming on early November, and we\u2019ll see. And I think the day after that, people might start adjusting their business models if in fact there is not a big blue wave.\n\n___\n\nLynn Elber can be reached at lelber@ap.org and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/lynnelber.", "ROCHESTER, N.Y.

And I love my family.\u201d\n\nRichard Kirk said his father has always been a good man who lived his life according to solid principles.\n\n\u201cHe was a great father who was very interested in his family,\u201d he explained. \u201cHe was a great worker, a great supporter of his family and a great member of The Church (of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) all of his life.\u201d\n\nFor much of his professional career, the elder Kirk worked as a credit manager for Fuller Paints in Salt Lake City, San Francisco and Boise. The family eventually returned to Utah in 1960 where they have remained ever since.\n\n\u201cShe packed him a lunch every day for work,\u201d he added.

Jon Tester. The actor, known for his portrayal of a character nicknamed \"The Dude\" in \"The Big Lebowski,\" is arguably the biggest name to appear on Tester's behalf this election season as the candidate seeks to distance himself from the Democratic Party mainstream. (Rachel Leathe /Bozeman Daily Chronicle via AP)\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Montana Senate candidate Matt Rosendale may not be a household name, but he\u2019s surrounded on the campaign trail by President Donald Trump and other big-name Republicans like Vice President Mike Pence, Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul.\n\nHis opponent, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester? He\u2019s got \u201cThe Dude.\u201d\n\nArguably the biggest name to appear on Tester\u2019s behalf this election season has been actor and part-time Montana resident Jeff Bridges, who played a character known as The Dude in the cult classic film \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s no slight by key Democrats, who steered clear of the race despite control of the closely divided Senate potentially at stake. Rather, it is Tester\u2019s calculated effort to distance himself from mainstream party figures and stoke his image as a centrist still rooted in the small agricultural community of Big Sandy where he farms.\n\nRepublicans have been throwing all they have at flipping the seat, helping drive spending to record levels. Trump will campaign for Rosendale in Montana for a fourth time Saturday \u2014 the most visits to the state by any sitting president. He\u2019s aiming to personally oversee the two-term incumbent\u2019s defeat in retribution for derailing his nominee for Veterans Affairs secretary.\n\n\u201cThe headwinds are greater for Tester than they have been in the past,\u201d said former Rep. Pat Williams, a Montana Democrat who served from 1979 to 1997. \u201cTester\u2019s time in Washington is being used by (Trump supporters) as a political weakness, when always before, Montanans have understood that time in Washington is a political strength.\u201d\n\nTrump is certain to lash out at Tester during the weekend rally in the college town of Bozeman. Two weeks ago in another Montana visit, the president said Tester was part of a \u201cDemocratic mob\u201d that \u201cviciously\u201d went after former White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who withdrew from consideration for the VA post in April after the senator released allegations of drunken behavior, overprescribing prescription drugs and fostering a hostile work environment.\n\nFacing all the GOP\u2019s firepower, Tester has stuck with the populist approach that worked for him in his 2006 and 2012 elections. He won both narrowly in a state that\u2019s increasingly tilting Republican. Closing in on the end of another tight race, the question is whether the strategy will withstand Trump\u2019s effort to vanquish Tester.\n\nBridges, an Academy Award winner who owns a ranch in Montana\u2019s Paradise Valley, plugged Tester at a get-out-the-vote rally last month at Montana State University in Bozeman.\n\nFor the standing-room-only event, the actor cast aside the signature sunglasses and chenille bathrobe worn by The Dude \u2014 a chronic pot smoker and bowler in \u201cThe Big Lebowski.\u201d In their place, Bridges donned a \u201cMontana Abides\u201d T-shirt, a nod to his movie character\u2019s favorite saying, \u201cThe Dude abides.\u201d\n\nTester later posted a video of the actor describing the Democrat as a \u201cseven-fingered dirt farmer\u201d in reference to Tester\u2019s life as a grain farmer and the three fingers he lost as a child in a meat grinder.\n\nTester also got a boost from a benefit concert by Pearl Jam , whose bassist is a childhood friend of the lawmaker\u2019s, and Cecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood.\n\nA similar dynamic is playing out in Senate races in Arizona and West Virginia.\n\nArizona Republican Rep. Martha McSally has campaigned alongside a list of GOP luminaries \u2014 Trump, former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and Gov. Doug Ducey. Her Democratic opponent, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, has fashioned herself as a centrist who doesn\u2019t follow party leaders, leaving her running basically alone.\n\nIn West Virginia, Sen. Joe Manchin has generally shied away from big-name Democrats, instead using sports personalities in ads to defend his seat in a state that Trump won by 43 percentage points. His Republican challenger, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, has appeared with Trump and Pence multiple times.\n\nRepublicans nevertheless have tried to associate the three senators with Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Attack ads by conservative political groups that have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the races have reinforced that message.\n\nInstead of engaging directly over the jabs, Tester and his supporters have pushed a counter-narrative that stresses his willingness to collaborate with the president and Republicans, particularly on veterans\u2019 health issues. He says he won\u2019t give ground on privacy protections, health care and abortion rights.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about who can represent Montana, who understands the rural nature of this state,\u201d Tester said in an interview. He added that Rosendale was \u201cjust going to go there and rubber-stamp\u201d Trump\u2019s proposals.\n\nRosendale, a former state lawmaker elected in 2016 as Montana\u2019s state auditor and insurance commissioner, has parroted Trump\u2019s lines of attack. He rails against Tester\u2019s opposition to Republican-sponsored tax cuts and Supreme Court picks and his treatment of Jackson.\n\n\u201cThese are things that the president is putting forward that I certainly support and then again that Jon has opposed every step of the way,\u201d Rosendale said. \u201cWe are turning back the clock of time and going to have a Supreme Court that simply upholds the Constitution and does not try to pervert it for some new progressive agenda.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "DPS says vehicles in freeway crash may have been racing\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Part of Interstate 17 remains closed in northwest Phoenix because of a crash that the state Department of Public Safety says may have involved vehicles racing on the freeway.\n\nOfficials say the closure of southbound I-17 between Northern and Southern Avenues because of the crash that occurred at about 2:30 a.m. is expected to last through the Friday morning commute.\n\nTrooper Kameron Lee says two of three vehicles involved in the crash may have been racing prior to the collision and that one of the three vehicles rolled, ejecting the female driver who has life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe frontage road in the closure area remains open but the Arizona Department of Transportation advised drivers to take alternative routes such as State Route 51.", "ALLENDALE, Mich.

The killing prompted critics to urge an end to American arms sales to the kingdom and a reappraisal of U.S. military support for the Saudi-led Arab coalition that has been bombing Iranian-supported Houthi rebels, sometimes at the expense of killing civilians.\n\nIn March 2015, the Saudi-led coalition unleased a full-scale military campaign against Iran-allied Houthi rebels who had captured most of Yemen including the capital, Sanaa, a few months earlier. The rebels pushed the internationally recognized government out of the country.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people have been killed.

Rival Chevron Corp. reported a doubling of quarterly profit, to $4 billion.\n\nCiti analysts said Exxon showed improved results Friday in both its production and refining segments, which \u201chelps support the case that the business is turning.\u201d\n\nOil companies are being boosted by rising crude prices. Brent, the benchmark for international oil, is up about 16 percent from a year ago, even with a dip in the last month, and the U.S. standard, West Texas intermediate, is up about 13 percent.\n\nShares of Exxon Mobil Corp. rose $1.28 to close at $81.95.\n\nWhile profit soared, Exxon\u2019s production continued to slide. Overall output declined 2.4 percent compared with last year\u2019s third quarter largely because of falling production of natural gas in the United States and Europe. That continued a theme of the past couple years, in which the oil giant has struggled to maintain its production pace.\n\nStill, it was an improvement over weak second-quarter production. And it was better than analysts expected, breaking a string of six straight misses on quarterly production, according to CFRA Research.\n\nExxon, like other oil giants, cut investment in big projects after prices began to collapse in mid-2014. It also suffered setbacks on some projects. Earlier this year, Exxon dropped a major oil-exploration deal in Russia after U.S. sanctions against Russia prevented the company from expanding the project.\n\nAs oil prices have rebounded, Exxon has increased capital spending. The company is upbeat about its prospects off the coast of Guyana, where it has drilled several exploratory wells, and Brazil, where it has increased its stake in an offshore basin to about 2.3 million acres. ExxonMobil will be the operator and own a 64 percent stake in the Brazilian block.\n\nAt home, Exxon has stepped up activity in the oil-rich Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said the company expects to increase output over time as it increases drilling in the Permian and starts pumping oil and gas from new projects.\n\nExxon\u2019s drilling in the U.S. is increasingly \u201cunconventional\u201d in nature, using hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to pull more oil and gas from shale formations underground. The shale revolution, as it is called, has pushed U.S. production to record levels and made the United States the world\u2019s leading oil producer, ahead of both Russia and Saudi Arabia.\n\nUnconventional drilling is more expensive, however, and some analysts believe that shale output will be under pressure if a very recent dip in oil prices continues.\n\nThe U.S. benchmark has retreated from around $76 to about $63 since early October. If oil falls much further, energy analyst Phil Flynn said Friday, \u201cyou can forget about increasing shale output in the future. Most shale oil producers were having a hard time making money when prices were above $70.\u201d\n\nSenior vice president Jack Williams told analysts that as new projects come online, Exxon will consider selling other oil and gas assets in North America that \u201cmight be worth more to somebody else than it is to us.\u201d He declined to name facilities that might be sold or say how quickly that could happen.\n\nExxon, based in Irving, Texas, earned $1.46 per share. Unlike many companies, Exxon does not adjust its earnings per share to exclude one-time gains such as the sale of about 1,000 Esso service stations in Germany. It received proceeds from that sale on the last day of the quarter, part of $1.5 billion in asset sales during the period. The average forecast among seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.21 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 25 percent to $76.61 billion in the period. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $72.45 billion.\n\nExxon shares have fallen 2 percent since the beginning of the year, compared with a 2 percent rise in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index in that time.", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 A Baltimore television station says its chief meteorologist is fine after collapsing on air.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun reports that WBFF Fox 45 posted a picture of Vytas Reid holding a Gatorade bottle Thursday on Facebook.

Morton, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Record imports expanded the U.S. trade deficit for the fourth straight month in September, as the politically sensitive trade deficit in goods with China hit a record.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Friday that the gap between what America sells and what it buys abroad climbed to $54 billion, up 1.3 percent from $53.3 billion in August and the highest level since February.\n\nImports climbed 1.5 percent to a record $266.6 billion, led by an influx of telecommunications equipment and clothing. Exports also rose 1.5 percent to $212.6 billion, led by increases in shipments of civilian aircraft and petroleum products.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made a priority of reducing America\u2019s huge, persistent trade deficits. Despite his tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and on Chinese goods, the deficit so far this year is up 10.1 percent to $445.2 billion. The goods deficit with China rose by 4.3 percent in September to a record $40.2 billion.\n\nChina and other countries have counterpunched with import taxes on American products. U.S. exports of soybeans, targeted for retaliatory tariffs by China, dropped 29.4 percent in September.\n\nTrump sees the lopsided trade numbers as a sign of U.S. economic weakness and as the result of bad trade deals and abusive practices by U.S. trading partners, especially China.\n\nMainstream economists view trade deficits as the result of an economic reality unlikely to yield to changes in trade policy: Americans buy more than they produce, and imports fill the gap. The strong U.S. economy also encourages Americans to buy more foreign products.\n\nU.S. exports are also hurt by the American dollar\u2019s role as the world\u2019s currency. The dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions. That means the dollar is persistently strong, raising prices of U.S. products and putting American companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets.\n\nIn September, the U.S. ran a $23.2 billion surplus in the trade of services such as banking and tourism. But that was offset by a $77.2 billion deficit in the trade of goods such as cellphones and cars.", "FILE- This Oct. 3, 2018, file photo shows the logo of Tesla Model 3 at the Auto show in Paris.

It\u2019s also key to the company\u2019s cash flow and pledge to make quarterly net profits into the future. In 2017 and this year, Tesla had trouble producing the cars, drawing a lawsuit from investors who said they were misled by CEO Elon Musk\u2019s production targets.\n\nEarly last year the Palo Alto, California, company announced plans to produce up to 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. But the company fell far short due to problems with automation at its Fremont, California, factory, making just 793 in the last week of 2017 and 2,700 for the entire year. It didn\u2019t hit the 5,000-a-week target until June 2018.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the FBI is doing a criminal investigation into whether Tesla misled investors by overstating Model 3 production forecasts.\n\nTesla Inc. says in the filing that to its knowledge, no government agency in an ongoing investigation has determined that it did anything wrong.\n\nA company spokesman wouldn\u2019t comment beyond the filing. Neither the Justice Department nor the SEC would comment Friday.\n\nIn September, Tesla settled a civil lawsuit by the SEC over tweets by Musk that funding was in place to take the company private.

On Friday, Nov. 2, the U.S. government issues the October jobs report. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. businesses ramped up hiring in October, and wages rose by the largest year-over-year amount in nearly a decade, a combination that is pulling a rising share of Americans into the job market.\n\nIn the final major economic report before Tuesday\u2019s congressional elections, the government said Friday that U.S. employers added a robust 250,000 jobs in October. The unemployment rate stayed at a five-decade low of 3.7 percent.\n\nHealthy economic growth is spurring employers to hire at a rapid pace that shows no sign of flagging even with the economy in its 10th year of expansion. With the supply of unemployed dwindling, companies appear to be finally putting up generous enough pay raises to attract and retain employees.\n\nAverage hourly wages rose 3.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the fastest annual gain since 2009.\n\nStill, inflation has picked up a bit in the past year as well, eating away at some of those pay raises. And the increase in wages last month also partly reflected a one-time drop in pay a year ago because of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nEven so, October\u2019s increase suggests that after a decade of anemic growth, wage growth is picking up. At the same time, an influx of new job-seekers increased the proportion of Americans with jobs to its highest level since 2009.\n\nThe economy has now added jobs for 97 straight months, a record. That steady hiring has helped reduce the unemployment rate for Latinos to 4.4 percent, a record low. Teenage unemployment dropped last month to 11.9 percent, the lowest since 1969. And the proportion of Americans without a high school degree who are working has reached the highest point on records dating from 1992.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d said Sun Wong Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics. \u201cEvidently, the word has spread that there are good jobs to be had at decent wages.\u201d\n\nCheyenne Mauzy of Springfield, Missouri, had held out for higher pay when she started job hunting in June. She felt she needed a high enough hourly wage to make up for the cost of child care for her three children.\n\n\u201cThere was a minimum we had to make,\u201d Mauzy, 28, said, referring to calculations she made with her husband. \u201cI had to bring home enough on top of child care. If I am just going to work to pay for our child care, I should be our child care.\u201d\n\nIn late August, she took a job at a hospital in Springfield that pays $11.22 an hour.\n\nBecky Frankiewicz, president of staffing firm ManpowerGroup North America, said companies are trying a variety of strategies to fill jobs. Many retailers are removing the label \u201cseasonal\u201d from their job postings and looking for permanent workers instead. Others are dropping their requirements for a college degree.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely see employers getting more and more creative about ways to get people in,\u201d Frankiewicz said.\n\nBy some measures, consumers are the most confident they have been in 18 years, and their spending is propelling brisk economic growth. The economic expansion is now the second-longest on record, and October marked the 97th straight month of hiring, a record streak.\n\nStrength in their customer demand has been a key factor leading companies to steadily add workers. Though economists have predicted that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there\u2019s no sign of that happening yet.\n\nStill, the latest month of healthy job growth might not tip many votes in the midterm elections. Polls have suggested that while Americans generally approve of the economy\u2019s performance, that sentiment hasn\u2019t necessarily broadened support for President Donald Trump or for Republican congressional candidates.\n\nThe strong job growth and bigger pay increases will likely encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising short-term interest rates. Most analysts expect the Fed to resume its rate hikes in December.\n\nHurricane Michael, which slammed into the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia last month, had no discernible effect on the jobs data, the government said. Still, October\u2019s outsize gain might have reflected, in part, a rebound from September, when Hurricane Florence depressed job growth.\n\nHiring in October was strong in higher- and middle-income jobs. Professional and business services, which include engineers, architects and accountants, gained 35,000 jobs. Manufacturers added 32,000 after two months of smaller gains, defying fears that Trump\u2019s trade fights would slow hiring in that sector. Construction companies added 30,000 positions.\n\nRetailers barely hired, adding just 2,400 positions, possibly reflecting the Sears bankruptcy. Restaurants and hotels gained 33,000, most of them lower-paying.\n\nIn the July-September quarter, consumer spending grew by the most in four years and helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate. That growth followed a 4.2 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter. Combined, the two quarters produced the strongest six-month stretch of growth in four years.\n\nHousing remains a weak spot in the economy, with sales of existing homes having fallen for six straight months as mortgage rates have risen to nearly 5 percent. But slower sales have started to limit home price increases, which had been running at more than twice the pace of wage gains.\n\nAlthough pay increases can help boost spending and propel the economy\u2019s growth, they can also lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs. That trend, in turn, can accelerate inflation.\n\nSo far, though, inflation remains in check. The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred price measure rose 2 percent in September compared with a year earlier, slightly lower than the year-over-year increase in August.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that teenage unemployment fell to the lowest since 1969 last month, not the lowest on record.", "FILE - In this Jan. 26, 2009 file photo, from left: James Dean, JoAnn Taylor, Thomas Winslow, and Debra Shelden, who were among five people pardoned for the 1985 murder of Helen Wilson, applaud during a reception held for them in Lincoln, Neb.

Nelson ruled Thursday that the liability policies Gage County purchased in 1989 do not cover the county\u2019s mishandling of the so-called Beatrice Six case, according to the Lincoln Journal Star .\n\nGage County faces a $28.1 million federal judgment after it lost a lawsuit filed by the six people who were wrongfully convicted and served a combined 75 years in prison for the murder of 68-year-old Helen Wilson.\n\nThe six were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2008 and won their lawsuit in 2016. A federal appeals court rejected Gage County\u2019s appeal earlier this year, leaving local officials with few options other than paying the judgment.\n\nThe policies in question were purchased through Employer\u2019s Mutual Casualty. Attorneys for the county asked a judge to determine whether a series of liability insurance policies would pay all or part of the damages or legal fees from the case.\n\nNelson ruled in October that insurance policies Gage County carried through the Nebraska Intergovernmental Risk Management Association, a risk-sharing pool, were not in effect when the six were arrested. That coverage went into effect in 1997. On Thursday, Nelson reached the same conclusion on the Employer\u2019s Mutual Casualty policies, which carried the county\u2019s insurance from Feb. 2, 1989, until Feb. 2, 1990.\n\nThe state\u2019s appellate courts have not yet heard the issue.\n\nNelson said the language of the Employer\u2019s Mutual Casualty policy excluded \u201cany and all professional services,\u201d but did not define what those services were. Attorneys for Gage County argued that law enforcement was an occupation, not a professional service, but Nelson said Nebraska case law defines professional acts and services as those requiring \u201cspecial learning or attainments of some kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe allegations in the Beatrice Six complaints involve \u2018decision-making based on an officer\u2019s training and experience,\u2019\u201d Nelson wrote. \u201cThe Gage County sheriff and his deputies investigated the rape and murder of Helen Wilson by using law enforcement\u2019s specialized decision-making process.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Two colleges in Georgia are being sued, accused of failing to provide adequate security at a homecoming celebration two years ago where several people were injured.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported five people have sued Morehouse and neighboring Spelman colleges, where an attorney says a scuffle started in a crowded tailgating area.

Ball, a passenger in the stopped vehicle, had run away, with Boykin chasing him. Police later found a 9 mm handgun near Ball\u2019s body. The shooting prompted protests in Columbus, and the City Council fired Boykin soon after. Council members said Boykin violated policy because he failed to activate his body camera before or during the incident and made inappropriate social media posts in its aftermath.

A DEA report obtained by The Associated Press shows heroin, fentanyl and other opioids continue to be the highest drug threat in the nation. The National Drug Threat Assessment will be released publicly later Friday. Azar said earlier this month that overdose deaths have now begun to level off. But he cautioned it is too soon to declare victory. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Drug overdose deaths hit the highest level ever recorded in the United States last year, with an estimated 200 people dying per day, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Most of that was the result of a record number of opioid-related deaths.\n\nPreliminary figures show more than 72,000 people died in 2017 from drug overdoses across the country. About a week ago, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said overdose deaths, while still slowly rising, were beginning to level off, citing figures from late last year and early this year.\n\nThe DEA\u2019s National Drug Threat Assessment, which was released Friday, shows that heroin, fentanyl and other opioids continue to be the highest drug threat in the nation. But federal officials are concerned that methamphetamine and cocaine are being seen at much higher levels in areas that haven\u2019t historically been hotspots for those drugs. The DEA is also worried that people are exploiting marijuana legalization to traffic cannabis into the illicit market or to states that don\u2019t have medicinal or recreational-use marijuana laws, according to the report.\n\nThe preliminary data also showed 49,060 people died from opioid-related overdose deaths, a rise from the reported 42,249 opioid overdose deaths in 2016.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has declared the U.S. opioid crisis as a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d and just last week pledged to put an \u201cextremely big dent\u201d in the scourge of drug addiction.\n\nFatal heroin overdoses rose nationwide between 2015 and 2016, with a nearly 25 percent increase in the Northeast and more than 22 percent in the South. Most of the heroin sold in the U.S. is being trafficked from Mexico, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers seize the most amount of heroin along the Mexico border, near San Diego, California, the report said.\n\nFentanyl and other related opioids, which tend to be cheaper and much more potent than heroin, remain one of the biggest concerns for federal drug agents.\n\nThe DEA has said China is a main source of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that have been flooding the U.S. market. China has pushed back against the characterization, and U.S. officials have stressed they work closely with their Chinese counterparts as they try to stem the flow of drugs.\n\nLegislation that Trump signed last week will add treatment options and force the U.S. Postal Service to screen overseas packages for fentanyl.\n\nAzar said in a speech last week that toward the end of 2017 and through the beginning of this year the number of drug overdose deaths \u201chas begun to plateau.\u201d However, he was not indicating that deaths were going down, but that they appear to be rising at a slower rate than previously seen.\n\nLast month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released preliminary figures that appear to show a slowdown in overdose deaths from December to March. In that period, the figures show that the pace of the increase over the previous 12 months has slowed from 10 percent to 3 percent, according to the preliminary CDC figures.\n\nEven if a slowdown is underway, no one is questioning the fact that the nation is dealing with the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in its history. While prescription opioid and heroin deaths appear to be leveling off, deaths involving fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamines are on the rise, according to CDC data.\n\nThe DEA\u2019s report also noted that methamphetamine is making its way into communities where the drug normally wasn\u2019t heavily used, the report said. Chronic use of meth, a highly addictive stimulant, can cause paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations and delusions, studies have shown.\n\nAs the government enacted laws that limited access to cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine \u2014 the ingredient used to cook meth with other household chemicals \u2014 or required the medications to be placed behind pharmacy counters, officials discovered the number of meth labs began to drop.\n\nBut the DEA has found the gap is being filled by Mexican and Latin American drug cartels that had primarily dabbled in heroin and cocaine trafficking. A saturated market on the West Coast is now driving the cartels to peddle methamphetamine into the Northeast, using the same routes they use for heroin and other drugs.\n\nOfficials also warn that because of more cocaine production in South American countries including Colombia, they expect to see larger shipments at the Mexican border.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Balsamo on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1 .\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the preliminary data indicated there were 72,000 drug overdose deaths, not specifically opioid-related overdose deaths, and that Azar spoke last month, not this month.", "FILE - In this Thursday, Aug. 30, 2018 file photo, Father Pierre Vignon holds a letter in Saint-Martin-en-Vercors, France.
