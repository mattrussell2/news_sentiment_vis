It\u2019s my job to run a guy over, not let one guy tackle you and after (breaking free), I did.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s what happened in the immediate aftermath that the Panthers believe speaks volumes about their team and the bond Ollison and Hall have formed over the last four years while taking turns atop the depth chart. Ollison\u2019s record-breaking sprint broke the previous record of 92 yards set by Hall set last season against Duke. And Hall couldn\u2019t have been happier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he got it,\u201d said Hall after running for 186 yards and a touchdown of his own on Senior Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing because he deserves it for everything he\u2019s done for this university.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers (6-4, 5-1 ACC) rolled up a school-record 654 total yards, 492 coming on the ground, the second-most ever given up by the Hokies (4-5, 3-3).\n\n\u201cObviously, we had trouble and they ran the ball awfully well,\u201d Virginia Tech head coach Justin Fuente said. \u201cKind of a weird deal ... we didn\u2019t play as well as we would\u2019ve liked to.\u201d\n\nRyan Willis threw for 231 yards and three touchdowns for the Hokies (4-5, 3-3), two of them to Eric Kumah, but Virginia Tech\u2019s defense offered little resistance. A season that began with such promise now finds the Hokies needing to win each of their final two games if they want to extend their bowl streak to 26 seasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not foremost in my mind,\u201d Fuente said. \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of other things to worry about right now.\u201d\n\nPitt\u2019s concerns are far different. The team that found itself floundering at 2-3 at the end of September after getting blown out by Central Florida now needs to win just one of its final two games to earn a trip to the ACC title game on the first Saturday in December.\n\n\u201cI know everyone wanted to jump ship after that (UCF) game but there was no doubt in my mind,\u201d Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett said. \u201cWe showed it with our play and how confident we are in each other.\u201d\n\nDespite the stakes, the Panthers insisted they were focused on avenging a 20-14 loss at Virginia Tech last November. Pitt had four chances from just outside the goal line in the final seconds to pull out the victory at Lane Stadium only to get stopped short, a setback that ultimately prevented the Panthers from earning a bowl bid.\n\nStill, Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi said he wasn\u2019t worried about his team\u2019s ability to deliver if put in a similar spot, and the Panthers spent four quarters putting on a clinic. Hall and Ollison spent most of the afternoon roaring through gaping holes and responding in the second half whenever Virginia Tech attempted to get back in it.\n\n\u201cWhatever we wanted, we got,\u201d Pickett said. \u201cSo it was a good day.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVirginia Tech: The Hokies don\u2019t appear interested in tackling anybody. Defensive coordinator Bud Foster hoped his young group would have learned after getting run over in losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College. Instead it was more of the same. Pitt\u2019s offensive line bullied Virginia Tech on a day the Panthers averaged 13.9 yards per play.\n\nPitt: The Panthers have developed a hard-earned reputation for stumbling when given an opportunity to produce a true breakthrough moment. It looked like the latest edition of \u201cPitt-ing\u201d might come in the second quarter when Pickett fumbled going into the end zone, Virginia Tech recovered for a touchback and then went down and scored to draw within 17-7. This time, however, the Panthers didn\u2019t panic. Pickett directed two touchdown drives before the end of the first half to put the Panthers up 31-7 at the break. The Hokies never drew closer than 16 the rest of the way.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nVirginia Tech: Welcomes Miami to Lane Stadium next Saturday.\n\nPitt: Travels to Wake Forest next Saturday in the first meeting between the two schools since Pitt joined the ACC in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson looks to pass against Rutgers during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Piscataway, N.J.

The Wolverines took the field on a chilly night in front of thousands of fans in blue-and-maize winter hats and jackets who turned Rutgers into a Big House East.\n\nMichigan\u2019s win was never in doubt \u2014 it was a 38 1/2-point favorite and had outscored Rutgers 162-30 over their last three meetings. Michigan\u2019s 78-0 win two years ago in Piscataway was perhaps the most horrifying defeat of Rutgers\u2019 149 seasons.\n\nThe only upset Saturday came in the total time it took Michigan to score. The Wolverines didn\u2019t take the lead until Higdon\u2019s 1-yard run with 45 seconds left in the first quarter.\n\nRutgers tied it at 7 when Isaih Pacheco took off for an 80-yard TD run, the longest rushing score for a freshman in program history. He finished with 142 yards on 16 carries.\n\nA few thousand Rutgers fans were suddenly pumped, but the threat of a monster upset was quickly wiped out. Higdon gave Michigan a 14-7 lead on a 1-yard run, and Patterson hit Collins for a 36-yard score. Collins was comically open \u2014 the Rutgers students in the end-zone seats were closer to him than any defender \u2014 and it was clear at that point the Wolverines were rolling.\n\nPatterson continued to play like the quarterback the Wolverines have been missing in search of a national title for the Jim Harbaugh era. Patterson, named a finalist this week for the Davey O\u2019Brien award, is on the board at Las Vegas with the third-best odds to win the Heisman Trophy. He didn\u2019t necessarily play like the best player in college football against Rutgers, but the Mississippi transfer didn\u2019t have to be at his best.\n\nPatterson has thrown a touchdown pass to seven receivers this season and No. 7 was Oliver Martin in the third quarter. Martin\u2019s 16-yard haul was his first career touchdown.\n\nPatterson had his fifth three-touchdown game of the season when he found Collins again for a 10-yard score and a 35-7 lead.\n\n\u201cThat was a really tough night to throw the ball,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt reminded me of my days back in Soldier Field playing in some of those windy conditions. He made some throws that were just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nMichigan waved its oversized \u201cM\u2033 flag, and Rutgers fans said goodbye as they flocked toward the exits.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably playing as good as any team in the country,\u201d Rutgers coach Chris Ash said.\n\nPatterson again got a boost in the backfield from Higdon, who ran for 42 yards and became the first Michigan running back to top 1,000 yards rushing since Denard Robinson in 2012.\n\nChris Evans had a 61-yard touchdown run in the fourth for a 42-7 lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we gave up the long run at the end,\u201d Ash said.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMichigan: The Wolverines are the only undefeated Big Ten team in conference play and are looking for their first conference title since 2004. Their first national championship since 1997 certainly remains within reach.\n\nRutgers: Artur Sitkowski had a 16-yard pass completion in the third quarter to give Rutgers 16 yards passing. That\u2019s how bad the Scarlet Knights were in their toughest test to date. The only number more impossible to believe than the 0 in the yards passing column at halftime was the announced crowd of 43,786 in the stands.\n\nCALLING FOR BACKUP\n\nWith the game out of hand, Michigan gave backup quarterback Joe Milton some snaps.\n\nINJURY LIST\n\nMichigan cornerback Lavert Hill was treated for a possible concussion.\n\nWHO ARE YOU?\n\nHarbaugh might need a scorecard the next time he refers to Ash.\n\n\u201cRob does a really good job with them,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMichigan: Head home to play the plucky Hoosiers.\n\nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights host No. 21 Penn State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim (24) runs against Purdue defensive back Brennan Thieneman (38) in the second quarter of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Andy Clayton-King)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Known for his catchphrases, Minnesota coach P.J. Fleck had one for his defense that he repeated often in the week after firing defensive coordinator Robb Smith: sound, simple fast.\n\nThe Gophers\u2019 maligned defense looked each part as it held Purdue to season-lows in yards and points for a 41-10 win against the Boilermakers in the cold and snow on Saturday.\n\nQuarterback Seth Green had a touchdown rushing and passing, and redshirt freshman Mohamed Ibrahim ran for 156 yards for Minnesota, which played its first game under interim defensive coordinator Joe Rossi.\n\nThe Gophers entered the game allowing 43.2 points and 507.7 yards per game, but linebacker Blake Cashman forced a fumble and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown as Minnesota (5-5, 2-5 Big Ten) held Purdue to 233 total yards and 0 of 12 on third down.\n\n\u201cSound, simple, fast,\u201d Fleck said of the defensive philosophy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t change our defense. The defense is the defense, and the defense works. We got back to us.\u201d\n\nSenior quarterback David Blough was 20 of 31 for 142 yards passing for the Boilermakers (5-5, 4-3), who entered the game second in the Big Ten scoring with 35.8 points per game.\n\n\u201cReally, just some selfish things that are going on that can\u2019t happen,\u201d Purdue coach Jeff Brohm said. \u201cToo many people that have patted themselves on the back too much, and listened to others instead of working their tail off and finding ways to improve, and understanding that all the little things matter, and realizing that the team comes first.\u201d\n\nFleck fired Smith a day after giving up 646 yards in a loss to Illinois last week. Rossi was the team\u2019s defensive line coach this season.\n\nThe announced 21-degree weather was the third-coldest start for a game in the 10-year history of TCF Bank Stadium. A light snow fell during much of second half in which Minnesota took control.\n\nCashman\u2019s fumble return for a touchdown on the opening drive started the half. The Gophers capped their first three offensive possessions of the second half with a touchdown.\n\n\u201cSimplified the game plan, which allows guys to play loose, play fast, give them that confidence out there,\u201d Cashman said of Rossi\u2019s impact. \u201cThat\u2019s really important because I think we lost some of that against Illinois when they came out and hit us in the mouth early.\u201d\n\nThe longest drive for Purdue, which entered with 485.2 yards per game in Big Ten play, was 30 yards until midway through the fourth quarter when Blough connected with Moore for a 9-yard touchdown pass to cap a 75-yard drive.\n\n\u201cThey run the same coverages, a few minor changes, but we couldn\u2019t get the run game going,\u201d Blough said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t on all cylinders on the pass game, and it made it easier for them to kind of tee off on us.\u201d\n\nONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK\n\nAfter beating then-No. 2 Ohio State 49-20 on Oct. 20, Purdue went on the road and lost to Michigan State 23-13, with their previous worst offensive performance in Big Ten play. The Boilermakers were coming off a 38-36 win against then-No. 19 Iowa last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take full responsibility for it,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have our guys ready to play. I think we somehow just thought we could just come out there, and the ball would bounce our way, and good things would happen.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nPurdue: The Boilermakers\u2019 chance to win the Big Ten\u2019s West division took a big hit with a second straight loss on the road. For any shot, Purdue will likely have to beat Wisconsin next week and hope for help against Northwestern. Of more concern is the bowl outlook gets cloudy as well. Purdue will need at least one win out of Wisconsin and Indiana.\n\nMinnesota: The defensive improvement sure changes the perception. The Gophers had allowed at least 30 points in every Big Ten game this season prior to Saturday. Beating Purdue gets Minnesota one game closer to bowl-eligible. The Gophers need a win at home against Northwestern or on the road at Wisconsin, no easy task.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPurdue: Hosts Wisconsin on Nov. 17.\n\nMinnesota: Hosts Northwestern on Nov. 17.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 France cracked right at the end once again as South Africa scored a try deep into injury time to win 29-26 at Stade de France on Saturday.\n\nFrance thought it had the Springboks beaten for the first time since 2009 after losing their past six meetings \u2014 including four last year \u2014 but poor composure again cost Les Tricolores.\n\nWith the match petering out, France winger Damian Penaud stepped out of bounds taking a high catch with about 10 seconds left of regulation time. South Africa used the mistake to set up a lineout near the French line. When Springboks winger Aphiwe Dyantyi scored the French looked terrified, then relieved when it was ruled out by referee Nigel Owens for a forward pass.\n\nBut the Springboks had time for another lineout, and replacement hooker Bongi Mbonambi bundled through in the 85th minute after France\u2019s forwards were too easily rolled over.\n\n\u201cThey finished strongly but the match seemed over until Damien went into touch,\u201d France coach Jacques Brunel lamented. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel because the players gave everything.

He used his searing pace to break free down the right, but took his eye off Arthur Iturria coming across and the flanker forced him to fumble the ball.\n\nLast year, the Springboks won 18-17 at Stade de France and this was another attritional affair.\n\nSerin and Pollard matched each other to make it 6-6 after an even opening 20 minutes.\n\nThen, France\u2019s sloppiness resurfaced: A lineout casually lost followed by another soft penalty and Pollard\u2019s huge kick from 50 meters made it 9-6.\n\nFollowing a rare French attack, initiated by Lopez and fullback Maxime Medard, the alert Lopez nailed a dropped goal from about 25 meters.\n\nBut France blew a golden chance to score the first try after right winger Teddy Thomas did all the hard work in crashing through four tackles. Instead of passing inside to center Geoffrey Doumayrou he stubbornly continued his run by going right and into traffic.\n\nMoments later, Guirado charged over from the back of a maul for his fifth try in 61 tests. Serin coolly converted for 16-9 at halftime.\n\nTwo errors yielded two tries immediately after the break.\n\nLopez\u2019s high kick was poorly dealt with by South Africa and the loose ball bounced up to Bastareaud, who bundled through.\n\nThen Pollard\u2019s restart was badly fumbled by lock Sebastien Vahaamahina, allowing Nkosi an easy try in the corner.\n\nPollard slotted two penalties to move the Springboks to one point behind entering the final quarter which, for France, is a nervous time. France\u2019s three defeats in the Six Nations were by six points or less.\n\nFrance got a free shot at three points when scrumhalf Faf de Klerk made a clumsy late tackle on Lopez as he kicked clear. Serin landed a tough kick to give France some breathing space at 26-22.\n\nBut not enough space.\n\nPenaud\u2019s error was ruthlessly punished by the Boks, leaving the distraught Guirado, watching from the sidelines, dropping to his knees in disbelief and hiding his head in his coat.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that much confidence, we can\u2019t really hide that,\u201d Iturria said. \u201cWe\u2019re a bit fragile.

They rushed for 139 yards by halftime, nearly matching their average of 153.5 yards per game, and even stopped the Cavaliers on one of their five first-half drives when Bejour Wilson intercepted Perkins, setting up Hickson\u2019s 7-yard scoring run on the next play. The defense needs vast improvement, but almost all their skill players on offense are underclassmen, so the offense should give them an increasing chance against better competition.\n\nVirginia: The Cavaliers seemed surprised that the Flames featured the run game so much and allowed Pickett to gain 47 yards on his first two carries, setting up Hickson\u2019s first touchdown for Liberty on a nothing-to-lose fourth-and-goal play from the 1.

And that puts Matt Barkley in the mix to start Sunday. (AP Photo/Jeffrey T. Barnes, File)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 The Buffalo Bills are going with newly signed journeyman Matt Barkley as their starting quarterback, rather than provide turnover-prone Nathan Peterman another chance.\n\nThe Bills ruled out injured rookie Josh Allen on Saturday and announced Barkley is expected to start against the New York Jets on Sunday. Barkley gets the nod ahead of Peterman despite having just two weeks of practice experience since signing Oct. 30.\n\nBarkley will become the fourth quarterback to start for the team this season, and third in three weeks. It will be his first start in two years since going 1-5 with the Chicago Bears in 2016.\n\nAllen will miss his fourth straight game since spraining his right throwing elbow in a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14. The first-round pick practiced on a limited basis this week and will get additional time to recuperate with Buffalo entering its bye week after playing the Jets.\n\nVeteran backup Derek Anderson had already been ruled out with a concussion.\n\nThe Bills also announced starting rookie middle linebacker Tremaine Edmunds has been cleared to play after missing one game with a concussion. They also promoted receiver Robert Foster from the practice squad and released linebacker Ramon Humber.\n\nBuffalo (2-7) has lost four straight and is off to its worst start since losing eight of its first nine games in 2010.\n\nThe game between the two AFC East teams will feature a matchup of backups rather than first-round picks.\n\nThe Jets (3-6) are starting 39-year-old Josh McCown with rookie Sam Darnold sidelined by a strained right foot. Darnold was drafted third overall, four spots ahead of Allen.\n\nBarkley is on his sixth team in six seasons since being selected by Philadelphia in the fourth round of the 2013 draft. He was most recently in Cincinnati before being cut by the Bengals in September after hurting his knee in a preseason game.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t maybe been the plan I signed up for when I thought of going to the NFL,\u201d Barkley said of his pro career, which came after he set numerous school records as a four-year starter at Southern California. \u201cBut from what I\u2019ve been able to learn along the way, I think I\u2019m in a great spot right now.\u201d\n\nOverall, Barkley has gone 159 for 266 for 1,911 yards passing with eight touchdowns and 18 interceptions in 11 NFL appearances.\n\nThat\u2019s much better than Peterman\u2019s production since being selected in the fifth round of the 2017 draft.\n\nPeterman has thrown seven interceptions in four appearances this season, including three in a 41-9 loss to Chicago last weekend. Overall, he\u2019s thrown 12 interceptions in eight appearances and is best remembered for getting picked off five times in the first half of a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a year ago.\n\nThe Bills offense has struggled no matter who\u2019s started this season.\n\nBuffalo has scored a league-worst 96 points and just two touchdowns in its past four games. The quarterbacks have combined for just three touchdowns passing and 16 interceptions, including five by Allen.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Ireland's Luke McGrath breaks through to score a try during the rugby union international match between Ireland and Argentina, at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

Center Will Addison was given a starting debut when Robbie Henshaw came up lame in the warm-up.\n\nIreland came from behind when it scored the first try, when the Argentina scrum was destroyed and scrumhalf Kieran Marmion darted over.\n\nA second Nicolas Sanchez penalty put Argentina back in front, then he and his centers tore apart the Irish to give unmarked wing Bautista Delguy an easy fifth try in nine tests.\n\nIreland\u2019s reply was swift as, following a tighthead against the Pumas on their line, center Bundee Aki got over at his second attempt and Sexton converted for the lead.\n\nArgentina fullback Emiliano Boffelli just missed catching a Sanchez bomb behind the Irish tryline but Sanchez kicked a penalty for the lead again.\n\nSexton got Ireland back in front by one with a penalty on halftime, but flanker Sean O\u2019Brien had just walked off cradling a broken right arm in his first test in a year. Marmion later limped off. Both of their replacements \u2014 Dan Leavy and McGrath \u2014 had big impacts.\n\nSo did fellow replacements Sean Cronin, Jack McGrath and Devin Toner, after Sanchez kicked the Pumas back ahead in the new half.\n\nThe spark Ireland needed from the fresh faces earned Sexton shots at goal: One from long-range fell under the crossbar but the next one went over, and Ireland had the lead for good, though not with any confidence until McGrath scored.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FLORHAM PARK, N.J.

He also ran for a 61-yard touchdown and had a 68-yard keeper in a 186-yard rushing day, helping Duke finish with a season-high 629 yards.\n\nAnd there was no shortage of praise for the redshirt junior\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cDaniel Jones played as well as a quarterback can play,\u201d said Duke coach David Cutcliffe, who has had a few notable pupils in his coaching career that includes a couple of guys named Peyton and Eli Manning.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not the fastest guy on the field,\u201d Jones said of his runs. \u201cI was trying to run as fast as I could. Both of those long runs, I\u2019m not sure I really got touched, and I think that\u2019s a credit to those guys up front.\u201d\n\nJones\u2019 547 yards of total offense were also the most ever allowed by UNC, surpassing the record of 525 yards set last year by reigning Heisman Trophy winner Lamar Jackson of Louisville.\n\nAfter taking a 35-28 lead into the break following a shootout of a first half, Duke pushed to a two-possession lead when Jones\u2019 68-yarder set up a short TD run by Quentin Harris. The Tar Heels (1-8, 1-6) got back in it with Nathan Elliott\u2019s 13-yard TD throw to Thomas Jackson with 75 seconds left.\n\nThen, after a late stop, UNC had a final drive for the tie and pushed to the Duke 39 with 6 seconds left. But Duke\u2019s Brandon Feamster ended it by knocking down the end-zone pass from Cade Fortin \u2014 a strong-armed freshman brought in for the final heave in his first appearance since being injured against Virginia Tech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re throwing a jump ball to tie the game up,\u201d UNC coach Larry Fedora said. \u201cThey\u2019re a good football team. Our guys continue to fight. There\u2019s no question about that, who they are and what they\u2019re made up of. I\u2019m proud of them for that fact.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels had another uneven performance, the kind of fix-one-thing-and-something-else-breaks issues frequently seen this season. Michael Carter (148 yards and a TD) and the ground game couldn\u2019t be stopped before halftime while the defense struggled, only to reverse roles with the defense coming up with a blocked field goal and two takeaways after halftime as the offense went into a 28-minute slumber. UNC fought to the final play, but still ended with a 20th loss in 25 games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to get through it,\u201d Fedora said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win a football game. I\u2019m not worried about their morale. I\u2019m not worried about what they\u2019re made up of. They\u2019ve already shown that for us this entire year. They could\u2019ve shut it down a long time ago.\u201d\n\nDuke: Jones grabbed the headlines with the total-offense record (set in 1988) and the biggest rushing day by a Duke quarterback (set in 1976). But the defense came up big, too, by turning the Tar Heels away repeatedly after halftime.\n\n\u201cThe reason we were able to fight that off is the fight of our entire team,\u201d Cutcliffe said. \u201cThere was no one part \u2014 offense, defense or kicking \u2014 that enabled us to win. It was every part that enabled us to win.\u201d\n\nINJURY NEWS\n\nDuke was already down several injured starters this year when starting safety Dylan Singleton limped off the field in the first quarter. Cutcliffe said he will have surgery Sunday without specifying the nature of the injury.\n\nKEEPING THE BELL\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much emotion in that rivalry, and especially toward the end it got a little closer than you\u2019d like,\u201d Duke left guard Zach Harmon said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a huge payoff of relief at the end, it couldn\u2019t feel better.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels step out of league play to host Western Carolina next Saturday.\n\nDuke: The Blue Devils draw the toughest of cross-divisional matchups, traveling to No. 2 Clemson next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap", "PROVIDENCE, R.I.

They need one more victory to become bowl-eligible.\n\nAt least they still have a chance and largely because they got contributions from each phase.\n\nScott carried 19 times for 103 yards and one touchdown. Peyton Ramsey went 16 of 28 with 243 yards, two TD passes and one interception and also made two shifty moves on a 35-yard scoring run in the first half.\n\nThe defense held Maryland (5-5, 3-4) to field goals on its first two trips into the red zone and forced four turnovers, including the sealing strip-sack of backup quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome.\n\nJustus made all four extra points and two field goals, something Maryland could not.

Two plays later, Leake scooted right and sprinted 27 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. Pigrome\u2019s 2-point conversion pass to McFarland made it 31-23.\n\nThe Terrapins closed to 31-26 on a field goal early in the fourth and retook the lead when Pigrome hooked up with Jeshaun Jones on a 15-yard TD pass.\n\nBut when Tayon Fleet-Davis\u2019 run was stopped short of the goal line, Indiana took advantage.\n\nFollowing a 23-yard kickoff return to the Indiana 40, Scott broke free down the right side of the field and went out of bounds at the Maryland 33.

I felt in control of my ball striking. I felt in control of driving, the iron play, the putting. It\u2019s been a great three days.\u201d\n\nKuchar saved par from just off the green at the 18th to keep his four-shot margin over Whee Kim, who had a 66.\n\nThe last time Kuchar had a four-shot lead going into the final round was the 2014 Houston Open, and he wound up losing in a playoff when Matt Jones made a 45-foot birdie putt on the last hole and then chipped in from 40 yards in a playoff.\n\nThe other two times Kuchar had the 54-hole lead, he won the Memorial in 2013 one week after losing a one-shot lead at Colonial.\n\n\u201cYou know the deal, though. You have to go play good golf,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cI can\u2019t go out there and think a whole bunch of pars are going to get me in the winner\u2019s circle. I\u2019ve still got to make a good number of birdies, and with that, somewhat have the pedal down.\u201d\n\nRichy Werenski and Danny Lee each shot 67 and were five shots back, followed by a group that included PGA Tour rookie of the year Aaron Wise (63) and Cameron Champ (69). Champ, who played in the final group with Kuchar and Lee, already won this season at the Sanderson Farms Championship.\n\nKuchar has been piling up birdies at El Camaleon Golf Club, and he began to pull away with four birdies on the front nine. Just like Friday, however, one hole gave him stress. It was the 12th hole in the second round, when he had to make a 35-foot bogey putt. On Saturday, it was a tee shot on the 14th. Kuchar took a penalty from the hazard, and dropped in a good lie a few inches next to the cart path.\n\nInstead of taking relief into deeper rough, he hit with his feet on the path and picked it clean so his fairway metal wouldn\u2019t smack into the cement. It came up just short of the green, and he chipped to 5 feet and made the bogey putt.\n\nKuchar responded with a tee shot to 4 feet on the par-3 15th to restore his margin to four shots, and he caught a break on the last hole when he pulled his approach, but it struck a tree and came down in light rough to set up a simple up-and-down.\n\nChamp was trying to get into the final group for Sunday with a par on the last hole, but his wedge came out hot from the rough and rolled through the green, his chip came out heavy and he three-putted for double bogey.\n\nRyder Cup captain Jim Furyk had a 66 and was at 13-under 200. Also seven shots behind was Anirban Lahiri of India, who was tied with Kuchar early on the front line and still in the mix until a double bogey on the 14th hole and a bogey on the 16th. He had to settle for a 69.\n\nKuchar\u2019s last PGA Tour victory was at Hilton Head in 2014. He won the Fiji International with his dad caddying for him late in 2015, but struggled to contend this year and failed to reach the third FedEx Cup playoff event for the first time in nearly a decade. He also did not make the Ryder Cup team for the first time in 10 years.\n\n\u201cSo 2018 has not been my best year, has not been a highlight for me, been a disappointing year,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got signs now of righting the ship and turning into a great start to ... maybe it\u2019s a great finish to \u201918, great start to \u201918-19, however you want to classify the calendar.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "GREENSBORO, N.C.

Missouri won 33-28. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) \u2014 When Missouri kicker Tucker McCann missed a 31-yard field goal to the left with 1:48 remaining in the game, the possibility opened up that Missouri could lose its third last-second contest of the season.\n\nThe Tigers were up 33-28. Quarterback Kyle Shurmur led Vanderbilt 55 yards down the field, setting up for a play on Missouri\u2019s 25-yard line with five seconds remaining.\n\nWhen the final pass came down untouched, Missouri had won its sixth game, becoming bowl-eligible for the second season in a row. The Tigers exhaled.\n\n\u201cI instantly just fell down on my knees and said \u2018thank you God\u2019,\u201d Missouri running back Damarea Crockett said.\n\nMissouri\u2019s defense bent but didn\u2019t break during Vanderbilt\u2019s final drive.\n\n\u201cI was wishing it was over before then,\u201d Missouri head coach Barry Odom said. \u201cBut I had trust in what was called. I\u2019m proud that our team ended up winning it on that last play.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Tigers (6-4, 2-4 Southeastern Conference) are going bowling, and the Commodores (4-6, 1-5) will need to win both its remaining games to guarantee bowl eligibility.\n\nVanderbilt had led all game until Missouri running backs Crockett and Larry Rountree III fueled a 99-yard drive to start the fourth quarter. The drive started after Vanderbilt failed to convert a 4th-and-goal opportunity on Missouri\u2019s 1-yard line.\n\n\u201cNot putting the ball in the end zone on fourth-and-1 was the most critical play in the ballgame for us,\u201d Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason said. \u201cNot getting that done cost us momentum.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the Tigers trekked down the field for a 14-play drive that lasted 5:38. Quarterback Drew Lock trotted three yards into the end zone to give Missouri its first lead of the game - 33-28 with 9:18 remaining.\n\nShurmur outplayed Lock for the majority of the game, with 249 yards and three touchdowns on 24-for-35 passing. Lock, a former Heisman hopeful, passed for 253 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions on 22-for-33 passing.\n\nCrockett bolted for 122 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries and Rountree added 92 yards on 21 rushes.\n\n\u201cThose guys put the game on their back,\u201d Lock said. \u201cOur o-line blocked their butts off.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt\u2019s Ke\u2019Shawn Vaughn ran for 182 yards and one touchdown on 15 carries, good for 12.1 yards per carry.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nVanderbilt: The Commodores showed promise on offense in the first half and proved that they could compete on the road. The victory would have immensely helped the team\u2019s bowl chances, but Vanderbilt can still clinch eligibility with wins in home games against Ole Miss and Tennessee.\n\nMissouri: It wasn\u2019t as pretty as the Tigers\u2019 38-17 victory over No. 13 Florida, but Missouri is officially going bowling. After a rough first half, the defense locked down and offense stepped up in the second half. Finally winning a close game should help the Tigers\u2019 spirits.\n\nFOURTH QUARTER FUTILITY\n\nBeginning with the failed fourth-and-goal attempt from the 1-yard line, Vanderbilt missed out on multiple opportunities in the fourth quarter. Vanderbilt was flagged on an unsportsmanlike conduct, which turned a 3rd-and-1 to a 3rd-and-16, which it didn\u2019t convert.\n\nThe Commodores picked off Lock on the ensuing drive, putting themselves on Missouri\u2019s 35. They managed just one yard on four plays.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the same story all season,\u201d said Vanderbilt tight end Jared Pinkney, who had five catches for 88 yards. \u201cWe can\u2019t finish, for whatever reason.\u201d\n\nON THE RIGHT SIDE\n\nMissouri has lost a pair of last-second contests this season, 37-35 to South Carolina and 15-14 against No. 12 Kentucky.

(AP Photo/Al Goldis)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Drue Chrisman\u2019s first punt of the day was an embarrassment, a 4-yarder at the end of Ohio State\u2019s first possession.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it ranks in Ohio State\u2019s worst punts in history, but it was definitely my worst punt,\u201d Chrisman said. \u201cI was just like, \u2018Man, I\u2019ve got to ball after this one.\u2019\u201d\n\nChrisman made up for that early blooper, keeping Michigan State pinned back with a sensational second half of punting. Eighth-ranked Ohio State pulled away for a 26-6 victory over the 24th-ranked Spartans on Saturday, largely because of what Chrisman did to Michigan State\u2019s field position.\n\nIn a tight defensive struggle, Chrisman\u2019s punts forced Michigan State (6-4, 4-3 Big Ten, No. 18 CFP) to start its first five drives after halftime from its own 5, 6, 3, 1 and 2-yard line. On the fourth of those possessions, the Spartans took an intentional safety instead of punting out of their own end zone. That decision gave Ohio State a 9-6 lead but wasn\u2019t enough to flip the field position.\n\nThe ensuing free kick went out of bounds, giving the Buckeyes the ball at the 50, and then Chrisman pinned Michigan State back again. Ohio State (9-1, 6-1, No. 10) capitalized on that punt when a shotgun snap by Michigan State hit the man in motion. Dre\u2019Mont Jones recovered the fumble for the Buckeyes in the end zone, giving Ohio State a 16-6 advantage.\n\n. @OhioStateFB recovers the fumble in the end zone for a TD \ud83d\ude4c pic.twitter.com/cPJbrt9fQS \u2014 FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) November 10, 2018\n\n\u201cWe just kept playing the field-position game,\u201d Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer said. \u201cWe always talk about the offense\u2019s job in a game like this \u2014 get two first downs, get the ball to midfield and let\u2019s get the ball down inside the 10-yard line.\u201d\n\nBoth offenses found the going tough. Michigan State was 2 for 16 on third down. The Spartans used both Brian Lewerke and Rocky Lombardi at quarterback but never reached the end zone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to call plays off the goal line,\u201d Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said.\n\nChrisman\u2019s day began with his 4-yard punt, but Michigan State couldn\u2019t take advantage.\n\n\u201cI almost benched him, but I didn\u2019t have anybody else to go with,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nOhio State opened the scoring late in the second quarter on a 1-yard pass from Dwayne Haskins to Parris Campbell. It was 7-3 at halftime.\n\nThe Spartans had a third-quarter touchdown called back for a penalty. They settled for a field goal on that drive to make it 7-6, but that was as close as they got.\n\nMichigan State has dealt with significant injury problems at the punter position this year, and that was a factor in Dantonio\u2019s decision to take the safety . The Spartans were soon right back against their own goal line. That was when the fumble on the snap turned the game in Ohio State\u2019s favor for good.\n\n\u201cSent the motion a little early,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t connect on it. ... I\u2019ve got to fix it.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nOhio State: This was likely the Buckeyes\u2019 toughest remaining challenge before a late-November showdown with Michigan. Ohio State remains very much in contention for the Big Ten title after shutting down Michigan State\u2019s offense and winning the special teams battle. The Buckeyes have won seven straight road games in this series.\n\nMichigan State: Lombardi appeared to give the Spartans a spark late in the first half, but Michigan State\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t sustain any momentum, thanks in part to all the bad field position. The Spartans\u2019 top-ranked run defense looked the part, but they weren\u2019t able to move the ball well enough.\n\nSTAREDOWN\n\nIn the final minute of the first half, Michigan State lined up as if to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Ohio State 26. Then the Spartans called a timeout.\n\nThen the Buckeyes called one. Then Ohio State called another.\n\nThen Michigan State took a timeout.\n\nThe Spartans finally gave in and kicked a field goal.\n\nMOVING UP\n\nHaskins threw for only 227 yards, but that was enough to move him ahead of J.T. Barrett and past Bobby Hoying on the school\u2019s single-season list. Joe Germaine, who passed for 3,330 yards in 1998, tops the list but is only 50 ahead of Haskins.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMichigan State will likely drop out of the Top 25, while Ohio State can hope a solid win on the road will impress the voters and the playoff committee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOhio State: The Buckeyes face Maryland next Saturday in their final road game of the season.\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans also play their last road game, at Nebraska.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Tevin McCaster rushed for three touchdowns and Youngstown State defeated Northern Iowa 31-10 on Saturday.\n\nMcCaster had 136 yards on 33 carries and became the 10th player in Penguins history to reach 2,700-career rushing yards.\n\nYoungstown quarterback Montgomery VanGorder connected with Darius Shackleford for a 62-yard touchdown on an out route for the game\u2019s first points before McCaster scored the first of his touchdowns from 5 yards out for a 14-0 lead.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\n\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s high-powered offense made Illinois pay for its many mistakes Saturday.\n\nThe Cornhuskers converted four of the Illini\u2019s five turnovers into 24 points while pulling away for a 54-35 win, their third in four games after an 0-6 start.\n\n\u201cWe got some good breaks today. We were probably due for some good breaks,\u201d Nebraska first-year coach Scott Frost said. \u201cThey made a couple mistakes and got us some good situations. You can\u2019t take advantage of those if you\u2019re not doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe Huskers (3-7, 2-5 Big Ten) did plenty right. Wearing alternate uniforms to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, the Huskers rolled up 606 total yards on a raw afternoon when the wind chill dipped to 13 degrees. Illinois amassed 509 yards in the meeting of the Big Ten\u2019s worst defenses.\n\n\u201cThere early on in the game, watching our offense executing, man, it\u2019s fun calling plays; it was a thing of beauty,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThose guys were executing everything we were calling.\u201d\n\nAdrian Martinez threw for 290 yards and accounted for four touchdowns and Devine Ozigbo ran for 162 yards and three scores.\n\nIllinois (4-6, 2-5) had three turnovers in the first half \u2014 two muffed punts and a fumble by quarterback AJ Bush. Those led to 17 points for Nebraska, which led 38-21 at half.\n\nBush moved the Illini into Nebraska territory on the opening series of the second half but was intercepted when his pass went through Dominic Stampley\u2019s hands into safety Aaron Williams\u2019. The Huskers embarked on a 17-play, 82-yard drive that chewed nearly 8 minutes off the clock, with Ozigbo scoring his second touchdown for a 24-point lead.\n\n\u201cWhen you turn the ball over like that, it\u2019s tough to win,\u201d Illini coach Lovie Smith said. \u201cWhen you continue to give up big runs on the defensive side of the football, run and pass, it\u2019s tough duty. When you have a couple mishaps like we did in the special teams game against a team like this at home, it\u2019s tough to win.\u201d\n\nMartinez was 24 of 34 and threw for three touchdowns, and he ran 13 times for 55 yards and a TD. His 345 yards of total offense pushed his season total to a school freshman-record 2,747.\n\nOzigbo broke a career-long 66-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and went 60 yards for another TD in the fourth.\n\nBush, playing against the school where he spent the first two years of his college career, threw for 126 yards but was intercepted twice. Nebraska couldn\u2019t stop Bush as a runner, though. He rushed for a school quarterback-record 187 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, but I didn\u2019t get the most important stat I wanted,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou ball out, but LeBron scores 60 and they lose. It\u2019s like that.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nIllinois: Five turnovers can\u2019t be overcome when the defense has no answer for an offense that\u2019s rolling like Nebraska\u2019s. It was the second straight week the Illini have had three or more turnovers and third time in four games.\n\nNebraska: The Huskers have scored at least 30 points in five straight games, including four straight in conference play for the first time since 2001, and have gone over 450 yards of total offense in seven straight games for the first time in program history. They\u2019re averaging 537.9 yards over those seven games.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe we can move the ball on anybody,\u201d Ozigbo said, \u201cand we should score every drive.\u201d\n\nNUMBERS TO NOTE\n\nOzigbo is 42 yards short of becoming the Huskers\u2019 first 1,000-yard rusher since 2014. ... Stanley Morgan Jr. caught eight passes for 131 yards and two TDs and moved to No. 2 on the school\u2019s all-time receiving list behind Kenny Bell. ... Illinois\u2019 383 rushing yards were its second-most this season behind the 430 against Minnesota last week.\n\nCORBIN INJURED\n\nThe Illini\u2019s Reggie Corbin, who ran for a career-high 213 yards against Minnesota, left with an injury in the middle of the second quarter. He ran nine times for 59 yards and caught one pass for 34 yards. He favored his right leg as he was helped off.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIllinois hosts Iowa on Nov. 17.\n\nNebraska hosts Michigan State on Nov. 17.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "MONROE, La.

Their last loss against the Welsh came a decade ago \u2014 and that also arrived in Cardiff courtesy of a late kick by a flyhalf, Stephen Jones.\n\nIt was 3-3 at halftime after Wales fullback Leigh Halfpenny and Australia flyhalf Bernard Foley traded penalties. Halfpenny reclaimed the lead for Wales with a penalty in the 68th, only for Matt Toomua to tie the game for the Wallabies seven minutes later.\n\nBiggar kicked what proved to be the winning points and was the player who booted the ball out of play to end the game, and Wales\u2019 run of defeats to Australia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones said. \u201cSomebody reminded me I was the sole survivor from 2008. We\u2019ve lost by many a fine margin and today, I\u2019ll be honest, we won by a fine margin. I\u2019m proud of the boys.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh have won seven straight tests for the first time since 2004-05, with this latest victory potentially boosting confidence ahead of a pool match against the Wallabies at the Rugby World Cup in Tokyo next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most comfortable we\u2019ve been defensively against Australia,\u201d Wales coach Warren Gatland said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a really good place building up for the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nFor Australia, it is eight losses in 11 tests in 2018 and the team has dropped to No. 6 in the world less than a year out from the Rugby World Cup.\n\n\u201cThat hurts,\u201d Australia captain Michael Hooper said of the result. \u201cCredit to them (Wales), they stuck at it. It was a real grudge match, a real test match.\u201d\n\nIt will not be one that lives long in the memory for the neutral, though. There were even two uncharacteristic penalty misses from near the posts by Halfpenny, one of the best place-kickers in the history of the game.\n\nHe had already missed an easy one when he booted the first points of the game after 22 minutes, but Australia drew level seven minutes before the break when Foley kicked a 40-meter penalty after Wales flanker Dan Lydiate drifted offside.\n\nReferee Ben O\u2019Keeffe completely missed a high arm-led challenge by Wyn Jones on Foley just before the penalty was awarded, and it could yet attract further scrutiny.\n\nAnother missed penalty from Halfpenny, this one a sitter from in front of the posts, meant the teams went in 3-3 at halftime and Wales suffered a low when winger George North limped off early in the second half, to be replaced by Liam Williams.\n\nThe Australians sacrificed a kickable penalty just 20 meters out, kicking for touch and an attacking lineout instead, but they knocked on possession and wasted the chance.\n\nThe Wallabies were growing in confidence, with Israel Folau starting to roam dangerously off his wing, and Wales required a lengthy clearance from Jonathan Davies to gain a foothold back in Australian territory.\n\nThen came all the drama of the final 12 minutes, with Biggar kicking the winning points soon after coming on for the dazed Halfpenny.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CLINTON, S.C.

(AP Photo/Chris Knight)\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) \u2014 Trace McSorley and Penn State went back to a familiar formula Saturday \u2014 a steady diet of elusive Miles Sanders.\n\nThe resurgent running game put the Nittany Lions offense back on track, and got McSorley a milestone victory, too.\n\nSanders ran for 159 yards and a touchdown on 23 carries, McSorley matched Todd Blackledge\u2019s program record with his 29th win at quarterback and No. 21 Penn State beat Wisconsin 22-10.\n\nIf Sanders had been irritated that his rushing totals had fallen off along with the Nittany Lions\u2019 offensive output lately, he hadn\u2019t shown it. He considers himself a patient tailback, and he channeled some pent-up energy into running over the Badgers.\n\n\u201cPeople may say that at times (Sanders) had been frustrated, but you never saw that,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said. \u201cWould we love to rush for more yards week in and week out? No doubt about it.\u201d\n\nPenn State (7-3, 4-3 Big Ten, No. 20 CFP) racked up 200-plus rushing yards in each of the first six games but had averaged just 120 over the last three. Meanwhile, McSorley \u2014 a key part of the team\u2019s rushing attack \u2014 has been dealing with a sore right knee.\n\nMcSorley completed 19 of 25 passes for 160 yards and a TD. He appeared to hurt his left knee in the first half but got some relief watching Sanders juke through the Badgers with his shifty running style.\n\n\u201cSomething that I don\u2019t think he gets enough credit for is the balance he has,\u201d McSorley said. \u201cHe\u2019s able to take on a hit and shake it off, maintain his balance and keep going.\u201d\n\nThe Badgers had no balance with starting quarterback Alex Hornibrook out with a concussion.\n\nJonathan Taylor ran 20 times for 185 yards and a touchdown for Wisconsin (6-4, 4-3), but backup quarterback Jack Coan completed just 9 of 20 passes for 60 yards with two interceptions and was sacked five times. The Badgers have lost three of their last five games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to execute better,\u201d Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. \u201cWe knew coming in, it\u2019s a good defense.\u201d\n\nDeAndre Thompkins caught a touchdown pass for Penn State, and the Nittany Lions held the Badgers to 125 yards in the second half.\n\nJake Pinegar made three field goals for Penn State while Wisconsin kicker Rafael Gaglianone added the Badgers final points midway through the third quarter.\n\nWisconsin broke through first when Taylor ran 71 yards to the end zone on the Badgers\u2019 first possession.\n\nBut McSorley led back-to-back scoring drives to give the Nittany Lions the lead for good. He hit Thompkins for a 14-yard touchdown pass to cap an eight-play drive, then led the offense just past midfield to set up Pinegar\u2019s 49-yard field goal.\n\nSanders added a 1-yard touchdown run midway through the second.\n\nPRESSURE GALORE\n\nBeaver Stadium was more difficult than usual for a quarterback to make his first career road start Saturday. Freezing temperatures were made worse by a constant wind powered by gusts up to 40 miles per hour.\n\nAt times, it looked like Penn State\u2019s defensive line was playing that fast. Shareef Miller and Wisconsin native Robert Windsor each turned in two sacks, and Coan was hurried or hit a handful of times.\n\nYOUNG WIDEOUTS\n\nThe Nittany Lions have been looking for more options in the passing game all season. Aside from KJ Hamler, who was targeted on six of Penn State\u2019s first 12 plays, another consistent playmaker has yet to emerge.\n\nBut a handful of underclassmen saw their most extended playing time yet. Jahan Dotson, Cam Sullivan-Brown and Justin Shorter combined to play season-high snap counts and contributed a combined four catches for 51 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nWisconsin: The Badgers were limited on offense without Hornibrook. Coan attempted just four passes in the first half and completed two for 10 yards. Meanwhile, the Nittany Lions were able to load up the box and keep Taylor from getting into the end zone following his first big run.\n\nPenn State: Offensive coordinator Ricky Rahne stuck with the running game and fed Sanders the ball, going back to what worked for Penn State earlier in the season as McSorley deals with a sore knee. The offensive line was solid, and the strategy worked well. It was Sanders\u2019 first 100-yard rushing game since Oct. 13.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWisconsin travels to Purdue.\n\nPenn State visits Rutgers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "Chicago Blackhawks' Erik Gustafsson, left, of Sweden, and Philadelphia Flyers' Jakub Voracek, right, of the Czech Republic, battle for the puck during the second period of an NHL hockey game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Philadelphia.

(AP Photo/Raymond Thompson)\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) \u2014 Once No. 7 West Virginia\u2019s offense found a rhythm, the Mountaineers imposed their will on TCU.\n\nWest Virginia scored three touchdowns in a 3:25 span late in the second quarter to break open a tie game and propel the Mountaineers to a 47-10 victory over the Horned Frogs on Saturday.\n\nWill Grier had touchdown throws of 32, 8 and 4 yards, the eighth time this season he\u2019s had at least three. Grier finished 25 of 39 for 343 yards on a breezy day.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for (TCU coach) Gary Patterson and that team. Controlling the tempo is huge,\u201d Grier said, adding that offensive coordinator Jake Spavital \u201cdid a great job of mixing it up and just us being on the same page.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia (8-1, 6-1 Big 12, No. 9 CFP) piled up 535 yards of offense against the injury-riddled Horned Frogs (4-6, 2-5) as it pursues a possible berth in the conference championship game with two regular-season games left.\n\n\u201cMorale\u2019s good.

The Horned Frogs are in jeopardy of missing a bowl for just the third time under Patterson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been on the other side of these many times,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to score points and you\u2019ve got to find a way to stop people.\u201d\n\nIt also marked the fewest yards allowed this season by West Virginia, who allowed 520 yards in a win at Texas a week ago.\n\nTCU\u2019s Mike Collins had some success throwing to sophomore Jalen Reagor, but not much else worked. Collins completed 22 of 37 passes for 229 yards. Reagor had a career-high 11 receptions for 150 yards.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\n\nMANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas State\u2019s defense gave up big plays, its offense struggled to consistently move the ball and its special teams made more mistakes in one game Saturday than they often do in an entire season.\n\nThe Wildcats were still good enough to beat Kansas.\n\nAlex Barnes ran for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Alex Delton scored the go-ahead TD from 21 yards out in the closing minutes, and Kansas State managed to hold on for a frigid, wind-blown 21-17 victory \u2014 their 10th straight over their biggest rivals.\n\n\u201cThey recognize there were things that could have been done that wouldn\u2019t have necessarily kept it a close ballgame,\u201d Wildcats coach Bill Snyder said of his players, \u201cbut to get the win when they\u2019re in the jaws of defeat, so to speak, it was significant for them. It was important.\u201d\n\nKansas State (4-6, 2-5 Big 12) trailed 17-14 when it got the ball back with 5:02 to go, and Barnes converted fourth-and-2 with a hard, hurdling run. Delton then connected with Dalton Schoen for 28 yards before taking a quarterback draw for a touchdown with 2:46 to go.\n\nThe Jayhawks (3-7, 1-6) reached the Kansas State 32 as they tried to answer, but Peyton Bender had the ball inexplicably pop from his hands while trying to pass with 20 seconds left to end the game.\n\n\u201cThat last play is certainly not the play that lost us the game,\u201d said Kansas coach David Beaty, who is finishing out the season after getting fired last Sunday. \u201cThere were a lot of other things that I can point to that probably kept us from being able to win.\u201d\n\nBender finished with 232 yards passing and two TDs for the Jayhawks, who were trying to win their first road conference game since Oct. 4, 2008. Steven Sims had five catches for 113 yards and a score.\n\nBender\u2019s turnover summed up a game that boiled down to which team made fewer mistakes.\n\nKansas State\u2019s punt-block team was penalized for running into the kicker. So was its kick-block team. And punter Andrew Hicks was woefully short when he was summoned to try a 53-yard field goal.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kansas answered with an 18-play, 94-yard drive that consumed nearly 10 minutes spanning the first and second quarters and was capped by ... a field goal.\n\nThen, when the Jayhawks got the ball back, they marched to the Kansas State 33 before dropping a certain TD pass. Referee Reggie Smith called a false start penalty on \u201cmultiple players,\u201d a fumble and delay-of-game penalty followed, and the Jayhawks failed to run their field-goal unit on the field when they had a chance to kick a 56-yarder as time expired.\n\nAll that was missing from the first half was the circus music.\n\nKansas State special teams coach Sean Snyder\u2019s frustration continued on the opening kickoff of the second half, when the wind popped it up and none of the Wildcats could recover it.\n\nBut in the ultimate game of one-upmanship, Kansas promptly went backward in four plays to give the Wildcats better field position than if they had fair caught the kickoff.\n\nKansas State took its first lead a few minutes later, when Barnes ran 24 yards for a score. And after the Jayhawks answered with a 75-yard drive that Bender capped with a TD pass to Jeremiah Booker, it was Barnes finding the end zone again to help the Wildcats regain the lead.\n\nLest they have too much success, the Wildcats botched a field-goal attempt a few minutes later.\n\nKansas regained the lead when Bender hit Steven Sims on a 65-yard touchdown reception, but the Jayhawks promptly squandered a chance to put the game away. They had two 50-yard-plus runs wiped out by holding penalties, and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was tacked on when Jayhawks tight end Mavin Saunders apparently disagreed with the second holding call and tried to hide the flag.\n\n\u201cI saw it,\u201d Snyder said, cracking a grin. \u201cSomewhat amazed.\u201d\n\nThe unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was tacked on and Kansas was ultimately forced to punt, and that gave Delton and the Wildcats the opening they needed for one more score.\n\n\u201cIt was really big to finally get off a losing streak,\u201d said Barnes, who delivered the lead block on the go-ahead score, \u201cand it\u2019s always good to beat Kansas.\u201d\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201cOur state deserves that game to be a good game and it was a good game today. It wasn\u2019t good for the Jayhawks because we want to finish with a victory, but it was a good game.\u201d \u2014 Beaty.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nKansas: So much for giving Beaty a memorable victory. Despite being fired Sunday, he is finishing the season while athletic director Jeff Long crisscrosses the country in search of his replacement.\n\nKansas State: Sloppy as they were, the Wildcats managed to keep their bowl hopes alive. They still need to win their next two games to become eligible, though, and will need to play a whole lot better.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKansas visits sixth-ranked Oklahoma next Saturday.\n\nKansas State plays Texas Tech in its home finale Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "", "", "Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks (13) shushes the crowd after scoring a touchdown against South Carolina during an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Gainesville, Fla.

Henderson sealed the victory when he intercepted Jake Bentley\u2019s third-down pass on the ensuing drive. Muschamp has dropped eighth of his last 10 games in the Swamp.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard, tough loss,\u201d said Muschamp, who is 0-2 against his former team in Gainesville. \u201cWe had our opportunities.

When you go on the road in our league and have the opportunities in front of us, to lose the game, it\u2019s gut-wrenching.\u201d\n\nFranks completed 15 of 21 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for 36 yards and two scores a week after getting benched for the third time in two seasons.\n\nMullen opened up the quarterback competition during the week, but backup Kyle Trask broke a foot in practice Wednesday and is out for the remainder of the regular season. That left Franks as Mullen\u2019s only viable option against the Gamecocks (5-4, 4-4).\n\nStill, the home crowd turned on Franks quickly Saturday by booing him after consecutive plays on the first series in which he fumbled and badly overthrew a receiver.\n\nFranks responded after his first TD run.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an emotional kid,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cI told him he\u2019s going to get booed. ...

Jordan Scarlett had 159 yards on the ground. Lamical Perine added 107 yards and two scores. Dynamic receiver Kadarius Toney chipped in 51 yards on four carries.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nSouth Carolina: After being up 17 points late in the third quarter, the Gamecocks found themselves in another nail-biter late. It was the team\u2019s fifth consecutive game decided by four points or less. They are 3-2 in those.\n\nFlorida: The Gators still have hopes of making a big-time bowl game and reaching 10 wins for just the second time in the last six seasons.\n\nMUSCHAMP CONNECTION\n\nAlthough Muschamp will forever be tied to Florida, he won\u2019t have many connections to his former school after this game.\n\nThe Gators have six fifth-year seniors who signed with Florida before Muschamp\u2019s final season in 2014. Florida also has one more payment to Muschamp to fulfill his severance, a $787,500 deposit later this month. That will complete his $6.3 million buyout.\n\nMISSING MEN\n\nFlorida was without three key players: guard Brett Heggie, safety Brad Stewart and receiver Freddie Swain.

It called Abrams\u2019 refusals to concede \u201ca disgrace to democracy\u201d that \u201ccompletely ignore the will of the people.\u201d\n\nBut members of civil rights groups including the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People held a small rally urging Abrams to keep fighting until every vote is counted.\n\n\u201cThat is a promise she made,\u201d said Ben Williams, president of the Cobb County branch of the SCLC, founded by the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nErick Allen, a black Democrat newly elected to the Georgia House, said allegations of voter suppression and questions about Election Day problems could dog Kemp as governor if he eventually prevails.\n\n\u201cThe erosion in trust is done,\u201d said Allen.\n\nAbrams is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in the United States, while Kemp is attempting to continue GOP dominance in a diversifying state that could be a battleground in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement Saturday afternoon, she said she had met with voters who experienced difficulties casting ballots. She said her campaign had heard stories of voters turned away from the polls, students and military members who requested absentee ballots that never arrived or were \u201clost in the mail\u201d \u2014 and first-time and longtime voters who found their names were \u201cno longer on the list.\u201d\n\nShe vowed to continue to fight.\n\n\u201cI am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it.

Abrams has argued that tens of thousands of provisional and military ballots could need to be counted before the race is over.\n\nThe Kemp campaign said a maximum of 17,495 provisional and military ballots remain to be counted. The Abrams campaign contends at least 30,823 votes remain, including nearly 27,000 provisional ballots; that could be enough to prompt a recount.\n\nThe Associated Press has not declared a winner.

Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics Service data show the state had 8,304 licensed dairy herds in October \u2014 634 fewer than a year ago.\n\nThe global flood of milk has depressed prices to about half what they were in 2014, and they still haven\u2019t hit all-time lows, The Des Moines Register reported . But U.S. production has continued to increase despite the large number of dairy cows being culled from herds, said University of Wisconsin-Madison dairy policy analyst Mark Stephenson.\n\n\u201cThe catastrophe is that we\u2019re still producing more milk month after month after month,\u201d Stephenson said, adding that the U.S. would need to see a significant increase in exports for dramatic improvement in prices.\n\nThe proposed United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which is expected to gain some dairy access in Canada, is not expected to change that. Regional leaders view the possible gains from the agreement \u201cas too small and too far in the future to help (U.S.) dairy farmers,\u201d said the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank recently.\n\nSadly, Stephenson said, the loss of dairy farms should help pull the milk supply in line with demand. But \u201cI\u2019m not seeing it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nA federal program might provide some help for reeling dairy farmers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Dairy Revenue Protection is designed to insure against unexpected declines in the quarterly revenue from milk sales. The covered milk production is indexed to the state or region where the dairy producer is situated.\n\nThe program is modeled after federal crop insurance programs for corn, soybeans and other commodities\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com", "This undated photo provided by Amarin in November 2018 shows a capsule of the purified, prescription fish oil Vascepa.

(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) \u2014 No. 11 UCF is becoming predictable as the Knights pursue another undefeated season.\n\nThe defending American Athletic Conference champions keep on winning while insisting they aren\u2019t listening to chatter about whether they will be deserving of a berth in the College Football Playoff if they remain unbeaten when the four-team field is picked in December.\n\nNow, coach Josh Heupel and his players say they\u2019re turning their focus to No. 25 Cincinnati, which comes to Florida next week for a crucial AAC test.\n\nA victory over the Bearcats will clinch a spot in the conference championship game.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, if you\u2019re doing it right inside of your program, each game becomes bigger,\u201d Heupel said Saturday after McKenzie Milton threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third to key a 35-24 victory over Navy that extended the nation\u2019s longest winning streak to 22 games.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we want. That\u2019s the type of program we\u2019re trying to build,\u201d Heupel added. \u201cI have great respect for Cincinnati. We\u2019re going to enjoy this one today and move on to Cincinnati tomorrow.\u201d\n\nUCF (9-0, 6-0) finished as the only unbeaten team in the Football Bowl Subdivision a year ago, but was not included in the CFP. The Knights currently are one of four FBS teams that remain undefeated, along with the top three teams in the latest CFP rankings \u2014 Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame.\n\nAlthough Heupel reiterated the Knights are only concerned with trying to go \u201c1-0 every week,\u201d the first-year coach said he\u2019s growing tired of playoff talk.\n\n\u201cNo, we want to be in that conversation. We want to be in it every single year,\u201d Heupel said. \u201cWe\u2019re building this program to have sustained success.\u201d\n\nMilton completed 17 of 21 passes for 200 yards without an interception for the Knights, who\u2019ve scored at least 30 points in every game throughout its long winning streak.\n\nDredrick Snelson scored on receptions of 34 and 12 yards, Greg McCrae ran for 101 yards and one TD, and the Knights finished with 297 yards rushing to stay atop the AAC East Division standings\n\nThe Knights are 12th in the latest CFP rankings. Beating Navy (2-8, 1-5), which has lost seven straight games, won\u2019t exactly silence critics who feel the defending AAC champions are undeserving of a higher ranking because of the strength of their schedule.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s (disappointing) to lose again,\u201d Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good team, though. They have won a ton of games. ... There\u2019s no consolation prizes for coming close, but I was proud of the way our guys fought.\u201d\n\nTRIPLE OPTION\n\nA week after being limited to a season-low 124 yards rushing in a 42-0 road loss at Cincinnati, Navy got one of the nation\u2019s most productive running attacks back on track. The Midshipmen rolled up 374 yards total offense, all of its rushing.\n\nQuarterback Zach Abey scored on runs of 5 and 8 yards, finishing with a team-best 85 yards rushing on 26 carries for Navy. He attempted two passes, both incompletions and was sacked once trying to throw.\n\nTre Walker ran for 82 yards on seven attempts, and Mike Martin ran for 51 and a fourth-quarter TD.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNavy: The Midshipmen finished a three-week stretch in which they lost to Notre Dame, Cincinnati and UCF, who were a combined 25-1 entering Saturday. Their chances of slowing UCF\u2019s potent offense hinged on getting its own running game going and dominating time of possession to keep Milton off the field.\n\nUCF: Milton was sharp in his second game since sitting out a road win over East Carolina with an undisclosed injury. The junior from Kapolei, Hawaii, hit 10 of his first 11 passes for 106 yards, completing throws to seven different receivers. He has at least one TD pass in 22 consecutive games.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Knights dropped two spots in the Top 25 after yielding 670 yards and 40 points in a 12-point home victory over heavy underdog Temple. They don\u2019t figure to earn any style points this week, either, after allowing the Midshipmen to hang around until the fourth quarter.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nNavy: Home vs. Tulsa, Saturday.\n\nUCF: Hosts No. 25 Cincinnati in key AAC matchup, Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J.

Godin said he was already looking for someone to take his captain\u2019s armband when he realized he would have to stay.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of minutes left and I thought about leaving. I couldn\u2019t run,\u201d said Godin, who was expected to be sidelined for at least three weeks because of the injury. \u201cBut I knew I could help in a set-piece or something like that.

Army coach Jeff Monken will take it \u2014 grudgingly.\n\nDarnell Woolfolk rushed for 69 yards and two touchdowns, Calen Holt and Kelvin Hopkins Jr. each scored on short runs, and Army beat Lafayette 31-13 on a windswept Saturday.\n\nIt was the sixth straight victory for Army (8-2), which has won 12 in a row at home. Lafayette (3-7), which plays in the Championship Subdivision, fell behind early and was doomed by a blocked punt to start the second half.\n\n\u201cI challenged our team this week to try and play our very best football, to play the best that we can play,\u201d Monken said. \u201cAt this point in the season we really need to be doing that if we\u2019re going to accomplish the goals that we\u2019ve still got out there. I don\u2019t think we did that today, but it was good enough to win. We made some plays.\u201d\n\nArmy dominated the opening half, running twice as many plays as the Leopards, outgaining them 256-63, and holding the ball for nearly 22 minutes to gain a 17-6 lead. The margin could have been greater if not for a turnover and two false start penalties in a three-play sequence with the ball inside the Lafayette 10 that forced Army to kick a field goal on the game\u2019s first drive.\n\n\u201cOur mentality is every game we play is the hardest game we have,\u201d Woolfolk said. \u201cWe knew that we couldn\u2019t get complacent. The talk around, \u2018Oh, you guys are playing an FCS team.\u2019 We just had to come out and execute, be perfect on our fundamentals. We were off and on on that.\n\n\u201cIf we want to be the team that we want to be, we have to be perfect every drive, cap every drive off with a touchdown. Our team is capable of that. We need to meet our standards and be that team we all want to be.\u201d\n\nThe Leopards\u2019 loss was sealed after a blocked punt on the first possession of the second half. Jacob Bissell\u2019s rugby-style kick slammed off the helmet of Army\u2019s Andy Davidson and Mike Reynolds recovered for the Black Knights at the Lafayette 1 to set up Woolfolk\u2019s second TD. It was his 34th rushing touchdown, fifth all-time at Army and one more than Carlton Jones.\n\n\u201cIt gives them an easy score,\u201d Lafayette coach John Garrett said. \u201cIt was an impactful play in the game, unfortunately in their favor.\u201d\n\nThe Leopards tied it late in the first, taking advantage of an Army gaffe. Lafayette generated nothing on its first possession, punting after three downs. But Reynolds fumbled the kick after it bounced once and Lafayette\u2019s Yasir Thomas recovered at the Army 23. After losing 2 yards in three plays, Jeffrey Kordenbrock kicked a 42-yard field goal.\n\n\u201cWe just fought until the end,\u201d said Lafayette running back Mike Dunn. \u201cWe made them earn every yard.\u201d\n\nThe Black Knights scored their first touchdown early in the second. Hopkins hit a wide-open Glen Coates along the right side, and he broke a tackle and bulled his way to the Lafayette 1 for a 35-yard gain, a career best. Woolfolk scored on the next play for a 10-3 lead.\n\nAnother nice punt by Bissell pinned Army at its own 6-yard line, but Artice Hobbs got the Black Knights out of trouble quickly with a nifty 18-yard run right after a pitch from Hopkins on the first play of the drive.\n\nThe Black Knights then used the pass to strike again and put Lafayette in a deep hole. With the Leopards intent on trying to stop the run, Hopkins found a wide-open Holt for a 32-yard gain. Holt scored on an 8-yard run to the right off another pitch with 41 seconds left in the second quarter, giving Army a 17-3 lead.\n\nKordenbrock\u2019s 43-yard field goal as time expired gave the Leopards a boost going into the break. It was short-lived for a team that was averaging 14 points a game and found little give in the Army defense. Lafayette converted just 2 of 8 third-down tries while Army converted all but one of its 13.\n\n\u201cWe were able to drive it fairly consistently ... out of our spread formations,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t able to convert on third down. It was there periodically, but they\u2019re a good defense. There were some times where we got behind on the chains against the wind, so it\u2019s hard to throw it when it\u2019s third-and-13.\u201d\n\nIn honor of Veterans Day, the Leopards had special decals on their helmets to honor the military .\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nLafayette: The Leopards, like most of the teams in the Patriot League, are in a down year but can salvage a measure of respect with a win next week against Lehigh in the most-played football rivalry in the nation. The teams have played 153 times since 1884.\n\nArmy: The Black Knights have become a force in their home stadium, going unbeaten last year and raising their record this year to 5-0 with one game left.\n\nNO PASSING FANCY\n\nArmy ranked second nationally in rushing entering the game, averaging 306.6 yards, and racked up 313 on Saturday. But Hopkins again demonstrated that teams have to respect his arm with the two key completions.\n\nLEOPARDS GROUNDED\n\nLafayette scored its lone touchdown in the fourth quarter when QB Sean O\u2019Malley finally got untracked. He had completions on screen passes of 23 yards to CJ Amill and 10 yards to Dunn and hit Tim Payne over the middle for 19 yards to set up a 3-yard scoring toss to Will Eisler.

They\u2019re also pets.\n\nWhen Rhonda Foster and her husband, Doug Foster, moved from Burlington to their rural Danville home four years ago, Rhonda Foster knew she wanted some kind of livestock to graze in the 2.5-acre pasture and barn accompanying their property. It was at the encouragement of her knitting group at the At Home Store in Fairfield, where she sells her yarn, that she decided on sheep.\n\n\u201cI knew from the people who have knit there for like 20-plus years that they\u2019re always on the lookout for exotic different fiber, and now the push is to slow fashion and knowing where everything comes from,\u201d Rhonda Foster said, gazing over her flock of 22 sheep as they munched on pumpkins, their favorite treat.\n\nShe knows them all by marking, name and personality.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calming,\u201d she told The Hawk Eye , adding that friends of hers have asked to visit the flock after a hard day. \u201cThey get their emotional cues from people\u2019s faces. ... They kind of are a barometer for people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nThough she knows much about sheep now, Foster\u2019s background was in nursing, not shepherding. So, to prepare for the venture, she took lamb and wool management courses online through Minnesota West Community and Technical College\u2019s Pipestone campus to learn the trade and sought out livestock veterinarian lectures to attend.\n\nWith the knowledge that diet affects the quality of the wool, Foster looked around for a local, high-quality hay provider, which she found in JD Stucker of rural Danville. The alfalfa and timothy hay blend provides a high level of protein for the sheep.\n\n\u201cIf you have a low-protein diet, you\u2019re going to have a lesser-quality wool,\u201d she said. \u201cThe wool tells the story of the animal\u2019s health. It represents a whole year of work.\u201d\n\nThe Fosters also have partnered with the Department of Natural Resources for pasture and woodland conservation efforts. Invasive honey suckle that grows in the woods around their home also is high in protein, so they cut it down and feed it to the flock to help eradicate it from the woods.\n\nIn deciding what kind of sheep she wanted, Foster, a retired nurse and longtime knitter, attended fiber and wool fairs, such as Iowa Sheep and Wool in June and Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival in fall, in search of the perfect texture.\n\n\u201cI wanted something that was next-to-skin that wouldn\u2019t scratch,\u201d she said.\n\nShe wanted a small, hardy, exotic breed in need of conservation efforts. She found all those things in Shetlands.\n\nHaving found a Shetland breeder in Waverly, she and her husband brought home 10 3-month-old lambs descended from a 4,500-year-old breed indigenous to the Shetland Islands. Foster gave them Scottish names, such as Finsla and Faegan James.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know much about how to manage them, so I kind of trained them like I do my dogs,\u201d Foster said.\n\nShe used a bell and treats to train the sheep to come in the barn at night. They are given free rein of the fenced-in pasture and barn, which is left open throughout the day but closed at night to protect them from coyotes.\n\nWord of her flock spread, and it wasn\u2019t long before she was contacted by a woman in northern Illinois who needed to downsize her Shetland flock. Foster agreed, and she took in four more sheep.\n\nAfter the first sheering, done by Justin Shau, Foster shopped around for someone who could spin the wool into yarn, sending wool to several Iowa spinners so she could get samples of each. She settled on Round Barn Fiber in Rockford. Rather than dye the yarn, it is left the color of the sheep from which the wool came, resulting in a range of white, brown and black hues.\n\n\u201cIt comes back and it smells like the sheep and it still has little pieces of hay, which reminds you that it\u2019s a farm product,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s also an Iowa product, with everything from the hay the sheep eat to the logo design, done by Jennifer Bell of Fairfield, coming from Iowa residents.\n\nThe first batch of home-grown yarn sold out within a day during a Meet the Sheep event at the At Home Store, during which Foster and three of her sheep visited the store to greet customers and show them where the product came from. Each skein of yarn is tagged with the name of the sheep from which the wool used to make it was shorn.\n\n\u201cI picked the colors (of sheep) that I thought the knitters would like,\u201d Foster said.\n\nShe will have more yarn to sell this year as her flock has grown by eight sheep.\n\nLast year, at the advisement of a woman Foster met at the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival, Foster decided to expand her flock to include Gotland and Finnish sheep.\n\n\u201cShe said if you love the Shetlands, you\u2019ll really love the other guys because they\u2019re mellow,\u201d Foster said.\n\nNot only are their temperaments desirable, but the Sweden and Finnish breeds can be sheered twice a year, once in early spring and again in fall.\n\nShe and her husband set out to get four sheep, but, at the suggestion of her husband, they brought home eight, raising their sheep count to 22 and resulting in a wider range of colors and textures.\n\nThose textures and colors help knitters like Foster decide what it will become.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Hawk Eye, http://www.thehawkeye.com", "MINDEN, Nev.

(AP) \u2014 Taking a break after a morning spent serving coffee and breakfast, Erin Schroeder laughs, repeating the joke that she and her husband, Ben, have a new child that now occupies much of her time.\n\nLike any young one, it\u2019s consuming a lot of their energy, but it\u2019s also helped bring a buzz to Hartington\u2019s business district.\n\nThe two veterinarians have found a niche restoring century-old buildings here, and their latest project, the historic Hartington Hotel, has kept Erin busy. Rather than doctoring area residents\u2019 pets and horses, Erin Schroeder has been welcoming them to the coffee shop, ballroom and guest suites she and Ben opened inside the hotel on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cThis is our third child,\u201d Erin said with a chuckle. \u201cThe joke is I\u2019m on maternity leave to take care of our new building.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been taking care of one thing or another \u2014 usually many at the same time \u2014 their entire professional careers, especially since the restoration bug bit them after moving to Hartington a little over a decade ago to take over Cedar County Veterinary Services from Ben\u2019s father, John.\n\nNeither Erin nor Ben Schroeder had a construction background. They loved animals instead. Erin grew up near Lake Champlain in Westport, New York, knowing from a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian. After graduating from Syracuse University, where she was a scholarship basketball player, she went to vet school at Kansas State University, where she met and married Ben Schroeder.\n\nBy 2007, they had bought Ben\u2019s father\u2019s practice. They\u2019ve moved the clinic three times, remodeling each new location to fit their needs for treating cattle, horses and small animals. They did the same when they opened a clinic in Vermillion, South Dakota, and again after opening a Yankton, South Dakota, clinic, which they\u2019ve since sold.\n\nThey grew to like the demolition, planning and design that goes into renovation projects, a departure from their daily veterinary work, the Sioux City Journal reported.\n\n\u201cI really feel like it\u2019s two different sides of my brain and my husband, too. It gives us each a creative outlet,\u201d Erin Schroeder said.\n\nThe buildings got bigger, the projects more ambitious.\n\nIn 2015, they bought the Globe clothing store building, which was built in 1901. They gutted it and turned the top floor into a home for them and their two boys. The main floor was turned into an event space for small parties and gatherings. After finishing that project, they asked a real estate agent if he had any buildings they could buy and restore. He eventually asked if they\u2019d be interested in the Hartington Hotel, a building just up the street from the Globe that they\u2019d eyed a time or two.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we got out of the office before saying yes,\u201d Erin Schroeder said.\n\nVacant for 23 years, the former hotel, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, still stood prominently on North Broadway, Hartington\u2019s main business district. The three-story brick structure, built in 1917, was structurally sound and had been gutted years earlier but had reached a point at which something needed to be done before it began to deteriorate.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have immediate plans for the building, but they knew one thing for sure.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to preserve the historic character\u201d and turn it into an attraction, something to bring people to Hartington, Erin said.\n\nThey set to work as they made plans. Ben Schroeder did a lot of the demolition work, Erin planned and designed the final product. Both worked to clean and restore original wooden beams, hardwood and tile floors and the hotel counter. A contractor did the major construction work.\n\nThey began work late last year and have transformed an empty building into an attractive and active business.\n\nThe main floor is home to The Lobby, a coffee shop that serves gourmet coffee, breakfast and lunch. Erin Schroeder said local residents desired a formal dining option in town, so on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, they host a sit-down buffet in the ballroom, which also can be reserved for private parties. It\u2019s also been used for weddings and receptions.\n\nThe top two floors were renovated into 17 bedrooms and nine bathrooms divided among four suites. They\u2019re popular with wedding parties, guests and families.\n\nIn the basement is The Tap Room, an event bar that was a speakeasy during Prohibition.\n\nErin Schroeder will soon open a home decor shop named Togged to the Bricks in a storefront inside the hotel.\n\nIt\u2019s been a lot of work, a lot of time balancing treating animals and giving a historic building special treatment, but it\u2019s been worth it, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you have to be passionate about,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes us proud.\u201d\n\nThat pride appears to be contagious. Erin Schroeder said that since they\u2019ve restored the Globe and now the hotel, she and Ben have noticed other downtown business owners improving their buildings, whether it\u2019s a new awning, touching up the facade or doing some renovations. There\u2019s more traffic downtown on Saturday nights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a renewed energy,\u201d Erin said.\n\nThe Schroeders plan to keep that energy flowing. Erin has her eyes on other older buildings she\u2019d love to restore. It may seem like an interest that has little in common with veterinary medicine, but Erin said the two are more similar than you\u2019d think.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like an animal,\u201d Erin Schroeder said. \u201cWe see things that are broken, sick and debilitated. Most of the time with TLC and the right care you can improve an animal\u2019s life, and it\u2019s the same thing with buildings. You just have to love them.\u201d\n\nThe Schroeders obviously have a lot of love to give. More buildings are destined to become part of their family and Hartington\u2019s future.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com", "Tottenham Hotspur's Juan Foyth, center, celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game during their English Premier League soccer match against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, London, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018. (John Walton/PA via AP)\n\nTottenham defender Juan Foyth had an uncomfortable debut in the Premier League last weekend.\n\nHis second game in England\u2019s top flight went a whole lot better.\n\nThe 20-year-old Argentine center back scored a second-half goal to earn Spurs a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace that moved them level on points with second-place Chelsea and Liverpool in the standings.\n\nA week ago, Foyth made his first appearance in the Premier League and gave away two penalties in Tottenham\u2019s 3-2 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a week makes,\u201d read a tweet from Tottenham after the match.\n\nSigned from Estudiantes in the 2017 offseason, Foyth is getting a run in the first team only because of an injury crisis that has robbed Tottenham this season of nine of its 12 players who featured in the World Cup in Russia.\n\nThe latest casualties were Colombia center back Davinson Sanchez, who injured his hamstring in the Champions League in midweek, and England right back Kieran Trippier, who hobbled off injured midway through the first half against Palace.\n\nWithout even hitting its stride this season, Tottenham is firmly in contention in the title race.\n\nFive of its last six wins in the league have been by a one-goal margin, with the only league defeat since mid-September coming at home to leader Manchester City.\n\n\u201cThis type of game is crucial in the battle for the top four,\u201d Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino said. \u201cThis is one of the toughest stadiums to play in. The three points are massive.\u201d\n\nEMOTIONAL TRIBUTE\n\nAction on the field seemed very much an afterthought at King Power Stadium as Leicester honored its late owner who was killed with four others in a helicopter crash two weeks ago.\n\nThe 0-0 draw with Burnley was the first game at the stadium since the tragic accident that saw Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha\u2019s helicopter crash shortly after the previous home game.\n\nSome injured Leicester players, including England defender Harry Maguire, led a march of fans from the city center to the stadium ahead of the match. Fans, players and staff remembered Vichai before, during and after the game.\n\nWINS FOR STRUGGLERS\n\nOn a rather lackluster day in the Premier League when only 11 goals were scored in six matches, there were crucial and confidence-boosting second wins of the season for struggling teams Newcastle and Cardiff.\n\nNewcastle climbed out of the relegation zone after beating Bournemouth 2-1 at home, with on-loan Venezuela striker Salomon Rondon setting Rafa Benitez\u2019s team on the way with two early goals. After going 10 games without a victory at the start of the season, Newcastle has won two in a row.\n\nCardiff also won against Brighton 2-1, its winner coming in the 90th minute through Sol Bamba following an extraordinary goalmouth scramble in which the ball struck the goal frame on twice before the center back eventually scored.\n\nBrighton played from the 34th minute with 10 men after Dale Stephens\u2019 red card.\n\nThe other two games were 1-1 draws. Felipe Anderson\u2019s goal earned West Ham a point at Huddersfield, and Jose Holebas equalized with a deflected strike nine minutes from time to earn Watford a draw at Southampton.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80", "CAIRO, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Ground has been broken on a new veterans memorial.\n\nAbout 100 individuals attended a recent ceremony in Cairo that officially marked the beginning of construction for the project that will honor those who served in the nation\u2019s military.\n\nCairo Veterans Memorial Park project is an undertaking by the Cairo Community Foundation and was sparked by the VanWinkle family.\n\nKirby VanWinkle said his father, Edward, an Army veteran, had tried to get a memorial established in Cairo for a number of years. The ball really got rolling a couple years ago when the foundation got involved.\n\nOriginally, the plan to honor veterans was going to be done by installing a pillar at the community center. That idea grew to create an entire park that will include granite pillars, a wall featuring engraved bricks and a memorial garden on the lot directly east of the Village of Cairo Fire Hall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than what he wanted,\u201d VanWinkle said of his father, who passed away four years ago. \u201cHe just wanted the names recognized on main street somewhere. I\u2019m sure he would be very impressed.\u201d\n\nCharity Adams, executive director of the foundation, said the project grew because of the community support. A committee was formed to develop the project. Many members of the committee are veterans or have family members who served.\n\n\u201cThis park was built 110 percent with veterans in mind. This is not a vanity park. This is for the veterans,\u201d Adams said.\n\nCost of the project was estimated to be about $200,000, but it likely will be less, the Grand Island Independent reported.\n\n\u201cWe have found that with community volunteers that the project is not going to be anywhere near that,\u201d Adams said, adding that the land was donated by the village.\n\nThere are some hard costs for the project. Fundraising efforts are still ongoing to cover those expenses. Donations are being taken and the public can purchase a brick for $150 to dedicate to a veteran. The bricks will be engraved and be part of a 90-foot-long memorial wall.\n\nBricks can be bought by anyone.\n\n\u201cWe want to honor all veterans. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve been to Cairo or are even from Nebraska. If you have a family member who lives in California and you want a brick to honor them, by all means, you can buy a brick,\u201d said Becky Grabowski, a committee member and Army veteran.\n\nAside from brick sales, the project is also being funded through Cairo sales tax revenue, a development fund set up through the Grand Island Community Foundation and other donations.\n\nOther pieces of the memorial park include five granite pillars that cost about $15,000 apiece. Each pillar will have a bronze emblem and be engraved with pictures depicting each branch of the military.\n\nThe center of the park will be a flag pole surrounded by four granite benches. There will also be a pollinator garden with a cement walkway in the shape of a ribbon.\n\nConstruction will be done in phases. The first phase, which all funding has been secured, will likely get started in the spring and includes the memorial wall with a donor recognition section, benches, pollinator garden and basic landscaping.\n\nPhase two includes the granite pillars and a star walkway made up of red, white and blue pavers.\n\nAdams said she knew the community would embrace the project but she was surprised by the turnout for the groundbreaking ceremony.\n\n\u201cI expected them to like it. I expected them to be on board. I knew they wanted it. I did not expect the turn out to be this big,\u201d she said.\n\nRain shifted the program indoors where several veterans and current military members were honored during a pinning ceremony. The group momentarily made it outdoors to the vacant corner lot to watch committee members turn over dirt with golden shovels.\n\nHopes are to have the project complete by next fall, Adams said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Grand Island Independent, http://www.theindependent.com", "MONTGOMERY, Ala.

Doug Jones, or at least demonstrate themselves as viable with competitive races.\n\nThe losses rekindled long simmering tensions, with several 2018 candidates calling for new leadership or at least a new approach.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a losing season and a losing season and a losing season, the coach goes,\u201d said former Alabama Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb, who ran in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Cobb earlier this year called for the resignations of Alabama Democratic Party Chair Nancy Worley and Vice-Chairman Joe Reed.\n\nMallory Hagan, a former news anchor and Miss America who ran in Alabama\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, used her election night speech to say that Democrats upset over the loss should be \u201cmad at our own\u201d party.

She said the party did have more money from qualifying fees this year, but had to hold money back for operating expenses, to pay debt and because of restrictions on how funds can be used.\n\nWorley estimated the party spent about $250,000 on efforts for candidates, including fliers that pictured all the statewide candidates, and five days of radio and TV ads urging people to vote Democratic.\n\n\u201cPointing the finger of blame at any single person after an election in just using the scapegoat method,\u201d Worley said\n\nThere are two separate petitions with the Democratic National Committee that were filed before Tuesday contesting Worley\u2019s August election as chairwoman.

We\u2019re prepared to stay in the fight so we\u2019ll get some luck from the game further down the track, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nEngland made a dream start as Chris Ashton and co-captain Dylan Hartley scored tries either side of an Owen Farrell dropped goal for 15-0 after 24 minutes.\n\nNew Zealand struck back through fullback Damian McKenzie near halftime, then a kickoff error from Farrell allowed the All Blacks to close the deficit to five points at the break.\n\nBeauden Barrett\u2019s dropped goal and penalty put the All Blacks ahead on the hour mark, setting up a dramatic finale in the rain.\n\nThe All Blacks celebrated a sixth straight win against England, and inflicted just the second home defeat of Jones\u2019 three-season tenure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously devastated,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut you take the good with the bad and we learned a lot.\u201d\n\nThere was plenty of good early on as Ashton, making his first start in four years, repaid Jones\u2019 faith with a second-minute try.\n\nEngland\u2019s backs swung left, taking the All Black defense with them as Ashton held his position on the right wing. The alert Ben Youngs spotted him and sent a long pass for the wing to become the first England player to score three tries against New Zealand.\n\nFarrell missed the conversion, but brought up his 700th England point soon after.\n\nAn overthrown All Blacks lineout allowed England to attack, and Youngs found Farrell for a dropped goal after 10 minutes.\n\nNew Zealand continued to make errors and England, enjoying momentum, chose to kick a penalty to the corner than at the posts. Itoje made the lineout catch, England drove, and Hartley\u2019s try made the All Blacks look completely helpless.\n\nFarrell\u2019s conversion made it 15-0 and the All Blacks were unnerved. Barrett, up for a third world player of the year award, was making sloppy kicks.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s resolve was tested further when center Sonny Bill Williams was forced off with a shoulder injury a half hour in. Yet, they found their groove.\n\n\u201cWe had to roll our sleeves up,\u201d lock Brodie Retallick said. \u201cThe conditions didn\u2019t allow us to play exactly how we wanted to and I think we finally did that.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie, who had been the All Blacks\u2019 biggest threat, ran a smart angle on the inside of Barrett and scored, setting up an easy conversion with halftime near.\n\nFarrell kicked the restart straight into touch, and the All Blacks used the last chance to attack and earn a penalty in front of the posts. Barrett obliged, and while 15-10 behind, New Zealand carried momentum into the second half.\n\nThe All Blacks missed a try when a McKenzie break was wasted by Aaron Smith, but Barrett produced a dropped goal for 15-13.\n\nEngland came close to responding immediately as it tried another attacking lineout rather than a penalty kick but prop Kyle Sinckler spilled the ball.\n\n\u201cWe score points there we win the game,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAnother bad throw-in by Jamie George wasted another England chance, but Barrett made no mistake with a penalty kick to put the All Blacks ahead with 20 minutes remaining.\n\nNew Zealand looked like accelerating in the rain as more errors crept into England\u2019s play, but roared on by the 80,000-strong crowd, the home side rallied impressively.\n\n\u201cI thought we played the final 20 exceptionally well,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s where New Zealand generally run away from teams in that area and they couldn\u2019t break us.\u201d\n\nLawes charged down replacement scrumhalf TJ Perenara, and Underhill twisted Barrett to score in the left corner.

But without the leader of the world\u2019s only remaining superpower, the forum will lose some of its sense.\n\nEurope feels deeply threatened, meanwhile, by Trump\u2019s declared plan to pull the U.S. out a nuclear treaty with Russia that Europeans see as a cornerstone of post-Cold War peace and their own security. The U.S. says Russia is violating it anyway.\n\nThe tension overshadowed the two presidents\u2019 latest meeting Saturday at the French presidential palace. A French official present at the meeting said Macron made the point that in making decisions about treaties like the one Trump said he would abandon, the U.S. \u201cshould not forget something under your nose, which is European allies.\u201d\n\nMost Americans have never heard of the treaty that\u2019s being scrapped, but it has a clear meaning for European policymakers. The 1987 Intermediary-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty grew out of years of friction over a Soviet nuclear buildup and a threatened retaliatory U.S. missile deployment in Europe.\n\nMacron has warned that if the treaty is scrapped and Russia resumes building the kind of missiles it banned, the weapons could easily reach European targets \u2014 but not the U.S.\n\nAnother sore point for Macron and Trump: the question of a joint European army, which Macron has championed but which could overlap with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nMacron said in an interview this week with Europe-1 radio that when it comes to the cyber-sphere and the threat to pull out of nuclear treaties, \u201cWe should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, the French leader talked about a European army. Trump lumped the two topics together and tweeted as Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d Macron wanted an army to defend Europe from the U.S.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet was especially wounding to Macron, one of the strongest U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nThe idea that Macron would see the United States as an adversary \u201cis totally against our alliance and our 250-year history. France and the U.S. have been side by side,\u201d another French official said, evoking World War I battlefields where U.S. and French soldiers fought on the same side and the nations\u2019 joint operation against Syria earlier this year.\n\nWhen Macron first took power, he expressed hope that he might be able to have a restraining influence on Trump, then newly elected like him.\n\nBut by pulling the United States out of a climate-change deal signed in Paris and other international deals that France embraces \u2014 and now, with his undiplomatic tweet before meeting Macron \u2014 Trump has made clear that the French leader is not holding the reins.\n\nMacron and his aides scrambled Saturday to clarify what the president views as the threats Europe faces today. Among them: Russia\u2019s political meddling and military buildup, as well as a sense that Trump is abandoning U.S. commitments to European allies.\n\nMacron pointed out that he pledged to boost France\u2019s military spending even before Trump upbraided NATO members last year for not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe tense exchange with Trump is just the latest challenge for Macron, who was seen as a bulwark against rising European nationalism when he was elected a year ago.\n\nThe pro-business, pro-EU president is increasingly weakened domestically for unpopular economic policies and isolated in Europe, where nationalist groups have gained ground.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press\u2019 WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

(Claudio Giovanni/ANSA via AP)\n\nFLORENCE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Italy will hope it dimmed talk of being replaced in the Six Nations after comfortably beating Georgia 28-17 on Saturday.\n\nThe Italians took the wooden spoon this year for the 13th time in 19 Six Nations, and the clamor has grown that they be substituted by Georgia, which has ruled the European second-tier championship.\n\nBut after conceding the first try to Georgia center Tamaz Mchedlidze, Italy pulled away from the middle of the first half to the middle of the second with consecutive tries to center Michele Campagnaro, wing Mattia Bellini, lock Dean Budd, and flyhalf Tommaso Allan. Georgia finished with a penalty try but was easily second-best to Italy in their first matchup in 15 years.\n\nItaly will move back above Georgia when the world rankings are updated on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a really top team,\u201d Italy coach Conor O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIn the past 12 months we have beaten only Fiji and Japan. It was a fundamental victory for this group today against Georgia.\n\n\u201cAfter today I\u2019m confident that people will look at our future with more belief seeing that in the past year only this match has been talked about. After this win, with less pressure, we are convinced that we can only get better.\u201d\n\nItaly was without talismanic captain Sergio Parisse, who has a calf injury. And perhaps because they were favored for once, the Azzurri started nervously although Allan kicked the hosts ahead with an early penalty.\n\nGeorgia then scored, Mchedlidze touching down beside the posts after Campagnaro failed hopelessly with a tackle.\n\nCampagnaro atoned for his error almost immediately. A great team move from Italy saw them spread the ball to the left and then to the right before Campagnaro forced his way over through three Georgia players. Allan converted for 10-7.\n\n\u201cMistakes can happen but there I did a really huge one,\u201d Campagnaro said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how you react afterwards and that\u2019s what we did. Luckily I made up for it.\u201d\n\nMatiashvili missed a penalty and matters grew worse for Georgia when flanker Giorgi Tsutskiridze was shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle.\n\nItaly almost immediately made the extra man count as it forced the ball over, but the try was disallowed on video review.\n\nThe Azzurri went through nearly 20 phases to close on the tryline, but earned only a penalty which Allan kicked over.\n\nItaly eventually got its second try in the 39th, after Tsutskiridze rejoined the match. From a lineout inside Georgia\u2019s 22, Tito Tebaldi picked out Bellini to score in the left corner for 18-7 at halftime.\n\nItaly started the second half in the same way it ended the first. Andrea Lovotti was stopped close to the line but Budd was there to take the ball and go over.\n\nAllan didn\u2019t convert again but he scored Italy\u2019s fourth try in the 57th, breaking from halfway and racing uninterrupted down the left flank.\n\nItaly\u2019s 18-point advantage was deserved, but it was cut to 11 for most of the last quarter after center Tommaso Benvenuti was yellow-carded and Georgia was awarded a penalty try.\n\n\u201cWhen it was 28-7 I thought the end of the match would be different and we could play with more freedom and score again,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cThere was a different finale thanks to the penalty try which gave Georgia so much energy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "CULLOWHEE, N.C.

A recovery plan released late last year by federal agencies identified the Snake River below the dams as the best spot for boosting the number of naturally reproducing spawning fish for the cold-water species.\n\nIdaho Power cites studies by scientists with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries that concluded changing the water temperature standards would not harm salmon.\n\nBut the change could reduce the cost of electricity, the company said, saving customers up to $100 million over 50 years.\n\nWhen the water temperature standards aren\u2019t met, Idaho Power must pay for mitigation for potentially harming fall chinook. The proposed temperature standard change would mean Idaho Power would have to pay for less mitigation. Mitigation work involves improving habitat upstream of the dams with the goal of reducing water temperatures.\n\nSpecifically, the new proposed temperature standards would raise the allowable water temperature below the dams from 55.4 degrees to 58 degrees from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6.\n\nThose two weeks are critical for fall chinook that are spawning and putting eggs in river bed gravel that might not survive if the water gets too warm.\n\nIdaho Power said river temperatures under the current standard have never been met, with records going back to 1991. The company said the new standard wouldn\u2019t be met in most years, but the level of mitigation to pay would still be less than under the current standard.\n\nIdaho Power\u2019s 50-year license for the Hells Canyon Complex with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expired in 2005, and it has been operating the dams under annual licenses renewed each August.\n\nIdaho Power officials have said the temperature standards are related to the relicensing but are also a stand-alone issue the company would like to get resolved.\n\nIdaho Power supplies electricity to nearly 534,000 customers in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon.

(AP) \u2014 The suspect charged with capital murder in the shooting of an off-duty Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper has been released from jail.\n\nAttorneys for Troy Anthony Eaton, 43, of Rienzi, said their client was released Friday shortly after Tippah County Circuit Court Judge Andrew Howorth set bond at $200,000 on the capital murder charge and $100,000 on an attempted murder charge.\n\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports Eaton faces charges in the death of 32-year-old Trooper Josh Smith. The incident happened near the Hatchie River south of Walnut on Sept. 30 in a rural, isolated area near the Alcorn/Tippah County line.\n\nAttorney Jamie Franks has said Eaton was defending himself and others.\n\nThe judge also granted a motion by the state to postpone a preliminary hearing that was set for next week. Holding a preliminary hearing would be \u201cpremature and could be detrimental to the integrity of the investigation,\u201d the motion requesting the continuance stated.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the investigation is still fluid and ongoing by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation,\u201d the motion states.\n\nThe motion also noted that Eaton\u2019s attorneys want subpoenas issued to several officials and agencies. The defense attorneys are seeking information on Smith, such as toxicology reports, employment records, 911 calls and other documents.\n\nPrior to his release Friday, Eaton had been held in jail without bond for about 40 days. He turned himself in on Sept. 30, hours after the shooting.\n\nThe bond includes conditions that Eaton not have any contact with Smith\u2019s family, Tippah County District Attorney Ben Creekmore said.\n\nThe charging affidavit against Eaton alleges that he killed Smith knowing that Smith was acting in an official capacity as a law enforcement officer. But the defense attorneys have said there are a \u201cmultitude of witnesses\u201d who support the claim that Eaton was exercising his legal right to self-defense when Smith, who was off-duty, was fatally shot.\n\nCreekmore said he is not aware of anything that would indicate that Eaton is not properly charged.\n\nEaton is also charged with the attempted murder of Rickie Dale Vick, 38, of Michigan City.\n\nTippah County Coroner Chris McCallister has said it appears that Eaton was sitting inside a vehicle on the passenger side when he allegedly shot and killed Smith. It appears Smith was standing outside the vehicle when he was shot once in the head/face area, McCallister has said.\n\nWitnesses said Smith was armed with a firearm when he was fatally shot, Davis said.\n\nIt is unclear when the case may be presented to a grand jury, said Creekmore, adding that it depends on how long it takes MBI to complete its investigation. The next regular grand jury will be in April.\n\nEaton was allegedly beat up inside the Tippah County Jail a few days after his arrest and was relocated to Marshall County to ensure his safety, Franks said. The FBI said it was looking into the jail-beating allegation to see if there were any civil rights violations.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com", "Pepperdine postpones game vs Northridge because of wildfires\n\nMALIBU, Calif.

(AP) \u2014 FJ Thompson headed to a polling site to vote in the Navajo Nation election this week only to be told it had run out of ballots.\n\nShe and about 30 others waited outside the Breadsprings Chapter in northwestern New Mexico thinking someone might pull up with more. As it got darker and within a half-hour of the polling site closing, she decided to leave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, the first thing I thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a rigged election. Somebody is not properly giving all the ballots they need for chapters.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe complaints were widespread across the Navajo Nation, where voters were choosing a new president to oversee the country\u2019s largest Native American reservation and representatives to the 24-member Tribal Council. Two days later, election officials offered a solution: Anyone who left their name at a polling site with no more ballots has a week to vote at one of a handful of election offices, starting Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhile many factors contributed to the issues that occurred, we understand that every registered voter has the right to have their vote counted, and we are doing our best to assure that happens,\u201d the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors said in a statement.\n\nThe ballot shortage was traced to a two-part referendum that asked Navajos whether they wanted to increase the salary of top elected leaders. Voting machines rejected overmarked ballots, and second ballots were issued, resulting in a shortage, tribal officials said.\n\nSome precincts issued photo-copied ballots after they ran out. People elsewhere were told to leave their names, numbers and other identifying information. But the tribe\u2019s election supervisors said those instructions didn\u2019t reach some precincts in remote places.\n\nWould-be voters were upset and felt disenfranchised. They weren\u2019t sure they would be contacted.\n\nMarlena Pino kept her cellphone close as she left a precinct south of Gallup, New Mexico, on Tuesday, more than two hours from where she lives.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say wait around or anything.

Mark Freeland is ahead in unofficial results for the seat representing Crownpoint, New Mexico, and nearby communities.\n\nHe said he is not declaring himself the winner. Absentee and provisional ballots still need to be counted, and he wasn\u2019t sure if people were turned away from voting in his race.\n\n\u201cEveryone should have the right and ability to vote to have their voices be heard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tribe\u2019s election supervisors announced Friday that they fired elections director Edbert Little, saying the office needed a \u201cnew direction.\u201d He was appointed in April 2017.\n\nThe election comes during a year when tens of thousands of Navajos were purged from the voting rolls. The tribe\u2019s election office generally removes voters in odd years if they don\u2019t cast ballots in two consecutive, major elections. The purge took place earlier this year because it hadn\u2019t been done as scheduled, election officials said. Not all those removed re-registered.\n\nEdison Wauneka, who served 13 years as the tribe\u2019s elections director and left the position almost two years ago, said ballot shortages were rare. He recalled times when a couple of precincts had a surprisingly high turnout and ballots weren\u2019t available and when a polling site didn\u2019t open on time, forcing a re-election in a council race. He said even with the spoiled ballots this time, \u201cthere shouldn\u2019t have been that many who ran out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to have them vote after the polls are closed,\u201d he said.\n\nWauneka was leading his opponent in a council race by 49 votes.\n\nThompson might have to take leave from work to cast a late ballot, depending on whether she can vote late in Window Rock, a 20-minute drive, or the election office in Crownpoint, an hour away.\n\n\u201cThey always say, \u2018If you don\u2019t vote, why complain?\u2019\u201d she said Friday. \u201cI\u2019m still complaining because I didn\u2019t get a chance to vote. That\u2019s my right to vote.\u201d\n\nTribal officials say the number of people who could not vote won\u2019t be known until early next week when election offices submit their reports.\n\nThe election supervisors generally certify results within 10 days of the election following a grievance period. But they said they\u2019ll wait until the late ballots are cast.\n\nThe ballot shortages did not affect voting for non-tribal races. Those elections are run separately from the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe closest tribal election office for Carol Davis is at least a 90-mile (145-kilometer) drive. She was waiting in her vehicle in Dilkon on Tuesday with a child when her husband returned to say the last ballot had been given to the person ahead of him.

(AP Photo/Tim Ireland)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 New Zealand survived a late scare to hold on for a 16-15 comeback victory over England at Twickenham in their first matchup in four years on Saturday.\n\nEngland thought it secured a rare victory over the world champion when Sam Underhill touched down five minutes from fulltime, but video review revealed Courtney Lawes was offside when he made a chargedown to launch the move.\n\nEngland made a dream start as Chris Ashton and co-captain Dylan Hartley scored tries either side of an Owen Farrell dropped goal for 15-0 after 24 minutes.\n\nNew Zealand struck back through fullback Damian McKenzie near halftime, then a crucial kickoff error from Farrell allowed the All Blacks to close the deficit to five points at the break.\n\nBoth sides had opportunities for more tries after in the second half but chances were repeatedly spurned in the spoiling rain. Beauden Barrett\u2019s dropped goal and penalty put the All Blacks ahead on the hour mark, setting up a dramatic finale.\n\nAfter upsetting the Springboks by a point, an even better England performance gave Eddie Jones\u2019 side plenty of reason for optimism less than a year out from the Rugby World Cup in Japan.\n\nBut beating the All Blacks remains elusive, and the visitors celebrated a sixth straight win against England.\n\nHaving taken until the second half to make it into the Springboks\u2019 22 a week ago, England made the perfect start as Ashton, making his first start in four years, repaid Jones\u2019 faith with a second-minute try.\n\nEngland\u2019s backs swung left, taking the All Black defense with them as Ashton held his position on the right wing. The alert Ben Youngs spotted him and sent a long pass for the wing to become the first England player to score three tries against New Zealand.\n\nFarrell missed the conversion, but brought up his 700th England point soon after.\n\nAn overthrown All Blacks lineout allowed England to attack, and Youngs found Farrell for a dropped goal after 10 minutes.\n\nNew Zealand continued to make errors and England, enjoying momentum, chose to kick a penalty to the corner than at the posts. Itoje made the lineout catch, England drove, and Hartley\u2019s try made the All Blacks look completely helpless.\n\nFarrell\u2019s conversion made it 15-0 and the All Blacks were unnerved. Barrett, up for a third world player of the year award, was making sloppy kicks.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s resolve was tested further when center Sonny Bill Williams was forced off with a shoulder injury a half hour in. Yet, they found their groove.\n\nMcKenzie, who had been the All Blacks\u2019 biggest threat, ran a smart angle on the inside of Barrett and scored, setting up an easy conversion with halftime near.\n\nFarrell kicked the restart straight into touch, and the All Blacks used the last chance to attack and earn a penalty in front of the posts. Barrett obliged, and while 15-10 behind, New Zealand carried momentum into the second half.\n\nThe All Blacks missed a try when a McKenzie break was wasted by Aaron Smith, but Barrett produced a dropped goal to make it 15-13.\n\nEngland tried another attacking lineout rather than a penalty kick but prop Kyle Sinckler spilled the ball.\n\nAnother bad throw-in by Jamie George wasted another England chance, but Barrett made no mistake with a penalty kick to put the All Blacks ahead with 20 minutes remaining.\n\nNew Zealand looked like accelerating in the rain as more errors crept into England\u2019s play, but roared on by the 80,000-strong crowd, the home side rallied impressively.\n\nLawes charged down replacement scrumhalf TJ Perenara, and Underhill twisted McKenzie to score in the left corner. But on TMO advice, referee Jerome Garces made the call against Lawes, who was in front of the last foot at a ruck.\n\nThree seasons into Jones\u2019 reign, England lost for only the second time at home.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "MEMPHIS, Tenn.

(AP Photo/Steve Yeater)\n\nJimmy Butler has his wish: He\u2019s out of Minnesota.\n\nAnd just like that, Philadelphia has a new Big Three \u2014 one that could make serious noise in the Eastern Conference.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation said Saturday that Butler is being traded to the 76ers in a package that will send Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been announced by either team and was still pending NBA approval, which is not expected until Monday.\n\nJustin Patton will also be sent to Philadelphia, and Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick are also going to Minnesota, the person said.\n\nThe Athletic first reported the agreement.\n\nBecause the trade was not official, Sixers coach Brett Brown had little comment.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak much about it. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said before the Sixers played Memphis.\n\nSixers guard T.J. McConnell said he learned of the deal through social media.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was true until more reports started coming out,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of that feeling in your stomach of just like, I mean, you can\u2019t really explain it. I was in disbelief.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s \u201cProcess\u201d led it to the second round of the playoffs last season behind two of the game\u2019s youngest, brightest stars in big man Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. Butler, an elite wing player and outstanding defender, will join them in a quest to rule the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James is out West with the Los Angeles Lakers following eight straight trips to the NBA Finals with Miami and Cleveland.\n\n\u201cI think they were a contender before,\u201d James said, giving his reaction to the deal Saturday. \u201cSo it only enhances what they\u2019re able to do. I mean, they\u2019ve got Ben and Joel and now you\u2019re adding Jimmy. I think that\u2019s a very, very good team.\u201d\n\nThe first order of business will be making the trade official, so Butler can debut for Philly either Monday at Miami or Wednesday at Orlando. The next step for Philadelphia will be coming to an agreement on an extension for Butler, a pending free agent who made clear to Minnesota that he would not be re-signing there in 2019.\n\nTranslated: The Wolves had to trade him, or they would lose him for nothing.\n\nThe drama has been constant from Butler\u2019s first practice with the Wolves this season, and the team\u2019s start while waiting for this inevitable move has been lousy. Minnesota finished a 0-5 road trip with a loss in Sacramento on Friday night and is 4-9 overall \u2014 winless in eight games on the road.\n\nButler played in 10 of those games, averaging 21.3 points. It was a peculiar arrangement; the Timberwolves were still running things through him often, even while the worst-kept secret in the NBA was that he wanted a change of address. Plenty of teams were mentioned along the way \u2014 Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami among them \u2014 as top candidates.\n\n\u201cI think him getting a fresh start on a team like ours will be beneficial to both sides,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nButler, 29, has been an All-Star in each of the last four seasons. There are also concerns, though they clearly didn\u2019t put off Philadelphia. Butler has missed at least 15 games in four of the last five seasons, including a career-high 23 games last year while dealing with a knee injury.\n\nPhiladelphia, who had just nine available players against the Grizzlies in part because of the pending move, will become Butler\u2019s third team, after Chicago and Minnesota. He\u2019s a career 16.5 point-per-game scorer, though that is skewed by his first two seasons, which were meager on the scoring front. He\u2019s on pace this season to average at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive year.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the best sports city in America,\u201d quarterback Carson Wentz of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles tweeted to Butler.\n\nSaric is in his third season and averaging 11.1 points, shooting only 36 percent. Covington had been a starter for Philadelphia for the bulk of the last four-plus seasons and is averaging 11.3 points per game this year.\n\nPhiladelphia and Minnesota don\u2019t meet until Jan. 15. Butler\u2019s return trip to Minnesota this season would be March 30, when he\u2019s sure to be showered with boos from a Target Center crowd that jeered him at the beginning of the home opener before quickly letting up. Butler had 33 points on 10-for-12 shooting from the floor in 36 minutes that night against Cleveland, a reminder amid the drama why coach Tom Thibodeau was so eager to acquire him the year before.\n\nThibodeau swung a draft-night deal with Chicago that sent Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and a first-round pick that became Lauri Markkanen to the Bulls for Butler and a later first-rounder Minnesota used on Patton. In the wake of that move, long-frustrated Wolves fans figured they were finally on their way to contending in the Western Conference for the first time since the Kevin Garnett era ended.\n\nPaired with Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins, the first overall picks in the 2015 and 2014 drafts, respectively, Butler immediately provided the experience, tenacity and defense the Wolves were missing, in addition to his scoring touch. He loved playing for Thibodeau, his coach for his first five seasons with the Bulls, and they helped Minnesota get to the playoffs last spring for the first time in 14 years.\n\nBut the roster never truly meshed. And now, a new start awaits them all.\n\n___\n\nAP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami, AP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and freelancer Clay Bailey in Memphis, Tennessee, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "YORKTOWN, Va.

The alliance aims to eliminate human deaths from rabies by the year 2030.\n\n\u201cThe key to saving human lives is preventing canine rabies,\u201d Wixsom said. \u201cCanine vaccination prevents the disease in humans by stopping the disease at its source.

As U.S. Catholic bishops gather for an important national assembly, the clergy sex abuse crisis dominates their agenda. But it's only one of several daunting challenges facing the nation's largest religious denomination. While federal and state law enforcement agencies widen their investigations of abuse, the church finds itself with ever fewer priests and nuns in service. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nAs U.S. Catholic bishops gather for their national assembly next week, the clergy sex abuse crisis dominates their agenda amid calls from critics that church leaders finally bring about meaningful reforms to root out misbehaving priests.\n\nThe three-day assembly that starts Monday in Baltimore comes after a series of abuse scandals this year that have been stunning in their magnitude and number.\n\nBishops have several reforms under consideration to craft a stronger response to the scandals, but some Catholic activists are demanding further steps, including releasing the names of all clergy accused of abuse and giving a greater voice to abuse victims. One coalition of concerned Catholics, the 5 Theses movement, plans to post its proposals for reform on church doors in Baltimore and elsewhere on Sunday.\n\nThe abuse crisis is foremost among several challenges confronting Catholic leaders, who face conflicting pressures on the role of women and LGBT people in the church. And even though the Catholic population in the U.S. has been growing, most Catholics attend Mass rarely, and the number of active priests and nuns continues to decline.\n\nSetting the tone for the national assembly, the president of the bishops\u2019 conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, asked his fellow bishops to spend the preceding seven days in \u201cintensified\u201d prayer, fasting and reparation.\n\nThe bishops will consider new steps to police their own ranks during abuse cases, and will likely approve an investigation by lay law enforcement experts of the handling of the scandal surrounding the former cardinal in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cBishops are under intense scrutiny and pressure to deliver on both of these items,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Berg, admissions director at St. Joseph\u2019s Seminary in Yonkers, New York.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis removed U.S. church leader Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up his misconduct.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging that more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nIn Baltimore, the bishops will consider several proposals approved by a committee in September. They include developing a code of conduct for bishops regarding sexual abuse and harassment, and establishing a confidential hotline \u2014 to be run by a third party \u2014 to receive allegations of sexual misconduct by bishops and relay them to appropriate church and civil authorities.\n\nThe committee also endorsed a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the McCarrick case that would give a role to lay law enforcement experts.\n\nCritics have urged the bishops to go further by allowing outside investigators full access to church sex-abuse records and by supporting changes to statute-of-limitation laws so that more cases of long-ago sex abuse could be addressed in court.\n\nAnother recommendation came from a sex abuse task force at Villanova University in Philadelphia, one of the country\u2019s top Catholic schools. It said the bishops\u2019 conference should require all bishops to become mandatory reporters of suspected sexual abuse \u2014 in the same category as school teachers, social workers and others who work with children.\n\nThe step has been avoided thus far despite \u201cthe nefarious actions of certain bishops surreptitiously transferring sexually abusive priests from parish to parish, and in some cases from diocese to diocese, without notifying civil authorities of the suspected abuse,\u201d the task force said. \u201cAmerican bishops should never have the option of looking the other way and remaining silent again.\u201d\n\nMost states include clergy among mandatory reporters, but some do not.\n\nThe abuse crisis overlaps with increasing tensions in the U.S. Catholic church over its approach to LGBT people. Some conservative activists have blamed the sex abuse on the presence of gay men in the priesthood, even though church-commissioned studies have disputed that claim. There\u2019s also been a conservative backlash to efforts by some liberal Catholic leaders to promote a more welcoming attitude toward gays.\n\nThe priest at a church in Chicago burned a rainbow banner, angering the local LGBT community, and was subsequently removed from his post by Chicago\u2019s archbishop. A gay employee at a Catholic church in San Diego resigned after being subjected to sustained harassment and vandalism. And conservatives have forced the cancellation of several scheduled speeches by the Rev. James Martin, a prominent Jesuit priest whose book urges more vigorous Catholic outreach to the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe hatred is breathtaking,\u201d Martin tweeted last week, describing a series of insults leveled at him online and in person.\n\nMartin says the U.S. bishops are divided over the merits of LGBT outreach.\n\n\u201cThe majority are suspicious or struggling; the minority are welcoming and accepting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep rift.\u201d\n\nThe church faces similar pressures over the role of women. U.S.-based groups urging the Vatican to allow women to become priests have made little headway, but they remain active \u2014 in some cases appealing for a policy change to let women serve as deacons.\n\nAware of such sentiments, bishops and priests attending a multinational Vatican meeting last month called for a greater presence of women in church decision making.\n\nAll these challenges coincide with relentless demographic pressures.

As U.S. Catholic bishops gather for an important national assembly, the clergy sex abuse crisis dominates their agenda. But it's only one of several daunting challenges facing the nation's largest religious denomination. While federal and state law enforcement agencies widen their investigations of abuse, the church finds itself with ever fewer priests and nuns in service. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nAs U.S. Catholic bishops gather for their national assembly next week, the clergy sex abuse crisis dominates their agenda amid calls from critics that church leaders finally bring about meaningful reforms to root out misbehaving priests.\n\nThe three-day assembly that starts Monday in Baltimore comes after a series of abuse scandals this year that have been stunning in their magnitude and number.\n\nBishops have several reforms under consideration to craft a stronger response to the scandals, but some Catholic activists are demanding further steps, including releasing the names of all clergy accused of abuse and giving a greater voice to abuse victims. One coalition of concerned Catholics, the 5 Theses movement, plans to post its proposals for reform on church doors in Baltimore and elsewhere on Sunday.\n\nThe abuse crisis is foremost among several challenges confronting Catholic leaders, who face conflicting pressures on the role of women and LGBT people in the church. And even though the Catholic population in the U.S. has been growing, most Catholics attend Mass rarely, and the number of active priests and nuns continues to decline.\n\nSetting the tone for the national assembly, the president of the bishops\u2019 conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, asked his fellow bishops to spend the preceding seven days in \u201cintensified\u201d prayer, fasting and reparation.\n\nThe bishops will consider new steps to police their own ranks during abuse cases, and will likely approve an investigation by lay law enforcement experts of the handling of the scandal surrounding the former cardinal in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cBishops are under intense scrutiny and pressure to deliver on both of these items,\u201d said the Rev. Thomas Berg, admissions director at St. Joseph\u2019s Seminary in Yonkers, New York.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis removed U.S. church leader Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up his misconduct.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging that more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nIn Baltimore, the bishops will consider several proposals approved by a committee in September. They include developing a code of conduct for bishops regarding sexual abuse and harassment, and establishing a confidential hotline \u2014 to be run by a third party \u2014 to receive allegations of sexual misconduct by bishops and relay them to appropriate church and civil authorities.\n\nThe committee also endorsed a \u201cfull investigation\u201d into the McCarrick case that would give a role to lay law enforcement experts.\n\nCritics have urged the bishops to go further by allowing outside investigators full access to church sex-abuse records and by supporting changes to statute-of-limitation laws so that more cases of long-ago sex abuse could be addressed in court.\n\nAnother recommendation came from a sex abuse task force at Villanova University in Philadelphia, one of the country\u2019s top Catholic schools. It said the bishops\u2019 conference should require all bishops to become mandatory reporters of suspected sexual abuse \u2014 in the same category as school teachers, social workers and others who work with children.\n\nThe step has been avoided thus far despite \u201cthe nefarious actions of certain bishops surreptitiously transferring sexually abusive priests from parish to parish, and in some cases from diocese to diocese, without notifying civil authorities of the suspected abuse,\u201d the task force said. \u201cAmerican bishops should never have the option of looking the other way and remaining silent again.\u201d\n\nMost states include clergy among mandatory reporters, but some do not.\n\nThe abuse crisis overlaps with increasing tensions in the U.S. Catholic church over its approach to LGBT people. Some conservative activists have blamed the sex abuse on the presence of gay men in the priesthood, even though church-commissioned studies have disputed that claim. There\u2019s also been a conservative backlash to efforts by some liberal Catholic leaders to promote a more welcoming attitude toward gays.\n\nThe priest at a church in Chicago burned a rainbow banner, angering the local LGBT community, and was subsequently removed from his post by Chicago\u2019s archbishop. A gay employee at a Catholic church in San Diego resigned after being subjected to sustained harassment and vandalism. And conservatives have forced the cancellation of several scheduled speeches by the Rev. James Martin, a prominent Jesuit priest whose book urges more vigorous Catholic outreach to the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cThe hatred is breathtaking,\u201d Martin tweeted last week, describing a series of insults leveled at him online and in person.\n\nMartin says the U.S. bishops are divided over the merits of LGBT outreach.\n\n\u201cThe majority are suspicious or struggling; the minority are welcoming and accepting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep rift.\u201d\n\nThe church faces similar pressures over the role of women. U.S.-based groups urging the Vatican to allow women to become priests have made little headway, but they remain active \u2014 in some cases appealing for a policy change to let women serve as deacons.\n\nAware of such sentiments, bishops and priests attending a multinational Vatican meeting last month called for a greater presence of women in church decision making.\n\nAll these challenges coincide with relentless demographic pressures. According to the latest data from Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, the number of Catholic priests in the U.S. has fallen from 59,192 in 1970 to 37,181 last year, the number of nuns has dropped from 160,931 to 45,605. The number of parishes without a resident priest has risen from 571 to 3,552.\n\nAccording to the center, the number of Catholics in the U.S. rose from 47.9 million to 68.5 million over that period, but a majority of them now attend church only a few times a year.\n\n___\n\nFollow David Crary at https://twitter.com/CraryAP", "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

(AP Photo/Kyusung Gong)\n\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a one-time speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan who later became Russia\u2019s leading defender on Capitol Hill and an outspoken advocate for legalized marijuana, was defeated Saturday, a victim of California\u2019s Democratic tilt and voters\u2019 distaste for President Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher, 71, was beaten by real estate executive Harley Rouda, 56, a Republican-turned-Democrat who pilloried the congressman for his skepticism over climate change and depicted him as an out-of-touch abettor in Washington gridlock.\n\nWith votes continuing to be counted, Rouda\u2019s edge grew steadily. The vote count updated Saturday showed Rouda with 52 percent of the vote and about 8,500 more votes than Rohrabacher.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s ouster from his seat in Orange County has historical and symbolic significance. The county southeast of Los Angeles was home to President Richard Nixon and long considered a foundational block in the modern conservative movement. Reagan himself likened it to a Republican heaven.\n\nOrange County was once a Republican lock on Election Day, said Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science at Chapman University.\n\n\u201cTheir lock is over,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Rouda\u2019s win, Democrats have picked off two GOP seats either all or partly in the county since Tuesday\u2019s election, and are threatening in two others. Democrat Mike Levin this week captured the seat long held by retiring Rep. Darrell Issa, which cuts through the southern end of the county. Democrats have also seized a GOP-held seat north of Los Angeles.\n\nRouda credited his victory to support from \u201cvoters across the political spectrum.\u201d In a statement, he said he intends to be \u201chonest, transparent, accessible and tireless\u201d in Washington.\n\nRohrabacher\u2019s campaign said in a statement that tens of thousands of ballots remain uncounted, and the campaign will have a statement once the vote count is complete.\n\nDemocrats had targeted seven GOP-held House districts in California this year that were carried by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, including Rohrabacher\u2019s 48th. They\u2019ve now won three of those seats, with the potential to pick up three more and pad their new majority in the House.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter is inching closer to Republican U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County\u2019s 45th District. In the nearby 39th District held by retiring GOP Rep. Ed Royce his protege, Republican Young Kim, sees her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros tightening.\n\nIn central California\u2019s farm belt, Democrat Josh Harder grabbed a nearly 2-point lead after a vote count update Friday after trailing Rep. Jeff Denham in the 10th District.\n\nFor state Republicans, Rohrabacher\u2019s defeat represents another stinging blow for a party that has seen its fortunes wither for years. Democrats hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Legislature and a 3.7 million advantage in voter registrations. With Rouda\u2019s win, Democrats will hold at least a 42-11 edge in California U.S. House seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have tumbled to third-party status in the state: they are even outnumbered by registered independents.\n\nBehind the shift: A surge in immigrants in recent decades transformed the state and its voting patterns. In Orange County, largely white, conservative homeowners once delivered winning margins for GOP candidates year after year. But most of the state\u2019s new voters, Hispanics and Asians, are Democrats or independents.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to discount the influence of Trump, who lost California by over 4 million votes in 2016. California is home to the so-called Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d which has stood in opposition to his policies on the environment and immigration.\n\nRohrabacher reflects the dramatic shift of fortunes in Orange County: He was re-elected by nearly 17 points just two years but met his end when Democrats backed a wealthy, pro-business moderate in Rouda.\n\nRohrabacher has long been an unusual figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe one-time Cold Warrior transformed into an outspoken supporter of improved ties with Russia, and his name has come up in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election; he has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was heard on tape in 2016 saying Rohrabacher was being paid by Russian President Vladimir Putin. McCarthy\u2019s office said the comments at a private meeting, disclosed by the Washington Post, were misconstrued and McCarthy was joking with colleagues.\n\nIn the campaign, Rohrabacher was faced with the prospect of making his Reagan-era conservative views appealing to newer voters, while holding college-educated Republican women who polls suggest are turned off by Trump.\n\nHis departure from Congress will mark a milestone of sorts. He\u2019s one of the last members of Congress who served in the Reagan administration.\n\nThe guitar-strumming, surfing congressman apparently saw the danger coming. He positioned himself as a maverick willing to buck both parties.\n\nRepublican Party mailers never mentioned he was a Republican.\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael R.

Walker has been in elected office since 1993 when he was 25-years-old. (Steve Apps /Wisconsin State Journal via AP, File)\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker leaves office in January, he faces being out of work and off the government payroll for the first time in more than a quarter-century.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t said yet what he plans to do next, but at 51, there\u2019s plenty of time for Walker to mount a political comeback. Or, as he hinted on the campaign trail, he could go in a completely different direction and join the ministry like his father did.\n\n\u201cThe poor guy, he\u2019s got to consider all options,\u201d said former Gov. Tommy Thompson, who campaigned for Walker. \u201cBut first he has to get over the pain of losing. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nWalker has been in elected office since 1993, when he was 25. Other than a brief stint working for the American Red Cross after he dropped out of college in 1990, Walker\u2019s job has been politics. After nine years in the state Assembly, he spent eight years as Milwaukee County executive followed by eight more as governor.\n\nHis life has been focused on climbing the political ladder, and he wanted to go even higher. In 2015, Walker ran for president but dropped out that September. He rededicated himself to winning a third term as governor, but lost narrowly to Democrat Tony Evers, who painted Walker as a career politician who cares more about himself than the people of the state.\n\nWalker is not wealthy. Based on his most recent statement of economic interests, he has two retirement accounts each worth less than $50,000. He has three other funds valued between $15,000 and $150,000, total. He\u2019s carrying more than $100,000 in student loan debt and credit card debt between $15,000 and $150,000.\n\nWhen he was first elected governor in 2010, Walker kept living in his Wauwatosa home. But in 2016 he sold it and moved into the governor\u2019s residence, where he will live until his term ends on Jan. 7.\n\nOther former governors \u2014 most much older than Walker when they left \u2014 offer some clues about what he could do.\n\nThompson, 59 at the time, left midterm in 2001 to join then-President George W. Bush\u2019s administration as health secretary. After leaving that job in 2005, he made millions working as a health care consultant and lobbyist in Washington and sitting on corporate boards before an unsuccessful run for Senate in 2012. Conversely, Democrat Jim Doyle mostly retired after leaving the governor\u2019s office in 2011 at age 65 and largely dropped out of the public eye.\n\nThere are lots of options for Walker. He could join a television network as an analyst, make the rounds on the national speaking circuit, become a lobbyist or work behind the scenes for conservative groups or think tanks. He has friends in all of those worlds but has never shown much interest in any of them.\n\nThompson said he expected President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be interested in having Walker join in some capacity. Walker insisted after Trump\u2019s win that he didn\u2019t want to join his Cabinet or turn to lobbying to capitalize on his close relationship with House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is also leaving office.\n\nWalker could run for Senate in 2022. That\u2019s when Republican Sen. Ron Johnson\u2019s seat is up, and Johnson has said he doesn\u2019t plan to run again. But Walker has never expressed interest.\n\nStephan Thompson, a close friend of Walker\u2019s who ran his successful 2014 re-election campaign, said he anticipates Walker will be in demand to offer political and policy advice, both in Wisconsin and around the country.\n\n\u201cHe has a tremendous following around the country,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe\u2019s been successful because of his communication skills in advocating for conservative reforms.\u201d\n\nSince his defeat, Walker has kept to himself. What he has said, including a statement Wednesday conceding to Evers, has come through Twitter. Several of his messages, from Election Day and afterward, have been deeply religious.\n\nOne Bible verse Walker tweeted said, \u201cFor I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s father, Llew Walker, was a Baptist minister. He died in October, a month before Election Day.\n\nNot surprisingly, Scott Walker didn\u2019t say much publicly during the campaign about what he would do should he lose. When asked about it by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker told a story about his dad \u2014 a week before he died.\n\n\u201cA long, long time ago, when I was a kid and I\u2019d fill in for my dad once in a while, some of his church members ... were surprised I didn\u2019t go into the ministry,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo who knows, maybe I\u2019ll see what God\u2019s calling is. I don\u2019t know that it would be that specifically but maybe there\u2019s some calling related to that, some sort of ministry.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Scott Bauer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sbauerAP\n\n___\n\nSign up for \u201cPolitics in Focus,\u201d a weekly newsletter showcasing the AP\u2019s best political reporting from around the country leading up to the midterm elections: https://bit.ly/2ICEr3D", "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 Environmental regulators in Maine say a power company\u2019s application to build a 145-mile transmission line through the state is not complete.\n\nCentral Maine Power wants to build the $1 billion project.

At the same time, voters elected twice as many women as men to statewide office on Beacon Hill.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when women in high political office were still a relative rarity in Massachusetts\n\nJust a decade ago, in 2008, the only woman holding statewide office was then-Attorney General Martha Coakley, a Democrat. And the only woman on the state\u2019s then 10-member congressional delegation was Democratic U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas.\n\nThe hard-fought shift didn\u2019t go unnoticed Tuesday, when the election of women in Massachusetts and other states became a familiar theme.\n\nThe highest-profile woman on the Massachusetts ballot \u2014 Democratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 credited women with leading the fight against the Trump administration during her victory speech after winning a second, six-year term.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen white women learning from black women how to organize and mobilize. Older women partnering with younger women to take to the streets. Married, single, straight, lesbian and transwomen, rich and poor women, building alliances with each other and, yes, building alliances with the men who also want to make real change in this country,\u201d said Warren, who has promised to take \u201ca hard look\u201d at running for president in 2020.\n\nBoston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley \u2014 who defeated longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano in the Democratic primary \u2014 ran unopposed Tuesday to become the first black woman elected to the U.S. House from Massachusetts. She will represent the 7th Congressional District.\n\nPressley said black women face an added challenge running for office.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to women of color candidates, folks don\u2019t just talk about a glass ceiling. What they describe is a concrete one,\u201d Pressley said in her victory speech. \u201cBut you know what breaks through concrete? Seismic shifts.\u201d\n\nIn the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, Lori Trahan emerged the winner. During her victory speech Trahan, who grew up in Lowell, gave a shout-out to Tsongas, whose decision not to seek re-election led to a mad scramble to replace her.\n\nKatherine Clark, who first won election to the U.S. House in 2012 to represent the 5th Congressional District, also pointed to the gains made by women seeking office in Massachusetts, saying she was thrilled to welcome Pressley and Trahan to the delegation.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our history we will have a record number of women representing the commonwealth in Washington,\u201d Clark said in a statement after winning re-election.\n\nAt the Statehouse, voters re-elected Attorney General Maura Healey, Treasurer Deb Goldberg and Auditor Suzanne Bump \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, a Republican. They also re-elected two men \u2014 Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and Democratic state Secretary William Galvin.\n\nThe victories for women candidates weren\u2019t limited to statewide and congressional races.\n\nIn the Massachusetts House, Democrat Tram Nguyen defeated incumbent Republican state Rep. Jim Lyons from a district that includes Andover, while fellow first-time Democratic candidate Becca Rausch from Needham Heights defeated another Republican incumbent \u2014 state Sen. Richard Ross.\n\nAnd in Boston, Rachael Rollins, a former federal prosecutor, won election to become the city\u2019s first female district attorney and the first woman of color to hold such a job anywhere in Massachusetts. Rollins ran on the promise to help curb mass incarceration and racial disparities in the criminal justice system while building trust between communities and law enforcement.\n\nIn another sign of the growing political clout wielded by women on Beacon Hill, 2018 marked the first time in state history when an incumbent female Senate president (Harriette Chandler) passed the gavel to an incoming female Senate president (Karen Spilka).", "Lawrence Teen who took gun to school put on probation\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan.

(AP) \u2014 A super weed that can devastate corn and soybean crops has now been found in five North Dakota counties, but a university expert says there is still hope for preventing a widespread infestation of Palmer amaranth in the state.\n\nThe aggressive pigweed species can grow as tall as 7 feet and produce hundreds of thousands of seeds. It\u2019s strong enough to stop combines and resist many herbicides.\n\nIt\u2019s native to the desert regions of the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, but it has slowly spread to southeastern and Midwestern states and in recent years has moved into South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa.\n\nIt was first confirmed in soybeans in southeastern North Dakota\u2019s McIntosh County in August, and it now has been confirmed either by extension specialists or through laboratory analysis in Benson, Dickey, Foster and Richland counties, in soybeans, livestock feed and in the wild.\n\nThe infestations have been small, with officials in most cases pulling the plants by hand, according to Tom Peters, sugar beet agronomist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service.\n\n\u201cWe can manage these small fields of Palmer amaranth,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we allow it to become established, I think then it\u2019s going to change the way we grow crops in North Dakota.\u201d\n\nA heavy Palmer amaranth infestation can cut soybean yields by as much as 79 percent and corn yields by up to 91 percent, according to research by Purdue University. The threat from the weed is so great that NDSU Weed Science officials named it the \u201cweed of the year\u201d in both 2014 and 2015, even though it hadn\u2019t yet been found in the state.\n\nOfficials determined the weeds found in the past few months had a variety of likely sources \u2014 migratory birds, farm equipment, a railroad car and livestock feed brought in from out of state. All of the plants so far have been found in eastern North Dakota, which borders states where Palmer amaranth also is present.\n\nThe weed has not yet been found in Montana, but western North Dakota could still be susceptible, especially with the large amount of out-of-state hay trucked in during the 2017 drought, according to Peters.\n\nDiligence by farmers, other landowners, gardeners and even hunters is key to diminishing the threat, according to Peters. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring has encouraged farmers to scout fields this harvest, and the state Game and Fish Department has asked hunters to keep an eye out.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s great hope,\u201d Peters said. \u201cI think we have to continue what we\u2019ve been doing, and that\u2019s be curious, be suspicious.

You made us sing that.\u201d It is why Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha will always be held in deep regard by the people of Leicester, where soccer returned for the first time since the Thai entrepreneur\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe Boss\u201d was the simple message on many T-shirts as up to 20,000 people embarked on a mile-long walk to the stadium where two weeks ago the 60-year-old Vichai died when his helicopter spiraled out of control shortly after taking off from the center circle.\n\nIt is the field where Vichai lifted the English Premier League trophy in May 2016, the culmination of an incredible journey taking an unglamorous team from the second tier to the pinnacle of English soccer. That was the day when tears of joy followed as tenor Andrea Bocelli serenaded manager Claudio Ranieri.\n\n\u201cTime to Say Goodbye\u201d carried a new sorrowful significance on Saturday when a recording of Bocelli was played in King Power Stadium after Saturday\u2019s 0-0 draw against Burnley. Vichai\u2019s son, vice chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, led the players around the field to thank fans who held aloft white scarves emblazoned with \u201cForever in our hearts.\u201d Clutching a Thai flag, Aiyawatt was embraced by goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel at the end of a lap of appreciation as the team and supporters applauded.\n\nWatching on, Ranieri looked close to tears on his return to Leicester. The Italian, whose reign ended nine months after the 5,000-1 longshot\u2019s title win, returned to mourn the late chairman along with his predecessor and successor as manager.\n\n\u201cHis love and his passion helped us to achieve something amazing,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cSomething that will be remembered forever.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire bought the struggling club in 2010 while in the second tier. In an era of mega-rich super clubs winning the English top-flight seemed unattainable for unfashionable teams like Leicester. With investment in the squad, but not vast sums, Vichai made the impossible dream possible.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t support Leicester City to win things. Other people do that with other teams,\u201d fan Glyn Morgans, who has been coming to Leicester games since 1969, said on the 5,000-1 walk named after Leicester\u2019s title odds. \u201cLeicester people support Leicester because they are local people who love their local team.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Leicester is a name that resonates around the world.\n\n\u201cEven when we are on holiday people come up to us and say they are so pleased Leicester did it, a small club like Leicester,\u201d fan Margaret Bennett said as sunshine gave way to a downpour on the march to the stadium that was led by injured players, including defender Harry Maguire.\n\nThe hundreds of jerseys and floral tributes that amassed outside the stadium within days of the tragedy have been moved to an open space close to where Vichai\u2019s helicopter crashed in a ball of flames after the Oct. 27 night game against West Ham.\n\nGoalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was still in the stadium an hour after the final whistle when he watched Vichai\u2019s blue aircraft take off as normal from the field, and he waved off the chairman. It was soon spiraling out of control and Schmeichel raced to the fire in a carpark.\n\n\u201cWhat happened next will stay with me forever,\u201d Schmeichel said in a 100-page matchday magazine dedicated completely to the five victims of the helicopter crash. \u201cIt has replayed through my head every minute since, wishing there was something more I could have done. I stood for a long time at the police cordon at the back of the carpark ... tears streaming down my face.\u201d\n\nSchmeichel was among the players who flew briefly to Thailand a week ago to pay respects to Vichai at a Bangkok temple during a weeklong funeral ceremony.\n\nNow the entire club could commemorate Vichai on matchday. The stadium fell silent for five minutes before kickoff as a video tribute to Vichai was played on big screens before chants of \u201cVichai\u201d broke out. The day carried an additional poignancy as wreaths were also laid and an additional minute\u2019s silence held to mark 100 years since the end of World War I.\n\n\u201cThis week has been hard,\u201d Leicester winger Marc Albrighton said. \u201cLeicester fans have been brilliant for us and we need them. It\u2019s going to be a tough road. The lads are emotionally drained. Today was one of the hardest games I have ever played.\u201d\n\nBefore the game, club officials including Aiyawatt viewed the area that has become a makeshift memorial to his father a few minutes\u2019 walk from the stadium. The Leicester vice chairman, who is also known as Top, inspected the carpet of flowers that have been formed in front of a picture of Vichai and the word \u201cboss\u201d in blue and white flowers. Of the hundreds of soccer jerseys from Leicester and rival clubs that were placed outside the stadium in the days after the disaster, some now encircle the pitch while others have been placed on railings near the stadium.\n\nFans who traveled from the northwest city of Burnley added their only tributes and took inspiration from the 2016 success.\n\n\u201cEveryone was a Leicester fan that year,\u201d Burnley fan Roy Addison said. \u201cIt showed to a small club anything is possible. Nothing is impossible.\u201d\n\nGrief will, however, forever be associated with the glory here.\n\nPremier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore found a flicker of optimism at a dark moment. Supporters gathering in English streets holding banners of team owners usually signals discontent and protest. In Leicester, they have only affection for Vichai.\n\n\u201cThe reaction showed a huge tolerance,\u201d Scudamore said in the days after Vichai\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s probably put to bed the idea there are foreign owners and there are English owners, and all the foreigners are bad and all the English owners are good.\u201d\n\nIn loving memory of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. pic.twitter.com/kFui3vSo3r \u2014 Leicester City (@LCFC) November 10, 2018\n\nNow Leicester, with Claude Puel as coach, has to look to the future on the field with the team 10th in the 20-team standings.\n\nAlthough the 32,184 attendance on Saturday was the biggest crowd of the season, the owner\u2019s death two years after the title win seems like the closing of a chapter to some fans.\n\n\u201cGames are a bit weird now we\u2019ve had all that success,\u201d 21-year-old season ticketholder Sam Collins said. \u201cWhen you win and lose now it doesn\u2019t mean as much anymore because we\u2019ve been to the pinnacle.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nRob Harris is at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports", "CARBONDALE, Ill.

(AP) \u2014 Despite promises to reinvigorate the coal industry, Kentucky has fewer coal jobs today than when President Donald Trump took office two years ago.\n\nThe Lexington Herald-Leader reports coal employment averaged 6,550 in Kentucky in the first quarter of 2017 when Trump was sworn in, according to the state Energy and Environment Cabinet. The estimated average in the July-through-September quarter this year was 6,381.\n\nThe number of coal jobs has gone up and down from quarter to quarter in Kentucky, but overall there has been no sustained increase. Numbers have remained far below 2011 when Kentucky coal jobs topped 18,000.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t happened like they said it would,\u201d said Martin County Judge-Executive Kelly Callaham.\n\nCallaham said one mine has recently hired some people in Martin County. Employment in the most recent quarter stood at 61, compared to more than 200 in early 2017, according to state records.\n\nNationally, there were about 1,900 more coal jobs in October than when Trump took office. One reason Kentucky hasn\u2019t seen an uptick is because the state has relatively little of the type of coal used in making steel. Metallurgical coal has been in demand overseas, and states with more of it, like West Virginia, have seen an increase in mining jobs.\n\nCoal employment in Kentucky has been stable since mid-2016, fluctuating between 6,300 and 6,600 jobs, according to the cabinet\u2019s reports. The industry credits Trump for stopping the big job losses that began in 2012.\n\n\u201cI think that we definitely would\u2019ve gone down further,\u201d said Tyler White, president of the Kentucky Coal Association.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projections through 2040 show a gradual decrease in production in Central Appalachia, the region that includes eastern Kentucky.

The pole will be erected with a screen at AWARE's women's transitional housing at Twin Lakes in April. (Michael Penn/Juneau Empire via AP)\n\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Even the wood chips in Wayne Price\u2019s ongoing project have meaning.\n\nThe master Tlingit carver and University of Alaska Southeast faculty member is deep into the process of creating a healing totem pole for Aiding Women in Abuse and Rape Emergencies, Juneau\u2019s gender-inclusive shelter for survivors of gender-based violence. The finished totem will tell a story created by Price\u2019s wife, Cherri, but the cedar chips carved off of the main log are symbolic, too.\n\n\u201cThis came about when I had a vision in a sweat lodge, which led to my own personal recovery,\u201d Price told the Capital City Weekly after putting some painting on pause in his UAS workshop. \u201cIn that sweat, I was granted a vision and told I had to create a healing totem or dugout, and I asked, \u2018How does it become a healing totem or dugout?\u2019 I was told by my creator, that keeps me sober, that each chip that comes off this totem represents a life that\u2019s been affected by domestic violence or sexual assault. Of all the chips that come off this totem, there won\u2019t be enough. That helps to bring awareness through my art to a pretty serious situation.\u201d\n\nSince his vision 15 years ago, Price has made four healing totems and five healing dugouts that have raised awareness for causes including boarding school atrocities against Alaska Natives, and misuse of alcohol and drugs.\n\n\u201cEvery healing totem and healing canoe that I\u2019ve been involved with has led to the creation of another one,\u201d Price said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from one healing project right into another one soon after, which tells me we\u2019re involved in a great time of healing, that we in the human race want to deal with a great healing in our lives.\u201d\n\nHe said the work for AWARE feels particularly necessary.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s ever been a healing totem that\u2019s been needed, it\u2019s really been this one,\u201d Price said. \u201cOne in three women are involved or know someone involved in this crime.\u201d\n\nMandy Cole, deputy director for AWARE, said Price\u2019s history with recovery also adds an element that may make the work extra relatablefor survivors who sometimes turn to substances to cope with traumatic events before starting their healing journey.\n\n\u201cI think working with the dimension of survivorship and recovery tells a fuller story that I think will make a lot of sense to the people we\u2019re serving,\u201d Cole said.\n\nCole also said she\u2019s been pleased by the collaboration between AWARE and Price, and impressed with the artist\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWayne is an incredibly special person, and we found each other in a way that\u2019s kind of larger than maybe any of us understood,\u201d Cole said. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m learning from him is healing is a journey, and you can\u2019t necessarily predict what it\u2019s going to look like. I think we\u2019re learning from Wayne, and he\u2019s learning from us, and that process is incredibly meaningful. Having someone who\u2019s a master ask you what you think or feel about things is incredibly validating, and you don\u2019t get that all the time. I think we\u2019re so lucky to have found him.\u201d\n\nLogging long hours\n\nThe 22-foot totem pole has been a work in progress for more than a year.\n\nPrice was first approached by AWARE about the possibility of creating a healing totem when he was working in Haines, and the project soon ran into a complication.\n\n\u201cFirst, the log we selected that came from the shelter site proved to be rotten, and we had to secure another log, and we did,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe secured a log from Thorne Bay, and brought it up to Haines, and that was not this last August, but it was the August before.\u201d\n\nPrice worked on the totem until winter chased him inside, and he resumed work in spring, and then continued to work through summer in Haines.\n\n\u201cThen we got involved with being a professor here at UAS, we brought the Jibba dugout as well as the healing totem to the Egan Library site, where I\u2019ve been working on it off and on as I learn the ropes for teaching my classes here,\u201d Price said.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Price said he expects to finish the totem, and it will be erected in the spring.\n\nThe location of the totem remains undecided as does the exact date that it will be put up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get the people invited who we wanted to honor as well, so right now, it\u2019s kind of an amazing complicated logistical progress in work,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s not set in stone is that it\u2019s really about the people who care. We\u2019re trying to really make it meaningful for the community.\u201d\n\nThe design and the story\n\nCherri Price came up with the concept of the totem\u2019s design, which contains a lot of AWARE-specific symbolism.\n\nThe pole is named \u201cKaasei,\u201d which is a Tlingit word that means higher voice, and is also the name of an AWARE transitional housing building.The story told by \u201cKaasei\u2019s\u201d design deals in themes connected to domestic violence and sexual assault.\n\nCherri Price shared the story told by the pole with the Capital City Weekly.\n\n\u201cA strong calm Tlingit woman wearing a traditional fringed dress and wooden hat bearing her name \u2018Kaasei\u2019, is the prominent figure. In her right arm she holds a happy baby boy. Next to her heart she holds a feather, the symbol of her voice and empowerment.\n\n\u201cA young girl lovingly hugs the woman, feeling safe at Kaasei\u2019s side and secure under her arm.\n\n\u201cKaasei stands on the top of a tear box. The tear box sits above oppressive paths of violence and abuse littered with pain, wounds, brokenness, sadness, torment and fear. They spiral down to empty darkness and despair.\n\n\u201cAbove Kaasei\u2019s head are healing paths of peace and safety, bright with hope, happy faces, songs of peace, words of kindness, gentle healing hands and symbols of traditional values. The AWARE logo is on the higher path. A large dove, the symbol of peace, sits on top of the totem.\u201d\n\nWayne Price said the various healing projects have a positive affect, and he hopes bringing awareness to this particular cause can help stop domestic and sexual abuse.\n\n\u201cI do believe in the long run it does help,\u201d Wayne Price said. \u201cA lot of times we as humans don\u2019t really know how to take the first step in a healing process. We\u2019re very capable of doing it, we just don\u2019t know how. What I do as an artist, is I provide a monument that does just that. It provides a step in that direction. It\u2019s wonderful to be involved in such a project.\u201d\n\nIf someone needs to take a step, Cole said anyone struggling with gender-based violence, they can call AWARE at (907)586-1090.", "OMAHA, Neb.

(Christin Mcqueen/Harris County Democratic Party via AP)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Houston area\u2019s courts are going to be a lot more diverse thanks to a group of 17 African-American women and their \u201cmagic.\u201d\n\nThe women, who were part of an effort dubbed the \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d campaign, all won races Tuesday to be judges in various Harris County courts in an election that featured more black women on the county\u2019s ballot than any other.\n\nThe \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d campaign debuted over the summer with a viral photo that featured the 17 women and two other sitting Harris County judges inside a courtroom. Although those two judges lost their bids Tuesday for seats on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, they will retain their local judgeships.\n\nThose behind the campaign say it was part of an effort to broaden the diversity of the Houston area\u2019s judiciary and ensure that more African-Americans and other minorities can bring their backgrounds and life experiences to the bench and better reflect the diversity of the nation\u2019s fourth largest city.\n\n\u201cI think that while Houston itself is one of the most diverse cities in the United States, our elected officials have not always reflected that,\u201d said Lillie Schechter, chair of the Harris County Democratic Party, which put together the \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d campaign. \u201cHaving a government that reflects the people, the population is something that is incredibly important.\u201d\n\nLori Chambers Gray, a Houston defense attorney who won election to be a judge on a criminal district court, said the photo and the \u201cBlack Girls Magic\u201d campaign provided her with a source of strength and motivation as she proceeded to Election Day.\n\n\u201cI hope that it\u2019s an example for women that we do have opportunities to run and to win a campaign,\u201d Gray said.\n\nThe \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d moniker has been used as a hashtag in recent years to highlight the accomplishments of African-American girls and women. In politics, it\u2019s been used to highlight the role African-American women have played in helping decide various races, including the highly contested Senate race in Alabama last year in which Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore.\n\nThe victory by the 17 black women on Tuesday was part of a Harris County rout by the Democrats, who won almost all of the nearly 70 local judicial races and ousted a popular Republican from the county\u2019s top elected office.\n\nAlthough Tuesday\u2019s election will increase the diversity of the Houston-area\u2019s judiciary, more than three-quarters of U.S. trial judges are white, according to 2016 report by a liberal legal organization, the American Constitution Society. The group found that less than one-third of state judges were women and less than one-fifth were people of color.\n\nIn Texas, women of color make up about 28 percent of the state\u2019s population but only about 12 percent of its state court judges, according to the American Constitution Society\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to U.S. Census figures, African-Americans make up about 20 percent of Harris County\u2019s population. Tuesday\u2019s election will increase the number of black female judges in Harris County from eight to 25, according to the Harris County Democratic Party.\n\nAngela Graves-Harrington, a family law attorney in Houston who was one of the 17 women elected, said Tuesday\u2019s success will be an important step in improving diversity, as this will be the first time that black women have been elected as family court judges and as judges on misdemeanor criminal courts in Harris County.\n\n\u201cWe felt showcasing the number of African-American women on the bench would galvanize our base and also galvanize those who don\u2019t typically vote in the midterm elections and get them excited about coming out,\u201d Graves-Harrington said. \u201cWe also wanted to have something out there that we could be proud of, that our community could be proud of and that Harris County could be proud of.\u201d\n\nSchechter said she hopes the successful election of the 17 African-American women inspires \u201ccandidates of all colors\u201d to run for local offices.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

Presumably that\u2019s due to overabundance, too many deer.\u201d\n\nCommunities around the country have grappled for years with too many deer in suburban areas by expanding archery hunting and in extreme cases relying on sharpshooters to do the work.\n\n\u201cA lot of times it\u2019s not a one size fits all. It can be a combination of things,\u201d said Steve Lightfoot, spokesman for the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department.\n\n\u201cThe issue we face mostly in these communities is you\u2019ve got different viewpoints. Some folks, they love to see the deer and they feed them. And that creates a bigger issue because others don\u2019t and they see their backyard plants getting browsed to near nothing and there\u2019s also the issue with traffic safety. Deer and cars don\u2019t mix too well,\u201d he said.\n\nVermont has an estimated deer population of 155,000, likely the highest amount in a couple of decades as a result of several mild winters, fewer hunters and fewer areas to hunt.\n\nThe state hopes to control the suburban deer by expanding archery hunting.\n\n\u201cI think we have more than enough hunters to control the deer population and we will as we continue to lose them over the next decade,\u201d Fortin said. \u201cThe challenge is that there are a lot places ... where hunters aren\u2019t allowed to go.\u201d\n\nThat certainly was the case on Friday, when a doe and fawn ended up in a woodworking shop in Morrisville.\n\nWCAX-TV reports that Paul Green was working at the Douglas P. Blake Jr. workshop when a doe ran through the door, then crashed through a window to get back outside. A few minutes later, a fawn ran in and out, while the mother crashed into and out of another room in the building.\n\nOffice manager Kathy Stokes said when the doe finally raced off to a nearby highway bypass, it got hit by a dump truck and killed.", "VANCOUVER, Wash.

Wells said he\u2019s been \u201caddicted to one thing or another\u201d since he was about 14.

He mentioned that, in the first six months of recovery, everything is completely new. It\u2019s like starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cWhen I got out of inpatient treatment, I spent about six months that was total chaos and totally overwhelming,\u201d Wells said. \u201cAnd I had a really good, stable environment to be able to explore all that, which most people don\u2019t.

It doesn\u2019t push any specific form of recovery and will help people find the best programs for them.

Bukaty, File)\n\nPORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Fishing managers are considering extending new protections to Atlantic herring, but catch quotas for the important bait fish are still likely to plummet before the end of the year, which is bad news for the American lobster industry.\n\nHerring is the most important bait source for the lobster fishery, which is one of the most lucrative marine industries in New England. A recent scientific assessment of the herring population says the fish\u2019s population has fallen in the past five years.\n\nAn arm of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission voted last month to initiate changes to try to better protect spawning herring off of New England.\n\nThe new protections are coming at a time when the lobster and herring fisheries are expecting a dramatic cutback in herring quota. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is expected to propose new rules about herring fishing this month and implement them by early 2019, when next year\u2019s herring fishing season starts.\n\nLobstermen in Maine, the biggest lobster-fishing state, are on edge waiting for the news, said Kristan Porter, president of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association. The lack of herring caused by a quota cut will drive up the cost of bait and possibly make it harder to load traps at all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s definitely going to be a huge cut,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously have to be looking at different sources of bait.\u201d\n\nThe impact of a bait crunch on lobster consumers remains to be seen, but it\u2019s possible a high cost of bait could be passed along to customers. It\u2019s also too early to say whether a bait shortage will result in less availability of lobsters, which have been in abundant supply at markets and restaurants for several years.\n\nThe Atlantic States\u2019 new protections of herring are designed to make it easier for the fish to spawn in the inshore Gulf of Maine, off Cape Cod and on Georges Bank, which are all important habitats for herring. The fish is the focus of efforts by conservationists because of its critical role in the ocean food web.\n\nThe NOAA announced during the summer that the herring catch limit would be cut back by more than 8 million pounds. That cut was \u201csurvivable and difficult,\u201d but the pending quota reduction has the potential to be much deeper, said Mary Beth Tooley, who works in government relations for the O\u2019Hara Corporation, a herring harvester in Rockland, Maine.\n\n\u201cThere will be a deep cut. I\u2019m certain of that. How deep is a question, and we\u2019ll wait,\u201d she said.", "MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 A Russian newspaper says video released by the self-styled Libyan National Army shows a businessman allegedly linked to a private contractor that sent mercenaries to Syria at a meeting with the head of the Libyan army and top Russian military officials.\n\nNovaya Gazeta reported Friday that a man seen wearing civilian dress at the meeting was Yevgeny Prigozhin.

(Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 He aggressively deleted inactive voters from registration rolls, enforced an \u201cexact match\u201d policy that could have prevented thousands of Georgians from registering to vote and launched an investigation that disrupted a major voter registration drive.\n\nNow Republican Brian Kemp is declaring himself the victor in Georgia\u2019s race for governor, a race so close that even marginal differences in voting and turnout could make the difference in determining whether the race goes to a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race between Kemp, who until this week was Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, and Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state lawmaker seeking to become the nation\u2019s first black woman to be elected governor.\n\nIn a state dominated by Republicans, Abrams staked her campaign largely on getting new and infrequent voters to participate.\n\nMeanwhile, Kemp and the state\u2019s Republican legislature have imposed tighter voting and registration rules that can make it more difficult for just those voters to register and cast ballots. Most of those rules have come since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.\n\n\u201cGeorgia uses every tool in the voter-suppression tool kit,\u201d said Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s unfriendly the way that voting happens in Georgia. It\u2019s more like cashing a check than casting a ballot.\u201d\n\nKemp defends his tenure, noting increased voter registration on his watch.\n\nLike other Southern states, Georgia after the Civil War had a history of suppressing black voters by disallowing votes from people who owed taxes, imposing literacy tests and implementing white-only primary elections. Those efforts eventually were stopped by the courts and the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruling five years ago rolled back a provision of that act that had required Georgia and eight other states to get federal approval before changing voting laws. That gave those states the freedom to impose new restrictions.\n\nThe ACLU\u2019s Young said Georgia\u2019s recent voting restrictions have been made in the name of preventing fraud. But she believes they\u2019re also born out of a desire to keep minorities from voting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see good faith in so many of these measures that advocates repeatedly say have disproportionate impact on African-Americans and other minorities,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of those restrictions predate Kemp.\n\nIn 2005 \u2014 five years before he took office \u2014 Georgia implemented a law requiring voters to show a photo ID at the polls. The Justice Department approved it, but a court struck it down as an unconstitutional poll tax because it required voters to pay for IDs unless they could prove financial hardship. Lawmakers responded in 2006 by revising the law to make it easier to get IDs for free.\n\nIn 2014, Kemp launched an investigation of a voting drive run by a group that Abrams had started. The investigation eventually forwarded to law enforcement just 53 allegedly forged registrations out of a total of 87,000, but critics said the probe disrupted the overall registration drive.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, which tracks voting issues nationally, said Georgia was among the most aggressive states in the country in removing inactive voters from its registration rolls between 2012 through this year. The stated purpose is to clear lists of voters those who have moved or died, but the purges also can mistakenly remove legitimate voters.\n\nData provided by the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office show the state removed more than 937,000 voters from the rolls from the start of 2015 through Aug. 1 of this year.\n\nKemp also used an \u201cexact match\u201d policy for voter registrations. To sign up, voters\u2019 names and other information had to match precisely how they appeared on other government databases. Kemp agreed to end the practice amid litigation last year. But within months, legislators put the policy into law.\n\nAs Election Day approached this year, it resulted in 53,000 voters \u2014 most of them minorities \u2014 with their registrations on hold. Civil rights groups sued while Kemp insisted those on the list could vote if they brought to the polls a photo ID substantially matching the information on file. Voters who failed to do so were to cast provisional ballots.\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, chairman of global health at Emory University, said a poll worker at his precinct in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur initially told him he was not registered. The issue: His voter registration has a space between \u201cdel\u201d and \u201cRio\u201d in his last name, but his driver\u2019s license does not.\n\nHe had to explain to the poll worker that the state Department of Driver Services does not allow for spaces in a name, and he was then allowed to vote.\n\n\u201cIt did require a little of me knowing how to defend my rights,\u201d del Rio said.\n\nBryan Sells, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who now specializes in voting rights, has sued Kemp over the exact match policy and other issues. He said Kemp and Georgia Republicans have been targeted in the rules they have chosen to implement in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe effort has not been to make it hard for everyone to vote,\u201d Sells said. \u201cIt has been to make it hard for people that some in the Republican party think are going to vote against them.\u201d\n\nMany voters in and around Atlanta, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods, were incensed by excessively long lines on Election Day, some with waits up to three hours. Some would-be voters couldn\u2019t last and left without casting a ballot.\n\nSuspicion in some places fell on the number of polling places that have closed over the years.\n\nAn investigation earlier this year by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that Georgia election officials have closed 213 polling places \u2014 or about 1 in 12 statewide \u2014 since 2012, a year before the Supreme Court allowed officials in the state to change polling places without federal approval. The newspaper revealed that Kemp had sent a memo to local election officials laying out reasons for such actions, including cutting costs and responding to lower numbers of voters. A Kemp spokeswoman said the move was not political.\n\nKemp also has noted that voter registration increased by 1 million people during his nearly eight years as secretary of state. He said his efforts, including the introduction of online registration, are among the reasons for that.\n\nHe told reporters during a campaign stop in Savannah a day before the election that record turnout during the early voting period showed that his office has not been engaged in voter suppression.\n\n\u201cPeople are voting at will. That\u2019s what we want,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cEasy to vote and hard to cheat.\u201d\n\nTom Mahoney, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Elections, also said it was not fair to blame Kemp for the problems with Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nHe said he waited 90 minutes to cast his ballot in Savannah. Not having enough voting machines and staff to handle the surge of voters resulted from a lack of foresight by local officials like him, not Kemp, Mahoney said.\n\n\u201cWe prepared for a midterm election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not prepare for a presidential election, and that\u2019s what we got.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBynum reported from Savannah.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Cassidy at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Christina and Bynum at http://www.twitter.com/russbynum", "A 1942 Office of War Information poster copy hangs in a hallway of the Rochester Public Library in Rochester, N.H., Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018. A trove of propaganda posters from World War I and II were found recently found after being lost in storage for decades in the library's basement. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nROCHESTER, N.H. (AP) \u2014 One poster in a recently discovered trove vilifies the Nazis with a sword through a Bible and the words \u201cThis Is the Enemy.\u201d Some encouraged self-sacrifice by promoting recycling, planting gardens and buying potatoes. Still others warned that loose lips can literally sink ships and get American soldiers killed.\n\nThis stash of 190 propaganda posters from World War I and World War II were found last year on top of two sawhorses in the basement of a Rochester, New Hampshire, library. Fragile but mostly in good condition, the posters offer viewers a glimpse of what life was like during war time and the extent that the American government went to maintain support for the conflict by playing on fear, patriotism and civic duty.\n\n\u201cSome of these are really neat,\u201d library director Brian Sylvester said as he thumbed through the posters.\n\n\u201cMost of them were about supporting the military,\u201d he said. \u201cI would call that the main theme. Patriotism. Purchasing war bonds, growing a victory garden, being in support of rationing all that stuff. There is a neat one that has all these pictures of bombs and stuff. The way the artist drew it is there is a skillet at the top dumping out waste fat. That was used for munitions.\u201d\n\nSylvester said it is unclear how the posters ended up in the library\u2019s basement, but the themes give some clues that they were likely there for decades. About 50 posters dating back to World War I championed the American Red Cross, which kept its records at the library. Dozens more promoted war bonds, while two dozen highlighted a World War I program in which libraries collected books to be sent to troops overseas.\n\nMany more look like big post cards, promoting tourist destinations in Britain or featuring a portrait of a soldier from an allied country \u2014 China, the Netherlands and even Ethiopia.\n\nThe best posters look like something painted by Norman Rockwell, with one for war bonds featuring children holding an American flag and another with a nurse watching over a soldier with his eyes bandaged and the words \u201cCarry On.\u201d On the flip side, a poster has darker images of Nazis burning books and the words \u201cBooks cannot be killed by fire.\u201d Another plays on the enemy-in-our midst theme and features a soldier floundering at sea with the words \u201cSomeone talked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe posters are almost a lost art form,\u201d Sylvester said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t do this to try and spread this kind of message anymore. These are such simple messages. It\u2019s just really laid on thick.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Weiss, director of collections at Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts who curated its current exhibit on 175 propaganda postcards from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, said certain themes stand out in these kinds of messages.\n\n\u201cRegardless the type of regime, the type of nation involved, propaganda is designed to rally people toward something and make people hate something,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s meant to divide the world into the people you want to be part of, the people who are opposed to you.\u201d\n\nThough he hadn\u2019t heard about the New Hampshire posters, Weiss said they also illustrate the power of propaganda with a focus on national themes.\n\n\u201cThat is a key piece of this which is they showed up in Rochester, New Hampshire but they could just as easily of been in Rochester, New York or Rochester, Minnesota,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were things that were created, in most cases, probably at a central point with the idea they are going to reach the whole country and address the whole country.\u201d\n\nSylvester said the library has no plans in the near future to display the posters. There are concerns that sunlight would cause the colors to fade. Instead, they have photographed all the posters and are showing them on a computer in the library. They are also planning to host an expert from the Wright Museum of World War II history for a Nov. 29 lecture on the power of war posters.\n\n\u201cFor me personally, it kind of gave me an awareness that libraries played a role in those wars,\u201d Sylvester said, adding they eventually hope to get the UV-protected glass and acid-free matting needed to display the original posters.", "LAWRENCE, Mass.

(AP) \u2014 When the Nazi dictatorship was new, Carl Hausman\u2019s parents closed the shutters on the living room windows to keep him safe.\n\nIt worked, for a little while.\n\nHausman was born on March 19, 1933, 20 days after a fire in the German parliament building provided the Nazis the opportunity to consolidate power over Germany. His father Ludwig was Jewish and poor, a German army veteran of World War I who sold animal feed. The family lived on a cobblestone street in a poor neighborhood of a village in southern Germany.\n\nOn Hausman\u2019s eighth day of life, family members arrived from nearby villages for the brith, to celebrate his circumcision. With the neighbors embittered by anti-Semitic propaganda, Ludwig feared trouble.\n\nHe nailed the shutters closed for the day.\n\nA few years later, Carl heard through the open windows the boots of Nazi soldiers pounding the cobblestones outside. His mother leapt across the room and slammed the shutters, making a huge crashing noise.\n\n\u201cThat is one of my earliest memories,\u201d said Hausman, now 85, of Teaneck. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on. I was a child.\u201d\n\nMost of Hausman\u2019s early life returns to him like this, in flashes of noise and color. The story behind these flashes he filled in later.\n\nIt is the story of hidden children.\n\nHunted by the Nazis, who murdered more than a million children in their quest to annihilate the Jewish people, thousands of children lived for years in basements, sewers, attics and haylofts across Europe. Sometimes they hid underground. In other cases the children lived in the open, with assumed names and forged documents.\n\nTheir protectors risked torture and death to save them, and to save what little remained of humanity in Nazi-controlled Europe.\n\nAs the youngest people to live under the Nazis, the hidden children are among the last people on Earth with personal memories of the Holocaust.\n\nTheir voices have never been more important.\n\nFor decades after the United States helped defeat the Nazis in Germany, their racist and anti-Semitic successors in this country occupied the far fringes of politics, largely mocked and easily ignored.\n\nThings are different now. We have a president who praised some \u201cvery fine people\u201d among a mob of white nationalists who carried torches through an American city while chanting \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d Last week, President Trump repeated the false and anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that George Soros, a billionaire investor who is Jewish, funded a caravan of refugees fleeing poverty and violence in Central America.\n\nCarl Hausman is too young to remember the German precursors to the events of his childhood, the early Nazi provocateurs who stoked fear of Jews beginning in the mid-1920s.\n\nBut he\u2019s the perfect age to warn us about where today\u2019s provocations might lead.\n\n\u201cI am a firsthand witness,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully it will never happen here.\u201d\n\nHausman was born in Kirchheimbolanden, a big name for a small town. Most of his memories of the place are bitter, but not all. Hausman remembers playing games with children who were not Jewish.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know his family was poor. He didn\u2019t know the neighborhood\u2019s more affluent Jewish families already had fled Germany, leaving his family among the last Jews in town.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know of his older sister Gretel, who could have been a playmate. As a young child she had contracted diphtheria. The local hospital refused to treat her because she was Jewish, so she died at home at age 7.\n\nThe passport of Carl Hausman\u2019s aunt and uncle, which was marked with a big \u201cJ\u2033 for Jew, which they used to leave Nazi Germany in 1940.\n\nIn 1938, when Hausman was five, someone set fire to the local synagogue. This he remembers.\n\n\u201cMy parents took me to see the synagogue burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of my first experiences that really stuck with me.\u201d\n\nEarly one morning in October 1940, the Hausmans were forced onto a train bound for a concentration camp named Gurs, in southern France. There they slept on floors covered in straw, and walked through ankle-deep mud. Food was scarce. Rats, fleas and bedbugs were not.\n\nIn Gurs, Hausman and his brother Gunther received food, blankets and clothing from OSE, a French Jewish humanitarian group organized to help Jewish children living under oppression. Eventually the organization removed both brothers from concentration camps, Gunter to a nearby orphanage and Carl, a year later, to a series of safe houses.\n\n___\n\n\u201cWhen they arrived at the camp they were gassed almost immediately, all three of them.

He was about to visit their parents in another concentration camp called Rivesaltes, he said, while Carl remained miles away, sequestered by OSE.\n\nIt was a trap. Soon after Gunter arrived, he and his parents were transported to Auschwitz.\n\n\u201cWhen they arrived at the camp they were gassed almost immediately, all three of them,\u201d said Hausman, who learned their fate years later. \u201cSo at the age of eight I became an orphan.\u201d\n\nAt around this time, OSE was forced underground. Hausman was transported to a farm in a mountainous region controlled by the French Resistance. He was given the French-sounding name of Jean Bloise and raised by the family of Albert Masse, a Communist farmer who always kept his handlebar moustache trimmed and his fingernails clean.\n\n\u201cThey had one cow, one pig and a lot of rabbits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey accepted me as their own.\u201d\n\nHe lived on the farm for two years, learning to milk goats and tend rabbits. Technically he was in hiding, Hausman said, but he never had to hide. Hausman didn\u2019t attend school for fear of being discovered, but occasionally he joined the Masse family in a cow-drawn cart for a Sunday ride into a nearby town.\n\nHis only contact with the war was BBC radio news and occasional sightings of French rebels carrying American-made submachine guns.\n\n\u201cSo these people were my protectors,\u201d Hausman said. \u201cThey were very decent people. Wonderful people.\u201d\n\nWhen the war ended in 1945, Hausman, just 12 years old, had already experienced more than enough sorrow for a lifetime. Two years later he emigrated to the United States, moving in with an uncle in Washington Heights. He learned English, graduated high school, was drafted into the U.S. Army, served in Allied-occupied Austria, came home and started a career as a painting contractor. In 1967 Hausman and his wife Rochelle moved to a ranch house in Teaneck, where they raised three children.\n\nThey live in the same house today. It has white shutters for decoration, not for nailing shut.\n\n\u201cLike many survivors, I seldom spoke of my childhood experiences,\u201d Hausman wrote in \u201cRescued,\u201d a memoir of his experiences as a hidden child.\n\nHausman began to share his experiences in the 1990s at meetings hosted by the Hidden Child Foundation, which brings survivors together and celebrates the people who saved them.\n\n___\n\n\u201cLike many survivors, I seldom spoke of my childhood experiences\u201d\n\n___\n\n\u201cIn the beginning it was terrible,\u201d Rochelle Hausman said of the meetings of survivors. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go to therapists. So they would come to these meetings and it would all come out.\u201d\n\nWhen Carl Hausman joined, the Hidden Child Foundation had about 80 members in Bergen County, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re down to about 50 now,\u201d he said, \u201cand most of us are in our 80s.\u201d\n\nHausman\u2019s family was exterminated. He lived his childhood in terror. He spent decades trying to forget the past.\n\n\u201cAttaining an increasing sense of normalcy in my life in my new country was possible only by suppressing my memories of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he realized his story as a hidden child must never be forgotten. Jews posed no threat to Germany in 1933, the year Carl Hausman was born. They pose no threat to America now. Neither do black people or gay people or Hondurans or Muslims or women or the poor.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise has forgotten the message that Carl Hausman survived to tell us.\n\n\u201cI see almost the same thing happening again,\u201d Hausman said of the rising voices of religious and racial hate in this country. \u201cPeople sometimes have said it\u2019s behind us. No. It\u2019s important that we remember it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttps://njersy.co/2Dudmkn\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Record (Woodland Park, N.J.), http://www.northjersey.com", "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Military eterans and active-duty service members can enter Indiana\u2019s parks free of charge Sunday as the state honors them on Veterans Day.\n\nThe state Department of Natural Resources says all veterans and active-duty military personnel \u2014 along with everyone in their vehicle \u2014 will be admitted free to all state parks, reservoir properties and state forest recreation areas.\n\nBecause southern Indiana\u2019s Falls of the Ohio State Park is only open during the afternoon on Veterans Day, it will offer free admission to its interpretive center for veterans and active-duty military both Sunday and Monday.\n\nVeterans and military personnel should present identification or evidence of military service at entrance gates.\n\nState Parks Director Dan Bortner says veterans \u201ccan explore some of the best outdoor places in our state.\u201d", "PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich.

Gutierrez, 47, said she initially was reluctant to give up the spruce, but Figueroa convinced her.\n\nErik Pauze, the center\u2019s head gardener, also attended the ceremony. He cared for the tree over the summer, watering and feeding it compost tea as the couple watched outside their home.\n\nAfter the tree is dismantled, it will be donated to Habitat for Humanity to help build housing.\n\nThe legacy of the famed New York holiday tree reaches back to Christmas Eve in 1931, during the Great Depression. Workers building Rockefeller Center pooled their money to buy a 20-foot tree they decorated with garland handmade by their families.\n\nTwo years later, Rockefeller Center officials made the tree an annual tradition, starting with the first lighting ceremony in 1933.", "MASSILLON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Three women break a loaf of bread and share it before placing a few pieces at their great-grandfather\u2019s gravesite.\n\nNo name marks the spot, just a 2-inch square stone bearing the number 84.\n\nNext, they have some olives and feta cheese. A bottle of champagne is passed around as part of an Orthodox tradition they have done many times for relatives and friends who have died. Soil from the graves of relatives is scattered in a circle around the top of the grave.\n\nThe women refer to it as the \u201cfeeding of the soul,\u201d which is traditionally done at a funeral or at the cemetery during the burial. Their great-grandfather, however, died in 1918 and no relatives knew where he was buried until Marian Ricalis decided to begin searching for the grave two months ago.\n\nOn Thursday, 100 years to the date of their great-grandfather\u2019s death, Ricalis and her cousins, Cathy Nitsopoulos and Linda Yanch, made the seven-hour drive from Canada to Massillon. They are the first of the family to visit the Massillon Cemetery resting place of Christo Lazo Shishareff, who they refer to as Dedo Christo.\n\n\u201cThe road trip has been an emotional ride,\u201d Nitsopoulos said. \u201cTo make it on this day is something special.\u201d\n\nSomewhere in Ohio\n\nFor many years, Ricalis\u2019 father searched for the grave. Language barriers and a lack of information made it difficult for the family to locate their lost relative. And it was before the internet made searches of this type easier.\n\nIn 1910, Shishareff traveled to the United States and began working on the railroad for A.B. Clark\u2019s mill, which later became Central Steel Co. in Massillon. Roughly eight years later, a week before he was scheduled to return to his hometown in Macedonia, he was struck in the head by a steel beam and died instantly.\n\nHe was 45 on Nov. 8, 1918 when he was killed in the accident, and was buried a few days later on Nov. 12.\n\nShishareff had traveled with a group of other Macedonians who reported back to the family of his death. However, no one from the family knew where he was buried. The only clue they had was that he died somewhere in Ohio.\n\nAs a child, Ricalis heard stories about her great-grandfather. She grew up in Toronto, Canada after the family left Macedonia in 1952.\n\nHer father died 23 years ago, and Ricalis took it as her mission to find the grave of Shishareff. Over the years, the search was placed on the back burner as Ricalis and her cousins were busy with their jobs and families.\n\nThe search for her great-grandfather\u2019s final resting spot resurfaced when Ricalis bumped into a family friend who had an interest in ancestry and genealogy. Within 24 hours, the friend had tracked down records of Shishareff, narrowing the search to Stark County.\n\n\u201cIt was always in the back of my head,\u201d Ricalis said. \u201cWhen we found him, it was very emotional. Without (our great-grandfather) none of us would be here. We have a huge family, and we\u2019re very loving and supportive of one another.\u201d\n\nFinding answers\n\nTo begin her search, Ricalis contacted several health departments in Stark County until she was able to obtain the death certificate from Massillon City Health Department.\n\nShe then contacted P.J. Crawford, a reference assistant at the Massillon Public Library, who dug through archives to find records of Ricalis\u2019 great-grandfather.\n\nIn the 1980s, volunteers combed through Stark County cemeteries, jotting down names and information found on headstones. Shishareff was not among them.\n\nThat lead Ricalis and her cousins to Massillon Cemetery, where they talked with Rose Buxton, office manager, who was able to track the location of Shishareff in the digital archives.\n\nEach grave in the cemetery is marked with a number. Through her electronic search, Buxton learned he was buried in section 13, lot 84.\n\nThe challenge, however, was Shishareff did not have a headstone marking his grave.\n\nBuxton and the groundskeeper used a spade to try to locate the small stone with number 84, which was placed at the foot of the grave.\n\nAfter three tries, they found the marker covered over with grass and leaves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of book work,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cOnce I narrowed it down, we went out and looked at the headstones nearby. It can take a while, but I really enjoy doing this.\u201d\n\nThe three women went to the cemetery late Thursday morning where they laid a Canadian flag, a jar of soil from the graves of other relatives and pieces of food from the feeding of the soul ceremony.\n\nBeiter Monument Works will be creating a headstone, and the trio plans to return to the grave after it\u2019s completed.\n\nThrough 100 years \u2014 during many of which other family members had searched for the grave \u2014 it was surreal to stand at their great-grandfather\u2019s resting place, the women agreed.\n\n\u201cI think (our family) would have been proud,\u201d Nitsopoulos said. \u201cWe were happy to find him.

My mom is the choir director at her church. My dad is a player and they had a dinner theater. So, I grew up around music.\u201d\n\nThe influence to perform was there, but Lea wasn\u2019t average.\n\nBorn with osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bone disease, Lea\u2019s physical growth was arrested. Her limbs developed twisted and shortened.

(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s been 157 years since an estimated 700 Confederate cavalrymen raided the small town of Guyandotte, only to withdraw before Union reinforcements torched much of the secessionist-leaning village the next day.\n\nIn the grand scheme of the Civil War, it was just one of thousands of inconsequential engagements that nonetheless carved its legacy into the fabric of American life. Unlike other wars Americans have bled in, campaigns were not waged in foreign, exotic lands, but in places and towns we now call home.\n\nIt\u2019s that energy that propels an interest in the Civil War nationwide and what\u2019s fueled Guyandotte Civil War Days for now 29 years.\n\nFor two days each November, re-enactors in blue, gray and period-appropriate civilian clothes set up camp on the same ground once bled over and wage a friendlier battle in the streets as hundreds watch from the safety of the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cWhether it was gray or blue, they fought for what they believed in - whether it was to preserve the Union or, in their minds, to save their homes and property,\u201d said Tim Delay, wearing the blue with gold trim of a Union infantry officer before his contingent filed into their lines.\n\nMost re-enactors, as do many Americans, claimed cherished ancestors on one or both sides of the war - fighting for their beliefs during the most tumultuous time in American history.\n\nThere\u2019s a deeply rooted appeal in re-enacting, in dressing up and playing the role of a forefather, that draws participants from across the United States to Guyandotte.\n\nVonda and Cassie Dixon, dressed in bonnets and line dresses, made the trip from Tennessee to watch as Confederate sympathizers.\n\nBut even though fortunes would eventually turn south for the South, the Dixons added that the past cannot be forgotten that easily.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re products of it,\u201d Cassie said.\n\n\u201cRight - we\u2019re products of it,\u201d her mother added. \u201cOur ancestors were in it, and everything that has come before us makes us what we are. To cross out everything that happened ... is just insane.\u201d\n\nAside from honoring their legacies, keeping Civil War history alive serves as a cautionary tale, particularly in today\u2019s divisive political climate.\n\n\u201cIf we forget what happened in the war that we went through - America\u2019s \u2018Iliad,\u2019 our \u2018Odyssey,\u2019 so to speak - we won\u2019t remember that this wasn\u2019t a very good thing,\u201d said Chris Johnson, a Union infantryman speaking over the first volleys of musket fire.\n\n\u201cIf 263,000 men were killed with single-shot muskets over a four-year period, what would happen today with all our semi-automatics?\u201d added Roger Caldwell, a fellow Union man, as the party filed in.\n\nSpecial events Sunday, Nov. 4, include the 10 a.m. memorial service, Madie Carroll House tours from noon to 4 p.m., and re-enactments and scenarios from 1 to 4 p.m.\n\nFor more information and a complete schedule, visit http://thunderinthevillage.com/.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Herald-Dispatch, http://www.herald-dispatch.com", "NORFOLK, Va.

(Mount Vernon has eight. The White House has three. The rest are scattered among other institutions.)\n\nThe dig, and an archaeological survey at the site, are part of a $12.35 million renovation project at the property, funded by billionaire philanthropist David M. Rubenstein. (The recovered artifacts are being preserved at the Park Service\u2019s Museum Resource Center in Landover, Md.)\n\nThe 200-year-old Arlington House, famous as the namesake of the national cemetery that surrounds it and the former home of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, has been closed since March. The renovation is expected to be finished next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the site has been revealing some of its secrets.\n\nThe survey also turned up part of the foundation of the vanished \u201cTemple of Fame,\u201d which stood in the garden outside Arlington House from 1884 to 1967, when it was demolished.\n\nThe temple, with stone columns and a tin dome, bore the last names of George Washington and Civil War heroes including Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nExperts have also discovered evidence that a hill where the house was built was leveled for construction, and that Native Americans had likely occupied the site long before.\n\nAlso found were two broken pieces of another set of china, made for George Washington in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, a group made up mostly up of Continental Army and Navy officers.\n\nRoller, in a telephone interview, said he also found evidence of \u201csome catastrophic fire that we don\u2019t know about. ... It\u2019s not documented anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe mansion, with its eight columns and grand portico, was built mostly by the slaves of George Washington Parke Custis between 1802 and 1818.\n\nCustis, who had about 60 slaves at Arlington, was the grandson of Martha Washington from her first marriage. After his father died in 1781 he was brought to Mount Vernon, where he was raised as a son by George and Martha Washington.\n\nHe grew to idolize George Washington and had Arlington built in part as a memorial to the nation\u2019s first president.\n\nAt Arlington House, he gathered Washington memorabilia and artifacts he had inherited or collected. They included his grandmother\u2019s bequest of her \u201cset of tea china that was given me by Mr. VanBraam every piece having MW on it,\u201d as Martha Washington put it in her will.\n\nThe story of the china goes back to the Dutch merchant Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, who designed and commissioned the set in China in 1796.\n\nIt was common for aristocratic Europeans to have specialized settings made in China and shipped to Europe, Schoelwer said. Blank porcelain would be made and then taken to the port city of Guangzhou, then called Canton, for decoration.\n\nVan Braam designed the plates with the MW monogram at the center of a sunburst. He chose the Latin motto Decus et Tutamen ab Illo, which means \u201cour union is our glory and our defense against him,\u201d Schoelwer said. The \u201chim\u201d referred to King George III of England.\n\nEnclosing the design is a blue snake swallowing its tail, which signifies eternity, Schoelwer said. The names of the 15 states that comprised the United States at that time were placed inside linked ovals, which signifies the union, she said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of symbolism packed into this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think that it was a dessert service,\u201d she said, and included two-handled cups for chocolate. \u201cIt was a very elegant service ... mostly the kind of service that you put on display.\u201d\n\nVan Braam arrived in Philadelphia, then the U.S. capital, to deliver his gift in 1796. George Washington was near the end of his second term as president.\n\nMartha Washington kept much of the set when she and her husband moved back to Mount Vernon after Washington\u2019s presidency. She may have given away some pieces, Schoelwer said.\n\nCustis must have brought what was left to Arlington after the Washingtons died.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Arlington House was vacated by the family of Robert E. Lee and occupied by Union forces. Some of the china may have been packed in barrels for storage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure how many are left at the time of the Civil War,\u201d Schoelwer said. \u201cBut many of the pieces have a fair amount of damage to them and have been pieced back together. It looks like they were in the process of war (and) handled roughly.\u201d\n\nRoller said he thinks the pieces he found in the trash pit outside came from an earlier period in the house\u2019s history.\n\nHe had dug down about two feet through layers of soil and deposits of kitchen refuse when he spotted the broken pieces encrusted in earth. When the dirt \u201cpopped off,\u201d he saw the striking ornamentation.\n\n\u201cAll the gold, all the gilded parts just glittered in the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was definitely a moment. I\u2019m sure I screamed something.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com", "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Not long after taking over as warden of the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women in Jessup, Margaret M.

The women were being served the same food as male prisoners, a 3,200-calorie menu filled with carbs, such as three slices of white bread at a meal.\n\n\u201cWomen here already have a number of health issues,\u201d Chippendale said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t helping.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to stem the weight gains, and improve chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes that disproportionately affect those incarcerated, she worked with a dietitian to retool the offerings and slowly cut about 1,000 calories a day from the meals.\n\nAbout three years after the effort began, the prison has replaced the white bread with wheat and gives out less. It has added items such as fish, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as cottage cheese and yogurt full of the calcium the aging female population needs. It serves drinks with less sugar.\n\nChippendale said she eventually expects to show savings on health care costs, including medications, the biggest part of her budget. The dietitian is now talking up the changes to other correctional institutions in the state.\n\nThe women in Jessup, who have had a say in the new menus, report greater satisfaction. More are coming to the dining hall rather than eating food they buy in the commissary. They say that has improved morale in the prison, which could translate into fewer squabbles and heightened safety.\n\nJermel Chambers, a 54-year-old incarcerated since 2000, said she\u2019s been through a lot of menu changes, mostly so bad that women were avoiding the dining hall and eating only unhealthy food they bought in the commissary. But now almost everyone comes together for meals.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone who has been here for 35 years,\u201d she said, \u201cand when she comes to lunch, you know there\u2019s been a change.\u201d\n\nThe women also say it could improve the health of their families, if they bring the lessons learned about nutrition home with them when they are released.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without input from them,\u201d Chippendale said of the inmates. \u201cWe needed buy-in. . We\u2019ll probably continue to tweak the menu forever.\u201d\n\nSignificant challenges remain, Chippendale said. Some women did not embrace the new healthier but often unfamiliar foods. The menu still can\u2019t be tailored well to individual health needs. Getting the fresh food without increasing the food budget \u2014 currently $3.30 to $3.50 per inmate per day \u2014 is an ongoing issue. An increase in funding is unlikely, even if the goal is saving money down the road.\n\nThe warden also can\u2019t yet measure improvements in health or medical spending. It\u2019s unclear when she could have evidence, as health care has been a complicated issue for correctional systems in Maryland and across the country. Health hinges on more than food.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice found in 2016 that half of prisoners had a chronic health condition and two-thirds were currently on some kind of prescription medication. Close to three-quarters were obese, with women more likely to be so.\n\nIn Maryland, advocates say the prisons have done somewhat better tending to chronic ailments in recent years than have the jails where detainees stay for short, often chaotic periods. But there is a lot of room to improve health care.\n\nNicole Hanson, executive director of Out For Justice, which promotes policies for ex-offenders re-entering society, said health care is not only constitutionally guaranteed to inmates but can put them on a better path, save money and protect the public from uncontrolled infectious diseases.\n\nShe and Julie Magers, coalition leader with the Maryland Prisoners\u2019 Rights Coalition, applauded any effort to improve the prison menu for taste, quality and nutrition, given the well-known link between food and health, both medical and mental. They say offerings in the past have been \u201cterrible\u201d and contributed to the women\u2019s health problems.\n\nThey said they hope the fresh food is actually fresh and healthy and that the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services eventually takes the makeover system-wide. They also said they hope women leave the institution able to make good decisions about feeding themselves and their families.\n\n\u201cPeople are used to sugar and junk food and ramen noodles, so it will take time and education to change,\u201d Magers said. \u201cThey need to teach them why this is important.\u201d\n\nThe menu in the Jessup facility is gender-specfic, and the corrections department doesn\u2019t have plans to retool the menu for men in other prisons, said Gerard Shields, a spokesman.\n\nTo make the changes for women at Jessup, the warden met with Rudeine Demissie, the institution\u2019s dietary manager, who said the system was bound by national standards and state requirements. The pair worked to change a state law that required the same menu for men and women in prison.\n\nAfter getting the law changed to allow the Jessup facility to create the gender-specific menu with fewer calories, Demissie said she had to rework the contracts that supplied the food for the old menu.\n\nShe now has to continually hunt down deals for fresh food through institutional vendors, sometimes buying fruit and vegetables that are unspoiled but blemished and less desirable to grocery stores. She has to work with the 800 inmates on their preferences.\n\n\u201cWe transitioned gradually,\u201d Demissie said. \u201cWhen we prepared iced tea, we didn\u2019t use as much sugar. We phased it in.\u201d\n\nSeveral inmates who say they like the new menu credit Demissie with considering their input. Change can be hard, especially for some who are more accustomed to fast food than home-cooked meals.\n\nThe women said they particularly look forward to spring rolls, baked potatoes with steamed broccoli on top and whiting fish. They eat their tuna with less mayonnaise.\n\nThe new food has made them feel better, they said, and they hope to sustain healthy eating when they leave.\n\nDacora Ross, a 24-year-old who has been in the facility since 2015, said she never thought much about her diet or how it could affect her health. Since the menu changes, she\u2019s discovered foods like cherry tomatoes. She said she even called her mother to tell her how much she liked them.\n\nDeborah Rowe, 54, said she came from a small county jail last year about 20 pounds heavier than when she arrived there. She was pleased to find that the menu was changing for the better and decided to get involved with the improvements, talking with other women and reporting back to Demissie. She said few women noticed a reduction in portions because the meals no longer consist of \u201cempty calories\u201d and are far more filling.\n\nRowe was inspired to start exercising and said she\u2019s lost the weight she put on.\n\n\u201cThey have been integrating little changes here and there,\u201d she said. \u201cI hear from everyone how happy they are for a piece of fresh fruit.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com", "In this Nov. 7, 2018, photo, President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Fresh off the GOP\u2019s loss of the House, President Donald Trump is fudging the success of a \u201cbooming\u201d economy and overstating the impact of his campaigning on the midterm elections.\n\nHe suggested that every Republican congressional candidate for whom he paid a visit to their state to rally voters prevailed on Election Day. That\u2019s not true. Several of his favorites in closely contested Senate and House races lost Tuesday, in some cases after Trump held multiple rallies on their behalf.\n\nOn the economy, Trump asserted that U.S. growth under his watch has been unprecedented. In fact, it was surpassed just four years ago during the Obama administration. He also minimized the trade threat from China and claims a U.S. steel industry renaissance that isn\u2019t really happening.\n\nAnd speaking before Veterans Day, Trump claimed premature success in achieving \u201cmore for the vets than any president,\u201d citing an expanded health care program that has yet to be fully paid for or take effect.\n\nA look at his claims and the reality:\n\nMIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nTRUMP, on the message taken from Tuesday\u2019s elections: \u201cI think the results that I\u2019ve learned, and maybe confirm, I think people like me. I think people like the job I\u2019m doing, frankly. Because if you look at every place I went to do a rally ... and it was very hard to do it with people in Congress because there are just too many ... but I did it with the Senate. I did it with (Kentucky Rep.) Andy Barr, as you know. And he won.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump is wrong to suggest that congressional candidates won in every state where he held a rally on their behalf.\n\nTwo Republicans who closely embraced Trump in their Senate races \u2014 Montana\u2019s state auditor, Matt Rosendale, and West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey \u2014 lost to Democratic Sens. Jon Tester and Joe Manchin, respectively. Trump had visited Montana four times and West Virginia three times to rally voters. Also losing Tuesday were Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, defeated by Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, and Leah Vukmir, a GOP state lawmaker in Wisconsin who lost her Senate race to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Trump campaigned for Heller in Nevada on Oct. 20 and for Vukmir in Wisconsin on Oct. 24.\n\nIn the House, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis lost his race in Minnesota to Democrat Angie Craig, whom he had defeated by 2 percentage points in 2016. Trump campaigned in Minnesota on Oct. 4 after Lewis invited Trump to appear for him. .\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cFifty-five is the largest number of Republican senators in the last 100 years.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: His party didn\u2019t win 55 Senate seats Tuesday. Republicans held 55 seats in the Senate in 2005-2006, as well as 1997-2000, according to the Senate historian\u2019s office.\n\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s elections, Republicans will hold a 51-46 edge, with races in Florida and Arizona too close to call. A special election in Mississippi has advanced to a runoff election on Nov. 27 between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy. That means 54 Republican seats if those three races all break the GOP\u2019s way.\n\n___\n\nECONOMY\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAmerica is booming like never before. ... In terms of GDP, we\u2019re doing unbelievably.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP, on his telephone conversation Tuesday night with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about impeaching. We didn\u2019t talk about \u2014 what do you do? Do you impeach somebody because he created the greatest economic success in the history of our country?\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: The economy is healthy, but it\u2019s not unbelievable or unprecedented. It\u2019s also not clear what he means in claiming the nation\u2019s \u201cgreatest economic success\u201d ever.\n\nThe economy expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, then by 3.5 percent in the July-September quarter. Those are the best two quarters in just four years. Growth reached 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2014, followed by 4.9 percent in the third quarter.\n\nThe economy has boomed much more dramatically in the past. In the late 1990s, growth topped 4 percent for four straight years. It reached 7.2 percent in 1984. The unemployment rate is now at an impressive 50-year low of 3.7 percent. But it remained below 4 percent for nearly four years in the late 1960s.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAnd our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s exaggerating.\n\nThe steel industry has added jobs at a faster rate than the economy as a whole since Trump\u2019s inauguration, though all the gains occurred before the administration imposed tariffs on steel imports in March. Still, the rebound has hardly restored steel to its former glory.\n\nThe United States has added 5,500 steel jobs since Trump entered the White House for a total of 86,500. Before the Great Recession, there were about 100,000 steel jobs. Aluminum factories have added 2,600 jobs since the inauguration for a total of 60,100. These are minor changes in an economy with almost 150 million jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, not many miners are working again. Coal mining jobs have increased just 1,900 to 52,600 since Trump\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s also a lot lower than the roughly 70,000 coal mining jobs that existed as recently as 2014.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cChina got rid of their \u2018China \u201925\u2019 because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, \u2018China \u201825\u2019 is very insulting, because \u2018China \u201825\u2019 means, in 2025, they\u2019re going to take over, economically, the world. I said, \u2018That\u2019s not happening.\u2019\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: There\u2019s no evidence China has abandoned its economic plan. Trump is referring to China\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, under which that country\u2019s government aims to develop world-leading companies in robotics, semiconductors, electric vehicles and other advanced technologies. It\u2019s a sore point between the two nations because the United States and other countries argue that China is using unfair tactics to achieve those aims, such as forcing U.S. companies to share technology and providing government subsidies.\n\nChinese officials have played down the plan in recent months because of the international criticism. But there\u2019s little sign they have \u201cgotten rid of\u201d the plan. Because China sees the plan as a key step in the development of its economy, many observers worry they are unlikely to scale it back, which suggests U.S.-China trade fights aren\u2019t going away anytime soon.\n\n___\n\nVETERANS\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI\u2019ve done more for the vets than any President has done, certainly in many, many decades, with Choice and with other things, as you know. ...If you look at Choice \u2014 Choice alone \u2014 I mean, just take a look at what we\u2019ve done with Choice.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s taking premature credit for improvements that will take years to see full effect in regards to the Veterans Choice program.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the private-sector Choice program, which was first approved in 2014 during the Obama administration in the wake of a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The current Choice program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility.\n\nHow much Choice will be expanded, however, will depend on yet-to-be-completed regulations that will determine eligibility for veterans as well as available money for the program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put funding for VA or other domestic programs at risk of shortfalls next year.\n\nAlso important to the program\u2019s success is an overhaul of the VA\u2019s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. VA Secretary Robert Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is \u201cyears\u201d away.\n\n___\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nTRUMP, on keeping health premiums down and covering people with preexisting medical conditions: \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing, if you look at the Department of Labor also \u2014 (Health and Human Services) Secretary (Alex) Azar, what they\u2019ve done. They\u2019ve come up with some incredible health care plans, which is causing great competition and driving the prices right down.\u201d \u2014 news conference Wednesday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s glossing over the limitations of his administration\u2019s new health care options, which offer lower premiums than comprehensive plans such as the Affordable Care Act but also cover less. The availability of Trump\u2019s short-term health plans also is not going to \u201cdrive down\u201d prices of the Obama-era overhaul or comprehensive plans, but may increase premiums for robust coverage if fewer healthy people take it as a result.\n\nStrictly speaking, the short-term and association health plans are not new. The Trump administration has broadened their potential reach, although some states may push back with restrictions.\n\nShort-term plans don\u2019t have to take people with medical conditions or provide benefits such as coverage for maternity, mental health, prescription drugs and substance abuse treatment. Association health plans do have to accept people with pre-existing medical conditions, but they don\u2019t have to cover the full menu of 10 \u201cessential\u201d kinds of benefits required by Obamacare.\n\nGary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says short-term plans may turn out to be more costly than Trump administration officials suggest. The plans now cover up to 90 days, but if insurers expand them to offer up to 36 months\u2019 coverage, the companies will be taking on more risk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay more up front because there\u2019s a longer time during which you could get sick,\u201d Claxton said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Cal Woodward, Alan Fram and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 Democratic governor-elect Janet Mills has picked the leaders of her team preparing to assemble her incoming administration.\n\nMills says her campaign manager Jeremy Kennedy and former Maine Democratic Party chairman Ben Grant will lead the team.\n\nMills, also attorney general, says she wants to lower health care cost and improve Maine\u2019s economy and public education system.\n\nMills\u2019 transition team will be evaluating and recruiting cabinet members ahead of the Jan. 2 inauguration.

Now it\u2019s up to lawmakers to review the complaints and figure out what to do.\n\nThe Assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Election Law will hold a public hearing Thursday in Manhattan to review Election Day operations and possible ways to improve the voting experience.\n\nAdvance voting will likely be at the top of that list. New York is now one of a minority of states that don\u2019t allow voters to cast an early ballot, either in person or through the mail.\n\nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie said his chamber is determined to take action this year to overhaul the state\u2019s election rules, many of which have been largely unchanged for decades.\n\n\u201cWe have legislation ready to ensure every eligible voter has ample opportunity to vote, including the establishment of an early voting period and no-excuse absentee voting,\u201d Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe also plan to pass legislation to combine federal and state primaries, bringing New York State in compliance with federal law. We want to modernize and streamline voter registration by establishing an online registration process.\u201d\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, also listed voting reform as one of his priorities for the year.\n\nOther proposed changes intended to make it easier to vote include overhauling the state\u2019s onerous registration deadlines, which can force people to affiliate with a party in some cases more than a year before the primary to cast a ballot.\n\n\u201cIt is so hard to vote in this state,\u201d Cuomo said on the radio Thursday. \u201cIt is a joke. ... Early voting! Make it easier.\u201d\n\nCHILD VICTIMS ACT: For years the Republican leaders of the state Senate have blocked a bill intended to make it easier for molestation victims to sue their abusers. Now, backers of that proposal are confident the bill could soon pass after Democrats flipped the chamber.\n\n\u201cIt is a new day for survivors of child sexual abuse in New York State,\u201d read a joint statement from a broad coalition of survivors and advocacy organizations. \u201cFor the first time, we have a partner in the state Senate that can and will commit to passing the Child Victims Act. ... We anticipate swift action.\u201d\n\nThe statement was signed by groups including Safe Horizon, the Stop Abuse Campaign, the Foundation for Survivors of Abuse, NY Loves Kids and the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nThe legislation, known as the Child Victims Act, would extend the criminal and civil statutes of limitation for molestation going forward, and create a one-year window allowing victims to sue over abuse claims now barred by the statute of limitations. The Catholic Church has long opposed the last provision, arguing that allowing civil suits over decades-old incidents could bankrupt any large institution that deals with children.\n\nRepublicans have long blocked the bill from getting a vote and suggested alternative bills that come without the look-back window, a deal-breaker for many supporters.\n\nUPCOMING: Wednesday: Standing Committee on Aging holds a public hearing in Albany focused on independent living and the programs and services dedicated to supporting seniors who age in place.\n\nAlso Wednesday: Three Assembly committees focused on alcohol and drug abuse, health and corrections will hold a joint public hearing on medication-assisted treatment programs for addicts within the state\u2019s correctional system.

(AP) \u2014 Farm bill negotiators in Congress have struggled to resolve differences over work requirements for food stamp recipients, but the Senate\u2019s top Republican guarantees the final version will include legalization of hemp.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that completing work on a new farm bill looms as one of his top priorities when Congress reconvenes for a lame-duck session.\n\nWork to reauthorize key farm programs has slowed over work requirements for food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\n\nWhile negotiators have wrangled over that issue, one provision certain to be in the final farm bill is one to fully legalize hemp, McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican is a key negotiator in the House-Senate conference committee crafting the final bill.\n\n\u201cIt will be in there, I guarantee you that,\u201d he told reporters in Kentucky.\n\nThe versatile crop is making a comeback in Kentucky and elsewhere.\n\nMcConnell has put his considerable clout behind legalizing hemp as an agricultural commodity. He has led the effort to remove hemp from the controlled substances list that currently associates the crop with its cousin \u2014 marijuana.\n\nHemp and marijuana are the same species, but hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a high.\n\nMcConnell said his home state has a jump on reviving hemp production and processing.\n\nKentucky farmers grew thousands of acres of hemp this year, and dozens of Kentucky processors are turning the raw product into a multitude of products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to think about what it could be,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to overstate this \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s going to be the next tobacco or not, but I do think it has a lot of potential,\u201d he added.\n\nKentucky agriculture has diversified since tobacco production went into deep decline, and farmers continue to look for alternative crops.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s proposal to legalize hemp was included in the Senate\u2019s version of the farm bill but not in the House version.\n\nThe crop was historically used for rope but has many other uses, including clothing and mulch from the fiber; hemp milk and cooking oil from the seeds; and soap and lotions. Other uses include building materials, animal bedding and biofuels.\n\nMcConnell said his goal is to have hemp production only \u201clightly\u201d regulated by the federal agriculture department. Growers would contact officials in their states so a list could be kept in case law enforcement wants to make sure what\u2019s planted is hemp and not marijuana, he said.\n\nHemp started its comeback with the 2014 federal farm bill. McConnell helped push for a provision that allows states to pursue research and development. That allowed the crop to be grown on an experimental basis in Kentucky and other states.", "NASHVILLE, Tenn.

The new venture builds custom steel siding and roofing products. (Larry Mayer/Billings Gazette via AP)\n\nRYEGATE, Mont. (AP) \u2014 A year ago, the Golden Valley Hutterite Colony in Ryegate launched a steel fabrication operation after leaders there realized they needed to do something different.\n\nHutterites have farmed and raised livestock on the Northern Plains of North and South Dakota, Eastern Montana and southwestern Canada for more than 100 years.\n\nBut agriculture hasn\u2019t sustained them like it used to, so leaders at the Golden Valley Colony decided they needed to branch out. Their facility produces steel siding, trim and roofs all cut and formed to fit for a contractor or homeowner.\n\n\u201cWe have to do this,\u201d said Dan Kleinsasser, a colony member and one of the workers in the steel fabrication plant. His son, Josh Kleinsasser, is the operation\u2019s manager.\n\nIntroducing a state-of-the-art steel fabrication and production facility to an agricultural operation, which runs on technology and practices that were pioneered, in some cases, generations ago, presents myriad issues.\n\nIn order to launch Valley Steel, the colony needed to take orders and correspond with contractors and customers electronically. And so for the first time, the internet has come to the Golden Valley Colony, The Billings Gazette reports .\n\nThe carpentry shop at the religious colony soon followed and now, for an entire year, the whole place has been wired. Dan Kleinsasser said having access to the internet, with all its worldly temptations, has gone well and that its use is closely monitored.\n\nAfter successfully using internet for Valley Steel and the carpentry shop, leaders at the colony decided to give access to all members. To encourage accountability, colony leaders set up a computer in an open room that had windows and a door with no locks. And they set up strict filters on internet searches to limit what the colony could access. Working with the internet service provider, leaders also monitor the computer\u2019s internet history.\n\nAs operations at Valley Steel have gotten underway, workers have been churning out steel trim and siding for barns, homes and warehouses for nearly a year now. It hasn\u2019t been easy and managers have had to troubleshoot at nearly every turn.\n\nDan Kleinsasser pointed to the warehouse\u2019s collection of steel.\n\nSteel arrives to the facility in single, long sheets wrapped on giant spools. They keep dozens of these spools on hand, each a different color or texture. And every so often one will show up damaged or otherwise unusable, a hiccup that can be costly as it slows production.\n\nProduction moves as quickly as they have the correct materials on hand to use. That was another learning curve.\n\n\u201cWe got a big surprise,\u201d Kleinsasser said. \u201cWe needed way more inventory. The biggest challenge is knowing what to order.\u201d\n\nCommunication has also taken some work. Hutterites are a close-knit group who speak a mix of English and an upper German dialect known as Hutterisch. Traditionally, they have limited their contact with the world outside the colonies.\n\nAnd so they\u2019ve had to work to ensure their communication with the contractors with whom they deal is clear and unequivocal, tightening up the ordering system and stating clearly their expectations.\n\nOn top of that, county phone lines don\u2019t go out to the colony. Instead they use a satellite phone connection that sometimes goes down in bad weather. The next big project for Golden Valley is bringing fiber to the rural colony to install an actual phone line.\n\nOn top of all that, the price of steel has shot up after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThat affected us quite a bit,\u201d Kleinsasser said.\n\nValley Steel absorbed some of the price hike but it had to pass some of it on to its customers.\n\nThe colony has been able to find a good stable of customers in its first year and Kleinsasser would like to see the company bring on more in the coming year.\n\nJeff Davis of Jeff Davis Construction in Billings is a fan.\n\n\u201cI love working with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not too big for their britches, like other companies I won\u2019t name.\u201d\n\nValley Steel has always shown a willingness to help regardless of the size of Davis\u2019 company and it almost always has his order done quickly. Davis also said the prices are good.\n\nOne of the major hurdles to bringing on new customers is the colony\u2019s decision not to deliver their product.\n\nDepending on the season, colony members \u2014 every able-bodied one of them \u2014 help with planting and harvest, or processing and packaging holiday turkeys. When it\u2019s time to deliver or harvest the turkeys, or the chicken and eggs or pork they process, the colony needs every truck it owns to get the work done.\n\nThose operations are vital to the success of the colony, so diverting resources to deliver its manufactured steel trim and siding just doesn\u2019t make sense, Kleinsasser said.\n\nStill, colony members believe launching Valley Steel has been a good move and leaders are hopeful its success will grow. They believe in their ability to do the work and do it well. And they\u2019ve seen it work at other colonies.\n\nGolden Valley is the only Hutterite colony in Montana to branch outside agriculture with a steel fabrication plant, but a handful of colonies in North and South Dakota have tried it and found success. Kleinsasser said those colonies have been a good resource as Valley Steel has worked out the bugs of its new operation.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t expect other Montana colonies to follow Golden Valley\u2019s lead. Another Hutterite-led steel fabrication plant would likely saturate the market, making it an unprofitable venture for both colonies, Kleinsasser said.\n\nOutside steel fabrication companies haven\u2019t taken much notice of Golden Valley\u2019s operation. The owner of Vannoy Metal Works in Billings said his company hasn\u2019t been affected by it.\n\nAs Valley Steel looks at its next year, Josh Kleinsasser, the manager, is optimistic about its prospects. Dan Kleinsasser is optimistic as well, but he also is more pragmatic about the future.\n\n\u201cThere will be more challenges that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d Kleinsasser said.\n\nBut they\u2019ll solve those problems as they come up and become a better company because of it.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Billings Gazette, http://www.billingsgazette.com", "MORRISVILLE, Vt.

A message popularized by every \u201990s kid\u2019s favorite cartoon aardvark has seeped into the collective millennial brain, according to a Pew Research study: \u201cHaving fun isn\u2019t hard when you\u2019ve got a library card.\u201d\n\nNationally, millennials are the generation most likely to use public libraries, the Pew study found. The 2016 data show 53 percent of those aged 18 to 35 said they had used a public library or bookmobile in the previous 12 months, compared to 45 percent of Gen Xers, 43 percent of baby boomers and 36 percent of those in the Silent Generation. The survey question was worded to focus on public libraries, not libraries on college campuses.\n\nColorado is stocked with slightly more than 100 library districts that reported to the Library Research Service\u2019s annual survey. Those Colorado libraries saw more than 31 million visits in 2017, offering more than 10,700 programs for young adults and nearly 70,000 for adults.\n\nJon Walker, executive director of the Pueblo City-County Library District, has seen the millennial trend for himself.\n\nWhile his libraries don\u2019t break out numbers to specifically track attendance by age, Walker said the Pueblo library district saw an 86-percent attendance increase in adult programming from 2017 to 2018, meaning people were scrambling to make it to sewing circles, coding classes and tie-dying events. The program attendance from January through September 2018 was 357,681, while the same time period in 2017 saw 191,822 participants.\n\n\u201cA lot of this interest is in our young adult population,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat age group is definitely in our wheelhouse.\u201d\n\nWalker thinks young adults\u2019 library love affair stems from two places. First, he\u2019s noticed fledgling parents finding solace behind library walls as they search for somewhere safe, affordable and educational to turn their kids loose.\n\nKiran Nole, 21, was hanging out with the almost 4-year-old twin boys she nannies in the Denver Central Library\u2019s children\u2019s section on Friday.\n\n\u201cThey love coming here and interacting with other kids and reading books with me,\u201d Nole said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice for me to come and talk to other nannies and parents. Also, I just found out I could check out movies here and that some of them are even new, so that\u2019s really cool, too.\u201d\n\nSecondly, Walker has seen massive growth in the Pueblo library\u2019s program attendance for hands-on classes and events.\n\n\u201cThis month alone, we\u2019ve got dance programs, music programs and we had a film festival where people made their own films and then we showed them,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t abandoning investing in the book, but we are seeing some shift away from the traditional resources to these other kinds of activities just based on utilization.\u201d\n\nA Boulder Public Library program named \u201cadultology\u201d is shamelessly catering to folks wanting to feel more grown-up in the kitchen. Aspen Walker, community engagement and enrichment manager at the Boulder library, said the class teaches farm-to-table cooking and culinary experiences like learning how to brew kombucha.\n\nWalker also pointed to the Boulder library\u2019s \u201cmakerspace\u201d \u2014 which features a full service woodshop and crafting supplies for sewing, mending, weaving and more \u2014 as being popular with young adults. A workshop coming up particularly excited Walker: library patrons can learn how to sew pockets on their clothes.\n\nChris Henning, spokesman for Denver Public Library, also has seen young adults gravitating toward some of the library\u2019s less traditional offerings. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a larger number of millennials than we\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d Henning said.\n\nAt the Denver Public Library, patrons can check out experiences: passes to Colorado state parks complete with a family activity backpack, admission to nearby museums and a lottery for tickets to plays and concerts with the Colorado Symphony and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, GoPro cameras, indoor air quality monitors and more.\n\nIn August, the Denver library\u2019s Rodolfo \u201cCorky\u201d Gonzales Branch offered literary-themed tattoos, moving the needle toward a youthful, trendy service to remind everyone of the magic of ink on paper and skin. A free Netflix-esque streaming service called Kanopy is also leaving its Denver Public Library mark, offering thousands of videos in its digital catalog.\n\n\u201cBased on that sharing economy idea where they\u2019re trying to save money and be resourceful, that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth because of millennials,\u201d Henning said.\n\nHana Zittel is an adult services librarian at the Denver Central Library branch, where she manages book checkout and designs programming for adults and young adults.\n\nZittel isn\u2019t convinced that young folks are pumped on the library just for the museum passes and movies \u2014 she watches millennials\u2019 love of the written word unfold around her every day.\n\n\u201cFrom what I see, millennials are big readers and see the merit of the library being free and open to everyone and a place where all ideas are welcome,\u201d Zittel said. \u201cOne of the most valuable things the library still represents is nurturing that love of learning and reading.\u201d\n\nZittel and her coworkers also help coordinate programs like the Winter of Reading, inspired from the classic summer reading programs normally aimed at children with a seasonal and generational twist.\n\n\u201cThis may not be the same library you remember when you were a kid,\u201d Zittel said. \u201cI was just sharing with a group of friends that they can get free tickets to museums through the library, and they were yelling at me to write the website link down for them. The connection over art and music and reading is something that really resonates with that age group, and the library has kind of become an epicenter for those interactions.\u201d", "DENVER (AP) \u2014 After years of double and triple digit growth, craft beer is slowing, weighed down by intense competition and even systemic changes to Colorado\u2019s beer market. There are more than 300 breweries now in Colorado. Competition to be the cold one you reach for is coming from both the biggest and smallest breweries.\n\nCraft beer owns the market here and Bart Watson, an economist at the Brewers Association, said we \u201cmay be reaching that point of a mature marketplace where it\u2019s more difficult to grow the overall share.\u201d\n\nDenver saw a record number of tap rooms open in 2017 and there are more than 80 breweries in the city now. Given that the Mile High City is soaking in suds, Brian O\u2019Connell, the owner of Renegade Brewing, admitted that you can \u201ctend to get a little myopic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think beer rules the world, right? And then you step back, and you\u2019re like, \u2018well, no, it actually doesn\u2019t,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nPeople have other things they can drink, like wine and whiskey, which are seeing strong sales growth too \u2014 yet it\u2019s bigger than that. The independent craft beer industry arguably faces more challenges today than at any other time since Prohibition.\n\n\u201cYou know, in some ways we are talking about the heart and soul of the independent beer industry,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.\n\nThe problem can be boiled down to competition. Most notably from Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s largest beer company. They\u2019ve bought up about a dozen craft brands across the country, including Colorado\u2019s own Breckenridge Brewery in late 2015.\n\nWhen Anheuser it slashed prices on those beers, O\u2019Connell was alarmed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just something that craft, independent craft, is never going to be able to compete with,\u201d he said. \u201cAn independent brewery will never win the price war.\u201d\n\nIn response, O\u2019Connell pulled back on distribution and is instead focusing on this neighborhood tap room. The profit margins are much higher in that pursuit.\n\nSomething big is coming though, that will amplify the advantages big beer companies. The Brewers Association\u2019s Watson points out that on Jan. 1, 2019, grocery stores will be allowed to sell full strength beer in the state.\n\nAndres Gil Zaldana, the head of the Colorado Brewers Guild, notes that it\u2019s \u201cgoing to be a sea change for a lot of our guys.\u201d\n\nMany grocery store chains may end up with limited selections picked by out-of-state executives. Right now, small independent liquor stores call the shots, many of which have been open to selling small craft brands.\n\n\u201cSo, a lot of people who did make heavy investments in distribution, for example, have now come to realize that shelf space is limited,\u201d Zaldana said.\n\nOverall craft beer sales might increase, with grocery stores across the state representing a new market. There will be greater access, but worries of a diminished selection. Brian Dunn of Great Divide Brewing Company thinks that \u201csmaller breweries are going to suffer\u201d in that environment.\n\n\u201cI think some of the larger ones will do OK to improve their sales,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t quite know how that\u2019s all going to shake out.\u201d\n\nSales have softened for many craft breweries this year, Dunn said. Like O\u2019Connell, Anheuser-Busch cutting prices on its craft portfolio are his number one concern right now.\n\n\u201cI would be very apprehensive to start a packaging brewery in Colorado right now,\u201d Dunn said. He has one of the largest in Colorado. A massive facility in RINO.\n\nDunn may be able to thrive in grocery stores because he has a strong brand that\u2019s found in 25 states.\n\nSmaller breweries like O\u2019Connell\u2019s Renegade have more existential questions. He fears that grocery stores and price competition from Anheuser-Busch will eventually force some independent brewers to close their doors.\n\n\u201cIf you think that independent beer is important, and you think that what they do for your community is important, and you think what they stand for is important, and you think that the art that they bring into the world is important, then, yeah, you better pay $11 or $12 for a six-pack and you better keep them going or they will be gone,\u201d O\u2019Connell said.", "GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) \u2014 Families involved in the Sunset Mesa funeral home case hoped to answer at least one question.\n\nAll the unknowns that surfaced after the FBI raided the Montrose business nine months ago left them uneasy, wondering if their loved ones\u2019 bodies could have been involved in the allegations.\n\nThey just wanted to know if the cremains they received were likely human, if they could be their relatives.\n\nThe funeral home and its owner, Megan Hess, were accused of operating a body-broker operation under the same roof as the crematory, something state law allowed at the time.

This echoes a concern that arose in the first civil suit filed against Sunset Mesa and Hess by the family of Gerald \u201cCactus\u201d Hollenbeck earlier this year. The cremains given to his widow were tested and found to be bone, but included parts of a zipper and watch, when he was wearing pajamas and no jewelry when his body was picked up.\n\n\u201cThe deception goes so much deeper,\u201d the family member said. \u201cIt raises a whole bunch of new questions. It\u2019s lies upon lies at this point.\u201d\n\nFamilies receiving their results from the tests are discussing the outcomes and speculating as to what could have happened. Some think that bodies were cremated together and divvied up, topped off with dry concrete and distributed. The funeral home regularly received orders for specific body parts, according to another source familiar with the business dealings, but also sold whole bodies. According to the report from a state regulatory inspector who accompanied FBI personnel when they raided the funeral home, they found a station that appeared to be used for measuring cremains next to the crematory. The setup included a scale, a container of labeled cremains from another crematory, a trowel and buckets of an unknown substance as well as bags of dry concrete.\n\nAt this point, the family member said it\u2019s about coming to terms with the idea that even if the cremains came back with results showing they were likely bone, it\u2019s not possible to know if they belonged to a person or even several people if they were comingled. The limitations of the testing were communicated by the forensics team at the university from the beginning, and no one person\u2019s cremains can be identified. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking we all pretty much had a scoop of whatever,\u201d the family member said. \u201cThey\u2019re essentially all of ours and none of ours.\u201d\n\nThough the FBI has remained mum on details surrounding the investigation, families said they have been told there are at least 50 core cases involved in the Sunset Mesa case, and there are hundreds more who used the funeral home since it opened in 2010.\n\nRoughly one-third of the 128 cremains samples submitted for testing to Colorado Mesa University were picked up Nov. 2, along with full reports detailing their analysis and whether the samples were likely bone or something else. While the tests cannot confirm the cremains are human, they were compared with test results from other substances, including kitty litter, concrete and bone, and the reports discuss the comparisons of results to those substances.\n\nThat afternoon, families came to the same place they dropped off their samples months ago, waited in the same lounge and shared a grim circumstance with each other. They discussed the case, horror stories of how they had been informed that their loved ones\u2019 remains had been located elsewhere after being sold without permission, or how they had no idea of the final destination of their loved ones\u2019 bodies.\n\nColorado Mesa University\u2019s forensics and social sciences students took on the project to help support the families who wanted to get cremains tested and had used Sunset Mesa to handle their loved ones\u2019 final arrangements. The question of whether cremains given back to the families were actually the decedents themselves is one that cannot be answered definitively, as DNA evidence is destroyed in the cremation process. However, tests revealed whether the substances were more likely to be bone or something else \u2014 like dry concrete, as has been found in some families\u2019 cremains they received from the mortuary.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many of the 128 samples submitted to the university\u2019s volunteers for testing came back as consistent with bone or as another substance.\n\nCMU Forensic Investigation Research Station Director Melissa Connor estimated each sample took roughly 10 hours to process and analyze, and said the staff and students spent more than 1,100 hours volunteering, cataloguing, sifting through samples, using magnets and metal detectors to find other substances and finalizing the reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful they put their trust in us,\u201d said Jamie Johnson, a senior biology major who volunteered her time. \u201cWe learned the human aspect of our science,\u201d added Sidney Potestio, a junior studying criminal justice.\n\nConnor said she hopes knowing that some of the samples are, in fact, cremains of bone ash will bring some closure to families who received those results.\n\n\u201cGiven some of the kerfuffles and questions surrounding Sunset Mesa, it doesn\u2019t answer all the questions, but it\u2019s the best we can do,\u201d she said.", "Dogs in animal cruelty cases up for adoption\n\nBRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) \u2014 Dogs seized in animal cruelty cases will be available for adoption in Brunswick.\n\nThe Bangor Daily News reports that nearly 30 dogs will be available Saturday at the Midcoast Humane Society.\n\nLocal police seized 44 dogs from a Brunswick home in August.
