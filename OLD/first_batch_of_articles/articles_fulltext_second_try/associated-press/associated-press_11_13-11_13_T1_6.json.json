(AP) \u2014 After Syracuse defeated Louisville in the home season finale Friday night, Orange coach Dino Babers brought the seniors out of the locker room to mingle one last time with their fans inside the Carrier Dome. Quarterback Eric Dungey lingered longer than most, snapping selfie after selfie with fans.\n\nIt was a moment to savor for one of the most dynamic players in school history as No. 12 Syracuse (8-2, 5-2 ACC) continued its return to respectability under the leadership of its third-year coach and his star quarterback.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Dungey said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been an incredible experience.\u201d\n\nThat skinny kid who was thrust into the season opener his freshman year when senior Terrel Hunt suffered a career-ending injury, then delivered a victory in his first college start the next week, has overcome at least one concussion and a broken foot to flourish at Syracuse. Dungey holds or shares 16 team records \u2014 from passing yards per game in a season (297.7) to career 300-yard passing games (10) to total offense per game for a season (330.2) and career (294.3) to most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback (200). He has 10,594 total yards, fifth all-time in the ACC, and needs just 71 yards rushing to reach 2,000 for his career.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the confidence I have in myself,\u201d said Dungey, who starred at Lakeridge High School outside Portland, Oregon, but had few college suitors. \u201cI was under-recruited. Our confidence wasn\u2019t as high as it should have been.\n\n\u201cI just put everything I had into this team, this school. It just feels good to finally get some wins out of it.\u201d\n\nThose records have been achieved despite long absences due to injury by a player who has uncanny physical ability as a runner that\u2019s allowed him to hurdle over defenders . Or better yet, now that he\u2019s a 226-pound tower of muscle, run over them.\n\n\u201cHe is an energized guy that I think has to have the respect of everybody on that team and the fans, too, because he plays the game like it\u2019s his last game,\u201d said Miami coach Mark Richt, a former quarterback. \u201cIt\u2019s just impressive to see him operate.\u201d\n\nThat broken foot happened last fall early in Syracuse\u2019s game at Florida State . It didn\u2019t prevent Dungey from finishing the game and nearly leading the Orange to victory. His line: 24 completions for two touchdowns and 109 yards rushing and another score in a three-point loss.\n\n\u201cThe energy we get from him is the way he competes. I mean, don\u2019t you get energy from the way he competes?\u201d Babers asked. \u201cWhen you\u2019re watching him, you\u2019re going, OMG. He\u2019s fearless. He\u2019s wreckless, and we love him.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the injuries have been a major hindrance for the team because they\u2019ve kept Dungey on the sideline for 10 entire games and most of another. In between, he\u2019s guided Syracuse to stunning home victories over Virginia Tech and Clemson , and two weeks ago he outdueled North Carolina State star Ryan Finley in a 51-41 victory over the No. 22 Wolfpack.\n\nDungey\u2019s final season has been injury-free. He\u2019s adapted his style, often sliding to safety instead of confronting tacklers head-on, and the high-powered offense has purred for the most part, averaging 44 points a game. But it has not been without its trials.\n\nThe broken foot opened a window for redshirt freshman backup Tommy DeVito to strut his stuff, and he has developed rapidly, taking first-string snaps in spring ball while Dungey was on the mend and mounting a challenge in preseason camp.\n\nThat experience has paid big dividends for the Orange. When Dungey faltered late and the Orange fell behind North Carolina three weeks ago, DeVito replaced him and led Syracuse to an overtime win as Dungey cheered from the sideline. DeVito also starred in a win over Florida State when Dungey had to sit because of blurred vision caused by a fragment from the artificial turf field.\n\nNow Dungey is poised for perhaps the biggest game of his career. The Orange face No. 3 Notre Dame (10-0) at Yankee Stadium on Saturday as the Irish chase a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nNo matter the outcome, the story of the likable kid from the West Coast, whose off-the-field antics included backflips off 20-foot ledges and plunges from 75-foot towers into the Willamette River, won\u2019t soon be forgotten.\n\n\u201cWhen this guy rolls out of here, there\u2019s going to be tall tales about him,\u201d Babers said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to say, \u2018Nah, he didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 The heck he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "A Utah fan shows his support in the first half during an NCAA college football game against Oregon Saturday Nov. 10, 2018, in Salt Lake City. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nClay Helton is on the hot seat at USC and four teams in the Pac-12 South could wind up with identical records at the top of the standings at the end of the season. The conference\u2019s southern side enters the final two weeks in a jumble.\n\nHere are the possible scenarios at the moment: Utah (7-3, 5-3 Pac-12) can capture the division\u2019s berth in the conference championship game with a win Saturday in the rivalry game against Colorado in Boulder. But the Utes will need Arizona State to lose one of its last two games. The Utes finish the season with a nonconference game against BYU.\n\nThe Sun Devils (6-4, 4-3) have the most direct route to the title game, needing only to win both of their final games, at Oregon this Saturday and on the road against rival Arizona over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nAnd Arizona (5-5, 4-3) can still pull off an upset by winning its final two games, at Washington State on Saturday and in the rivalry game, but the Wildcats will also need Utah to lose to the Buffaloes.\n\nThat Utah-Colorado game will happen early Saturday, so the Wildcats will know by the time they take the field against the No. 8 Cougars that night if they still have a shot.\n\n\u201cWe have to be mature enough and be focused enough \u2014 which we have been the last couple of weeks with the way we played \u2014 to focus on the task at hand, which is Washington State,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re worried about anything more than that, obviously that\u2019s going to affect your play. We\u2019ve still got a lot of things out in front of us, but in order to have that in front of us, we\u2019ve got to play very well in Pullman, the way we\u2019ve played the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nMind-numbingly, it is possible for four teams to finish at 5-4 atop the conference. However, if that happens, and Arizona State has won the Territorial Cup, the Sun Devils have the tiebreaker. If ASU falls to Arizona, it goes to Utah.\n\nSo there\u2019s that.\n\nThere are a couple of other possibly less confusing things to consider down the stretch:\n\nHOTSEAT HELTON: USC eliminated itself from the conference championship conversation with last Saturday\u2019s 15-14 loss to California at the Coliseum. The Trojans (5-5, 4-4) have lost two straight at home after a 19-game winning streak there.\n\nTo say it has been a disappointing season for the Trojans is an understatement. The team was picked to finish first in the South in the Pac-12\u2032s preseason poll.\n\nWhile the most recent loss gave rise to speculation that Helton would be fired following the season, the coach said he has faith in his team and its future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the 5-5 season right now. But better days are to come,\u201d Helton said. \u201cPrograms I\u2019ve seen across the country, win a Rose Bowl, win a Pac-12 Championship and then have an off season and then come right back. As a matter of a fact, we\u2019re going to compete against one of them in about two weeks. Sometimes you have a season that just doesn\u2019t go your way. I believe in this coaching staff, I believe in the leadership and in the players. Most of all I believe there are better days ahead.\u201d\n\nUSC\u2019s remaining games are against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, and at home against Notre Dame on Nov. 24.\n\nRIVALRIES: It used to be that nearly all the teams had rivalry games on the final weekend of the regular season. This season, there are three rivalry games this weekend, including the Big Game between Cal and Stanford, the battle for the Victory Bell between USC and UCLA, and the Rumble in the Rockies between Utah and Colorado.\n\n\u201cI did get used to it for a long time, being the last game of the year, the last regular-season game. But I do understand a lot of people don\u2019t want to have it on the Thanksgiving weekend, they\u2019d prefer not to have the Big Game on Thanksgiving weekend. So I can see it both ways,\u201d Stanford coach David Shaw said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve kind of gotten used to it now with the way that it\u2019s been with a game afterward. It doesn\u2019t cheapen the rivalry to me. This is a great week with a lot of festivities.\u201d\n\nOH, AND ABOUT THE NORTH: It\u2019s not settled either. But all signs point to the Apple Cup. Both the Cougars and the Huskies control their own destinies, meaning that whichever team wins out will get the championship game berth.\n\nWashington State (9-1, 6-1) hosts Arizona on Saturday, while Washington (7-3, 5-2) hosts Oregon State. Both seemingly winnable games.\n\nThe Apple Cup is set for Black Friday in Pullman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Astoria has a growing number of marijuana stores, but they're also part of a trend toward consolidation, as many shops try to weather a weak market, sometimes taking on outside investment capital. (Colin Murphey/The Daily Astorian via AP)\n\nASTORIA, Oregon (AP) \u2014 Signs for Mr. Nice Guy, an ode to the 1998 stoner comedy \u201cHalf Baked,\u201d recently began popping up in Astoria, Oregon.\n\nThe Daily Astorian reports that the marijuana retailer has merged with a sister company, Hi Cascade, absorbing its location at the foot of the South Slope. Mr. Nice Guy will open another store next month on Bond Street downtown.\n\nThe new addition to Astoria\u2019s growing number of marijuana stores is also part of a trend toward consolidation, as many shops try to weather a weak market, sometimes taking on outside investment capital.\n\nWill Wiedenmann, an assistant director of operations with Mr. Nice Guy, said the two companies\u2019 ownership felt they needed to make a universal brand behind Mr. Nice Guy. The company now has 16 locations in Oregon, including former Hi Cascades.\n\n\u201cStrength in numbers is a big thing,\u201d Wiedenmann said.\n\nFive Zero Trees, a Portland-based retailer that recently opened stores in Cannon Beach and Astoria, has six locations on the North Coast and around Portland. Sweet Relief has five locations on the North Coast and inland to Columbia County. Cannabis Nation, with a location in Seaside, has four stores around the state.\n\nMarijuana stores have faced increasingly tight margins since overproduction after the drug was legalized in Oregon led to a sharp decline in prices. Having more places to sell allows retail chains to buy at a larger scale for a lower price, said Beau Whitney, a cannabis economist with New Frontier Data.\n\n\u201cThat creates a pricing differential relative to the smaller mom and pops that don\u2019t have the purchasing power,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, this is a natural evolution of the market. It\u2019s starting to increase now lately.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like Oregon was reaching saturation when it recorded nearly 600 dispensaries, Whitney said. But the state had focused on getting more licensees and offering lower entry fees to help take consumers away from the illicit market.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, when you think about it, having unlimited licenses in a closed environment . at some point there was naturally going to be a consolidation in the marketplace,\u201d Whitney said.\n\nState regulators in June placed a moratorium on new licensees until they could work through the backlog of applicants seeking entry into the marijuana industry. That backlog is exacerbated by companies changing ownership as they take on investors, Whitney said. The process was made easier by the state Legislature in 2016 rolling back requirements that more than half of a marijuana store be owned by an Oregon resident.\n\nNow out-of-state investors can contribute as much as they want to Oregon cannabis businesses, bankrolling new franchises.\n\n\u201cInvestors are coming in,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cThey see an opportunity. They are seeing a certain level of distress in the market. That distress is allowing them to buy high-value properties at a discount. They see this as an arbitrage opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the rush of outside capital is that marijuana business owners can\u2019t access traditional financing, such as loans, because of federal prohibition, Whitney said.\n\nThe clearest example of outside investment locally is Hashstoria, a marijuana store in Uniontown. The business is registered to Charles Delvalle from Eugene and Canty Ventures, an angel investment firm from Florida embracing nontraditional, emergent industries from cannabis to cryptocurrency. Hashstoria\u2019s ownership was not immediately available for comment. On his Instagram profile, Canty founder Jedd Canty announced the company would be establishing a second location in Springfield.\n\nWhitney sees smaller shops and growers being squeezed out of the cannabis market as prices continue to stagnate. \u201cThose mom and pop shops that don\u2019t have access to capital, they\u2019re the ones that are going to be priced out of the market first,\u201d he said.\n\nApril Smith and her family bought out the previous owners of The Farmacy, a standalone marijuana store in Astoria, earlier this year. Previously a behavioral health and addiction treatment therapist in Washington state, Smith said she had seen how well cannabidiol, a nonpsychoactive compound in cannabis with medical uses, had helped people escape addiction to hard drugs.\n\nThe Farmacy includes a retail shop and a grow operation under a separate company in the basement. The vertical integration from seed to sale allows more tax write-offs under the section of the IRS tax code limiting cannabis producers to business deductions attributable to production activities.\n\n\u201cTo be able to be successful, you have to have a way to optimize everything,\u201d Smith said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from The Daily Astorian http://www.dailyastorian.com/", "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

Susan Martinez, a Republican who advocated a tough-on-crime agenda that sought to enhance penalties for criminals.\n\nDemocrats, who control the state House and Senate, largely rejected the measures.\n\nMartinez is being replaced in January by U.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who won election last week.\n\nThose on the criminal justice reform subcommittee are now weighing an agenda that includes amended parole procedures that could make it easier for some former inmates to meet certain demands of parole such as holding a low-wage job and meeting regularly with their parole officer.\n\nFigures in a Legislative Finance Committee report last week showed New Mexico\u2019s prison population increasing, even as nationwide figures reflect incarceration rates overall on the decline.\n\nThe report from the Legislature\u2019s non-partisan analysts also showed rising recidivism rates, with an increasing number of men and women returning to New Mexico prisons within three years of their release. Lawmakers say many are returning on technical violations such as failing to report for appointments with parole officers rather than committing new crimes.\n\n\u201cThe data shows recidivism is driven by technical parole violations,\u201d said Rep. Antonio \u201cMoe\u201d Maestas, an Albuquerque Democrat.\n\nSen. Cisco McSorley, also an Albuquerque Democrat, noted that the committee analysists also found that the state had spent $40 million in a recent year incarcerating inmates who had returned to prison on such technical violations.\n\nHe questioned whether small changes to state laws could result in savings and in new funding for treatment and jobs programs for felons as they re-enter society.", "CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP Photo/Ed Zurga)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes walked off the field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday with another record on his resume and the Kansas City Chiefs another win toward earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHe didn\u2019t have much chance to savor any of it.\n\nMahomes quickly learned that the stepfather of his longtime girlfriend, Brittany Matthews, had died after a medical emergency during the game. Mahomes quickly skipped out on the postgame celebration and joined Matthews, who posted the sobering news on her social media accounts that evening.\n\n\u201cToday is a day I will never forget,\u201d she wrote in the caption of a photo. \u201cDirectly after this picture I sprinted to the front entrance to see my stepdad passed out! He did not come back from this and he was called to heaven today! I KNOW 100 (percent) he is so happy up there with his kids looking down on us, cheering loud that his Chiefs won today!\u201d\n\nMahomes is not expected to miss any preparation for Monday night\u2019s showdown with the Rams in Los Angeles, though Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he would be fine if it happens.\n\nThe Chiefs were off Tuesday and Wednesday, giving Mahomes and his family time to cope.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear about what took place,\u201d Reid said. \u201cPrayers and blessings are with the family. I talked to Patrick and they\u2019re doing well for the circumstances that took place. As they go through this mourning period our thoughts and prayers are with them.\u201d\n\nThis season has already been a whirlwind for Mahomes, who was thrust into the starting job after the trade of Alex Smith to Washington and whose ability was justifiably questioned.\n\nHe was a product of the Texas Tech offensive system. His big arm was tempered by problems with his accuracy. He had leadership abilities, but could they translate from college to the NFL?\n\nMahomes has answered all those questions every week.\n\nHe threw six touchdown passes in a game. He led the Chiefs to tough road wins over the Chargers and Steelers, and went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady in New England. He has thrown so few interceptions that any questions about his decision-making have been left in September.\n\nWith two more TD passes against the Cardinals, he broke the franchise single-season record of 30 that Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson set during the 1964 season \u2014 with six games to go.\n\n\u201cPat is just a competitor,\u201d Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt said, \u201cand a great guy and he\u2019s always trying to win. We needed all 31 of those touchdowns and he got them.\u201d\n\nWell, the Chiefs probably didn\u2019t need all of them.\n\nThe Chiefs have scored 353 points through their first 10 games, the most in club history, and have been held to fewer than 30 only twice. Three times they\u2019ve scored more than 40, including their 43-40 loss to the Patriots that remains the only blemish on their record.\n\nTo put into perspective just how good Mahomes has been this season, consider this: He threw for 249 yards against the Cardinals for a passer rating of 125.4, the eighth time this season he\u2019s been over 100.0 \u2014 the third most in a single season in franchise history.\n\nYet some people considered the end of his streak of eight consecutive 300-yard passing games to be a relative disappointment, as if he failed to live up to some otherworldly expectation.\n\nHis teammates certainly weren\u2019t in that camp.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019d do on \u2018Madden,\u2018\u201d wide receiver Tyreek Hill said of Mahomes\u2019 TD record. \u201cFor him to come in and do that, that\u2019s amazing. A lot of people doubted him, saying he wasn\u2019t going to do this or wasn\u2019t going to do that. He\u2019s shutting a lot of people up right now and I\u2019m proud of him. He\u2019s just got to continue to move forward and stay humble. He\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been far better than that this season.\n\nOddsmakers in Las Vegas have made the 23-year-old Mahomes the front-runner to win the league\u2019s MVP award, ahead of Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Rams running back Todd Gurley. And if he keeps going at his current rate, he will no doubt continue to rewrite the Chiefs record book.\n\nMaybe even the page that lists the Chiefs\u2019 rather unimpressive postseason history.\n\n\u201cListen, he\u2019s had a heck of a year,\u201d Reid said. \u201cComes out every day bringing energy and he makes sure that he has his things in order. When he does that, and he\u2019s got a lot on his plate as far as responsibility goes to run that offense, and he takes care of that. He\u2019s in a position where he can make everyone better around him, and he\u2019s doing that.

And I\u2019m a winner. It\u2019s just tough.\u201d\n\nThe Jets (3-7) have lost four straight as they hit the bye week with speculation surrounding the future of coach Todd Bowles, who appears will remain in his job for now. Beyond this season, however, would seem unlikely.\n\nAdams has been vocal in his support of Bowles, repeatedly saying it\u2019s on the players to execute on the field. He said in an interview with Bleacher Report during the offseason that when he arrived to the team as a first-rounder out of LSU, there was a questionable culture surrounding the Jets in which they were used to losing and not everyone put out a full effort.\n\nHe was asked on WFAN\u2019s \u201cCarlin, Maggie & Bart Show\u201d if that culture had changed, and Adams pulled no punches.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I could sit here and sugarcoat everything, but things have not changed,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re still losing. And I\u2019m not saying that we have guys like that in the locker room, but at the same time, it\u2019s not changing. It hasn\u2019t changed and we\u2019ve been losing. At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to get it fixed. Soon, the sun will shine.\u201d\n\nIt would be difficult for Adams to spin anything in a positive light when the team has seven losses, and he again made it clear he fully supports Bowles. But, his remarks certainly won\u2019t help his coach in the eyes of the Jets\u2019 brass.\n\nAdams acknowledged that the Jets prepared during practice last week to face rookie Josh Allen as Buffalo\u2019s starting quarterback \u2014 despite Allen missing the three previous games with an injured elbow \u2014 and there was little film on Barkley, the fourth-stringer who wasn\u2019t named the starter until Saturday.\n\nBarkley, who hadn\u2019t played since the 2016 season finale while with Chicago, threw two touchdown passes to lead the Bills to a rout.\n\nAdams acknowledged that he didn\u2019t have his best performance, but said the Jets lacked energy in the game and he saw \u201cpeople were down\u201d on the sideline. But he wouldn\u2019t say whether he thought the team quit Sunday.\n\n\u201cJust know one thing: As long as I\u2019m on the team, I will not let that happen as best I can, and I damn sure won\u2019t quit,\u201d Adams said.\n\nHe also added that he spoke to teammates at halftime \u2014 \u201cthere were definitely some words said\u201d \u2014 when the Jets were trailing 31-3.\n\n\u201cWe just got whooped, man,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s really as clear as day.\u201d\n\nAdams is generally considered one of the main emotional leaders on the team, despite being in just his second season. He said he was heading home to Louisiana for a few days before the team gets back together for work next Monday.\n\n\u201cA lot of frustration, a lot of emotions,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be around family, man. I\u2019ve got to get down south and just clear my mind. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m not happy with what\u2019s going on. Obviously, no one is in the building. I always say this: I classify myself as a winner no matter what. It\u2019s very tough to go out there and come up short.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get away, man. I\u2019ve got to go home and just be around my loved ones.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal judge set a hearing for Monday to determine whether to temporarily halt the Trump administration\u2019s latest immigration policy change denying asylum to anyone caught crossing the border illegally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued a proclamation late last week.

But besides the Patriots, no other team has essential fantasy starters to replace.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s break forces you to fill in for running back Matt Breida and tight end George Kittle. Cleveland\u2019s only regular fantasy starters are Nick Chubb and Jarvis Landry. Still, you must deftly navigate the waiver wire for potential playoff contributors, especially with trade deadlines about to pass in most leagues.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nJAYLEN SAMUELS, Steelers (Owned in 0.2 percent of leagues): Le\u2019Veon Bell is no longer relevant in Pittsburgh, so now is the time to grab James Conner\u2019s handcuff. When Conner left last week\u2019s game against the Panthers, Samuels scored his first NFL touchdown. This is the time of year to start cutting players from your bench that you will never comfortably start and roster the immediate backups of your best RBs.\n\nTHEO RIDDICK, Lions (19.5): He has started to re-emerge since the Lions traded Golden Tate, working in the slot and replacing the departed WR as a key target to move the chains. Riddick is purely an add in point-per-reception leagues, but a viable one. The upside is not high, but with 13 catches for 96 yards in his last two games, there is an adequate floor for your flex spot.\n\nRASHAAD PENNY, Seahawks (13.1): The rookie delivered his best performance to date in Week 10, rushing for 108 yards on a dozen carries and registering his first NFL scoring run. Penny displayed the explosive abilities that made him a first round pick. But you have to be patient with him, as Chris Carson may return to the mix and Mike Davis is the team\u2019s best receiver at RB. Penny may ride your bench in the near future as part of a committee, but Carson is oft-injured and Penny may eventually ascend because he is the most talented RB of the three.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nANTHONY MILLER, Bears (13.4): Another potentially explosive rookie, Miller is healthy and starting to make his presence felt in the rapidly improving Chicago offense. He came through with his best performance so far in Week 10, catching five passes for 122 yards and a TD. Miller has scored twice in his last three games and three in his last five. He has yet to display a wider range of his big-play skills, and he may soon approach fantasy WR3 status.\n\nDONTE MONCRIEF, Jaguars (15.1); Fantasy owners seem to avoid Jacksonville WRs as a rule, but Moncrief has at least performed respectably enough to make him a quality bye week and injury fill-in. In a dire situation, if you have to start Moncrief, he will provide good enough PPR numbers. He has four double-figure PPR performances in his past six games, and two of those have been 20-point outings.\n\nJOSH REYNOLDS, Rams (1.1): Cooper Kupp is done for the year with a knee injury, so you have to take a cautious flier on Reynolds again, who was mediocre in terms of catches and yardage last time Kupp was out but did deliver a two-TD game in Week 8. Reynolds will be fourth, and maybe even fifth in targets for the Rams now, but you have to take a waiver shot on a player with more possible opportunity in a great offense.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nJONNU SMITH, Titans (0.6): Marcus Mariota has started to raise his game recently, and Smith has been involved enough to make savvy fantasy owners raise an eyebrow. Smith has scored in each of his past two games and has the abilities to start contributing more often on key passing downs.\n\nGERALD EVERETT, Rams (1.4): The Los Angeles tight ends could also benefit from the absence of Kupp. Everett scored in Week 10 and along with Tyler Higbee, could start to get more offensive attention from Jared Goff in the weeks ahead.\n\nNICK VANNETT, Seahawks (9.5): He has scored in two consecutive games, as he is getting more attention from Russell Wilson in red zone situations. He\u2019s not much more than a TE2 in fantasy but can certainly fill in on a bye week.\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nLAMAR JACKSON, Ravens (6.7): Injury issues and mediocre play appear to be putting Joe Flacco on the hot seat. While Robert Griffin III could get a chance to move in first, Jackson should get his chance if the Ravens get booted out of the playoff race soon, and his dual threat abilities will make him an intriguing fantasy option.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 11 fantasy advice, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com", "", "", "", "ALAMEDA, Calif.

Maryland is challenging the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the new U.S. acting attorney general. A draft filing obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press argues that President Donald Trump sidestepped the Constitution and normal procedure by naming Whitaker to the position in place of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 While in private business, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns, delays and other problems, public records show.\n\nThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nAfter being appointed last week by President Donald Trump to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job, Whitaker\u2019s history as a former federal prosecutor, Republican Party loyalist and critic of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has come under scrutiny, as have some of his business dealings.\n\nWhitaker is expected to return to his home state Wednesday to speak at a conference at a downtown Des Moines hotel, about two miles from the Ingersoll Avenue apartment building that he once saw as an investment opportunity. After years of rising costs, Whitaker stopped work on the project by early 2016 and sold the building months later.\n\n\u201cHe did not complete the project due to cost overruns and a bad general contractor,\u201d Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said late Tuesday.\n\nShe didn\u2019t identify the contractor, but a handyman listed in public records as working under Whitaker on the project didn\u2019t return a phone message.\n\nCity officials raced to see the project completed to avoid losing federal money, and contractors filed liens seeking compensation for more than $32,000 in unpaid work.\n\nA company formed by Whitaker and two partners, MEM Investment, was awarded a $166,000 city loan to renovate the vacant three-story complex in 2012, through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program to promote affordable housing. A reorganization in 2014 made Whitaker the company\u2019s sole owner.\n\nAll but $25,000 of the loan would be forgiven as long as the project was completed by 2017 and half of its 22 units were restricted to low-income tenants for five years. But what was once thought to be a $400,000 project for lead testing and site improvements became more expensive as additional work and damage piled up, records show.\n\nWhitaker refinanced his mortgage on the building to get more funding and put an undisclosed amount of his own money into the project.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, city officials said they repeatedly communicated the urgency of finishing the project to Whitaker during meetings, letters and phone calls. But by March 2016, an inspection showed \u201cthere had been minimal, if any, additional rehabilitation work completed since the previous inspection\u201d several months earlier, city planner Mary Neiderbach wrote to Whitaker on April 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cIn addition, more damage had occurred to the building\u2019s interior because of what appears to be a roof leak and missing downspouts on the back of the building,\u201d she wrote, adding that Whitaker\u2019s company \u201cappears to have abandoned the property.\u201d\n\nThe letter informed Whitaker that the city was terminating the loan agreement and gave him 30 days to pay back $151,620 that he had been advanced. It noted that the city had to complete the work by the end of 2016 or repay HUD, and that it did not have confidence Whitaker\u2019s company was up to that task.\n\nWhitaker did not reply to the city\u2019s notice. His lender, Lincoln Savings Bank, soon declared Whitaker\u2019s company in default after he ignored demands to pay back a mortgage that had ballooned to $687,000, records show. The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in July 2016, seeking to be paid back ahead of the city and contractors.\n\nThe contractors included an electrician who filed a lawsuit seeking to collect more than $14,000 in unpaid invoices. A process server said in a court filing that repeated visits to three addresses listed for Whitaker\u2019s company and his law firm turned up nothing other than dark, locked offices. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after both Whitaker and the contractor failed to show up to a scheduled court hearing that had been announced in the newspaper.\n\nAs part of an exit agreement, Whitaker\u2019s company agreed to sell the building to developer Jeff Young, to \u201cprovide a portion of the Lincoln Savings Bank repayment and to settle all contractor liens against the property,\u201d an August 2016 city memo showed. It\u2019s unclear whether the contractors have been repaid in full.\n\nThe memo said Young was expected to complete the project by the looming December 2016 HUD deadline.\n\nKupec said the buyer also assumed Whitaker\u2019s loan, and the city didn\u2019t take any legal action.\n\nAttorney Jeff Courter, who represented Lincoln Savings Bank, said its foreclosure petition had been resolved but declined to comment further.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s company did add value to the building, which it bought for $200,000 in 2012 and sold for $650,000 four years later.", "Search for new ND Chief People Officer after resignation\n\nBISMARCK, N.D.

They also won without their regular caddies.\n\nKuchar used a local caddie at Mayakoba because he entered at the last minute and his regular looper, John Wood, had a previous engagement. Westwood used his girlfriend, Helen Storey, who previously caddied for him in Denmark.\n\nWood is back to work with Kuchar this week at the Australian Open. Billy Foster\u2019s 10-year run with Westwood is done.\n\n\u201cMine and Billy\u2019s working relationship had got to a point where neither of us were gaining anything from it and we weren\u2019t doing each other any good,\u201d Westwood said Tuesday at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. \u201cI sat him down and said, \u2018This is no good, I\u2019m playing better when you\u2019re not there than when you are there, so something\u2019s obviously not working.\u2019 He said to me, \u2018Well, I can\u2019t caddie for you how I want to caddie for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWestwood said he has reached a stage in his career where he doesn\u2019t need as much from his caddie, and he felt Foster wasn\u2019t happy just carrying the bag.\n\n\u201cIt just was one of those things that had to come to an end,\u201d Westwood said. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously had a great time the last 10 years and been very successful, but people change and the way you work and look at things.\u201d\n\nFoster is working with Matt Fitzpatrick in Dubai.

Last year, the three PGA Tour events leading up to The Open offered nine spots to players not already exempt \u2014 at two tournaments, four spots from the top 12 on the leaderboard, and one spot at the John Deere Classic.\n\nNow, three spots to the leading 10 players not already exempt are being offered at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill on March 7-10. Three spots are being awarded at the Canadian Open on June 6-9. Two spots are being awarded at the new Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit on June 27-30. The John Deere Classic still gets one spot a week before the British Open at Royal Portrush.\n\nEurope\u2019s schedule has not changed, only the tournaments. Three spots to the leading 10 players will be awarded in each of three tournaments leading to The Open \u2014 the Andalucia Valderrama Masters, the Irish Open and the Scottish Open.\n\nA total of 46 qualifying spots are offered around the world for the 156-man field, starting this week at the Australian Open.\n\nEVERY SHOT MATTERS\n\nEmiliano Grillo rapped a 3-foot bogey putt on the final hole at Mayakoba that popped around the lip and spun out, leaving him stunned. He made double bogey for a 69 that dropped him from a six-way tie for 10th to alone in 15th place.\n\nThat was worth $35,400. It cost him nine FedEx Cup points. That happens every week.\n\nThis late in the year, it cost the Argentine 0.83 world ranking points. Instead of being at No. 46, Grillo moved up to No. 48. That\u2019s important because the top 50 at the end of the year get into the Masters, and he\u2019ll have to wait to see if that putt ends up costing him a certain invitation.\n\nThen again, Grillo is playing the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan this week and could make it a moot point.\n\nFIELD BOOST\n\nThe Australian Open doesn\u2019t have Jordan Spieth for the first time since 2013, though it attracted a strong group of Americans that include Matt Kuchar, Keegan Bradley and Brandt Snedeker. Kuchar is staying in Australia next week for the World Cup of Golf.\n\nNext year, the Australian Open could get even more star power.\n\nOrganizers announced Tuesday that it will be held Dec. 5-8, one week before the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.\n\nWhen the Presidents Cup last was in Australia in 2011, 13 players from the U.S. and International teams competed in golf\u2019s fifth-oldest championship.

The governing bodies agreed to take over the program that the European Disabled Golfers Association created in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere is an accelerating growth in the number of events around the world for golfers with disabilities to compete in, so it makes absolute sense that there is a global ranking to provide a robust measurement of an individual\u2019s skill and ability,\u201d said Duncan Weir, head of golf development and amateur events for the R&A. \u201cIt is another important step toward ensuring that golf is more inclusive of people of all ages and abilities.\u201d\n\nThe announcement coincided with the Australian All Abilities Championship, in which 12 golfers are playing alongside pros at the Australian Open this week.\n\nTRAVELING MAN\n\nAnother week, another golf course for Padraig Harrington.\n\nAnother country, too.\n\nThe RSM Classic at Sea Island is the ninth tournament in 10 weeks for Harrington, which includes his role as vice captain at the Ryder Cup.

Missouri plays Tennessee on Saturday, Nov. 17, 2018.(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey, File)\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Missouri offensive coordinator Derek Dooley said he\u2019s grateful about the opportunity he had at Tennessee as the former Volunteers head coach prepares for his return to Knoxville.\n\nDooley went 15-21 at Tennessee from 2010-12 before getting fired amid his third straight losing season. After spending five years in the NFL as the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 wide receivers coach, Dooley came back to the college ranks this season as Missouri\u2019s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\n\nHe returns to Neyland Stadium on Saturday when Missouri (6-4, 2-4 SEC) visits Tennessee (5-5, 2-4).\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t of course get the results we wanted when I was there, but that experience there \u2014 32 months \u2014 made me a better coach and made me a better man,\u201d Dooley told reporters after practice Tuesday in Columbia, Missouri. \u201cIn some ways, you\u2019re always grateful for every experience you\u2019ve got, and they gave me a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nDooley noted that much has changed since his Tennessee tenure. The coach who succeeded Dooley isn\u2019t there anymore. Neither is the athletic director who fired him.\n\nButch Jones replaced Dooley as Tennessee\u2019s coach and went 34-27 in five seasons before getting fired last November. Tennessee has since handed the job to Jeremy Pruitt , a former Alabama defensive coordinator.\n\nDave Hart dismissed Dooley but later stepped down as athletic director and was replaced in 2017 by John Currie , who lasted only eight months on the job before former coach Phillip Fulmer took over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been six years and two coaches, a couple of AD\u2019s, a president, so there\u2019s been a lot of change,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cNobody on the roster (remains), but I\u2019ll know some people there.\u201d\n\nTennessee went 6-7 and lost the Music City Bowl in Dooley\u2019s first season but failed to earn a bowl bid either of the next two years.\n\nDooley\u2019s tenure never really recovered after Tennessee ended the 2011 season with a 10-7 loss at Kentucky that ended the Vols\u2019 26-game winning streak in that annual series. Dooley was fired the day after a 41-18 loss at Vanderbilt.\n\n\u201cEvery place you go, you learn and you grow from,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cThere\u2019s not one place I don\u2019t go and look back and go, \u2018Gosh, I could have done a little better here and I could have done a little better there.\u2019 That\u2019s what experience is. I feel like I\u2019m a lot better ... today than I was six years ago, and that\u2019s because of the experience I had in Knoxville.\u201d\n\nPruitt said this week that Dooley has done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d with Missouri\u2019s offense.\n\nAlthough the two coaches have never been on the same staff, both have worked for Alabama coach Nick Saban. Dooley was on Saban\u2019s staffs at LSU (2000-04) and with the Miami Dolphins (2005-06). Pruitt served two stints at Alabama from 2007-12 and 2016-17.\n\n\u201cI know that some of the guys I\u2019ve worked with have a whole lot of respect for (Dooley), what kind of coach that he\u2019s been when they worked with him on the staff,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cI\u2019m watching what they\u2019re doing offensively and they\u2019re doing a really good job.\u201d\n\nNo matter how much Dooley has tried to downplay his return to Tennessee, Missouri\u2019s players suspect this game is particularly important to him.\n\n\u201cI think if you\u2019re a really good coach, you don\u2019t necessarily show whether or not one game means more to you than other ones,\u201d Missouri quarterback Drew Lock said. \u201cIt probably means a little bit to him, but he\u2019s not going to show that to us. He\u2019ll probably express how he felt during the week after the game is over.\u201d\n\nThis will mark the second time this season that Tennessee has faced off with one of its former coaches. Jones is now an offensive analyst at Alabama, which trounced Tennessee 58-21 at Neyland Stadium last month.\n\nSome Tennessee fans got angry after that game when photos circulating on social media showed Jones smoking a cigar , a postgame tradition for the winner of the annual Alabama-Tennessee game. Alabama players also doused Jones with a bucket of water on the field to celebrate the Crimson Tide\u2019s victory.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee", "FILE - In this Aug. 17, 2018, file photo, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro speaks to reporters during a visit to the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa.

Georgia Tech won 27-21. (AP Photo/John Amis)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech was headed for a dismal season.\n\nSuddenly, it looks a lot more promising.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have ripped off three straight victories, locked up a bowl trip and could clinch a winning season with a victory Saturday over Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I always tell the team, \u2018It\u2019s never as good or as bad as it seems,\u2019\u201d coach Paul Johnson said Tuesday. \u201cVery few teams in America are going to show up every week and blow people out. There\u2019s too much parity in college football these days. If you play clean and make plays, you\u2019ve got a chance to be successful. If you don\u2019t, that other thing happens.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Tech (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) started the season 1-3, which included blowing a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter at South Florida and a rout at the hands of No. 2 Clemson . When the Yellow Jackets lost at home to lowly Duke , a third losing season in four years seemed likely and many wondered if Johnson\u2019s long tenure on the Flats was winding down.\n\nBut they bounced back with a dominating 49-28 win at Virginia Tech \u2014 without completing a pass, no less \u2014 before pulling out nail-biting wins over North Carolina and Miami the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cThis league is so balanced,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOther than Clemson, everybody is pretty similar. If you don\u2019t play well, you can lose. That\u2019s kind of the way it is for everybody.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh, which handed Georgia Tech its other loss early in the season , is on the cusp of wrapping up the ACC Coastal Division title, so that goal is pretty much out of reach.\n\nBut a victory over Virginia would give the Yellow Jackets a winning mark in the conference for the first time since 2014. Plus, it would improve their position within the ACC bowl hierarchy.\n\nThe seniors, who helped to hold the team together when things looked bleak, are eager to keep the turnaround going.\n\n\u201cWe got to six. Cool. We get to go to a bowl game,\u201d receiver Brad Stewart said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019re still hungry. We want more.\u201d\n\nAlways a run-dominated team out of the triple-option, the Yellow Jackets have essentially shut down any pretense of a passing game over these last three games, attempting only seven passes and completing five for 177 yards.\n\nMeanwhile, they\u2019ve averaged nearly 386 yards on the ground during that span, a big reason they\u2019ve dominated time of possession with an average of 37:45 per game.\n\n\u201cIf the other team doesn\u2019t have the ball,\u201d Johnson said with a smile, \u201cit\u2019s hard to score.\u201d\n\nVirginia will certainly need to do a better job against the triple-option than it did in last season\u2019s Military Bowl, when Navy ran all over the Cavaliers in a 49-7 rout . The Midshipmen failed to complete their only pass attempt but rushed for 452 yards, a game plan that Georgia Tech would certainly like to duplicate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unique. You don\u2019t see it week in and week out,\u201d Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack said. \u201cIt\u2019s one week, and you\u2019ve got to abandon everything you know essentially and just focus in on the offense.\u201d\n\nThe Cavaliers did a better job when they faced Georgia Tech last season in Charlottesville. They limited the Jackets to 220 yards rushing, picked off a pair of passes and pulled out a 40-36 victory on a 27-yard touchdown pass with 1:22 remaining .\n\nWith that win, Virginia locked up its first bowl appearance in six years.\n\n\u201cThat was very satisfying,\u201d defensive lineman Eli Hanback said. \u201cIt was a hard-fought game, it was a rainy game, it was tough.

They now form the core of the Bulls (9-1, 6-0 Mid-American Conference), who are off to the best start in program history and already matched the school record for wins, which was set in 1986 when Buffalo played at the Division III level.\n\n\u201cI think it was very apparent, even last September, that we were taking strides in the right direction,\u201d Leipold said. \u201cNow strides to us doesn\u2019t always equate into how many wins last season or this season. But we knew we were getting closer.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls have gone beyond what few could have envisioned in transforming themselves from long-time pushovers \u2014 this is their third winning season since joining the MAC in 1999 \u2014 to a formidable powerhouse while getting votes in the national polls.\n\nWith two games left, starting with a trip to Ohio (6-4, 4-2 MAC) on Wednesday night, Buffalo needs one win to clinch the East Division title and only its second berth in the conference championship game.\n\nAnd the Bulls have all but assured themselves of what would be the program\u2019s fourth bowl berth, including in 1958, when Buffalo players elected not to take part in the Tangerine Bowl because the team\u2019s two black players were not allowed to participate.\n\nJackson hasn\u2019t forgotten how low things became in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s something that actually kind of motivates you still,\u201d said the junior quarterback, whose 24 touchdowns passing are five shy of Buffalo\u2019s single-season record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always keep that with me, and keep that chip on my shoulder,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI never want to feel that way again.\u201d\n\nAnother motivating factor is how last season ended. Buffalo won its final three games to finish 6-6 before getting snubbed in the bowl-selection process.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we definitely talk about: Leave no doubt,\u201d center James O\u2019Hagan said in September. \u201cGetting six wins isn\u2019t enough, and we can\u2019t leave it up to other people to decide our fate.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve left nothing to chance this year.\n\nJackson oversees a dynamic dual-threat offense averaging a little over 36 points and 427 yards per game.\n\nOne week, the Bulls are winning with their passing attack. Johnson scored three times and set a school record with 238 yards receiving in a 51-42 win over Miami (Ohio) on Oct. 30.\n\nThe following week, it\u2019s their ground game. Freshman Jaret Patterson had 187 yards rushing and two touchdowns in a 48-14 win over Kent State on Nov. 6.\n\nAnd Buffalo\u2019s stingy defense is allowing a MAC-low 328 yards per outing.\n\nThe Bulls have won 12 of their past 13, dating to last season, with the lone blemish a 42-13 home loss to Army on Sept. 29.\n\nWith a 22-24 record, Leipold already ranks fourth among Buffalo coaches in career victories.\n\nBefore being hired by Buffalo, Leipold went 109-6 over eight seasons at Division III Wisconsin-Whitewater.\n\nWhen asked to put this season\u2019s success into perspective, Leipold reflected back to his first full-time coaching job as an assistant at Division II Nebraska-Omaha. The Mavericks, whose program has since been discontinued, went 1-10 in his first season, 1994, before winning the North Central Conference championship with a 10-2 record two years later.\n\n\u201cA lot of hard work, a lot of heartache,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat was my most rewarding time in coaching. I always felt we took something that wasn\u2019t very good and we made it into a consistent winner.\u201d\n\nLeipold is doing it again in Buffalo.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this April 24, 2014, file photo, then-Iowa Republican senatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney Matt Whitaker watches before a live televised debate in Johnston, Iowa. Maryland is challenging the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the new U.S. acting attorney general. A draft filing obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press argues that President Donald Trump sidestepped the Constitution and normal procedure by naming Whitaker to the position in place of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 While in private business, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker walked away from a taxpayer-subsidized apartment-rehabilitation project in Iowa after years of cost overruns, delays and other problems, public records show.\n\nThe city of Des Moines ultimately yanked an affordable housing loan that Whitaker\u2019s company had been awarded, and another lender began foreclosure proceedings after Whitaker defaulted on a separate loan for nearly $700,000. Several contractors complained they were not paid, and a process server for one could not even find Whitaker or his company to serve him with a lawsuit.\n\nAfter being appointed last week by President Donald Trump to the nation\u2019s top law enforcement job, Whitaker\u2019s history as a former federal prosecutor, Republican Party loyalist and critic of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has come under scrutiny, as have some of his business dealings.\n\nWhitaker is expected to return to his home state Wednesday to speak at a conference at a downtown Des Moines hotel, about two miles from the Ingersoll Avenue apartment building that he once saw as an investment opportunity. After years of rising costs, Whitaker stopped work on the project by early 2016 and sold the building months later.\n\n\u201cHe did not complete the project due to cost overruns and a bad general contractor,\u201d Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said late Tuesday.\n\nShe didn\u2019t identify the contractor, but a handyman listed in public records as working under Whitaker on the project didn\u2019t return a phone message.\n\nCity officials raced to see the project completed to avoid losing federal money, and contractors filed liens seeking compensation for more than $32,000 in unpaid work.\n\nA company formed by Whitaker and two partners, MEM Investment, was awarded a $166,000 city loan to renovate the vacant three-story complex in 2012, through a Department of Housing and Urban Development grant program to promote affordable housing. A reorganization in 2014 made Whitaker the company\u2019s sole owner.\n\nAll but $25,000 of the loan would be forgiven as long as the project was completed by 2017 and half of its 22 units were restricted to low-income tenants for five years. But what was once thought to be a $400,000 project for lead testing and site improvements became more expensive as additional work and damage piled up, records show.\n\nWhitaker refinanced his mortgage on the building to get more funding and put an undisclosed amount of his own money into the project.\n\nBeginning in February 2015, city officials said they repeatedly communicated the urgency of finishing the project to Whitaker during meetings, letters and phone calls. But by March 2016, an inspection showed \u201cthere had been minimal, if any, additional rehabilitation work completed since the previous inspection\u201d several months earlier, city planner Mary Neiderbach wrote to Whitaker on April 1, 2016.\n\n\u201cIn addition, more damage had occurred to the building\u2019s interior because of what appears to be a roof leak and missing downspouts on the back of the building,\u201d she wrote, adding that Whitaker\u2019s company \u201cappears to have abandoned the property.\u201d\n\nThe letter informed Whitaker that the city was terminating the loan agreement and gave him 30 days to pay back $151,620 that he had been advanced. It noted that the city had to complete the work by the end of 2016 or repay HUD, and that it did not have confidence Whitaker\u2019s company was up to that task.\n\nWhitaker did not reply to the city\u2019s notice. His lender, Lincoln Savings Bank, soon declared Whitaker\u2019s company in default after he ignored demands to pay back a mortgage that had ballooned to $687,000, records show. The bank initiated foreclosure proceedings on the property in July 2016, seeking to be paid back ahead of the city and contractors.\n\nThe contractors included an electrician who filed a lawsuit seeking to collect more than $14,000 in unpaid invoices. A process server said in a court filing that repeated visits to three addresses listed for Whitaker\u2019s company and his law firm turned up nothing other than dark, locked offices. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed after both Whitaker and the contractor failed to show up to a scheduled court hearing that had been announced in the newspaper.\n\nAs part of an exit agreement, Whitaker\u2019s company agreed to sell the building to developer Jeff Young, to \u201cprovide a portion of the Lincoln Savings Bank repayment and to settle all contractor liens against the property,\u201d an August 2016 city memo showed. It\u2019s unclear whether the contractors have been repaid in full.\n\nThe memo said Young was expected to complete the project by the looming December 2016 HUD deadline.\n\nKupec said the buyer also assumed Whitaker\u2019s loan, and the city didn\u2019t take any legal action.\n\nAttorney Jeff Courter, who represented Lincoln Savings Bank, said its foreclosure petition had been resolved but declined to comment further.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s company did add value to the building, which it bought for $200,000 in 2012 and sold for $650,000 four years later.", "COSTA MESA, Calif.

Both devices were removed and destroyed by military experts, and a sweep of the area did not turn up any additional explosives.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how the explosives got there or how long they had been there.\n\nIdaho Department of Transportation spokesman Jake Melder said the unexploded military ordnance was found underwater on the river floor near two of the piers supporting the bridge. A video of one of the devices posted by the Idaho Transportation Department online shows what appears to be a corroded artillery shell about 28 inches (72 centimeters) long that has some plant life growing either on or around it.\n\nITD worked with a bomb squad from the Nampa Police Department, the Mountain Home Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy and local law enforcement to safely remove the ordinances and determine next steps.\n\nMelder said it was the first time that an explosive device has been found near an Idaho bridge, and the department believes the likelihood of it happening again is small. He referred questions about the nature of the device to the Mountain Home Air Force base; officials there did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Idaho Transportation Department routinely inspects bridges, but those inspections don\u2019t typically include an underwater inspection team. In this case, Melder said, the team was called in because the department was preparing to make repairs to the bridge supports as well as to the deck of the structure.\n\nThe divers found the first explosive on Oct. 31 and the next one the following day.\n\n\u201cThe ordnances themselves were both located about 20 feet (6 meters) underwater,\u201d Melder said. \u201cWhat the assessment showed where they were placed didn\u2019t show an immediate safety risk to the public. We didn\u2019t need to have cause for an alarm.\u201d\n\nAn Explosive Ordnance Device Dive Team was brought in from the Navy. The divers removed the explosives on Nov. 9, and the bridge was closed for about 20 minutes during that process, Melder said.\n\nThe bridge is on Highway 45 just south of Nampa. About 1,700 vehicles travel across it every day, according to the Idaho Transportation Department.\n\nThe last underwater inspection of the bridge was done in August 2016.

Northwestern won 14-10. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nIowa junior tight end Noah Fant is one of the most talented players that Kirk Ferentz has ever coached in his 20 years.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t Iowa (6-4, 3-4 Big Ten) getting Fant the ball more?\n\nIt is a perplexing question in an increasingly disappointing season in Iowa City. The issue came to a head last week in a 14-10 loss to Northwestern, Iowa\u2019s third straight defeat after a 6-1 start.\n\nFant, the team leader with six touchdown catches, had just one catch for zero yards as the Hawkeyes let its final chance to remain alive in the Big Ten West race slip away. It was the fourth straight game without a TD grab by Fant.\n\nThe Hawkeyes head to Illinois (4-6, 2-5) on Saturday looking to resurrect its season and Fant\u2019s role in their offense, especially considering he might leave for the NFL.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to keep him involved and get him involved. But he\u2019s a good football player. We\u2019re going to be a better team if we can get him the ball,\u201d Ferentz said of Fant.\n\nFerentz said Tuesday that the Hawkeyes have focused more on emerging sophomore T.J. Hockenson in recent weeks because of Hockenson\u2019s versatility, adding that they see Fant as more of a \u201cspecialist.\u201d\n\nHockenson has been excellent, with 39 catches for 615 yards and five total TDs. But Fant\u2019s 18 career touchdown receptions are the best in school history for a tight end and the third-most in that category in Big Ten history.\n\nFant is also considered a possible early-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft, should he choose to leave school early. Iowa rarely has such talent at a skill position, which only makes it more confusing as to why the Hawkeyes haven\u2019t found more creative ways to throw the ball Fant\u2019s way. Ferentz dismissed the notion that something is going on with Fant away from the field.\n\n\u201cI can assure you, that\u2019s not an issue. Noah is a high-character guy,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous with us. He\u2019s a great kid. So there\u2019s no issues there at all, and that\u2019s hardly the deal. Beyond that, again, he\u2019s a good player.\u201d\n\nIowa is a 16-point favorite against an Illinois team allowing nearly 40 points a game. But the Black Friday finale against Nebraska could end up being a referendum on the Hawkeyes\u2019 season.\n\n\u201cIt really goes down to two things for a football team or anybody when you face disappointment. You\u2019re either going to pull together or you\u2019re going to divide or you\u2019re going to fight and compete or you\u2019re going to surrender,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cThe choice is to push forward and maximize the opportunities moving forward, and I\u2019m confident and comfortable our team will do that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "Virginia Tech President Tim Sands speaks at the school's announcement of a 1 million square-foot technology focused campus in Alexandria, Va., to build one of it's two new headquarters, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. The project was cited as a key reason Amazon selected Virginia for a new headquarters. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) \u2014 As he assessed his state\u2019s winning effort to lure 25,000 Amazon jobs to northern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam said the key may not have been the hundreds of millions of dollars that were promised if the company delivered on its job-creation promises \u2014 indeed, many states offered much richer incentive packages.\n\nInstead, he said what made Virginia\u2019s bid distinct was \u201cinvestments in our people,\u201d particularly a $1 billion Virginia Tech University graduate campus to be built near the new Amazon headquarters that will churn out hundreds of qualified high-tech workers annually.\n\n\u201cVirginia\u2019s proposal to Amazon represents a new model of economic development for the 21st century,\u201d Northam said in a celebratory press event Tuesday in an old warehouse that will be knocked down to create Amazon office space. \u201cThe vast majority of the commonwealth\u2019s proposal is investments in our people that will align with Amazon\u2019s long-term goals.\u201d\n\nThe linchpin of that investment is the \u201cInnovation Campus\u201d planned for the Potomac Yard neighborhood of Alexandria, just a couple miles south of where Amazon will be.\n\nThe campus will be part of Virginia Tech, and the first 100 master\u2019s degree students will enroll next year in temporary space. When it\u2019s finished, the campus will enroll 750 master\u2019s degree candidates, train hundreds of doctoral students and will include on-campus housing, officials said.\n\nStephanie Landrum, director of economic development in Alexandria, suggested that when Virginians look back on Tuesday\u2019s announcement, the establishment of the Virginia Tech campus may be even more monumental than Amazon\u2019s arrival. She said the campus will not only feed Amazon but other tech companies that have been drawn to the region, and are diversifying the region\u2019s economy from its large reliance on the federal government and defense spending.\n\nRep. Don Beyer, a Democrat who represents the area, said he expects the campus to eventually rival Ivy League schools and MIT in prestige for developing high-quality tech workers.\n\n\u201cThe reason Amazon is coming is that they see already the talent that is here in northern Virginia,\u201d Beyer said.\n\nVirginia Tech said the plans for the Innovation Campus mesh perfectly with the university\u2019s longstanding plans to increase its footprint in northern Virginia and meet demand for computer science and other high-tech degrees. Amazon\u2019s other new headquarters will be built in a New York City neighborhood that is near a new technology-oriented graduate school called Cornell Tech.\n\n\u201cWe need to be where our partners are,\u201d said Virginia Tech President Tim Sands. \u201cHere we have the opportunity to be within 2 miles of Amazon.\u201d\n\nThe plan calls for the state and Virginia Tech to each commit $250 million to the campus.

But you have to win games.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, athletic director Rick George issued a statement about speculation over MacIntyre\u2019s tenure with the team.\n\n\u201cWe do not comment on speculation or unsubstantiated rumors with anonymous sources,\u201d George said. \u201cLet me just say I have made no decisions regarding the future of our football program.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre said he met with George two weeks ago and was given a vote of confidence.\n\n\u201cHe gave me 100 percent support,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him multiple times since then, never said a word to me about anything to this effect.

But the league consulted with the players\u2019 association and local officials before deciding it couldn\u2019t risk the players\u2019 health on a damaged field.\n\n\u201cThe combination of a difficult rainy season and a heavy multi-event calendar of events at the stadium have resulted in significant damage to the field that presents unnecessary risks to player safety and makes it unsuitable to host an NFL game,\u201d said Mark Waller, the NFL\u2019s executive vice president of international. \u201cAs a result, we have determined that moving the game is the right decision, and one that we needed to announce now in order to allow our teams and fans to make alternate arrangements.\u201d\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn\u2019t been ideal for several months. Concern about the field grew in recent days when aerial photos of the stadium showed serious damage to the grass, particularly on the end of the stadium recently used for a major concert.\n\nCruz Azul, the Liga MX soccer club that shares the stadium with Club America, played a tournament game on the field last Saturday in noticeably poor conditions. Coach Pedro Caixinha expressed concern, and the NFL continued working with groundskeepers to improve the field.\n\n\u201cThe long and unusual rain season, as well as the calendar of events with third parties in Estadio Azteca, might be a factor for the grass to be far from optimal conditions,\u201d Azteca Stadium authorities said in a press release.\n\nThe Rams are required to keep the Coliseum available as a backup in case of a problem with international games. They immediately announced plans for ticket sales starting Wednesday, with season ticket holders allowed to buy their own seats and up to four more.\n\nThe Rams also will give away thousands of seats to first responders and people affected by recent tragedies in Southern California. Deadly wildfires have ravaged several areas near the Rams\u2019 training complex in Thousand Oaks for the past week, and 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks last Wednesday night.\n\nThe move also creates big logistical obstacles for \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d broadcaster ESPN, which will have to shift its operations back to the West Coast.\n\n\u201cWe have been in communication with the NFL and we understand the league\u2019s decision,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cWe are already in the process of adjusting our plans and will be ready to present this much-anticipated matchup on Monday Night Football from Los Angeles. We also remain committed to identifying future opportunities with the league to engage its already strong fan base in Mexico.\u201d\n\nAzteca hosted the first regular-season game ever held outside the U.S. in 2005 when Arizona beat San Francisco. The stadium has hosted several NFL exhibitions, and the Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and New England Patriots all played regular-season games there over the past two years.\n\nThe Rams played in England in each of the previous two seasons, and they are expected to have another international game next season, as required of teams playing in a temporary home stadium.\n\nBoth the Rams and the Chiefs were due to play in Mexico for the first time next week. Kansas City has played just one regular-season game outside the U.S., going to London in 2015.\n\nThe Rams are in the third of four seasons at the Coliseum before their new multi-billion-dollar stadium complex in Inglewood opens in 2020. The venerable Coliseum hasn\u2019t hosted a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game since October 1985, and the Rams haven\u2019t hosted a game there on a Monday night since 1979, before they moved to Anaheim and then St. Louis.\n\nThe Rams traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Monday to spend their week of practice in high altitudes to prepare for Mexico City\u2019s conditions \u2014 and they plan to stay put anyway.\n\nSeveral players and coaches are still displaced from their homes near their training complex in Thousand Oaks by evacuations due to fire danger, and the Rams already transported the families and friends of many players and employees to Colorado Springs. The Rams currently plan to fly home on the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "TOPEKA, Kan.

(AP) \u2014 Two students told investigators they reported the Florida high school shooting suspect to an administrator for making threats but felt they were not taken seriously, a commission investigating the massacre was told Tuesday.\n\nPinellas County sheriff\u2019s Detective Chris Lyons told the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission that 30 people knew suspect Nikolas Cruz made threats and racist remarks, committed animal cruelty and engaged in odd behavior in the years before the February shooting that left 17 dead, but few reported it to police or school authorities.\n\nEven when they reported the former Stoneman Douglas student, nothing happened, Lyons said.\n\n\u2033\u2018See something, say something\u2019 means something, and it has to be more than a phrase,\u201d said Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the commission\u2019s chairman. \u201cIt has to resonate with the public because law enforcement cannot be everywhere all the time.\u201d\n\nThe commission is using his detectives and other investigators from outside Broward County to conduct its investigation to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nIn one case where a report was allegedly made, Lyons said two male students he did not name told investigators they reported Cruz to a Stoneman Douglas administrator in December 2016 after one of them said Cruz threatened to shoot up the school. They disagreed on whether they spoke to Principal Ty Thompson or Assistant Principal Jeff Morford, but agreed that the administrator dismissed their concerns and blamed Cruz\u2019s behavior on his autism. They said the administrator told them Cruz would be out of the school soon. Cruz was removed from the school three months later.\n\nA mother of one of the teens said she spoke to Thompson the next day, upset with her son\u2019s treatment. She told investigators Thompson said that if she didn\u2019t like how the school was run, she should remove her son.\n\nThompson and Morford both told investigators the meetings never happened, but Gualtieri said other than the disagreement on which administrator they contacted, the boys\u2019 and mother\u2019s stories corroborated each other.\n\nThe Broward school district declined to make Thompson and Morford available for an interview.\n\nLyons also testified that:\n\n\u2014 Several students told investigators Cruz brought knives, bullets, dead frogs and other small animals he had killed to school. One girl reportedly received a decapitated bird\u2019s head from him. Others said he made racist remarks about African-Americans and Jews and said he wanted to kill them. Few reported him.\n\n\u2014 Cruz destroyed other students\u2019 class projects, telling a teacher he didn\u2019t want them to get a better grade than him.\n\n\u2014 A gun store employee who sold a firearm to Cruz after he turned 18 in the presence of his mother, Lynda Cruz, received a call from her the next day. She asked him not to release the gun to him after the three-day waiting period if she wasn\u2019t there. When he pressed her on why, she hesitated then said he was young and she wanted him to be safe.\n\n\u2014 A bank employee who had weekly phone conversations with Lynda Cruz said she often heard Nikolas in the background yelling at his mother. She said he threatened to kill his mother and burn down their house if she didn\u2019t kill herself. Lynda Cruz told the banker that Nikolas was \u201cevil\u201d and that if anything happened to her, tell the police it was her son. The banker never contacted police before Lynda Cruz died in November 2017 of pneumonia.\n\nThe commission is composed of law enforcement, education and child welfare officials from across the state along with the fathers of two students who were killed. They will file a report to Gov. Rick Scott on their findings and recommendations by Jan. 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime died in the shooting, filed suit Tuesday against the FBI for not acting on a call it received in January about Cruz threatening to shoot up the school. The FBI has admitted it botched the call.\n\nCruz, now 20, has pleaded not guilty. His attorneys have said he will plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence.

Dufner says winning on the PGA Tour is so hard that anyone winning 2 percent of their events in a long career can be considered for the Hall of Fame. (AP Photo/Jon Super, File)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Jason Dufner scanned down both sides of the crowded practice range Tuesday at Sea Island as he tried to find a spot to practice.\n\nSo many players, even if he doesn\u2019t know all their names.\n\nAnd so few trophies.\n\nIt was another reminder to Dufner that golf has a failure rate unlike most other sports.\n\nThe PGA Tour had 648 players tee it up in at least one tournament last year, and only 37 players went home with a trophy. Consider the winners-only start to the calendar year at Kapalua. From the 34-man field in January, 25 players have not made it back.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take an economics degree from Auburn to figure out that winning isn\u2019t easy.\n\nDufner, who has such a degree, came up with his own version of success on the PGA Tour that at first glance seems outrageous.\n\n\u201cYou win 2 percent of your tournaments, you probably have a Hall of Fame career,\u201d Dufner said. \u201cYou throw in a major and win 2 percent of your tournaments, and you\u2019re certainly in the Hall of Fame.\u201d\n\nMaybe he had Fred Couples or Mark O\u2019Meara in mind.\n\nCouples won 2.4 percent of his career starts on the PGA Tour, along with the 1992 Masters. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame five years ago. O\u2019Meara won 2.4 percent of his PGA Tour events, plus two majors in 1998. He was inducted two years later. Another example is Davis Love III, who has won 2.6 percent of his tournaments with one major and was inducted last year.\n\nHall of Fame standards are hard to determine now because a 16-person panel of mostly golf administrators talk among themselves before voting who should get in. But the standard isn\u2019t what it once was, nor should it be with a talent pool that is getting deeper with every year.\n\nIt\u2019s getting harder to win.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop nine players from winning at least twice last season on the PGA Tour \u2014 Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas and Bryson DeChambeau each won three times \u2014 but in Dufner\u2019s eyes, those are either exceptional players or exceptional years, sometimes both.\n\nDufner won twice in one season in 2012, the year before he won the PGA Championship. He now has five victories in 314 starts. That equates to winning 1.6 percent of his PGA Tour starts with one major. So the Hall of Fame is not in the picture.\n\n\u201cI better get going,\u201d Dufner said with a laugh.\n\nOne measure of difficulty is who didn\u2019t win this year, a list that includes Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama and Henrik Stenson, who all started the year among the top 10 players in the world.\n\nAnother measure is who ended long droughts.\n\nThe most famous is Tiger Woods, an exception in many cases. His victory at the Tour Championship was his first since 2013, and it followed four surgeries on his back. Phil Mickelson in Mexico City won for the first time since 2013. Matt Kuchar won last week at Mayakoba, his first on the PGA Tour since 2014. Keegan Bradley, whose two victories as a rookie included the PGA Championship, won the BMW Championship for his first PGA Tour title since 2012.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson crushed the field at The Players Championship for his first victory since 2013.\n\nThe key ingredient in Dufner\u2019s model, of course, is playing long enough so that winning 2 percent of tournaments actually means something. And those who last that long usually build up scar tissue from all the times they failed to win.\n\nLosing happens a lot.\n\nJustin Rose and Johnson are among those who have made winning a habit. Johnson has won every calendar year since 2008 on the PGA Tour except for 2014. Rose has won every year since 2010 except for 2016, though he won Olympic gold in Rio de Janiero that summer.\n\n\u201cWinning every year is extremely tough to do,\u201d Dufner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fine line out here.\u201d\n\nHow fine?\n\nDufner has a model for that, too.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a 95 percent-plus success rate to win,\u201d he said.\n\nHe defines success on a hole-by-hole basis in a negative sense. It\u2019s more about what a player doesn\u2019t do wrong as opposed to what he did right. Last week in Mayakoba, he said he had five penalty drops and three-putted three times. That\u2019s not success. Dufner shot 13-under 271 and finished nine shots behind Kuchar.\n\n\u201cI probably had 15 or 20 shots that were not successful,\u201d he said, estimating his success rate at 90 percent.\n\nFor the 309th time in 314 starts on the PGA Tour, he failed to win.\n\nThen again, Dufner went over $26 million in career earnings.

The hospital in central Oregon has removed the gender designation from patient identification bracelets, a small change that represents a huge difference for its transgender patients. (Andy Tullis/The Bulletin via AP, File)\n\nBEND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 A hospital in central Oregon has made a small change that represented a huge difference for its transgender patients: It removed the gender designation from patient identification bracelets.\n\nThe Bulletin newspaper in Bend reports the St. Charles Health System adopted the change last month. The ID bracelet is designed to provide caregivers an easy way to identify patients based on two distinct identifiers.\n\n\u201cIt was something that everybody felt had to be on there because it was always on there,\u201d said Rebecca Scrafford, a psychologist at St. Charles who was involved in recommending the change. \u201cIt\u2019s providing no benefit, but it\u2019s causing harm.\u201d\n\nThe ID bracelet is designed to provide caregivers an easy way to identify patients based on two distinct identifiers. But staff generally check the patient\u2019s name and date of birth, not gender.\n\nUntil recently, the hospital\u2019s record system did not distinguish between sex assigned at birth, legal gender and gender identity. The ID bracelet had been showing the patient\u2019s legal name and sex assigned at birth.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of those patients, that didn\u2019t match, and that was distressing for our patients,\u201d Scrafford said. \u201cThis is one little baby step in providing affirming care that is probably the first visible sign of many efforts that are underway at St. Charles and communitywide.\u201d\n\nLast year the hospital held a transgender health care training event for providers, and this year convened an internal sexual orientation and gender identity work group to guide initiatives around welcoming transgender patients. Meanwhile, the new Central Oregon Transgender Healthcare Coalition held its first meeting last month, establishing a goal of expanding capacity for transgender health in the community.\n\nThe hospital has now trained its staff about when and how to ask about gender identity, and how to record that information in the patient\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cYou can have the nicest provider in the world, but if the person at the front desk says the wrong name and gender, it\u2019s not going to be the greatest experience,\u201d Scrafford said.\n\nSurveys show many transgender people have had negative experiences interacting with the health care system and nearly half say they avoid medical care because of it.\n\n\u201cPatients will access care first and foremost if they feel safe accessing care,\u201d said Dr. Christina Milano, a professor of family medicine at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, and an expert in transgender health issues. \u201cUnfortunately, transgender and gender diverse individuals have a long history experiencing things like discrimination or inappropriate questions and comments regarding their gender when accessing health care.\u201d\n\nLimitations in electronic health records, she says, often mean printed labels or ID bracelets don\u2019t align with a patient\u2019s gender identity.\n\n\u201cA wristband that a patient is wearing in a hospital during a critical time, a scary hospital admission, that\u2019s something that they\u2019re staring at 24/7 during their waking hours,\u201d Milano said. \u201cSo having that being gender affirming by either having the correct gender or having no gender marker \u2014 so avoiding the risk of the wrong gender marker \u2014 is a big positive.\u201d\n\nBut the limitations of the record system often mean transgender patients must sacrifice their privacy to get things corrected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to publicly out myself many times,\u201d said Rob Landis, a transgender man from Prineville and a board member of the Human Dignity Coalition. \u201cIf I was any other transgender person, I could have gotten very offended and hurt by that.\u201d\n\nLandis recounted a visit to one clinic where the woman checking him in for his appointment burst out laughing when she pulled up his records.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so weird. There\u2019s an F here on the screen where there should be an M,\u201d he recalls her saying. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not really funny because I\u2019m transgender.\u201d\n\nAnother time he had to explain why he was coming for an appointment with a gynecologist.\n\n\u201cI had to out myself again, to say I had some female parts that needed to be removed,\u201d he said.\n\nStill Landis says he has seen tremendous change in Central Oregon. When he started his transition six year ago, he had to research which providers locally were familiar with transgender health issues and if offices would treat him with respect.\n\n\u201cI thought Central Oregon was like its own little island that has been kept from the real world,\u201d Landis said. \u201cBut doing some research, there are a lot of providers out there locally. I don\u2019t have to go to Portland.\u201d\n\nThe Human Dignity Coalition has served as a clearinghouse for transgender individuals seeking health providers, sharing word-of-mouth reviews of which doctors were knowledgeable and accommodating. It also holds training sessions for providers and staff on transgender issues.\n\nCoalition president Jamie Bowman has two transgender daughters and tries to pre-empt problems by informing the front desk when she checks in that her child\u2019s legal name isn\u2019t the name she now uses.\n\n\u201cI just hope that the waiting room full of parents and other children didn\u2019t hear, and then hope and cross my fingers that when the nurse comes to the door to call my child, she would call the right name,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cAnd just last week, they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, her daughter received an ID bracelet with the wrong gender at the emergency room at St. Charles Redmond.\n\n\u201cI just looked at it and sighed. And then the admit person came back with a different bracelet, took the M off, and put an F on instead,\u201d she said. \u201cEven that little bitty thing, it just made all the difference to my child.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 1.4 million transgender people in the United States, representing about 0.6 percent of the population, although those numbers may represent an undercount.\n\n___\n\nInformation from The Bulletin https://www.bendbulletin.com/", "", "", "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Francois Mori, Pool)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump is partly right but far from completely correct when he says that France\u2019s \u201cbig tariffs\u201d make it hard for American vintners to sell their wines to the French.\n\nWrong because customs duties on imported wines are applied not by France but by the European Union. Right because American tariffs are \u201cglobally\u201d less than what Europe charges, the French customs authority says.\n\nPrices aside, wine made in the U.S. is apparently appreciated in the European Union \u2014 the world\u2019s premier importer \u2014 and in France, where the value of wine imported has risen 200 percent between 2008 and 2017, according to the French Federation of Wines and Spirits Exporters.\n\nTrump went after France on several fronts in tweets Tuesday, including blasting tariffs on its emblematic wine.\n\n\u201cOn Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S.,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThe problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\u201d\n\nFrench tariffs as such don\u2019t exist. Tariffs are set by the European Union \u201cin the same conditions\u201d as wines imported from most countries and are applied by all EU countries, the French exporter group said in an email.\n\n\u201cThis tariff has not evolved in 20 years,\u201d it said.\n\nThe alcohol level helps determine tariffs on non-EU wine imported into European countries, with a higher duty as the alcoholic volume rises, Lionel Briand, communications chief for the French Customs office, said in an email. Alcoholic content is also factored into U.S. tariffs, along with the size of the wine\u2019s container.\n\n\u201cAmerican products are not submitted to a distinct duty but to the same duties as all third countries,\u201d those outside the EU, Briand added.\n\nAs an example, a bottle of white American wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the European Union carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents (a bit over 11 U.S. cents). A bottle of white of white wine from the EU exported to the United States has a customs duty of 5 U.S. cents.\n\nThe gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14.5 percent.\n\nBulk wines are another story \u2014 the U.S. tariff is double the EU one, a break for American producers since bulk wine represents 25 percent of the volume of U.S. wine coming into the EU, according to the French exporter federation.\n\nStill, \u201cthe level of customs duties applied by the United States to (imported) wine is globally weaker than EU duties for the same products,\u201d Briand of the Customs office said.\n\nAnd Americans clearly like French wine. The United States is the leading importer of French wines by value, taking in 1.67 billion euros worth of French wines between Aug. 2017 and July 2018, according to FranceAgriMer, which works under the French Agriculture Ministry. That is up 30 percent compared to five years ago.", "Forecasters: South is in for wintry mix this week\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.

We\u2019ve had a chance to dialogue at least broadly about it,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nWith fires raging on both ends of California, one of them the deadliest and most destructive in the state\u2019s history, Newsom sidestepped questions about what action should be taken against utilities if their equipment is found to be responsible. The fires started near the time and place where Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric reported equipment irregularities, but no cause has been determined.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to assess the facts first before I opine,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsom called legislation enacted last year to improve forest management and protect utilities from financial ruin \u201ca good first step, obviously a work in progress.\u201d The measure included money to clear dead trees from fire-prone areas and made it easier for utilities to pass along the costs of wildfire lawsuits to their customers. California is one of two states with a legal standard that holds utilities entirely liable if their equipment causes a wildfire.\n\nBrown said California is \u201cpretty well maxed out\u201d from fighting several deadly wildfires and he\u2019s grateful for the help from surrounding states and the federal government.\n\nHe said the state is doing everything possible to prevent fires, but \u201csome things only God can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented, or what I call the new abnormal,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe winds are faster, the temperatures are hotter. The soil and vegetation is dryer. This is unprecedented.

Police said last November they were investigating, but no charges have been filed. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Actress Paz de la Huerta filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of raping her in 2010 and then embarking on a campaign of harassment that harmed her career.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults. New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta\u2019s allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman.\n\nIn a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman.\n\nAbout a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in The New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s attorney Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta\u2019s \u201cnewly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Scorsese, who is not a defendant in the case, had no immediate comment.\n\nDe la Huerta, 34, alleges Weinstein damaged her career by at least $60 million.\n\nAshley Judd, who is among numerous women suing Weinstein, says in her own lawsuit that Weinstein hurt her career and prevented her from getting at least one role. Judd cites an interview last year with director Peter Jackson, who said that Weinstein warned him against hiring Judd and Mira Sorvino for his \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d films. Both women have alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them.\n\nDe la Huerta\u2019s lawsuit alleges Weinstein first pressured her for sex in her apartment after the two had been at a party celebrating the premiere of the film \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d in 2010, and threatened to harm her career if she didn\u2019t submit, then raped her when she refused.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Weinstein taunted her with phone calls for two weeks, and on Dec. 23 she agreed to see him at her apartment with the intention of demanding that he stop the calls. She drank large amounts of alcohol in her anxiety, making her vulnerable, and Weinstein raped her again, according to the suit.\n\nThree weeks later in January 2011, the two were both in Los Angeles for series of awards-season events when de la Huerta again tried to confront Weinstein. Her lawsuit states the mogul opened the door of his room at the Four Seasons Hotel and exposed himself to her and invited her to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman who was in the room and undressed, the suit states.\n\nDe la Huerta left feeling \u201cembarrassed, scared, shocked and humiliated,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe then drank excessively and was denied entry to a GQ party at the Chateau Marmont. Photographers captured video of the drunken actress, further damaging her reputation and career, the lawsuit states.\n\nMore than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing.

He made it clear winning a championship is his main priority.\n\n\u201cI already got enough money to have me and my family set for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not about the money,\u201d said Butler, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent at the end of the season. \u201cI have to love where I\u2019m at and have a great chance to win a championship.\u201d\n\nThe Sixers believe adding Butler to a roster that includes Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will allow them to compete for an NBA title. They won 52 games last season and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals after going 75-253 combined the previous four years.\n\nRobert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless were traded to Minnesota along with a 2022 second-round draft pick for Butler and Justin Patton.\n\n\u201cWith Joel, Ben and Jimmy, we have a strong, dynamic team,\u201d Sixers general manager Elton Brand said, pointing to a \u201cchampionship window.\u201d\n\nButler is expected to make his debut with his new team on Wednesday in Orlando.\n\nThe 29-year-old Butler has averaged 21.8 points a game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span. The deal to Philadelphia ends a two-month saga that began when Butler told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved.\n\nCritics, often citing anonymous sources, called Butler a disruptive presence on a team. Butler defended his reputation.\n\n\u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t know who I am unless you\u2019re around me every day,\u201d Butler said. \u201cFor the most part, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t worry too much about what everybody says. If you know me, if you\u2019re around me, you know my heart. You know how I go about what I go about.\n\n\u201cI love my teammates. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many of them that\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m a bad teammate but people get whatever they want to say out. It is what it is, but I think that I\u2019m an incredible human being and teammate and I\u2019ll show that to the guys that are here.\u201d\n\nBrand said he spoke to several of Butler\u2019s former teammates and came away more than satisfied.\n\n\u201cIn the locker room, they loved him,\u201d Brand said. \u201cOn the court, he\u2019s demanding and he wants to win.\u201d\n\nButler\u2019s hard-charging style of play will certainly fit well in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the most talented guy. I\u2019m not the best shooter. I\u2019m not the fastest guy. I just work hard,\u201d Butler said. I take great pride in that. I love to work. I love to grind. It doesn\u2019t change now. I\u2019ll take it up a notch. I think the city will love that.\u201d\n\nButler isn\u2019t concerned about not getting enough touches on offense with Embiid, Simmons, JJ Redick, Markelle Fultz and others on the Sixers. He handled the ball a lot in Minnesota but doesn\u2019t worry about fitting into coach Brett Brown\u2019s system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m great at sharing the ball, moving without the ball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf I need the ball, I\u2019ll go steal it, go the other end and lay it up. Go get an offensive rebound. There\u2019s more than one way to get the ball. I think the way these guys play, sharing the ball, setting screens, slipping, all of that good stuff, I think that\u2019s actually easier than having to create all the time in iso situations and off the pick-and-roll.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "FILE - In this Sept. 2, 2011 file photo, former Oakdale Police Chief Marty West is pictured at the department in Oakdale, Calif.

Montgomery was ejected for fighting in the second half. (AP Photo/Matthew Putney)\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 No. 18 Iowa State will be without junior David Montgomery, one of its best players, for the first half of one of the bigger games in school history.\n\nHow the Cyclones (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) fare for 30 minutes without their star running back could decide whether they stay alive in the Big 12 title game chase.\n\nMontgomery, the Big 12\u2032s second-leading rusher, will miss the first two quarters of Saturday\u2019s showdown at No. 13 Texas (7-3, 5-2) after being ejected for throwing a punch during last week\u2019s win over Baylor. Iowa State didn\u2019t even bother to appeal Montgomery\u2019s suspension, instead chalking it up to a lesson learned and a chance for his backups to respond.\n\nThe Cyclones own the head-to-head tiebreaker over No. 7 West Virginia. But they need to win out and hope for a Mountaineers loss to make it to the championship game for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really fortunate to have a really talented backfield,\u201d Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \u201cAll those guys bring a lot of different qualities to the table.\u201d\n\nMontgomery\u2019s numbers \u2014 765 yards and six touchdowns on 4.5 yards a carry \u2014 at times belie his ability, as the third-year back often runs behind a line that has struggled to spring him. But Montgomery is undoubtedly a difference maker, and the kind of player who could easily leave for the NFL draft next spring.\n\nThe Cyclones\u2019 next-best running threat is freshman quarterback Brock Purdy. But trying to spring Purdy to run wild in open space might be too risky \u2014 especially against a physical defense like Texas.\n\nThe better bet is that the Cyclones will try to cobble together a first-half rushing attack behind reserves Kene Nwangwu, Johnnie Lang and Sheldon Croney. Those three have combined for just 3.1 yards a carry in 69 tries this year, but they say they\u2019re confident they can fill Montgomery\u2019s shoes.\n\nNwangwu is averaging 33 yards on kick returns, and he had 10 carries for 49 yards in a win over Oklahoma State on Oct. 6. Lang, a freshman, is one of the fastest players on the team, and Croney appears to be an option in short-yardage situations.\n\n\u201cI feel like whoever is in the game is just going to produce,\u201d Nwangwu said.\n\nCampbell said he is not concerned about missing Montgomery for a half, partly because the Cyclones played without him against the Cowboys and scored 48 points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here already. We had to play a conference game, on the road, without our tailback,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for them. I think it\u2019s just another great opportunity for them to showcase that (group).\u201d\n\nMontgomery\u2019s suspension couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the Cyclones, who have won five straight in the league for the first time.\n\nBut Iowa State has shown an impressive knack for overcoming adversity, bouncing back from a 1-3 start despite losing two starting quarterbacks \u2014 Kyle Kempt to injury and Zeb Noland to a transfer \u2014 already this season.\n\n\u201cThe cliche answer is the going to be this \u2014 but it\u2019s also the real answer,\u201d Campbell said his team\u2019s resilience. \u201cOur culture, within our walls ... the player leadership, the player ownership. You know I think sometimes in a lot of ways coaching gets overrated.

Stapleton is scheduled to testify before a legislative committee about two contracts his office awarded to a former Republican Party chairman and his wife. (Thom Bridge/Independent Record via AP)\n\nHELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Montana Secretary of State Corey Stapleton on Tuesday defended his decision to award an emergency $265,000 contract to a friend\u2019s printing company, saying he did what was right for state voters.\n\nStapleton, a Republican, testified before the State Administration and Veterans Affairs Committee, which oversees his office, about the contract awarded to former state Republican Party Executive Director Jake Eaton.\n\nThe company printed and distributed 470,000 mailers on Oct. 12 that corrected mistakes in the Montana Voter Information Pamphlet. The action came three days after the company was first contacted about the job and the same day that absentee ballots were sent to voters across the state.\n\nStapleton told the committee that Eaton\u2019s Ultra Graphics, a Billings printing company formerly known as Alpha Graphics, was the only one in the state that could do the job within that timeframe so voters had accurate information before casting ballots.\n\nHe also said opponents of a ballot measure to add new standards to mine cleanups threatened to sue over the pamphlet\u2019s errors, which was also a consideration in the decision.\n\n\u201cYes, the person who runs that now is a friend of mine,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cI\u2019ve done business with Alpha Graphics and Ultra Graphics for years, long before it was owned by anybody that I would know. The point is, we did what was right for the voters.\u201d\n\nEaton was revealed as the winning contractor after a public-records request by The Associated Press.\n\nThe committee\u2019s chairwoman, Sen. Sue Malek, a Missoula Democrat, asked Stapleton to testify after a Billings Gazette editorial, citing the AP\u2019s reporting, called for Stapleton to be questioned about that contract and a $60,000 contract awarded to Eaton\u2019s wife, Billings attorney Emily Jones, to defend Stapleton\u2019s office in a lawsuit.\n\nMalek said she considered it unusual that Stapleton dealt directly with Eaton instead of including the state Department of Administration\u2019s print and mail services in those negotiations. She also questioned how the mistake could have happened, and wondered whether staffing cuts to Stapleton\u2019s office were a factor.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how this happened,\u201d she said.\n\nStapleton did not address any staffing cuts within his office. He said that if the contract had been awarded to an Arizona company that had bid on the job, it would have taken Montana voters an extra day or two to receive the corrections \u2014 and as many as 50,000 people could have sent back their absentee ballots by then.\n\nStapleton also called news reports that the Arizona company submitted a less expensive bid erroneous, and he said Eaton\u2019s bid was the cheapest.\n\n\u201cIn the end we had to pick somebody, but we picked the cheaper one, the one that was in state and the one that would get it to voters on time, because nobody else could,\u201d he said.\n\nThe facts don\u2019t bear that out that Ultra Graphics made the lowest bid, according to documents detailing the bids.\n\nStapleton cited the higher of two bids submitted by the Arizona company in claiming that Eaton\u2019s bid was lowest. However, he made no mention that his office had initially requested two bids \u2014 one for a postcard with the corrections, and another for a larger sheet \u2014 and that the Arizona company\u2019s postcard bid was more than $14,000 below Ultra Graphics\u2019 bid, including postage.\n\nBut then Stapleton\u2019s office changed the specifications because Eaton\u2019s office had enough paper of a different size in stock, and the Arizona company did not get the opportunity to bid on the new specifications, Department of Administration spokeswoman Amber Conger said.", "FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2018 file photo, Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask (40) plays against the Detroit Red Wings in the second period of an NHL hockey game in Detroit.

(Steve McCrank/The Orange County Register via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 An Egyptian man was held without bail Tuesday on federal charges of fraudulently collecting insurance payouts after driving his severely autistic children to their deaths when he sped off a pier into the Port of Los Angeles.\n\nAli Elmezayen (EL-mah-ZION) plotted for over two years before launching his plan into action April 9, 2015, when he barreled down a commercial fishing dock in San Pedro, turned his Honda abruptly toward a parking space and gunned the engine, federal authorities said.\n\n\u201cWitnesses heard the tires of the car screech loudly and saw the car accelerate before it flew off the edge of the wharf, crashed into the water and immediately sunk,\u201d FBI agent Matthew Parker wrote in an affidavit in support of Elmezayen\u2019s arrest last week.\n\nElmezayen, 44, did not enter a plea in the case in U.S. District Court, but he has told investigators and others he may have accidentally accelerated instead of hitting the brake, according to court papers. He blamed the city, Honda, and Jiffy Lube and others for negligence, but his lawsuit was tossed out.\n\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney declined to bring charges in the deaths because of insufficient evidence. A police mechanic found evidence that the brake pedal didn\u2019t properly work, but couldn\u2019t tell if that was the case before the tragedy or because of salt water corrosion.\n\nWhile a county prosecutor said the father\u2019s explanation could create reasonable doubt, they suggested police tell federal prosecutors about evidence of insurance and other fraud.\n\nFederal investigators said they found that Elmezayen spent about a quarter of his reported $24,000 salary to insure himself, his longtime partner and three sons for $6 million.\n\nElmezayen repeatedly called insurers to confirm they wouldn\u2019t automatically investigate a claim made more than two years after a policy was written, federal prosecutors said.\n\nThe deadly plunge occurred two years and 12 days after the final policy took effect, authorities said.\n\nElmezayen\u2019s car window was open, and he surfaced within 30 seconds and swam to a ladder on the pier. His partner, Rabab Diab, couldn\u2019t swim, but she was rescued by a fisherman after surfacing and screaming, \u201cMy kids, my kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe poor lady was screaming hysterically,\u201d said fisherman Ray Prince shortly after the incident. \u201cI thought she was going to drown.\u201d\n\nTwo boys, Abdelkarim, 8, and Elhassan, 13, couldn\u2019t swim and were strapped in child seats. They were pulled lifeless from the car by rescue divers and died from drowning.\n\nElmezayen collected more than $260,000 in insurance payouts for the deaths and wired more than $170,000 back to his native Egypt, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors argued that Elmezayen should not be free awaiting trial because he was likely to flee to his homeland. They also argued he still posed a danger to Diab because he had intended to kill her and still pays premiums on her life insurance policy and that of another son, who was at camp when his siblings were killed.\n\nA public defender representing Elmezayen argued that nothing had happened to Diab and the other son in over three years. He asked to have Elmezayen use $250,000 in equity in two houses he owns to secure his bond.\n\nElmezayen and Diab came to the U.S. in 2000 and overstayed their tourist visas, prosecutors said. Both married other partners in hopes of becoming permanent residents. Elmezayen has acknowledged his was a sham marriage.\n\nJudge Alka Sagar said Elmezayen lacked credibility and she denied bail, in part, because of what she called the \u201cghastly scheme to obtain insurance benefits.\u201d", "RICHMOND, Ind.

The system automatically pushes the nose of the plane down.\n\nBut if that nose-down command is triggered by faulty sensor readings \u2014 as suspected in the Lion Air crash \u2014 pilots can struggle to control the plane, which can go into a dive and perhaps crash, according to a Boeing safety bulletin and safety regulators.\n\nThe bulletin included new details on how to stop a runaway series of events from leading to a crash, pilots say.\n\n\u201cIt is something we did not have before in any of our training. It wasn\u2019t in our books.

An American spokesman said the airline was unaware of some new automated functions in the MAX but hasn\u2019t experienced nose-direction errors. A United spokesman said Boeing and the FAA do not believe additional pilot training is needed.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive last week to airlines, telling them to update cockpit manuals to include instructions for how pilots can adjust flight controls under certain conditions.\n\n\u201cThe FAA will take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant,\u201d the agency said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.

(AP Photo/ Cheryl Senter)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Having spent a fortune to help elect Democrats this fall, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared lifetime allegiance to the Democratic Party on Tuesday and outlined an aggressive timeline for deciding whether to run for president.\n\n\u201cI think January, February would be about as late as you can do it and as early as you can gather enough information,\u201d Bloomberg told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nThe 76-year-old billionaire said his decision would have little to do with other Democratic presidential prospects. He conceded that \u201cit\u2019s much too early to tell\u201d whether he has a legitimate chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and, with it, the chance to take on another New York billionaire, President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving, Christmas and then maybe a few weeks into January \u2014 that\u2019s when you really gotta sit down, talk to your advisers and say, \u2018Look, do I have a chance?\u2019 I think I know why I would want to run. I think I know what I think this country should do and what I would do. But I just don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible,\u201d Bloomberg told the AP.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf people don\u2019t seem to be warming to you, there\u2019s plenty of other ways that I can make a difference in life and say thank you to this country for what it\u2019s given my kids and me.\u201d\n\nShould he run, Bloomberg would bring virtually limitless resources and a pragmatic governing approach to what is expected to be a massive 2020 Democratic field. Hardly a far-left liberal, he is described by his team as socially progressive and business-minded. He has spent tens of millions of dollars to promote liberal priorities on climate change, gun control and immigration.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether there\u2019s room for Bloomberg in today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a lukewarm assessment this week when asked about Bloomberg\u2019s $110 million investment in his party\u2019s 2018 midterm efforts.\n\n\u201cI applaud everybody who was involved,\u201d Perez said in an interview. \u201cVery appreciative of Mayor Bloomberg. Equally appreciative of those grassroots activists who were knocking on doors every weekend, texting people, investing 50 bucks in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nStill, Bloomberg endeared himself to many Democratic leaders in recent months after deciding to invest more than $110 million in the 2018 midterms \u2014 largely focused on House races. Long an active political donor to candidates in both parties, Bloomberg gave almost exclusively to Democrats this year for the first time.\n\nThe decision, he explained, was born out of his concern that Republicans who controlled the House and Senate weren\u2019t providing an adequate check on the Trump presidency. Yet this political season marked a permanent shift in his political identity, he said.\n\n\u201cI will be a Democrat for the rest of my life,\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nInitially registered as a Democrat, the Massachusetts native filed paperwork to change his voter registration to Republican in 2000 before his first run for New York City mayor, according to a spokesman. In June 2007, he unenrolled from the GOP, having no formal party affiliation until he registered again as a Democrat this October.\n\nMonths before that, Bloomberg directed his political team to work hand in hand with leading Democratic allies to shape the first nationwide election of Trump\u2019s presidency. His top aides even shared office space at times in the campaign\u2019s final days with the super PAC aligned with top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi.\n\nUltimately, Bloomberg\u2019s preferred candidates won all but three of two dozen targeted House races, focused overwhelmingly in America\u2019s suburbs.\n\nOnce it became clear Democrats seized the House majority, he said he delivered a stern message to Pelosi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said to Nancy Pelosi: \u2018We don\u2019t expect you to do the same thing to the Republicans that the Republicans were doing to you. We want to have people working across the aisle for the benefit of America rather than for the benefit of their party,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg said.\n\nThat\u2019s a message Pelosi herself has articulated in recent weeks. Bloomberg reinforced it again in person on Tuesday as Pelosi met with his board of directors in private.\n\n\u201cI said, sitting next to her, without mincing words, I said, \u2018You know, we expect you to do a good job,\u2019\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we supported the Democrats.\u201d\n\nDemocratic officials poised to play leading roles in the next presidential election took notice of Bloomberg\u2019s investment.\n\nGuy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, described Bloomberg\u2019s midterm effort as \u201cincredibly helpful.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, however, whether Democratic voters who might favor younger, more liberal candidates in 2020 will see him any differently.\n\n\u201cDemocrats appreciate how much he has invested and how much his team has been engaged in the cycle, but ultimately it\u2019s going to be about what Bloomberg\u2019s vision is for the future,\u201d Cecil said.\n\nBloomberg acknowledged he has already formulated his justification for a presidential bid, but he declined to share it when asked. Still, he offered a message to any critics who might not think he belongs in today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has done more on the environment, on gun safety, on immigration, go right down the list,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cI was the one who stood up for gay marriage long before it became popular. I was the one at the national convention who said Trump was a con man. If you find anybody that\u2019s done more on these issues than I have, and the people that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work with, please give me a call.

From 2012 to 2016, the legislature never approved more than 74 percent of the system\u2019s funding request. The legislature has approved 97 percent of the agency\u2019s funding request in the past two years, plus 100 percent of the request over the next two years.\n\n\u201cThis is a great turning point for us,\u201d Harbin told members of the system\u2019s governance and audit committee on Tuesday. \u201cThe legislature and the administration are to be wholeheartedly ... applauded for the financing they put toward this pension plan.\u201d\n\nThe teachers\u2019 retirement plan has been a lightning rod in 2018. In the spring, the Republican-controlled legislature made some changes to the system, including moving all new teacher hires into a hybrid plan and limiting how teachers can use sick days in calculating their retirement benefits. It also changed how the state pays off its pension debt, requiring more money at first but savings over time.\n\nThousands of teachers responded by marching at the state Capitol, a protest so large it forced the closure of more than 30 school districts across the state.\n\nThat law, Senate Bill 151, has been challenged in court. But Harbin said that law\u2019s fate will not determine the solvency of the teachers\u2019 retirement system going forward because the new spending from the legislature was authorized in a separate bill.\n\n\u201cThe funding from the state is the primary driver,\u201d he said.\n\nThe teachers\u2019 retirement system is one of eight public pension plans in Kentucky that covers most of the state\u2019s public employees, including police officers, firefighters and other local government employees. Altogether, Kentucky\u2019s pension systems are among the worst funded in the country.\n\nThe system in the most trouble is the Kentucky Employees Retirement System\u2019s nonhazardous plan, which covers most state workers. Last week, officials announced that plan now has just 12.9 percent of the money it needs to pay benefits over the next 30 years. Executive Director David Eager said that\u2019s because the system is paying more in benefits than it receives in contributions and investment returns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of treading water right now in that plan,\u201d Eager said.\n\nBut Eager said things should improve slightly next year. The system\u2019s board of trustees recently changed its investment assumptions, meaning the state will contribute 83 percent of payroll to the plan instead of 49 percent of payroll. The legislature decided to fund the increase.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to make a huge difference for us going forward,\u201d he said.", "KANSAS CITY, Mo.

It was that debate and a desire not to further divide the city that inspired volunteers to return to the parks Sunday, McCord said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be split by economic hardship and racial disparity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to come together.

The court hasn\u2019t scheduled a hearing on the Senate\u2019s request.\n\nThe panel of acting justices ruled the Senate lacked jurisdiction to pursue Justice Margaret Workman\u2019s impeachment trial. The decision also was applied to trials involving retired Justice Robin Davis and Loughry, who had petitioned the court to intervene.\n\nSenate President Mitch Carmichael said Monday the focus now is on overturning \u201cthis ridiculous, crazy decision by the appointed Supreme Court that just breaks every judicial canon. It is a ridiculous decision that has far-ranging implications for the separations of powers.\u201d\n\nCarmichael said the Senate\u2019s view on the court\u2019s earlier decision is that the court can\u2019t decide whether one of its members can be impeached.\n\n\u201cThe court is not a party to this process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is within the constitution (to be) entirely left to the Legislature to determine the impeachment process.\u201d\n\nLoughry resigned effective Monday and is the third justice to leave the five-member court in recent months.

Some of the justices were accused of abusing their authority by failing to rein in excessive spending.\n\nWalker was cleared of an impeachment charge at her Senate trial last month.\n\nWest Virginia voters last week passed a constitutional amendment that would give legislators the option of reducing part of the state judiciary\u2019s annual budget.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Miami Heat sent a letter to Miami-Dade County commissioners Tuesday, saying they want to set the record straight on what the team perceives as misconceptions about the relationship between it and the county as a new naming-rights deal looms.\n\nThe letter from Heat Business Operations President Eric Woolworth comes about three weeks after county officials exercised their right to take full control of negotiations for the next naming-rights deal for the arena where the team plays. The county chose an option to pay the Heat $2 million annually starting in 2020 and keep the rest.\n\nThe Heat hoped for a collaborative effort on the next naming-rights deal, saying both sides would benefit. County officials did not make that offer.\n\n\u201cI tend to take for granted that everyone in South Florida knows how the Arena came to be, what its purpose is, how we operate it, what kind of partners we have been for the County, and what we have come to mean in the community,\u201d Woolworth wrote. \u201cI see now that this is a flawed approach.\u201d\n\nThe current naming-rights deal with American Airlines Arena, which has been worth about $2.1 million annually, ends in 2019. The relationship between the Heat and the county is complex; the team paid the construction costs for the arena, but the facility is owned by the county, and some lawmakers have bristled over the years about how they believe the arrangement is too team-friendly. The Heat say that notion is unfounded.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what advantage \u2014 if any \u2014 the next holder of the naming rights could glean from the Heat brand if the team is not part of the deal-making process. The team controls the arena operations.\n\nAnd that brand is bustling. The Heat sold 35,000 of their popular \u201cVice\u201d edition jerseys last season, more of what the league calls City Edition jerseys than all other 29 NBA teams did combined and are on pace to sell significantly more this season. Those jerseys say Miami across the front, not Heat, and the team contends that selling them in 49 different countries makes the jerseys a walking billboard of sorts for a city that thrives on tourism.\n\nCounty Mayor Carlos Gimenez told commissioners that it\u2019s believed Miami-Dade could generate up to $50 million in additional revenue over the lifetime of the deal by taking over control of the naming rights.\n\nWoolworth wrote that Heat managing general partner Micky Arison and his family have never taken a cent out of the arena or the team \u2014 \u201cthey are the kind of owners every community and every fan base wants,\u201d Woolworth said \u2014 and pointed out that the team has spent nearly $94 million to maintain the arena, well over the $18 million that the county mandated be spent to this point in the lease agreement.\n\n\u201cThink about that,\u201d Woolworth wrote. \u201cWe take our responsibility to maintain the Arena you own in a first-class manner so seriously that we have spent $75 million more than we have been required in order to do so.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a risk to the county because regardless of what it sells the naming rights for, or if the deal is delayed, it must pay the Heat $2 million per year regardless. And all this comes with the county\u2019s widely criticized deal that gave the Miami Marlins an extremely team-friendly stadium deal still fresh in the minds of many lawmakers. The Heat believe any comparison to the Marlins\u2019 situation is a false equivalency.\n\n\u201cWe have tried to make the County proud to be partners with us,\u201d Woolworth wrote.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "", "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Ten Indonesian fishermen arrested in Hawaii are accused of trying to smuggle nearly 1,000 shark fins from the U.S. to Indonesia.\n\nThey had been working on a Japanese-flagged boat and were headed home via Honolulu when airport security workers found shark fins in their luggage last week, according to court documents.\n\nAt least 962 shark finds were founded in 13 pieces of luggage.

(Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal via AP)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 A Spanish-language reporter who faces deportation after his arrest while covering an immigration protest in Tennessee said Tuesday he was unjustly detained and faces danger if sent back to El Salvador.\n\nManuel Duran spoke publicly about his case for the first time since his arrest at an April rally protesting immigration policies the day before the 50th anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in downtown Memphis.\n\nDuran is from El Salvador and he has lived in Memphis for years. He ran the Memphis Noticias online news outlet and reported on the effects of U.S. immigration policies in the Hispanic community. Duran\u2019s lawyers have said he came to the U.S. without permission in 2006 after receiving death threats related to reporting on corruption in El Salvador.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous for me to return to my country,\u201d he said in Spanish during the conference call.\n\nDuran had been critical of law enforcement in his reporting. Activists say he faced retaliation for it. Memphis police have repeatedly denied those allegations, saying officers arrested Duran after an order to clear the street was given.\n\nDuran said he was just doing his job as a journalist when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cI was doing the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn October, the Board of Immigration Appeals in Virginia denied an appeal in the case. Duran\u2019s lawyer, Michelle Lapointe, said he could be deported within two weeks if the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta does not agree to delay his removal and reopen his deportation case. A ruling is pending.\n\nLapointe, who works with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said she will ask for asylum for Duran if the court does agree to open his case because reporters are facing worsening conditions in El Salvador.\n\nDuran was issued a deportation order in 2007 after he failed to show up for court. His lawyers have said that he did not receive notice to report to court before the deportation order was issued.\n\nAfter Duran\u2019s April 3 arrest, disorderly conduct and obstruction of a highway charges were dropped. Authorities in Memphis then handed him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe would not be in this situation if he had not been targeted for exercising his First Amendment rights reporting the news that was critical of local policies and ICE policies that harmed his community,\u201d Lapointe said.\n\nDuran was transferred from Memphis to an ICE facility in Louisiana. Duran said he has experienced poor conditions, including bad food and dirty bathrooms with no toilet paper, in ICE facilities in Louisiana.\n\nICE spokesman Bryan Cox denied Duran\u2019s allegations. Cox said the facility where Duran is being held in Jena, Louisiana, has been inspected by multiple groups and has passed inspection.\n\nDuran\u2019s lawyers have sought his release from ICE custody as they fight his deportation.

It has set up a de facto government in the Gaza Strip, where it is responsible for managing the daily lives of some 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael, which along with its Western allies considers Hamas a terrorist group, joined with Egypt to impose a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas takeover, eviscerating the local economy. Jobs are hard to come by, Gaza\u2019s beaches are polluted by untreated sewage and tap water is undrinkable.\n\nThe blockade greatly restricts the movement of people out of the tiny territory, making it difficult to do business or travel abroad for work, school or family reasons.\n\nHamas wants Israel and Egypt to lift the blockade and it has led weekly protests since March aimed at busting it. Fueled in part by desperation, thousands have attended, with some burning tires, throwing rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damaging the perimeter fence. More than 170 protesters have been killed by Israeli fire since the protests began.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers. But it has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed people who have been shot.\n\n___\n\nISRAEL\n\nIsrael, which withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 after 38 years of occupation, says it has no choice but to enforce the blockade, accusing Hamas of trying to smuggle weapons into the territory.\n\nIsrael claims some credit for keeping border crossings open, allowing food, consumer goods and some construction materials to flow into the territory. It also has asked the international community, which already funnels hundreds of millions of dollars a year into Gaza, to increase aid.\n\nOver the years, Hamas has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets and other weapons which it has fired sporadically at Israeli communities along with other Gaza militants. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars, including one in 2014 that exposed a network of underground tunnels leading into Israel from Gaza, prompting Israeli accusations that Hamas uses material meant for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction for its war infrastructure.\n\nDespite its recognition that the economic situation in Gaza could lead to a humanitarian crisis, Israel says no political resolution can be reached so long as Hamas remains in power. Hamas has refused to disarm or disavow its opposition to Israel.\n\n___\n\nTHE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\nCompounding the situation has been a yearslong rift between Hamas and Abbas\u2019 Fatah faction. Attempts to reconcile have repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinians divided between rival governments in the West Bank and Gaza. The talks have repeatedly broken down over Hamas\u2019 refusal to disarm.\n\nAbbas is fearful of any political settlement that would separate Gaza from the West Bank and entrench Hamas rule.\n\nHe has slashed the salaries of thousands of former government workers in Gaza and cut fuel subsidies to pay for electricity, all in an effort to step up pressure on Hamas. He has also thwarted a series of internationally-backed initiatives aimed at rehabilitating Gaza, worried that they could help Hamas.\n\nThese measures, combined with the decade-long blockade, have sent Gaza\u2019s economy into freefall, prompting the increasingly desperate Hamas to step up the mass border protests.", "In this Aug. 2018 photo, Jed Copham, right, along with his wife Kristi and Forrest Lucas, owner and founder of Lucas Oil Products, which is the title sponsor of BIR\u2019s Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals each year pose for a photo.

Linhardt said he would favor the adoption of rules that would reduce nitrogen oxide emissions but doubts that the administration wants to do that.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this administration and this leadership of the EPA do not fill us with much confidence that this will be a real air pollution reduction measure,\u201d Linhardt said.\n\nPaul Billings of the American Lung Association said he thinks the idea is encouraging but depends on exactly what the proposal looks like.\n\n\u201cThe devil\u2019s always in the details,\u201d Billings said. \u201cIf they were not to tighten the (nitrogen oxide) standards, it\u2019d be a bait-and-switch.\u201d\n\nNitrogen oxides can worsen existing lung disease, contribute to the development of asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.\n\nSince the emissions regulations were last updated in 2000, regulatory requirements have been added piecemeal, resulting in what Wheeler calls \u201coverly complex and costly\u201d requirements that don\u2019t benefit the environment. The goal of the regulatory change would be to root out inefficiencies and perhaps use onboard diagnostic computers to ensure compliance over the life of trucks, Wheeler said.\n\nThe share of overall pollution contributed by heavy trucks has grown over the years, especially in urban areas and port cities with significant truck traffic, said Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator of the EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation.\n\nWehrum said the EPA doesn\u2019t have a proposed target for setting new nitrogen oxide standards because it\u2019s at the beginning of a rule-making process. He said vehicles are now tested for emissions on a treadmill-like dynamometer, which might not capture all high-emissions phases of engine operation. The new standards could cut emissions during high-pollution phases, he said.\n\nCalifornia already is working on more stringent heavy truck emissions standards, and new federal standards could conflict with them. Wehrum said the EPA isn\u2019t drawing up its own standards to set up a confrontation with California, and it will work with the state on the new regulation.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s plan to freeze passenger vehicle fuel economy standards at 2020 levels would relax a regulation enacted at the end of the Obama administration. But that plan already has touched off a legal fight with California and about a dozen other states that follow its rules. California wants the requirements to become progressively more stringent through 2026.\n\nFor now, the U.S. and California standards match, and the auto industry fears they could be split in two, forcing them to make costly design changes for California and the other states.\n\nThe EPA is still considering the light-vehicle standards.

Rowling about portraying the younger version of Albus Dumbledore, the two discussed how to rebuild the fan-favorite character from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d films.\n\nLaw spent an afternoon jotting down notes from Rowling who talked to him about Dumbledore\u2019s life before becoming the world\u2019s most powerful wizard. The British actor walked away with a vote of confidence from the famed author, alleviating some pressure on him.\n\n\u201cWhen the boss says \u2018I like you,\u2019 it gives you a little bit of comfort,\u201d Law said of Rowling, screenwriter of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d prequel series that is based on her 2001 book \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\u201d \u2033You can\u2019t help but step into something like this, playing a part like this without feeling a sense of responsibility, a fear of letting someone down. But when the creator gives you the thumbs up, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nDumbledore was a Hogwarts headmaster in the \u201cPotter\u201d franchise commonly known for his silver hair and long beard, sporting a loose robe. He was played by Michael Gambon after inheriting the role from the Richard Harris, who died in 2002.\n\nEddie Redmayne shares his excitement about his first day on set opposite Jude Law's Dumbledore, while Katherine Waterston says the new movie's links to \"Harry Potter\" are strong. (Nov. 8)\n\nLaw\u2019s youthful version enters in his mid-40s wearing a three-piece suit with short auburn hair in the sequel \u201dFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald ,\u201d which will be released Friday. It\u2019s the second part of a five-film franchise that started with 2016\u2032s \u201cFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\u201d which grossed $813 million worldwide.\n\nIn \u201cGrindelwald,\u201d Law\u2019s character works with his former student Eddie Redmayne\u2019s Newt Scamander to thwart the divisive wizard leader Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp. The film also stars Katherine Waterston, Zoe Kravitz and Ezra Miller.\n\nFor research, Law read several Harry Potter books that referenced Dumbledore, rather than solely watching the previous films featuring the elder character. With the help of Rowling and director David Yates, they wanted to build from the \u201cground up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was then given the opportunity to create him without feeling the pressure to mimic or impersonate or indeed hang the character too much on past representations by the other actors,\u201d Law said. \u201cThere were certain traits I wanted to include. I loved his humor, the twinkle he had. He sees the good in almost everyone. He has a good heart. But I was able to layer him up a little more.\u201d\n\nRedmayne said the studio perfectly cast Law as Dumbledore, who doesn\u2019t necessarily show his true powers and appears only in about six scenes \u2014 most of which are interactions with Scamander.\n\n\u201cBeing a formidable, formidable actor with great gravitas and weight and yet at the same time, he has this kind of playful quality,\u201d Redmayne said of Law. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll never forget our first scene, which was the first time we see each other in the film. I just saw his back, basically. And the way he turned around, it was instant. It was like in one look, he had managed to inhabit that. I hadn\u2019t had any expectations about Dumbledore. But somehow it was solidified in one look.\u201d\n\nThe sequel picks up after Grindelwald was captured by the Magical Congress of the United States of America with the aid of Newt at the end of the first film. But the villainous wizard finds a way to escape custody and assembles a group of pureblood wizards who support him to rule over all humans in 1920s Paris.\n\nLaw says the film opens the door to many dramatic paths and explores a more troubled time in Dumbledore\u2019s life along with his once-close relationship with Grindelwald.\n\nRowling announced in 2007 that Dumbledore is gay after the release of \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hollows,\u201d the final book in the series. Some on social media criticized the author\u2019s decision to unveil and tinker with the beloved character\u2019s sexuality, but she has defended her actions.\n\nLaw assures the story is more focused on his character\u2019s complicated relationship with Grindelwald from decades ago, rather than Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality.\n\n\u201cHis sexuality doesn\u2019t define him, but the relationship with Grindelwald does,\u201d Law said. \u201cI believe, and (Rowling) would agree, that Albus had many intimate relationships. And the one he has is the love of his life, which is damaged. It becomes even poisonous and sends the two of them in opposite directions. He\u2019s now in his middle age, around my age 45, and he\u2019s still recovering from a relationship that he\u2019s trying to work out from when he was 20. That\u2019s a long time. I could barely remember what life was like when I was 20.\u201d\n\nThe actor applauded Rowling for being fearless in creating \u201clayered\u201d and \u201cdiverse\u201d characters such as Dumbledore in a fantasy world with \u201cescapism and magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful that we\u2019re in a world where finally, finally a franchise like this has a great character and it doesn\u2019t matter. But (Rowling) is brave enough to put it out there and say \u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019 People should be able to handle this. They can. It\u2019s as we should be.\u201d\n\nLaw called his introduction as Dumbledore a good \u201cwarmup\u201d as the franchise progresses. The actor has a few big films ahead on his plate including \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d and \u201cVox Lux,\u201d but is looking forward to filming the third installment of \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d next summer.\n\nIt\u2019ll give Law time to grow his beard.\n\n\u201cFinding all those pieces of him were fun\u201d he said. \u201cI eased into the part, but the line was drawn at the end of this one.

(AP Photo/Lalo R. Villar)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 Real Madrid is done searching for a new coach.\n\nThe club said Tuesday it is sticking with Santiago Solari, giving him a permanent contract until June 2021.\n\nSolari was appointed as the interim coach about two weeks ago to replace the fired Julen Lopetegui and was rewarded with a long-term deal after leading the team to four straight victories, putting it back on track in the Spanish league and the Champions League.\n\nThe 42-year-old Solari is a former Argentina international who played for Real Madrid in the early 2000s. He had previously coached Madrid\u2019s \u201cB\u2033 team.\n\nThere had been speculation about Antonio Conte and Roberto Martinez as possible replacements for Lopetegui, but Solari gained the club\u2019s confidence \u2014 and the approval of fans and players \u2014 with his impressive start in charge of the main squad.\n\nMadrid outscored its opponents 15-2 in the four matches under Solari. It had lost five of its last seven games with Lopetegui in command, being outscored 13-4.\n\nSolari was virtually unknown outside of Spain and few saw him as a front-runner for the Madrid job, but he has always been well-regarded within the club.\n\nHe got the demanding Madrid fans on his side by making some popular choices early in his stint, including giving more playing time to Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian who arrived amid high expectations but had been relegated to the \u201cB\u2033 team under Lopetegui. The 18-year-old forward played well every time Solari put him in, showing he was indeed ready to be with the main squad.\n\nPlayers who had been struggling under Lopetegui also began thriving after Solari took over. Karim Benzema was one of them, scoring four goals in the four victories under Solari. The French striker had scored only once in the last 10 matches before Lopetegui was fired.\n\nThe club had registered Solari as its permanent coach on Monday because local regulations prohibit teams from having an interim coach for more than two weeks.\n\nMadrid officials had been praising Solari but had not said they stopped looking for a full-time replacement for Lopetegui, the former Spain coach who was fired following a 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou Stadium.\n\nThe club said the decision to keep Solari was made after a meeting of the board of directors on Tuesday.\n\nThe coach helped Madrid move from ninth to sixth in the Spanish league, four points behind Barcelona. He also put the three-time defending European champions back at the top of its group in the Champions League, tied on points with Roma.\n\nSolari helped Madrid win the 2002 Champions League as a player as was involved in the build-up that led to Zinedine Zidane\u2019s superb winner in the final.\n\nThe former midfielder also played for River Plate, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan.\n\nHe had been coaching Real Madrid\u2019s \u201cB\u2033 team since 2016, taking over not long after Zidane left to coach the main squad.\n\nMadrid\u2019s next match is at Eibar in the Spanish league on Nov. 24, after the international break.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "ELLICOTT CITY, Md (AP) \u2014 After Howard County\u2019s new five-member council and executive are installed in office on Dec. 3, they will have to hit the ground running as they face the pressing and complex issue of how to proceed with a $50 million flood mitigation plan for Ellicott City, Maryland.\n\n\u201cEllicott City will be an immediate priority,\u201d County Executive-elect Calvin Ball said in a statement to Capital News Service last week. \u201cI want to assure the residents, businesses, and property owners that I intend to keep the timeline of upstream storm water mitigation projects put forth by my predecessor.\u201d\n\nOne central question for the historic town, devastated by two 1,000-year floods in less than two years, is what to do about the flooded buildings downstream. The latest plan, put forward by the outgoing administration, would include knocking down some older buildings \u2014 and that\u2019s where opinions differ.\n\nThe five-year plan was announced in August by County Executive Allan Kittleman and County Councilman Jon Weinstein, who will be ending their respective terms in office next month.\n\nKittleman, 60, was elected four years ago as the first Republican to serve as county executive since 1996. He is being replaced by Ball, 43, a Democrat who has been representing District 2, which includes Columbia and Oakland Mills, as a councilman for the last 12 years.\n\nIn October, the council approved two of three amended funding bills to partially finance the county\u2019s plan \u2014 to purchase and raze 10 buildings in historic Ellicott City and expand the Tiber River stream channel \u2014 in an effort to reduce damage done by rushing water during flash floods.\n\nBall was one of two council members who voted against all three bills. He stated that he voted no because some of his proposed amendments, which he believed would address the plan\u2019s shortfalls, were not included.\n\nDemocrat Jen Terrasa, another council member whose term is ending, also voted against the funding bills.\n\nBall said he plans to research options before signing off on the demolition of the buildings.\n\n\u201cMy transition team will be tasked with evaluating all viable options to avoid the need for the demolition of lower Main Street,\u201d said Ball in the statement to Capital News Service. \u201cHowever, our work in this regard will not delay those critical projects that will provide immediate safety for Main Street.\u201d\n\nWidening the stream channel on upper Main Street and working on fully engineered stormwater facilities that will provide additional downstream protection are critical projects he supports, Ball said.\n\nThe new administration will also work with the state Legislature to raise additional funding that will be used to improve the plan, Ball said.\n\nAttorney and civil engineer Liz Walsh, a Democrat who won the District 1 County Council seat that Weinstein used to hold, has publicly stated that she wants to study the engineering report that is the basis for tearing down the properties.\n\nEfforts by Capital News Service to obtain comment from Walsh and other newly elected council members were either unsuccessful or unanswered.\n\nFrom the outset, the plan was opposed by Preservation Maryland and others who have voiced concerns that removal of the structures could result in undesirable consequences.\n\n\u201cThis plan, which seems to have been developed without substantive public input, could result in the de-listing of Ellicott City from the National Register of Historic Places,\u201d said Nicholas Redding, executive director of Preservation Maryland during an interview with Capital News Service in September. \u201cThe removal could eliminate or diminish incentives and tax credits available for the historic community in Howard County.\u201d\n\nHowever, the preservation advocacy group released a statement two days after the election that said the approved plan had \u201cworthwhile and positive components,\u201d and they supported \u201cthe scientifically-proven upstream stormwater retention and mitigation components of the plan.\u201d\n\nThe largest bone of contention to the county\u2019s current plan is the removal of the buildings in the Historic District without reducing flash flood waters to safe levels and speeds, Redding said.\n\nFlood water velocity would be reduced from about 11.1 feet per second, which happened during a July 30, 2016, flood, to approximately 4.5 feet per second. Two people died in that flood.\n\nThe flood water\u2019s depth would decrease from over 8 feet to 2-6 feet, according to numbers in the county\u2019s plan.\n\nAfter a May 2018 flood, in which one person died, property owners approached the county to acquire their buildings, county officials said.\n\nThat depth and speed of water traveling down Main Street in the approved plan is not close to safe, Redding said.\n\n\u201cWith the election now settled, non-partisan groups like Preservation Maryland are prepared to engage with newly elected officials about the future of the historic community,\u201d Redding wrote in a statement on the organization\u2019s website.\n\nIn contrast, several members of the business community in Howard County who have been supportive of the \u201cKittleman/Weinstein\u201d plan said they hope that the wholesale turnover of council members does not scuttle the town\u2019s plan to move forward with the removal of the buildings to widen the channel.\n\nBruce Taylor, developer and owner of two buildings targeted for demolition, said he is hopeful that Ball and the new five-member council will retain the plan to purchase and demolish the structures \u2014 including Caplan\u2019s Department Store, a building that has been in his family since 1895. \u201cMy family has been part of the development of Ellicott City for five generations; let\u2019s all work together so that future generations can safely enjoy this national treasure.\u201d\n\nTaylor said the current plan \u201cachieves the best possible result\u201d under the time and budget constraints and allows for treatment of the remaining buildings to keep them as dry as possible, while reducing the force and speed of flood waters in town by over 50 percent.\n\nBall says he is committed to finding a resolution that works for everyone involved, but he is not certain that the best plan is in place.\n\n\u201cThe people of Ellicott City are at the top of my mind and have a seat at my table,\u201d said Ball. \u201cYou have waited long enough. The campaign is over and now it is time to heal.\u201d", "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) \u2014 Arkansas\u2019 governor said Tuesday he believes it\u2019s possible to find consensus for raising additional money for the state\u2019s highways, but he stopped short of endorsing a specific plan yet to do so.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who was re-elected last week, said a new highway funding plan is a priority when lawmakers return to the Capitol in January for the legislative session. He said any highway funding plan is going to need to have consensus among lawmakers and industry groups, as well as support from the public.\n\n\u201cIt might take some time. It might not be before the legislative session begins,\u201d Hutchinson told reporters. \u201cBut we all know what the end goal is and there\u2019s an incredible amount of support for it in the public and the industry and mayors and counties. But the Legislature has got to figure out the exact way to fund the highway program.\u201d\n\nHutchinson spoke at the annual meeting of the Good Roads Foundation, which has called for additional funding for the state\u2019s highways. Arkansas officials say the state highway system needs $478 million in additional funding a year just to meet its current maintenance and improvement needs.\n\nRecent efforts to raise more money for Arkansas highways have stalled. Lawmakers last year rejected a proposal to put a 20-year bond issue on the ballot and potentially raise $200 million annually for the state\u2019s highways. The measure failed when some Republican lawmakers opposed an accompanying bill to raise taxes on gas and diesel to pay for the bonds. The state Highway Commission in February dropped an effort to try and put its own highway funding plan on this year\u2019s ballot.\n\nHutchinson, who has opposed past efforts to tap into general revenue such as taxes from vehicle sales, again expressed resistance to the idea given other budget needs. Hutchinson said a plan could include extending the half-cent sales tax voters approved in 2012 for highways. That tax expires in 2023.\n\nRobert Moore, a member of the Highway Commission, said Hutchinson making road funding a priority is key for getting any effort through the Legislature.\n\n\u201cI think the governor\u2019s leadership is essential, and I\u2019m proud he\u2019s taken that initiative,\u201d Moore, a former state House speaker, said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "More angst at Maryland: QB Hill out for season with torn ACL\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 10, 2018, file photo, Maryland quarterback Kasim Hill (11) grimaces as he is examined by team trainers after an apparent injury during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Indiana, in Bloomington, Ind.

(AP) \u2014 An Illinois judge ordered an investigation Tuesday into allegations that Rockford police intentionally gave prosecutors the wrong gun to send a man to prison for more than two decades for murder.\n\nWinnebago County Judge Joseph McGraw gave the order the day Patrick Pursley\u2019s retrial was slated to start. He was convicted in 1994 for the murder of Andy Ascher, 22, during a robbery in Rockford, but last year Pursley, 52, won a new trial because ballistic testing proved the gun prosecutors used as evidence was not the homicide weapon.\n\nThe allegations against police arose after Ascher\u2019s mother informed prosecutors a detective said to her after Pursley\u2019s first trial that investigators never found the gun used to kill her son. She told prosecutors about the information last year after a judge ordered a new trial, but it was not disclosed to Pursley\u2019s attorneys until days before the retrial was set to begin.\n\nNow, prosecutors and the Rockford police department must turn over all paper and electronic records that mention Pursley\u2019s case by Dec. 20, when an evidentiary hearing is scheduled. Pursley\u2019s attorneys have also asked for the personnel records of the detectives who investigated Ascher\u2019s death\n\nBut, in the meantime, defense lawyers want the case dismissed, citing misconduct by police and prosecutors.\n\n\u201cHis life should not continue to be hijacked by their misconduct,\u201d Andrew Vail, one of Pursley\u2019s attorneys, argued in court.\n\nAssistant state attorney James Brun agreed to the investigation into whether the detective\u2019s statement to Ascher\u2019s mother is true, but he pushed back on the request to dismiss the case entirely.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of the statement needs to be determined before the court makes an appropriate ruling,\u201d Brun said.\n\nRockford police spokeswoman Laura Madher did not immediately return a call for comment.\n\nPursley spent years representing himself during his prison sentence and successfully lobbied state lawmakers to pass legislation that would allow him to use the Integrated Ballistic Identification System to retest the shell casings used to prosecute him.

(AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)\n\nASHKELON, Israel (AP) \u2014 Loren Amar was watching TV with her father around midnight when an air-raid siren warning of incoming rocket fire blared through their working-class neighborhood in southern Israel.\n\nTheir old apartment had no in-house shelter, so they huddled in the stairway just before a rocket from Gaza slammed into the building next-door, sending shrapnel and debris flying into their bedrooms \u2014 and the 29-year-old Amar to the hospital with shock symptoms.\n\n\u201cThe walls shook and the hallway filled with white smoke. It felt like an earthquake,\u201d she recalled Tuesday, a hospital identity tag still wrapped around her wrist. \u201cThe electricity went out and we didn\u2019t know whether to go up or down. I was hysterical.\u201d\n\nIt was the first lethal rocket attack from Gaza in years, and yet the only fatality was a Palestinian laborer from the West Bank. Two Israeli women were critically wounded.\n\nIn just 24 hours, Gaza militants fired more than 450 rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel, the most serious escalation since a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in 2014. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes it said targeted militants.\n\nResidents angrily demanded the government restore calm for good, even if that means another war. Yet many people wearily expressed a sense of helplessness, as successive governments fail to come up with an effective policy to bring quiet to the Israel-Gaza frontier.\n\nHamas militants seized Gaza in 2007, triggering an Israeli-Egyptian border blockade that has choked the territory of 2 million people. Israel refuses to lift the blockade unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants refuse. The volatile standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli border towns.\n\nWord late Tuesday that Gaza militants agreed to a cease-fire was unlikely to sway people\u2019s minds that there is no long-term solution to the Gaza conundrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stop this thing. Nothing helps. Whatever you do it always comes back,\u201d said Shlomit Hayat, 38.\n\nShe noted that the deadly violence came just days after Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million in cash to Gaza to alleviate its economic hardship and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he\u2019d do everything he can to prevent an \u201cunnecessary\u201d war.\n\nThe latest fighting was triggered by a botched Israeli raid into Gaza on Sunday that set off clashes resulting in the deaths of seven Palestinian militants, including a local Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer. Palestinian militant groups said the rocket barrage was a message to Israel that such incursions have a cost.\n\nGazans have similar fears when fighting breaks out. While Israel says it has confined its airstrikes to military targets, hundreds of Palestinian civilians have been killed in the three previous wars. For many in Gaza, the latest outbreak of fighting brought back fears that no place is truly safe in the densely populated territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a six-story residential building in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City that housed a kindergarten on its ground floor. Israel said the building was used by Hamas for military purposes \u2014 a charge denied by residents.\n\n\u201cAll the people here are civilians, children and families,\u201d said Mamdouh al-Shurafa, a building resident. \u201cWhen we are bombed in the middle of the city, where can we go?\u201d\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the group seized Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome rocket-defense system and advanced warning networks have provided a large degree of protection from the rockets, which killed some 30 civilians in the decade prior to the 2014 war. Casualties have dropped considerably since then and a proliferation of rocket-proof safe rooms in newer buildings has allowed many Israelis to feel much safer in their own homes.\n\nBut this week\u2019s onslaught showed the system is not foolproof. The overnight rocket that slipped through penetrated the roof of a four-story apartment building, leaving the entire structure pockmarked, its windows blown out and the balcony shutters hanging limply.\n\nEmergency forces evacuated a critically wounded woman to hospital. Only an hour later, a neighbor sifting through the rubble discovered the other wounded woman and the dead man. \u201cI heard a murmur and then I saw a hand reach out,\u201d said Shlomi Lankry.\n\nRelatives in the West Bank town of Halhoul identified the dead man as 48-year-old Mahmoud Abu Asbeh. A married father of six, he would typically sleep in Ashkelon during the week and return home for weekends.\n\n\u201cThe rockets don\u2019t have eyes to see, they hit randomly, and this happened randomly, it was unintentional,\u201d said his father, Abdel Hamid Abu Asbeh. \u201cLast night he told me the rockets are falling like rain. He said: \u2018May God protect us,\u2019 as if he expected something.\u201d\n\nThose around the building were at a loss to describe the shock of a rocket landing in the heart of their neighborhood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Russian Roulette,\u201d said Elie Mozes, 57. \u201cIt just comes out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nBack at home after her stint in the hospital, Amar said she was at a loss to prescribe a solution. With glass strewn across her bed and holes blown through her hanging laundry, she said all she knew was that something had to be done.\n\n\u201cIf anyone still lives in a fairytale that there will be peace here they need to snap out of it,\u201d she said.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Fares Akram in Gaza City contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "Congressional District 2 Republican candidate Yvette Herrell talks to supporters at the Republican Party of Otero County watch party in Alamogordo, N.M., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

(AP) \u2014 At the center of Florida\u2019s vote recount storm is an elections supervisor with a checkered past whose Democratic-dominated county has been the target of protests and accusations, including by President Donald Trump, that something fraudulent is afoot.\n\nLawyers for Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is in a razor-thin Senate race with incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson, have claimed that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes committed fraud without presenting any evidence. Trump has echoed those claims on Twitter.\n\nState monitors and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement say there are no indications of fraud in the county\u2019s vote.\n\nYet, Snipes, a Democrat, remains a target for the GOP, including former Gov. Jeb Bush, who appointed her to the post in 2003 when the previous supervisor was accused of malfeasance and now says Snipes should be removed. Snipes has been re-elected since then, and is unapologetic about her record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked here for about 15 years, and I have to say this the first time that this office or I have been under such attacks,\u201d Snipes told reporters Monday. \u201cThere have been issues that haven\u2019t gone the way we wanted it. You can call it a mistake or you can call it whatever you want to call it.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Snipes hinted to reporters that she might not run for re-election in 2020 \u2014 \u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d she said \u2014 but quickly added that no final decision has been made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll check with my family and they\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Snipes has been in office, there seems to be a long list of these mistakes.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, a judge ruled she broke election law by destroying ballots in a 2016 congressional primary race involving Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz without waiting the required 22 months. Also in 2016, a medical marijuana amendment didn\u2019t appear on some Broward ballots, and again that year results from primary elections were posted on the office\u2019s website before polls had closed.\n\nA week after the 2012 election, about 1,000 uncounted ballots were suddenly discovered. And in 2004, about 58,000 mail-in ballots were not delivered, requiring workers to hurry to replace them.\n\nJust last week, a judge found that Snipes had violated Florida open records laws by failing to quickly provide voting records to attorneys for Scott\u2019s Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not a case about counting votes. This is a simple case about access to information that the supervisor of elections was required to have and required to provide,\u201d said Scott lawyer Jordan Zimmerman. \u201cThis is simply public information the public is entitled to.\u201d\n\nSnipes, 68, a native of Talladega, Alabama, moved to Broward County in 1964 to begin what became a long career as an educator. She eventually rose to become an area director in the public school system, leading principals from 16 schools, according to the supervisor\u2019s office web site.\n\nIn 2003 Bush appointed her to the supervisor\u2019s position after her predecessor, Miriam Oliphant, was removed from office because of numerous problems in the 2002 primary election.\n\nNow Bush is calling for Snipes to be removed after the ongoing recount .\n\nScott has not commented on whether he would take such a step. However, in his nearly eight years as governor, Scott has only suspended or removed elected officials when they are charged with crimes.\n\nSnipes remains a target of Trump and other Republicans, including a cadre of protesters who have sometimes broken into chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d mainly because of their claims she is trying to tilt the elections for Senate and governor to the Democrats. Scott has a slim lead over Nelson and Republican Ron DeSantis is ahead of Democrat Andrew Gillum for governor.\n\nElections experts, however, say it\u2019s not unusual for contested or provisional votes in \u201cblue\u201d Democratic counties like Broward to mainly support that party.\n\n\u201cIt is no surprise that Democrats gain votes later in the counting process in part because big cities tend to contain lots of Democratic votes, and given their population, cities take much longer to count,\u201d said Richard Hasen, law professor at the University of California-Irvine and author of books on election controversies, in an opinion article Monday in Slate.\n\n\u201cAlthough nerve-wracking, there\u2019s nothing at all nefarious about any of this protracted counting,\u201d he added.\n\nSnipes\u2019 attorney, Eugene Pettis, said \u201cpeople are going to scream fraud no matter what\u201d and that the Broward process is moving forward in an orderly fashion. Snipes insists Broward will meet the Thursday deadline for all votes to be sent to the State Department.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to go through those ballots. It should not be missed on anyone that state law permits until 12 o\u2019clock four days after the election to submit your preliminary results.

The ethics law prohibits officials from using their office for personal financial gain and from soliciting or receiving money or other things of value.\n\nGlenn was appointed in August 2017 as administrator of the EPA\u2019s regional office in Atlanta, which oversees eight Southeastern states.

Warren)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 As Amazon turns its attention to setting up new homes in Long Island City, New York and Arlington, Virginia, experts and historians in Seattle say both places can expect a delicate relationship with the world\u2019s hottest online retailer.\n\nThe communities will be subject to outsized influence from a company used to getting what it wants and unfazed by blame, fairly or not, for widespread changes all around.\n\nJust look to the Pacific Northwest, where both Amazon and Seattle have transformed dramatically together and sometimes at odds over the past 24 years, prompting resentment among a certain crowd of wistful \u201cmossback\u201d natives.\n\nBut there is a key difference.\n\nThe New York city and DC-area picks allow the company to strategically sidestep and diffuse many of the growing pains Amazon has been accused of inflicting on its Seattle hometown. That\u2019s because the pending moves will shift Amazon from the \u201cMVP\u201d employer role it plays here, to a mere \u201cVIP\u201d employer position in two of America\u2019s largest, most robust locales.\n\nA Fitch Ratings analysis notes that 25,000 Amazon jobs would amount to less than 1 percent of the labor force in either New York\u2019s or DC\u2019s metropolitan statistical area. Both also already have a large concentration of personal incomes in the six-figure bracket.\n\nIn Seattle, Amazon\u2019s workforce has grown from 5,000 to 45,000 employees since 2010, while its physical footprint in the downtown core grew from 1 million to 8 million square feet today.\n\nMatthew Gardner, chief economist with the Windermere Real Estate company in Seattle, estimates that Amazon\u2019s crew of highly-educated, well-paid techies makes up about 15 percent of downtown Seattle\u2019s total workers.\n\nAmazon says it spent $4 billion developing its Seattle home after claiming the once-sleepy South Lake Union warehouse district that\u2019s unofficially rebranded \u201cAmazonia\u201d because of the company\u2019s 44-building (and counting) development spree.\n\nThe company says it has infused $38 billion into the city\u2019s economy between 2010 and 2016.\n\nThe downtown core today is a bustling employment center that is complemented with extra bus routes subsidized by Amazon, which claims half of its employees walk, bike or take public transit to work.\n\nThe area is also buoyed by blue-badged Amazon workers having lunch in small local eateries and food trucks outside. The Downtown Seattle Association said more than 2,000 small businesses have opened in downtown Seattle since Amazon showed up.\n\nThat\u2019s also meant a steady blockade of construction work in pockets of downtown, which also coincides with major traffic congestion caused by two long-overdue public transportation projects on Interstate 5 and Highway 99. Critics also lament Seattle\u2019s metamorphosis from a modest blue-collar region fueled by timber, fishing and factory jobs, to the city\u2019s status as a star tech hub that was cemented by Amazon and then drew Facebook and Google to set up key outposts here.\n\nSeattle\u2019s new concentration of highly-educated, well-paid techies infused in a post-Great Recession era has contributed to a vicious housing market. As a majority of them are young and single renters, Gardner said average city rents have increased by more than 70 percent since 2010, to nearly $2,000 a month. Meanwhile, the average cost of a single-family house has increased by nearly 90 percent to an average price of $844,000.\n\nThe tension around Amazon\u2019s growth hit a peak this year as the city struggled to address its homelessness crisis. Amazon successfully fought a proposed city tax that would have helped fund more services. Local officials quickly bowed down to the city\u2019s top employer after Amazon threatened to pull development projects. The bitter battle further bruised CEO and founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 \u201ccorporate citizen\u201d reputation and also overshadowed the growing, though relatively small portfolio of philanthropy Amazon has done in the city for homelessness.\n\nFor the first two decades in existence, Amazon.com\u2019s business blossomed quietly in Seattle, starting as a literary dot-com darling and expanding into the \u201cEverything Store.\u201d In fact, Amazon in 1994 was warmly embraced by a city proud of its innovative legacy tied to Boeing and Microsoft, but also committed to being an affordable, creative enclave out West.\n\nIt\u2019s in the last five years that the acceleration of change has been so intense that the growing pains between Amazon and Seattle have been stark and visceral.\n\nKnute Berger, a longtime Seattle columnist who has chronicled the city from a native perspective, recalls the days when Amazon hired local journalists and writers to produce high-quality content to help sell books on its platform. But Amazon\u2019s widespread success was later seen as a threat on traditional bookstores and print publishing on the whole.\n\n\u201cAt some point, they crossed the line from being a creative dot-com to \u2018The Man,\u2019\u201d Berger said.\n\nWith all of this in the rearview and looking forward to its new headquarter cities, Margaret O\u2019Mara, a tech industry historian and University of Washington professor, said there\u2019s an opportunity for an Amazon fresh start. She urged the company to forge a new path as a community-conscious tech giant who will support local taxes as needed.\n\n\u201cBuilding a neighborhood that\u2019s a really great place to be a tech employee but not built for anyone else, from a city\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not the kind of sustainable development you want to have,\u201d O\u2019Mara said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sally Ho on Twitter: https://twitter.com/_SallyHo", "1 of 14 This cover image released by Harper Design shows \"Hindsight & All the Things I Can't See in Front of Me,\" by Justin Timberlake.

On Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, San Francisco-based Juul Labs Inc. announced it had stopped filling orders for its mango, fruit, creme and cucumber pods but not menthol and mint. It will sell all flavors through its website and limit sales to those 21 and older. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s leading e-cigarette maker is halting store sales of some flavors to deter use by kids.\n\nThe move by Juul Labs Inc. comes ahead of an expected U.S. government crackdown on underage sales of flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nJuul said it stopped filling store orders Tuesday for mango, fruit, creme and cucumber pods and will resume sales only to retailers that scan IDs and take other steps to verify a buyer is at least 21. It said it will continue to sell menthol and mint at stores, and sell all flavors through its website.\n\nThe company also said it would close its Facebook and Instagram social media accounts, and pledged other steps to make it clear that it doesn\u2019t want kids using its e-cigarettes.\n\nIts products are meant to help adult smokers quit regular cigarettes, CEO Kevin Burns said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone who doesn\u2019t smoke, or already use nicotine, to use Juul products,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want youth using the product. It is bad for public health and it is bad for our mission.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that turn liquid often containing nicotine into an inhalable vapor. They\u2019re generally considered a less dangerous alternative to regular cigarettes, but health officials have warned nicotine is harmful to developing brains.\n\nSome vaping products come in flavors with names like bubble gum and cotton candy, leading to criticism that the industry is marketing e-cigarettes to children.\n\nJuul e-cigarettes first went on sale in 2015. The devices look like computer flash drives, can be recharged in computer USB ports and have prefilled cartridges containing nicotine. A starter kit with the device, charger and pods costs about $50 on the company\u2019s website.\n\nLast year, Juul became the top-selling U.S. brand of e-cigarette. That\u2019s due at least partly to aggressive marketing through Instagram and other social media that many kids see, some researchers say. University of Pittsburgh researchers estimate that a quarter of the followers of Juul\u2019s Twitter account are underage.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans sales of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18. Some states restrict sales to 21 and older.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb responded to Juul\u2019s announcement via Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned about the epidemic of youth use of e-cigs,\u201d he said. \u201cVoluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps #FDA will soon take. But we want to recognize actions by JUUL today and urge all manufacturers to immediately implement steps to start reversing these trends.\u201d\n\nLast week, an FDA official said the agency plans to bar stores and gas stations from selling most flavored e-cigarettes, but not menthol. It also plans to require online retailers to verify ages, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, explaining that the details were not final.\n\nJuul said it will keep selling mint and menthol in stores because those flavors mirror what is in traditional cigarettes. For sales on its website, the company said it is beefing up age checks, requiring the buyer to give the last four digits of their Social Security number or upload a government ID.\n\nVaping products have grown into a $4 billion market in the U.S. However, there\u2019s been little research on their long-term effects and debate persists about how helpful they are in helping smokers quit or avoid cigarettes\n\nThe FDA has been targeting the San Francisco-based Juul. In April, the agency issued warnings to retailers about sales to children. The FDA also asked Juul Labs to turn over documents about the devices\u2019 design and marketing, and in September made an unannounced visit to Juul headquarters to look for evidence.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Juul. Last month, the FDA sent letters to 21 other e-cigarette companies seeking information that might help the agency determine if those companies have been marketing products illegally.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

He allegedly left for Canada after he was indicted in California in 2001 for a fraud scheme involving identity theft and illegal access devices.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nick Chase said in court documents that Adeyemo \u201cdesigned and executed his deception so that he could pose as a more sympathetic person\u201d at sentencing, including keeping the pending California charges under wraps. Chase said the defendant lied about his age and portrayed himself as a \u201cmuch younger and less sophisticated criminal.\u201d\n\nAdeyemo is charged with four counts of obstruction of justice. He faces an additional 10 years in prison on top of the original sentence, which he is serving in Oakdale, Louisiana.\n\nDOUBLE JEOPARDY\n\nRonald Hettich, the defendant\u2019s lawyer, said in court documents that prosecutors are retrying the original case, which constitutes double jeopardy or trying someone twice for the same crime.\n\n\u201cMore than anything else, this case is about the government wanting a second bite at the apple,\u201d Hettich wrote. \u201cThe prosecutor, unhappy with the sentence Judge Erickson imposed, had to search for new charges in order to obtain the length of the season he wanted in the underlying case.\u201d\n\nHettich said both Adekunle Adetiloye and Michael Adeyemo were names given to the defendant \u201cin his Nigerian culture\u201d and he has never made a false statement regarding his name.\n\nHIGH-TECH BANK ROBBERY\n\nInvestigators say the fraud case was one of the largest credit card schemes in U.S. history and that Adetiloye was the mastermind behind a plot to steal the identities of 38,000 people and bilk dozens of banks out of millions of dollars. After lawyers argued for a couple of years over the amount of losses, a federal judge ordered Adekunle Adetiloye to pay about $1.5 million in restitution and forfeiture.\n\nAdetiloye was convicted of incorporating two different companies that claimed to be debt collection companies. He gained access to commercial data providers \u2014 including large-scale outfits LexisNexis and ChoicePoint \u2014 that only allow access to law enforcement, financial services and debt collection companies.\n\nProsecutors described it as high-tech bank robbery.\n\nAdetiloye became a suspect when authorities tried to find out how someone who was unemployed and receiving welfare was living lavishly, complete with a Range Rover vehicle, extended trips to England and an expensive condominium.", "DURHAM, N.C.

Authorities announced Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, that the family of four has been arrested in the slayings of eight members of one family in rural Ohio two years ago. (Ohio Attorney General's office via AP)\n\nWAVERLY, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Authorities arrested a family of four Tuesday in the gruesome 2016 slayings of eight people from another family in rural Ohio, a crime that prosecutors suggested stemmed from a custody dispute.\n\nThe announcement marked the culmination of a massive investigative effort that began after seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four separate homes in April 2016. The killings terrified local residents and spawned rumors that it was a drug hit.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the four on aggravated murder charges and they could be sentenced to death if convicted. DeWine gave scant detail about why the victims were killed, but he said the custody of a young child played a role. He added that the accused had carefully planned the murders for months.\n\n\u201cThere certainly was an obsession with custody, obsession with control of children,\u201d DeWine said.\n\nThose indicted were Edward \u201cJake\u201d Wagner, 26, his father George \u201cBilly\u201d Wagner III, 47; Billy Wagner\u2019s wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner and George Wagner, 27. The four lived near the scenes of the massacre about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus and had long been considered chief suspects, DeWine said.\n\n\u201cThey did this quickly, coldly, calmly, and very carefully. But not carefully enough,\u201d said Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader. \u201cThey left traces. They left a trail.\u201d\n\nThe victims were Jake Wagner\u2019s longtime former girlfriend, 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, who shared custody of their daughter, her parents, siblings and other relatives. Rhoden had been in bed with her newborn when she was killed. The baby wasn\u2019t hurt.\n\nA coroner said all but one of the victims was shot more than once, including two people shot five times and one shot nine times. Some also had bruising, consistent with the first 911 caller\u2019s description of two victims appearing to have been beaten.\n\n\u201cI just might tell you this is just the most bizarre story I\u2019ve ever seen in being involved in law enforcement,\u201d said DeWine, who was elected governor earlier this month.\n\nA lawyer for the Wagner family maintained their innocence.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\u201d the lawyer, John Clark, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe Wagners are also very hopeful that in the ensuing months there will be a thorough vetting of all the facts.\u201d\n\nDeWine and Reader said Tuesday that the Wagners studied the layouts of the victims\u2019 properties, as well as their habits, routines, sleeping locations and pets. The indictments accuse the Wagners of tampering with phones, cameras, a gun silencer, shell casings and parts of a home security system.\n\nDeWine said there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence\u201d anyone else was involved.\n\nInvestigators scrambling to determine who targeted the Rhoden family and why conducted over 130 interviews and processed over 100 pieces of evidence and 550 tips, with assistance from more than 20 law enforcement agencies. The last significant piece of evidence was collected Oct. 30, DeWine said.\n\nFirst mention of the suspects came in June of 2017, when authorities announced they were seeking information about the Wagners, including details on their personal and business interactions, and conversations people may have had with them.\n\nNone was named a suspect at the time. Investigators also said they had searched property in southern Ohio sold by the Wagners.\n\nBoth Jake Wagner and Angela Wagner told the Cincinnati Enquirer that they were not involved in the April 2016 killings. Angela Wagner said what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden had been like a daughter to her. She said that her husband, Billy, and Christopher Rhoden Sr., one of the victims, had been more like brothers than friends.\n\nThe Wagner family lived in Peebles, Ohio, at the time of the killings but later moved to Alaska, returning in the spring.\n\nPike County Prosecutor Rob Junk cautioned that the case could last several years, and it\u2019s possible the trial relocated because of the publicity.\n\n\u201cThis has been so long coming. Thank God!\u201d Verlina Jarrell, of Circleville, Ohio, co-administrator of a Facebook page about the \u201cPike County massacres\u201d with some 650 members, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe victims were 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \u201cFrankie\u201d Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Frankie Rhoden\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.\u2019s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden. Hanna Rhoden\u2019s days-old baby girl, another baby and a young child were unharmed.\n\nAuthorities said marijuana growing operations were found at three of the four crime scenes. While that\u2019s not uncommon in this corner of Appalachia, it stoked rumors that the slayings were drug-related.\n\nDeWine said \u201cthere\u2019s an undercurrent of drugs\u201d in the case, but there\u2019s no evidence the killings were related to drugs. He wouldn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nPolice in Kentucky say the FBI tracked \u201cBilly\u201d Wagner to Lexington, where he was arrested without incident at around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday. Lexington police weren\u2019t sure if he had been living in the area.\n\nThe mothers of Angela Wagner and \u201cBilly\u201d Wagner also were arrested in Ohio and charged with misleading investigators.\n\nJake Wagner was also charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sexual contact with Rhoden when she was 15 years old and he was 20 years old, DeWine\u2019s office said.\n\n___\n\nWelsh-Huggins reported from Columbus.

J. Brian Bransfield, conference general secretary, at the USCCB's annual fall meeting, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Several Roman Catholic bishops on Tuesday urged colleagues at their national meeting to take some sort of action on the clergy sex abuse crisis despite a Vatican order to delay voting on key proposals.\n\nBishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois, suggested a nonbinding vote to convey a sense of the bishops\u2019 aspirations regarding anti-abuse efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are not branch managers of the Vatican,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people are crying out for some action.\u201d\n\nBishop George Murry of Youngstown, Ohio, echoed Paprocki\u2019s call, saying parishioners and priests in his diocese are \u201cvery, very angry.\u201d\n\nThe three-day assembly opened Monday with a surprise announcement by Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. The Vatican, he said, was ordering the bishops to delay votes on two anti-abuse proposals until after a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February.\n\nDiNardo indicated there were two principal reasons for the Vatican order: to ensure that steps taken by the U.S. bishops would be in harmony with steps decided at the February meeting, and to provide more time for vetting aspects of the U.S. proposals that might conflict with church law.\n\nEven without the option of a formal vote this week, the U.S. bishops proceeded with discussion of the two key proposals. One would establish a new code of conduct of individual bishops; the other would create a nine-member special commission, including six lay experts and three members of the clergy, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nThe lay members would include experts in law enforcement, social work and psychology, as well as at least one survivor of clergy abuse, Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron said.\n\nHowever, the bishops are under pressure to take additional steps, as stressed in an address to the assembly Tuesday by Francesco Cesareo, chairman of the National Review Board, which the bishops created in 2002 to monitor the church\u2019s efforts to prevent clergy sex abuse.\n\n\u201cYour response to this crisis has been incomplete,\u201d said Cesareo, calling for more accountability. \u201cIt is shameful that the sin of abuse was hidden and allowed to fester until uncovered by the secular world.\u201d\n\nHe cited the grand jury report released in August in Pennsylvania. It detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in at least 11 other states have launched investigations.\n\n\u201cHow many souls have been lost because of this crisis?\u201d Cesareo said.\n\nHe urged all U.S. bishops to commit to conducting a thorough review of their dioceses\u2019 files, dating to at least 1950, and publicly sharing a list of any clergy who have been credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable adults.\n\nSome bishops had taken this step, he noted, and urged the others to follow suit.\n\nCesareo also endorsed the bishop conference\u2019s proposal for a thorough investigation of the scandal involving disgraced church leader Theodore McCarrick. Pope Francis removed McCarrick as a cardinal in July after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible.\n\nSubsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up McCarrick\u2019s misconduct.\n\nAt one point during the morning session, Bishop Shawn McKnight, of Jefferson City, Missouri, expressed dismay that the Vatican \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust us\u201d and asked Cesareo what the USCCB should do.\n\n\u201cDecisively act on this issue and continually move it forward,\u201d Cesareo replied. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t happen, I fear for the future of our church.\u201d\n\nAmong those attending the assembly was James Timlin, a retired Pennsylvania bishop who was faulted by the state grand jury for his handling of clergy sex abuse and barred from representing the diocese in public.\n\nAlso on hand was former Bishop Robert Finn, who once led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, and pleaded guilty to failing to report a suspected priestly child abuser. Pope Francis in 2015 accepted Finn\u2019s resignation, offered under the code of canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some \u201cgrave\u201d reason that makes them unfit for office.\n\nBishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vermont, said the USCCB didn\u2019t have the authority to ban any ordained bishop, active or retired, from attending the assembly.\n\nOutside the conference venue along Baltimore\u2019s waterfront, hundreds of people gathered in a protest rally organized by far-right Catholics, including the group Church Militant. Some held placards denouncing homosexuality in the priesthood, asserting that it was behind clergy sex abuse.\n\nUlana Campbell, of Wilmington, Delaware, was one of roughly 400 participants at the rally. She said the bishops appeared incapable of stopping clergy sex abuse.\n\n\u201cThese bishops are absolutely corrupted by power. I think the true church is going to have to go underground,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI am an angry Catholic, but I refuse to leave my faith.\u201d\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York.", "", "", "", "Auburn DE Nick Coe to miss game against Liberty with injury\n\nAUBURN, Ala.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The federal government recorded a deficit of $100.5 billion in October, a big increase from a year ago that was primarily caused by quirks in the calendar.\n\nThe Treasury Department said Tuesday that the deficit shot up 59 percent from the same month a year ago. Last year\u2019s October deficit was smaller because the government paid $48 billion in benefits in September because Oct. 1 fell on the weekend.\n\nThe government has run a deficit in every October going back to the early 1950s. The new report begins a budget year in which the federal deficit is expected to soar above $1 trillion, reflecting in part the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts Congress approved last December.\n\nIn its latest review this summer, the administration projected that the deficit would climb to $1.09 trillion this year and stay above $1 trillion for three straight years.\n\nThe only time the government has run deficits of this size was for four years from 2009 through 2012. Government revenues at the time were depressed by the worst recession since the 1930s. The US boosted spending to grapple with the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and provide benefit payments to millions of people who lost their jobs.\n\nThe huge deficits during that period triggered a substantial backlash, which led to government shutdowns as conservative Republicans battled the Obama administration in an effort to cut government spending. This time the outcry has not been as loud.\n\nRepublican lawmakers enthusiastically supported the 10-year $1.5 trillion tax cut approved last year. Democrats charged that most of the benefits went to corporations and wealthy individuals.\n\nWhile the deficits were not a major issue in most mid-term races this year, Trump has said that the new budget he will present to Congress next February will require 5 percent spending cuts for domestic agencies. Larry Kudlow, head of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, promised in a CNBC interview Tuesday that the administration would produce a \u201ctough budget\u201d for the new year.\n\nThe October report showed that among the biggest increases in spending from a year ago was in interest payments on the public debt, which totaled $32 billion, 30 percent more than a year ago.\n\nTotal outlays in October were $353.2 billion, up 18.3 percent from a year ago, a jump that was heavily influenced by the fact that Social Security and other benefits for October 2017 had been paid in September of last year.\n\nGovernment revenues totaled $252.7 billion, an increase of 7.3 percent from a year ago as a strong economy and low unemployment have offset some of the losses from the tax cuts.", "South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley, left, scrambles as he is pressured by the Florida defense during the first half of an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Gainesville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Every player on South Carolina\u2019s team knows the reason the Gamecocks went 4-4 in the Southeastern Conference and are still trying to become bowl eligible in mid-November \u2014 they have struggled to maintain momentum for an entire game.\n\nThe latest example was last week\u2019s loss to Florida, in which the Gamecocks blew a 17-point lead in the final 16 minutes. There were slow starts against Kentucky, going down 24-3 after the Wildcats first four drivers and versus Texas A&M, trailing 16-0 at half, that created problems an excellent second half couldn\u2019t solve.\n\nThe inconsistency leaves a team thought to be the most likely challenger to Georgia in the SEC East locked into fourth in the division with three games to go \u2014 all against nonconference teams.\n\nThe Gamecocks play Football Championship Subdivision Chattanooga on Saturday, perhaps the best shot at getting that sixth win to go to a bowl with No. 2 Clemson looming at the end of the month and a Dec. 1 game with Akron to make up for a game canceled because of Hurricane Florence.\n\n\u201cIf we go back and look at it, there are five or six plays where a better block here, or a throw or catch or whatever it may be \u2014 a little thing could have been the difference in the game,\u201d quarterback Jake Bentley said.\n\nChattanooga provides a relief from the grind of eight straight SEC games, only broken up by a bye week and an unexpected week off after the Sept. 15 game against Marshall was canceled by Hurricane Florence.\n\nSouth Carolina has only lost twice to FCS teams since 1990 \u2014 both times to The Citadel. Even with the 23-22 loss to the Bulldogs in 2015, the Gamecocks have averaged a 21-point win over their last dozen FCS opponents.\n\nThe Mocs will have their own motivation. At 6-4 and with their Southern Conference season over, they are likely on the outside of the 24-team FCS playoff bracket. But a win over South Carolina would be impossible for the playoff committee to ignore.\n\nAnd without a lot of pressure to win, Chattanooga defensive lineman Isaiah Mack said they can have fun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun game. Just pin your ears back and let\u2019s go play some ball. Try to get an upset really,\u201d Mack said.\n\nFor South Carolina, a stunning loss to Chattanooga would turn an uneasy year closer to a disaster. After Will Muschamp took the 3-9 team he inherited to six wins in 2016 and nine victories in 2017, this season the Gamecocks rise seems to have stalled, barring a stunning win to break Clemson\u2019s four-game winning streak in the is-state rivalry.\n\nBut Muschamp said he thinks the inconsistency is temporary. Players usually listen better after a loss and he saw a lot of improvement at Tuesday\u2019s morning practice.\n\nThe Florida game was unusual for Muschamp\u2019s three years at South Carolina. It was only his sixth loss in 23 games decided by seven points or fewer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really good in one score games. They understand those games are going to come down to probably three or four for five plays in the fourth quarter,\u201d Muschamp said. \u201cThe interesting part of that is you never know when they are going to come. We\u2019ve got to come out on top in those situations.\u201d\n\nBentley said the key for South Carolina this week is to quickly learn from the Florida mistakes, and not dwell on them, and ignore the huge in-state rivalry game at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cNot only can we not look ahead, we can\u2019t look behind,\u201d Bentley said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "KINGMAN, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson, File)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Markus Howard is quite the big shot at No. 24 Marquette.\n\nHe can rebound. He can find open teammates. He can draw extra attention from defenses simply by just being on the floor.\n\nAnd when he gets going at the 3-point line, the Golden Eagles can be tough to beat.\n\nThe junior sharpshooter is a big reason why Marquette returned to the Top 25 this week. It is the school\u2019s first appearance in the poll since 2013, and the first time in Steve Wojciechowski\u2019s five-year tenure as head coach.\n\nHoward was 10 of 16 from the field, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range, for 37 points in 28 minutes in a 92-59 win over Bethune-Cookman on Saturday.\n\nThat outing erased the memory of a subpar season opener, when Howard was 5 of 16 from the field, and just 2 of 12 from the 3-point line in a victory over UMBC . Howard finished with 15 points.\n\nSee, nothing to worry about.\n\n\u201cMarkus is an explosive offensive player,\u201d Wojciechowski said. \u201cI was never concerned about his shooting. He\u2019s a guy that with the law of averages, it\u2019s going to average out.\u201d\n\nHoward proved his marksmanship from the arc as a freshman, when he led the nation by shooting 54.7 percent, which was also a Marquette single-season record. He shot 40.4 percent from the 3-point line as a sophomore.\n\nThe accuracy is the result, in part, of hours of offseason workouts back home in Arizona.\n\n\u201cI try to work a lot more on pick-and-roll situations ... and trying to find my man,\u201d Howard said last month. \u201cI always incorporate the shooting parts as well.\u201d\n\nGood plan considering how much deeper that Marquette\u2019s roster seems to be this season.\n\nJoey Hauser and Brendan Bailey give added length and athleticism up front as freshmen. Joey Hauser\u2019s older brother, Sam, is a steady, do-everything forward who provides leadership. Sacar Anim and Jamal Cain provide athleticism on the wing. Emerging sophomore Theo John can muscle up in the paint.\n\nAdded depth has helped Marquette play better defense, too, after holding the first two opponents to a combined 26 percent shooting. Marquette was 326th out of 351 Division I schools last year in allowing opponents to shoot 47.8 percent.\n\nIf the Golden Eagles can play anything close to the level of defense that they\u2019ve played over the first week through the course of the season, they should return to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three years.\n\nSeveral key pieces on the team, including Howard and Sam Hauser, were on the team two years ago that lost in the first round of the NCAAs. They also have the experience of advancing to the NIT quarterfinals last year .\n\n\u201cThe strength of our team is our team. Everybody has to be ready,\u201d Wojciechowski said. \u201cAt any given moment at any given time, a guy can be a catalyst.\u201d\n\nMore often than not, Howard is still one of those players.\n\nHe took Big East Player of the Week honors for averaging 26.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists over the first two games. He has scored 30 points eight times in his career, the most for any Marquette player since 1963-64.\n\nThe Golden Eagles might need another all-around effort from Howard to pull out a win in a tough road game at Indiana on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always kind of been used to dealing with things being thrown at me in terms of the offensive end,\u201d Howard said. \u201cAs a player in my position, that only excites me more to able to dish to other guys, make sure they\u2019re getting their shots.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "FILE - In this July 5, 2018, file photo, eroded hills are shown in Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota.

(AP) \u2014 North Dakota\u2019s Health Department did not improperly discount its own concerns about pollution from a proposed oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park when it permitted the project earlier this year, attorneys for the agency and for the developer argue.\n\nThe department and Meridian Energy Group are asking a state judge to reject a challenge by environmental groups to an air quality permit that allowed the company to begin construction during the summer at the Davis Refinery site about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the state\u2019s top tourist attraction.\n\nThe department\u2019s decision to issue the permit in June essentially concluded that the refinery will be a minor source of pollution and won\u2019t negatively impact the park. Assistant Attorney General Margaret Olson in court documents filed Nov. 5 said the decision \u201cwas not made in haste,\u201d but after a two-year review that involved more than 1,000 hours of department staff time and more than 10,000 comments from the public.\n\n\u201cBecause of the public interest in the Davis Refinery and its proximity to Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the department conducted a more in-depth review than typically required,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMeridian maintains the Davis Refinery will be built with modern technology and will be the \u201cthe cleanest refinery on the planet.\u201d The company began site work in July.\n\nOpponents worry about pollution in the 30,000-acre (12,000-hectare) park that draws more than 700,000 visitors annually.\n\nThe National Parks Conservation Association, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council sued in July. The groups argue the Health Department initially had concerns about the amount of harmful pollutants the refinery might generate and assert that the agency didn\u2019t adequately explain its eventual conclusion that the refinery wouldn\u2019t be a major source of pollution.\n\n\u201cThe result here is that Meridian will be allowed to build a new petroleum refinery under unrealistic and unproven air pollution limits that Meridian will very likely not meet,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys Derrick Braaten and Scott Strand wrote.\n\nThe groups want state District Judge Dann Greenwood to vacate the permit and order the Health Department to either adequately explain its rationale or to launch a permit process for a major polluting refinery.\n\nThe state maintains its review process was more than adequate, and it also says Meridian provided information that eased initial concerns about refinery pollution. Once built, the plant will need to prove it can meet state and federal air quality standards, and compliance will be continually monitored.\n\nOlson and Meridian attorney Lawrence Bender both asked Greenwood to uphold the state\u2019s permit decision. The judge has scheduled a Dec. 12 hearing in Dickinson.\n\nA separate hearing before a state administrative law judge is scheduled Wednesday in Bismarck over a state permit Meridian needs to use underground water for the refinery. Neighboring landowners are challenging a recommendation from the state engineer to approve the request.\n\nThe Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council also sued in state court Friday over the decision last month by the state\u2019s Public Service Commission not to study the appropriateness of the refinery site. The two groups question an administrative law judge\u2019s conclusion that the commission doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction because the refinery will be too small to warrant review under state law.\n\n___\n\nFollow Blake Nicholson on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/NicholsonBlake", "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Gov.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. (AP) \u2014 A Delaware inmate charged in a deadly prison riot testified Tuesday that he did not assault or kill anyone, and that he was expecting inmates to stage a peaceful protest about prison conditions.\n\nJarreau Ayers, who is acting as his own attorney, took the stand to give his account of what happened during the February 2017 riot at Delaware\u2019s maximum-security prison, where a guard was killed and three other staffers taken hostage.\n\nAyers, 37, denied killing, assaulting or kidnapping anyone but said he accepted responsibility for his actions during the disturbance and would not try to point the finger at other inmates.\n\n\u201cI refuse to do it. I\u2019m not going to do it for a not-guilty verdict. I\u2019m not going to do it for anything,\u201d he told jurors.\n\nAyers, who is serving life in prison for murder, is one of three inmates being tried on murder, assault and kidnapping charges. They are among 17 inmates charged in the riot, 16 of whom are charged with murder in the death of Sgt. Steven Floyd. The others face trials over the next several months.\n\n\u201cSergeant Floyd shouldn\u2019t have died. I agree with that,\u201d Ayers said. \u201cBad things happen when you have good intentions.\u201d\n\nAyers told jurors that he knew something was going to happen at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna but didn\u2019t know exactly what. He said he was in the recreation yard when inmates inside a building staged the takeover, recalling that he felt frustrated when he realized what was happening because he expected inmates to stand together in the yard in a show of solidarity.\n\n\u201cThey chose for me not to be part of that situation. That was a decision they made that I still take issue with at times,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the weeks and months leading up to the riot, inmates had staged peaceful protests over issues such as phone and shower time, said Ayers, who acknowledged talking to another inmate, convicted murderer Royal Downs, about a similar protest. Refusing to come in from the recreation yard or staying on the prison tier and refusing to lock into their cells were two options to get the attention of prison administrators, he suggested.\n\nA review ordered by Democratic Gov. John Carney after the riot found that Department of Correction officials\u2019 dismissal of warnings about trouble brewing was indicative of an overcrowded, understaffed facility plagued by mismanagement, poor communication, a culture of negativity, and adversarial relationships among prison staff, administrators and inmates.\n\nSince the riot, state officials have devoted millions of dollars to security upgrades, staff training, improved programming for inmates and salary increases for correctional officers. Last week, they said hundreds of inmates would be transferred to Pennsylvania in an effort to reduce mandatory overtime in the severely understaffed guard ranks at Vaughn.\n\nCo-defendant Dwayne Staats, a convicted killer who is also serving life and representing himself, told jurors that he planned the uprising with the realization that it could be violent and recruited six other inmates to carry it out.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to do something to expose this place to where the public and the government would take notice. I say I got their attention,\u201d said Staats, 37. \u201cA lot of stuff wasn\u2019t being addressed until that happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get into a \u2018by any means\u2019 mode, sometimes you do what is necessary,\u201d Staats later explained under cross-examination.\n\nAt the same time, he denied assaulting anyone and said Floyd\u2019s death was not part of the plan.\n\n\u201cThe people that participated in the uprising, the takeover \u2014 the murder was something isolated from that. Somebody splintered off the takeover and turned it into a murder,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to Floyd being killed, two other correctional officers were beaten and tormented by inmates before being released. Hours later, response teams used a backhoe to breach a wall and rescue a female counselor who was still being held hostage. She was not injured.\n\nThe third defendant, Deric Forney, 29, denied any role in the uprising and said he did not find out until being questioned by an FBI agent afterward that Floyd had died. He recalled how he prayed when he realized response teams were breaching the building and got on the floor of his cell as a flash-bang grenade exploded near him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to get out alive,\u201d Forney said, breaking down in tears.\n\nForney, like many other inmates, said he was beaten by officers who stormed the building.\n\n\u201cThey came in, came in rough,\u201d he testified.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed two weeks ago on behalf of scores of inmates at the prison alleges that they were subjected to inhumane conditions and physical and verbal abuse both before and after the riot.\n\nClosing arguments in the criminal trial are scheduled for Thursday.", "Korver, Osman out for Cavs, now down 5 rotational players\n\nCleveland Cavaliers forward/center Tristan Thompson, left, battles for a loose ball against Chicago Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr., during the second half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Chicago.

(Nov. 13)\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \u201csome significant ethical concerns,\u201d the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA\u2019s counterterrorism team \u201cdid not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\u201d the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA\u2019s discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\u201cBut decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\u201d Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It\u2019s in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\n\u201cVersed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of \u2018mind-altering drugs\u2019 or those which \u2018profoundly altered the senses.\u2019\u201d\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \u201cAt the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services\u2019 review, informally termed \u2018Project Medication\u2019 was shelved, never to be reactivated,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report\u2019s release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \u201cdraft,\u201d was just one agency officer\u2019s impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA\u2019s or the Office of Medical Service\u2019s \u201cfinal official history, or assessment, of the program,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it\u2019s important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \u201chell of a lot worse.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \u201cnot support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\u201d\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2014 a practice called \u201cwalling\u201d \u2014 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \u201cwould compromise wound healing.\u201d Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\u201d Ladin said. \u201cBut it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors\u2019 participation.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the medical office\u2019s report said waterboarding was not \u201cintrinsically painful.\u201d It said there was \u201cphysical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\u201d but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \u201cof the pain of the restraining straps.\u201d\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate\u2019s 2014 report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \u201ccried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\u201d\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \u201clittle more than an amateurish experiment\u201d and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \u201cprovided periodic relief\u201d to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \u201creassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\u201d said Crosby, of Boston University\u2019s School of Medicine and Public Health. \u201cAt least one detainee was tortured to death.

(AP) \u2014 The New Hampshire chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of psychiatric patients being involuntarily held in hospital emergency departments.\n\nState law requires involuntary psychiatric patients to get probable cause hearings within three days of admission to determine whether they are a danger to themselves or others. Under the state\u2019s interpretation, the clock starts when someone is admitted to the state psychiatric hospital or other inpatient facility, but the lawsuit points to a Merrimack County court ruling that said the clock should start at the time of emergency room admission.\n\nThe lawsuit names the Department of Health and Human Services and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center as defendants. The lead plaintiff is a 26-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency room at the Nashua hospital on Nov. 5 after a suicide attempt and was held involuntarily without a hearing for nearly a week until his status was changed to voluntary. The lawsuit was filed Saturday, before his status was changed.\n\n\u201cWhen someone is indefinitely detained against their will without due process, wishes to see their children, and is worried about the financial security of one\u2019s family, such frustration should be sympathized with, especially when the person is kept in a secluded, windowless room,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cHere, Plaintiff is desperate to get back to his family and his work. His family needs him. He is entitled to make that case to a Circuit Court judge.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Southern New Hampshire Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The Department of Health and Human Services referred questions to the attorney general\u2019s office, which did not immediately respond.\n\nThe lawsuit highlights a problem the state has struggled with for years. A report released Tuesday by the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Health Association notes that the number of adults waiting for inpatient beds has steadily increased since 2015, peaking at a one-day high of 71 adults and 27 children. Aside from a few inmates, they are all waiting in emergency rooms and most, if not all, are deemed to be held involuntarily because the state psychiatric hospital does not accept voluntary admissions, said Ken Norton, executive director of the New Hampshire chapter National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nHe welcomed the lawsuit as a necessary step to what he called the \u201csystemic discrimination\u201d against people with mental illness and said he hopes it will spur a solution to a situation he has long deemed medically, legally, ethically, morally and economically wrong.\n\n\u201cNone of us want to see people released on a legal technicality, but all other remedies have been attempted, including really good-faith efforts by the commissioner, by the Legislature, by the governor, and all ultimately failed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do think this will draw further attention to the current mental health boarding crisis.\u201d\n\nA sweeping bill to reform the state\u2019s mental health system last year included a provision requiring the development of a plan to ensure timely hearings for patients held involuntarily in emergency rooms. But a planned pilot program involving four hospitals was scrapped in part due to safety concerns about essentially setting up mini courtrooms in hospitals.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court, asks that the state\u2019s practice of denying due process to such patients be deemed unconstitutional. But Gilles Bissonnette, the ACLU attorney, said he hopes it will also prompt policy makers to take action to address the wider problem.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a symptom, not the disease. The due process issue is a symptom, the disease is really the underlying waitlist,\u201d he said.\n\nMobile crisis response teams helped 5,052 people avoid emergency room admissions in 2017, according to the report from the Community Behavioral Health Association. But such teams are based only in Concord, Manchester and Nashua, leaving large areas of the state uncovered.\n\nPeter Evers, CEO of Riverbend Community Mental Health Center, said he hopes those teams will be expanded, but also believes the state should consider increasing the number of inpatient beds.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask the question, does New Hampshire really have the appropriate services for people with serious mental illness?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really having a proper conversation about the whole continuum of care until we understand that some people need a longer stay in a hospital.\u201d", "Congressional District 2 Republican candidate Yvette Herrell talks to supporters at the Republican Party of Otero County watch party in Alamogordo, N.M., Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018.

Many migrants say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Did someone say caravan?\n\nOne week after Election Day, President Donald Trump\u2019s daily drumbeat of warnings about a caravan of \u201cbad thugs\u201d and potential terrorists intent on invading the U.S. from Mexico has largely fallen silent.\n\nThe migrant caravans are still trudging along, the largest still about 1,000 miles from the southern border, but Trump \u2014 and many in the conservative media \u2014 have dramatically reduced the frequency and intensity of their dire warnings now that they no longer feel the same urgency to stir up GOP voters.\n\nTrump and his media allies have largely moved on: They\u2019re more focused now on the possibility of electoral chicanery in recounts in the Florida Senate and governor\u2019s races.\n\nWithin the West Wing and in Trump\u2019s orbit of allies, there is a sense that the caravan was a useful midterm messaging tool, one that became the centerpiece of an eleventh-hour pre-election strategy modeled on the president\u2019s 2016 campaign pledges to crack down on illegal immigration, according to four White House officials and outside advisers not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.\n\nBut once the election was over, the president\u2019s attention turned elsewhere, the officials and advisers said.\n\nFor weeks before the election, the caravan was a dominant news story. The largest caravan was believed to have formed in Honduras on Oct. 12 and first was featured in a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment four days later, which prompted a tweet from the show\u2019s most famous fan.\n\nAs the midterms approached, Trump and his conservative allies flooded the zone with harsh rhetoric and hardline policy proposals, including sending troops to the border, revoking birthright citizenship and an ad featuring a Latino man convicted of killing two police officers that was widely condemned as racist.\n\nBut the caravan was Trump\u2019s favorite talking point. During his final blitz of campaign rallies, he hammered at the threat night after night and, without evidence, suggested that Democrats were supporting \u2014 and perhaps funding \u2014 the march of migrants.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities,\u201d Trump said in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, on election eve. \u201cIf you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow. ... If you want strong borders and safe communities, no drugs, no caravans, vote Republican.\u201d\n\nTrump ratcheted up his rhetoric on Twitter too. One tweet read: \u201cWe will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!\u201d\n\nThat tweet, on Oct. 31, was his last on the subject. Since the election, he\u2019s invoked the caravan only once. Asked about it during a news conference last Wednesday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about the caravans\u201d when talking about militarizing the southern border and his proposed wall.\n\nThe thousands of Central American migrants in the largest caravan have been leapfrogging their way across western Mexico, despite the prospect of a hostile reception at the border. Most appeared intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles (2,200 kilometers) away.\n\nOn Friday, Trump signed a proclamation restricting asylum applications but did so with little fanfare and no press coverage before he departed for a trip to Paris. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether further action on immigration was imminent.\n\n\u201cClearly, this was an election-eve stunt designed to whip up the base that really didn\u2019t have much foundation in fact and, clearly, when the election was over there was no need to keep beating those drums,\u201d said Mark Feldstein, journalism professor at the University of Maryland. He added that what the conservative media did with the story was \u201creally toxic\u201d and divided an already polarized country.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that they dropped it so suddenly is just further confirmation of how bogus the story was in the first place,\u201d Feldstein said.\n\nFox News spent more than 33 hours discussing the caravan through Election Day, according to a study by Media Matters, a progressive media watchdog organization. On Nov. 7, the day after the election, Fox had no discussions centered on the caravan. On Nov. 8, the network spent four minutes and 57 seconds on discussions centered on the caravan, according to the study.\n\nSome Republicans said the caravan\u2019s fade from the spotlight was a natural part of the election cycle.\n\n\u201cEvery election, there are a series of issues that rise to artificial highs and then, once the votes are cast, settle back down to normal noise,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. \u201cBoth parties do it; this isn\u2019t some trumped up phony issue. The caravan will be back in the news once it gets closer to the border.\u201d\n\nTrump had suggested sending up to 15,000 troops to the border; currently there are approximately 1,000 at the border itself and another 4,800 in staging areas nearby. The deployment is scheduled to end Dec. 15 but that could be changed, extended or shortened.\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis plans to visit the border Wednesday. He was asked by a reporter Tuesday whether the military mission along the border of south Texas will change, now that the lead migrant caravan in Mexico is headed much farther west.\n\n\u201cRight now, the mission is exactly what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what the future holds. But right now that\u2019s the only mission I have.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from New York.

(AP) \u2014 Federal prosecutors in Vermont have closed their investigation into a college land deal involving the wife of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and decided not to charge her, a spokesman for the couple said Tuesday.\n\nJane Sanders was informed by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office that she would not be charged, Sanders spokesman Jeff Weaver said.\n\nJane Sanders is grateful the investigation is over.\n\n\u201cAs she has said from the beginning, she has done nothing wrong and Jane is pleased that the matter has now come to a conclusion,\u201d Weaver said in an email.\n\nU.S. attorney\u2019s office spokesman Kraig LaPorte said he could not deny or confirm that an investigation took place.\n\nFederal investigators had been looking into the finances behind a real estate deal for the now defunct Burlington College, where Jane Sanders served as president from 2004 to 2011.\n\nIn 2010, she had worked out a $10 million deal for the college to buy 32 acres of waterfront land in Burlington on Lake Champlain and a 77,000-square-foot former orphanage and administrative offices of Vermont\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, which needed the money to settle a series of priest sex abuse cases.\n\nJane Sanders, a longtime political adviser to her husband, promised at the time that the deal would be paid for with increases in enrollment and about $2.7 million in donations. She left the school a year later. The enrollment increase and the promised donations didn\u2019t happen and by 2014, the college had about $11 million debt. It sold much of the waterfront land and closed in 2016, with officials citing debt from the land deal as a major reason.\n\nWeaver has said the allegations were politically motivated attacks. The initial complaint was filed in early 2016 by attorney Brady Toensing, who served as the Vermont campaign chairman for Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run.\n\nToensing sent a letter to federal authorities alleging that in 2010 Jane Sanders made fraudulent claims while seeking $10 million in financing for the real estate deal.\n\nToensing released a written statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame Burlington College Students, the Catholic Diocese, hard-working Vermont tradesmen, and others lost so much as a result of Ms. Sanders\u2019s misconduct, but I am pleased that the matter was professionally investigated and assessed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCriminal standards are extremely high, but now that the investigation is over, I look forward to a full explanation from Senator Sanders and his wife about the financial discrepancies in her loan application and the Senator\u2019s involvement in procuring the loan.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of the investigation does not make a difference to Bernie Sanders\u2019 political career, retired Middlebury College Political Science Professor Eric Davis said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most popular people in Vermont and the end of this investigation is certainly not going to change that,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Wilson Ring contributed to this report.", "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Phoenix police say two of four teenagers in a sedan driven by a 14-year-old boy suffered injuries not considered life threatening when one of two people in a passing car shot at the sedan.\n\nPolice Sgt.

The Le'Veon Bell watch is almost over for the Steelers. The star running back has until 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, afternoon to sign his one-year franchise tender and be eligible to play this season. (AP Photo/Michael Wyke, FIle)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Le\u2019Veon Bell\u2019s patience on the football field sets him apart.\n\nIn a game built on chaos, the star running back rarely hurries or makes hasty decisions.\n\nHis ability to put his hand on the back of an offensive lineman while waiting for the hole to open \u2014 much like a child sticking close to a parent in a crowded store \u2014 helps him make the remarkably difficult at times look remarkably easy.\n\nHis career at a crossroads partly of his own making, Bell will have to rely on that patience now more than ever after the two-time All-Pro declined to sign his one-year, $14.4 million franchise tender with the Pittsburgh Steelers by Tuesday\u2019s deadline, making him ineligible to play for the AFC North leaders or anyone else this season.\n\nThe unprecedented move sets Bell up for the potentially big-time payday he has long been searching when he becomes a free agent in the spring, provided there\u2019s a team willing to splurge on one of the league\u2019s more talented if mercurial players.\n\nWhile TV cameras set up outside the team\u2019s practice facility on Tuesday to catch Bell if he decided to show up for work for the first time in nearly 10 months, the 26-year-old never pulled up to the gates, ending \u2014 for now \u2014 one of the more unusual labor standoffs between a team and a player in the era of free agency.\n\nPittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin seemed resigned to Bell\u2019s decision shortly before the 4 p.m. deadline, saying simply \u201cso be it\u201d when asked about the possibility of Bell not returning to the team that selected him in the second round of the 2013 draft and helped mold him into one of the league\u2019s most dynamic threats.\n\n\u201cEven when we don\u2019t understand it, we\u2019re sensitive to it, so we\u2019re not shocked when things happen from a business standpoint, no,\u201d Tomlin said.\n\nThe Steelers (6-2-1), who have won five straight to sprint to the top of the division heading into a visit to Jacksonville on Sunday, will turn to second-year back James Conner and reserves Stevan Ridley and rookie Jaylen Samuels to help shoulder the load with Bell out of the picture.\n\nConner, third in the NFL with 771 yards rushing, remained in the concussion protocol on Tuesday after leaving last Thursday\u2019s blowout win against Carolina but could practice as early as Wednesday.\n\nAll season Tomlin stressed he was focused on the players in the locker room and not the ones outside it. He hardly seemed bothered by the idea of Pittsburgh\u2019s quest for a postseason berth continuing without Bell.\n\n\u201cThat train has left the station,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re comfortable with how we function, the people at our disposal, the division of labor and our ability to ready ourselves for the challenges.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers drafted Bell with the 48th overall pick five years ago, won over by his youth, size and versatility. Along with wide receiver Antonio Brown, Bell became the linchpin in which the Steelers rebuilt themselves on the fly as the franchise\u2019s identity shifted from away from the defense that fueled three Super Bowl appearances in six years from 2005-2010 toward an offense that ranked among the most explosive in the league.\n\nThe makeover relied heavily on Bell, whose patient running style became his trademark while helping Pittsburgh to four straight playoff berths.\n\nBell is one of only three players in recent NFL history to be franchise tagged in consecutive seasons. The first two \u2014 linebacker Karlos Dansby and quarterback Kirk Cousins \u2014 played all 16 games during their second seasons under the tag then went and cashed in elsewhere in free agency.\n\nAs his profile rose, Bell insisted he wasn\u2019t merely a running back, pointing to his success as a receiver \u2014 he finished 10th in the league with 85 catches in 2017 \u2014 as proof that he should be paid far above his peers.\n\nWhen Bell and the Steelers failed to reach an agreement on a new deal last summer, he said \u201cboth sides worked extremely hard\u201d in an attempt to get something done. When it didn\u2019t happen, he skipped training camp again, just as he did in 2017. His teammates stressed it was no big deal, confident Bell would show up in time for the regular-season opener.\n\nOnly he didn\u2019t. And when preparations for Pittsburgh\u2019s Week 1 trip to Cleveland began without Bell, several Steelers \u2014 particularly the offensive line \u2014 vented their frustrations publicly.\n\nThe anger eased as the weeks passed and Conner thrived in Bell\u2019s absence while Bell remained in Florida, where encounters captured on social media found him riding a Jet Ski or hitting the club. He returned to Pittsburgh last week and even played some pickup basketball at a fitness center.\n\nIt\u2019s as close to breaking a sweat with the Steelers as Bell will get.\n\nThough the team could use the franchise or transition tag on Bell next spring, it\u2019s more likely he\u2019ll just walk away.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "File - In this Aug. 28, 2018 file photo, Clark County Commission member and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak and Kathy Ong meet others at an event in Las Vegas.

Experts say the seemingly endless series of devastating wildfires in recent years has increased costs and limited the available pool of workers needed to rebuild.\n\nHomeowners can also find themselves confused by the insurance system and even underinsured, leaving them to bear more of the costs of rebuilding than they might have expected.\n\nBlazes have been so frequent that the state government recently passed a spate of laws intended to help victims of wildfires, but experts say it can still sometimes take years for a home to be rebuilt.\n\nCalifornia is currently fighting three fires \u2014 the Camp Fire in the northern part of the state and the Woolsey and Hill fires just outside of Los Angeles in the south. Statewide, thousands of people have been evacuated, more than 225,000 acres have burned and 44 people have died.\n\nThe Camp Fire is now deemed the most deadly in the state\u2019s history \u2014 killing at least 42 people and burning more than 125,000 acres. That follows this summer\u2019s Mendocino Complex fire, which burned more than 459,000 acres and led to more than $56 million in insured losses, and a particularly brutal fire season in 2017.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody\u2019s on Monday estimated that insured losses for the three current fires will be between $3 billion and $6 billion. The staggering price tag is due in part to the size of the fires but also the costs of rebuilding \u2014 both materials and labor.\n\nDan Dunmoyer, president and CEO of the California Building Industry Association, said builders were having trouble finding enough workers prior to the fires because of high demand for housing in the state. The spate of fires has only worsened the problem and that adds to the delay for consumers.\n\n\u201cIf your home burns down by itself, you have no problem rebuilding, but if it burns down with 2,000 others, you have to wait,\u201d Dunmoyer said.\n\nHomeowners also sometimes find themselves struggling to navigate the insurance system.\n\nUnited Policyholders, a nonprofit that aims to help consumers with insurance issues, said that it regularly hears from policyholders struggling with their insurer following a disaster. Policies may not have been updated in some time or estimates of rebuilding costs were too low, so homeowners find themselves on the hook for large expenses. The group estimates, based on polls of communities affected by disasters, that roughly two-thirds of insured households are underinsured. Or, they simply are struggling to jump through the hoops.\n\n\u201cThe insurance piece really gets people because they felt like it was the rug getting pulled out from under them,\u201d said Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders. \u201cOK, I lost everything, but at least I have insurance. But then insurance is a fight.\u201d\n\nWhile it can be a smooth process for some, others feel like \u201cmother nature just took my house, now insurance took my sanity,\u201d she said.\n\nThe process became so problematic that a series of laws were passed to help protect homeowners.\n\nUnder the new rules, homeowners have three years to rebuild and a six-month extension if the delays are out of their control. Insurance companies must also now provide an updated cost for rebuilding every time a policyholder renews, to help prevent the sticker shock some victims suffered. Other changes allow more time to sue their insurer following a declared disaster, given that it now takes longer to rebuild.\n\nAll the same, Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones has expressed disappointment the state couldn\u2019t do more. Californians are still able to find property and casualty insurance, although Jones has previously warned that the increasing number and severity of wildfires will limit availability and increase costs in the future.", "COLUMBIA, S.C.

Fortunately, the disease remains rare: This year, there have been 90 cases spread among 27 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what\u2019s causing some children to lose the ability to move their face, neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms tend to occur about a week after the children had a fever and respiratory illness.\n\nHealth officials call the condition acute flaccid myelitis. No one has died from it this year, but CDC officials say at least half the patients do not recover from the paralysis and some have serious complications.\n\nPolio and West Nile virus have been ruled out. Doctors have suspected the cause might be some kind of enterovirus, which in most people causes cold symptoms. But CDC officials say that\u2019s not clear.\n\nThe first mysterious wave of paralysis cases in 2014 coincided with a wider spike in illnesses connected to an enterovirus called EV-D68, CDC officials said. But there was no such spike during the waves in 2016 or this year.\n\nThere\u2019s also a lack of clinical evidence: CDC officials have checked the spinal fluid of about three-quarters of the 90 patients, and found EV-68 in only one. Another type of enterovirus called EV-A71 was found in only one other patient.\n\nBut there are questions about that, too. If a virus is the cause, it\u2019s possible the test is not good enough, or the germ left the spinal fluid by the time the tests were taken, said the CDC\u2019s Dr. Nancy Messonnier. It\u2019s also possible the culprit is hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\nOr perhaps the paralyzing illnesses are caused by some new germ for which no lab test has been developed. Or maybe there\u2019s some predisposing factor in some patients that cause their immune systems to react so severely to a germ or other trigger that the immune response causes paralysis, CDC officials said.\n\nParents and even some scientists have criticized the agency for not solving the riddle.\n\n\u201cI understand why parents are frustrated. I\u2019m frustrated. I want answers too,\u201d said Messonnier, who is overseeing the agency\u2019s outbreak investigation. CDC officials have pledged to do more to notify doctors to look for possible cases and to more thoroughly review cases from years past for further clues.\n\nAbout 120 cases were confirmed in 2014, the first time such a wave occurred. Another 149 were reported in 2016. In 2015 and 2017, the counts were far lower, and it\u2019s not clear why.\n\nThe illnesses have spiked in September each year there\u2019s been a wave and tailed off significantly by November. But it can take weeks to determine which cases should be counted in the outbreak. More than 160 cases are still being investigated, and some of those may join the count, CDC officials said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Feinberg and Camille Biros, not pictured, are administrators of claims submitted to the Independent Reconciliation and Reparations Program, a new clergy child sexual abuse victim compensation fund set up by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Jacqueline Larma)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Officials from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia have agreed to pay uncapped compensation offers for victims of child sexual abuse by clergy as part of a claims process that started Tuesday.\n\nDetails of the Philadelphia program were discussed at a news conference held by independent claims administrators and members of an independent oversight committee who said they\u2019ve already mailed out informational packets to 342 survivors who previously reported credible abuse claims. The Philadelphia Archdiocese\u2019s program is the first victim compensation fund initiated since a chilling grand jury report was released in August detailing child sexual abuse over seven decades by hundreds of priests in six of Pennsylvania\u2019s catholic dioceses. Philadelphia had previously been the subject of a local grand jury investigation that found similar patterns of abuse.\n\nVictims in the Philadelphia Archdiocese, which covers Philadelphia city and county, as well as Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, must register claims by July 31 and file them by Sept. 30 under the program. Most of the state\u2019s seven other dioceses are expected to follow with their own compensation funds opening to claims early next year, according to statements released late last week. Altoona-Johnstown said it set up a victim fund in 1999.\n\nFive of the dioceses\u2014 including Philadelphia\u2014 have hired veteran compensation fund coordinator Ken Feinberg to design and operate their programs. Feinberg and co-administrator Camille Biros ran victims\u2019 compensation funds set up by five New York dioceses in recent years. Feinberg was also the administrator of several other high-profile compensation funds including for the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting victims and as special master for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nAt the news conference Tuesday, Feinberg outlined several features of the Philadelphia program that make it different from others in the past, including it is completely independent and voluntary.\n\n\u201cThe program in awarding compensation really performs two functions with the victim. People focus on the money,\u201d he said. \u201cNo amount of money is going to provide closure to that victim or satisfy the victim. It is a small step in helping that victim at least secure some degree of financial security. Just as importantly we have found in our work in New York, that a claimant who files a claim with us and receives compensation finds some degree of validation as to that claim. Do not underestimate the importance of this.\u201d\n\nPayouts and total fund amounts will not be disclosed by the diocese, and church officials will have no say in decisions about eligibility or payout amounts. There will be no appeals process, and if a claimant accepts a compensation offer, they must waive their right to sue the archdiocese for any past or future abuse.\n\nLawyers who help settle child sexual abuse cases say courts generally promise a bigger payout, while dioceses face the possibility a judge can order them to divulge records of child sexual abuse complaints and how they handled them. Plaintiffs also can extract court-approved agreements from dioceses to add procedures or training to better protect children going forward. Some of the money goes to lawyers\u2019 fees, and the church\u2019s defenders say that motivates civil lawyers.\n\nWhile payouts won\u2019t be capped, $500,000 is the most paid out to one individual during Feinberg\u2019s administration of claims against the New York dioceses. The size of the payouts is determine by numerous factors, including the severity of the abuse, the age of the victim and the long-term effect on the victim\u2019s life.\n\nA victim compensation often delivers a faster payout to victims. Biros said once claims are filed, most should be processed and paid within 90 days.\n\nVictims do not have to accept the compensation offers, and don\u2019t have to waive their right to sue if they reject an offer. But many victims may fall outside the window to file a civil claim against the Archdiocese under Pennsylvania law.\n\nA legislative effort to change state law to allow a two-year window for people to sue in abuse cases that are otherwise too old to pursue passed the state House, but it was blocked by Republican state senators last month. Opponents, including Catholic bishops and the insurance industry, expressed concerns about the cost and argued that a retroactive change would violate the state constitution.\n\nProponents have said negotiations on the change are continuing.\n\nState Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose office oversaw the grand jury investigation, said the grand jury \u201crecommended that victims deserve their day in court \u2014 not that the church should be the arbiter of its own punishment.\u201d\n\nThe Philadelphia Archdiocese said its program will be overseen by the independent committee, including former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, former interim Philadelphia District Attorney Kelley Hodge and Lawrence Stengel, a retired federal judge. The diocese plans to sell properties as one way to bolster the fund, but will not dip into money for charities, seminaries, donor-designated gifts or donations to parishes, ministries or schools.\n\nThe program offers pro-bono legal representation if victims want a lawyer and offers help from a victim support facilitator who can help with the claims process.", "FILE - In this July 29, 2015 file photo, Chris Cornell poses for a portrait in Agoura Hills, Calif.

He had four tackles for loss and three sacks in a rout of TCU last week. The fourth-year junior is undersized at 5-foot-11 and 221 pounds, but in the Big 12 his quickness allows him to stay on the field against spread offenses. Long, one of 10 semifinalists for the Butkus Award as the nation\u2019s best linebacker, is second in the nation in tackles for loss per game with 1.94 and the leader of the third-best defense (5.23 yards per play) in a conference where stops are hard to come by.\n\nWhat they are saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t block him. He keeps his feet. He keeps getting banged up and still makes tackles.\u201d\u2014 West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen.\n\nOutlook: Tough for Big 12 defensive players to get a lot of recognition and linebacker is always a loaded spot nationally, but Long and the Mountaineers will be in the spotlight down the stretch.\n\nWHO\u2019S HOT\n\nCaleb Wilson, TE, UCLA\n\nWilson leads all tight ends with 718 yards receiving after his best game of the season last week against Arizona State. The junior caught 11 passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns. UCLA\u2019s offense has struggled most of the season with inexperience and injuries at quarterback, but the 6-foot-5, 235-pound Wilson is still proving to be a downfield threat and possible first-round NFL draft pick.\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nJ.K. Dobbins, RB, Ohio State\n\nDobbins ran for 1,403 yards and 7.23 yards per carry as a freshman last season, showing a blend of power and speed. He came into this season with some Heisman buzz and the possibility of being a focal point in the Buckeyes\u2019 loaded offense. Instead, his performance has epitomized the team\u2019s inability to consistently establish the run. Dobbins has been held under 4.0 yards per carry in five of the last six games, breaking out for a season-high 164 yards rushing against Nebraska two weeks ago and then managing just 28 on 14 attempts last week against Michigan State.\n\nGROUP OF FIVE STAR\n\nRyquell Armstead, RB, Temple\n\nArmstead is averaging 122.25 yards rushing per game, and has been rolling the last two weeks with 252 yards on 57 carries after missing the previous two games with an ankle injury. Against Houston last week, Armstead scored six touchdowns to lead the Owls to a victory that made them bowl eligible. The 5-11, 211-pound senior has occasionally seen time as a third-down pass rusher for Temple, but now he is the engine of a surging offense that has put up 1,207 yards in the past two games.\n\nON THE LINE (ESPN analyst Cole Cubelic, a former guard at Auburn, identifies an offensive lineman playing at an All-America level)\n\nLiam Eichenberg, LT, Notre Dame\n\nThe 308-pound junior moved into the starting lineup this season to fill the spot left by first-round draft pick Mike McGlinchey.\n\n\u201cEichenberg has been great in pass protection in his initial season as a starter and helped pave the way for the Fighting Irish being undefeated.

Taylor is sixth in the nation in rushing at 122.10 yards per game and fifth in carries at 207. Pelluer is a sixth-year season who will set a school record this week by playing in his 52nd game.

November 9, 2018\n\nBlame to go around in Porter County election fiasco\n\nAt best, some top Porter County elections officials seem to have treated one of society\u2019s most important institutions as an afterthought.\n\nAt worst, polling places and some ballots appear to have been treated as inconsequential.\n\nIt\u2019s shameful, and both people and processes must be held accountable.\n\nThrough it all, Porter County Clerk Karen Martin, who is supposed to be in charge, has been largely missing in action as other county officials deal with the fallout.\n\nNow Porter County voters and political candidates are reaping the reward: An election system that appears to have been in chaos long before election night and a lack of reported results 60 hours, and counting, after election night.\n\nAdding shameful insult to injury, Indiana Republican Party leaders actually tried to block the efforts of county officials and a judge to extend polling hours at 12 voting locations that opened several hours late Tuesday.\n\nA number of voters faced disenfranchisement in an era when national political scandals already have eroded public trust in our elections.\n\nThe state GOP was tone-deaf and shortsighted, placing politics above voters.\n\nOne of the few positives rising from the voting fiasco in Porter County is the leadership of county commissioners.\n\nThe three county executives pushed for the later operations of the affected polling locations, giving voters who were turned away in the morning more time to vote later in the day.\n\nWhen various complaints flowed in from election workers, the details of which have not been fully disclosed, the commissioners called on the FBI to investigate.\n\nIt was an important step in beginning to restore trust, or in weeding out any possible transgressions.\n\nCommissioners Laura Blaney, a Democrat, and Jim Biggs, a Republican, have been providing particularly visible leadership in the wake of the chaos.\n\nCommissioner Jeff Good, the Republican president of the commissioners, is on the ballot this election cycle and rightly has kept himself removed from the situation.\n\nBut the solid leadership from commissioners aside, how did we get here to begin with?\n\nWhy are results not counted three days and counting after polls opened? Why were early and absentee ballots apparently not organized and counted timely and properly?\n\nWho is responsible?\n\nIt will take more leadership from commissioners and other county officials to fully vet what caused this disaster and ensure it never happens again.\n\nPorter County taxpayers deserve it \u2014 and should be demanding it.

November 9, 2018\n\nCash infusion\n\nState crafts wise plan to spend anti-opioid grants.\n\nJim McClelland, who leads Indiana\u2019s efforts to fight the opioid epidemic, acknowledges the state has been slow to spend federal funds earmarked for the crisis. But that was to get it right, he said in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cIt took longer to roll some of that out than might have been desirable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem here that took 20 years to develop,\u201d said McClelland, Indiana\u2019s executive director for drug prevention, treatment and enforcement. \u201cThere\u2019s no instant solution to it.\u201d\n\nAs The Journal Gazette\u2019s Ron Shawgo reported recently, during a one-year period that ended in April, Indiana had spent about a quarter of its $10.9 million allocation for fighting opioid abuse. An Associated Press analysis of the use of funds from the 21st Century Cures Act passed by Congress in 2017 revealed that states such as Indiana that had accepted Medicaid expansion dollars have generally been slower to spend that money. That\u2019s because Medicaid funds had already allowed them to \u201cgo beyond the basics.\u201d\n\nIndiana, though, had farther to go than most other states. It is among those states with the biggest problems from opioids, and the least effective response systems, as noted in a recent report from IUPUI\u2019s Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health (also discussed on the facing page). AP reported Indiana\u2019s rate of spending Cures Act funds lagged even among those 33 states where Medicaid expansion had occurred. Through April 30, the state spent $2.47 million - 24.9 percent of the money allotted.\n\nIn an interview this week, McClelland said Cures Act funds are being distributed much faster now. \u201cWhen we got into this, we just did not have anywhere near the treatment infrastructure that we needed to respond to a crisis of this magnitude. You don\u2019t just flip a switch and make that happen.\n\n\u201cWhat appeared to be a slow rollout of the Cures Act grant in its first year was largely a result of our desire to take a strategic approach and build a well-thought-out infrastructure that could be sustained,\u201d he said. \u201cOur interest is in spending money wisely rather than just spending money fast.\n\n\u201cWe did not lose a dollar by doing that,\u201d McClelland continued. \u201cAll of what was unspent the first year carried over to the second year.\u201d In fact, he said, the Cures money is just a portion of the resources the state is marshaling against its worst drug epidemic. The original Cures Act allocated another $10.9 million for this year; the omnibus opioid-fighting bill that became law in October will make the same amount of money available to Indiana each year through 2023. And Indiana will receive additional federal grants of $18.1 million this year and next.\n\nMcClelland said the state has used Cures funds to train medical professionals to administer medically assisted treatment with buprenorphine; to create mobile-response teams for rural counties; to distribute the opioid antidote Naloxone; and to launch an anti-stigma campaign called Know the O Facts.\n\nIn addition to its support through Cures, the federal government has given Indiana a waiver allowing the state to spend more of its Medicaid funds on a wider range of assistance, including as much as 30 days of residential treatment and some types of recovery-support services - the kind of sustained therapy that can help victims overcome opioid addiction and get back on a path to a normal life. That may mean as much as $80 million a year targeted at the epidemic, McClelland said. Meanwhile, Fort Wayne is one of several sites around the state the legislature has approved for pilot programs to add treatment beds. Locally raised funds will be used to match a $1.5 million state grant.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of money, consider the costs in deaths and devastation to families, and the economic cost to Indiana, which the Fairbanks School estimated at $43 billion over the past 15 years. There are a few signs of progress statewide, such as dropping opioid prescription rates and a reduced number of visits to emergency rooms this year, according to McClelland.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are no quick solutions,\u201d he said. But the state is quickly resolving how to best spend the windfalls of opioid-crisis-related funds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d McClelland said of the slow start to spending the federal dollars, \u201cyou\u2019ll see this problem, going forward.\u201d\n\n____\n\nSouth Bend Tribune. November 7, 2018\n\nFix communication issues at Housing Authority of South Bend.\n\nA number of issues raised by Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 including financial and safety matters \u2014 suggests that South Bend\u2019s Housing Authority has some major work to do.\n\nThe way the mayor chose to publicly present his concerns emphasizes the troubled state of affairs.\n\nAt the Oct. 24 meeting of the South Bend Housing Authority\u2019s Board of Commissioners, Buttigieg raised concerns about the local housing authority, including unaddressed safety issues, fiscal problems and a lack of communication between the city and housing authority.\n\nHe highlighted concerns about complaints from personnel in seven city departments, in terms of responsiveness from housing authority staff. His office also has fielded complaints from some residents about the conditions in public housing.\n\n\u201cThere are some issues that have gotten to the level that I think we need to pay special attention to,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten to the level that has prompted me to decide that working to support and improve the housing authority will be in the top tier of priorities for my administration for as long as I\u2019m mayor.\u201d\n\nIn response, a number of commissioners expressed anger and frustration about the way the issues were raised, after not receiving a letter outlining his concerns from Buttigieg in advance of the meeting. Some felt that this failure left them unable to respond. Buttigieg distributed the letter during the meeting, and apologized for not presenting it to them earlier.\n\nLast week, the executive director of the housing authority and president of the board of trustees acknowledged financial problems and issues with bug infestations, but pushed back on some of the other concerns the mayor raised. In the next week, the board and housing authority executive director Tonya Robinson plan to release letters specifically responding to Buttigieg\u2019s concerns about communication, maintenance shortfalls, payment problems and mistrust between authority staff and residents.\n\nThe agency, which draws funding from the U.S. Department of Housing, has a history of turmoil. According to a February 2015 Tribune report, federal housing officials found in 2013 that the local agency was plagued by mismanagement and financial woes. The issues led HUD to classify the housing authority under \u201ctroubled\u201d status.\n\nIn 2015 \u2014 shortly after the agency received a series of bleak performance reviews by the federal government, Buttigieg replaced the entire board. \u201cThe Housing Authority is at a crossroads, with many issues requiring attention, and this year brings an opportunity to draw new vision and leadership for the board,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nThree years later, Robinson, the executive director, says the agency has been \u201cdigging ourselves out.\u201d \u2033We\u2019re working hard to correct our deficiencies.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that some issues remain at the agency that operates hundreds of public housing units and more than 2,100 Section 8 vouchers. Both the mayor and housing authority officials have expressed a commitment to fixing the problems. We\u2019d suggest that both sides start by repairing their communication failure.\n\n____\n\n(Terre Haute) Tribune-Star.

The Sky didn\u2019t make the playoffs either year.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wade was an assistant with the San Antonio Stars from 2012-16 before joining the Lynx. He was with Minnesota for two seasons and now inherits a roster led by guards Courtney Vandersloot and Allie Quigley. The Sky drafted Diamond DeShields and Gabby Williams last season with the third and fourth picks and have the No. 4 pick in next year\u2019s draft.\n\n\u201cOne of the main things I think we need to focus on is defense and we need to find an identity,\u201d he said.\n\nWade credits former Stars coach Dan Hughes for being the main reason he became a coach in 2010, when he finished playing overseas. Wade talked over the offer an internship with his wife Edwige Lawson-Wade, who played in the WNBA.

(Greek Culture Ministry via AP)\n\nATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece\u2019s culture ministry said Tuesday that archaeologists have located the first tangible remains of a lost city that the ancient Greeks believed was first settled by Trojan captives of war after the sack of Troy.\n\nA ministry statement said excavations from September to early October in the southern Greek region of the Peleponnese turned up \u201cproof of the existence of the ancient city\u201d of Tenea, until now known mostly from ancient texts.\n\nFinds included walls and clay, marble or stone floors of buildings, as well as household pottery, a bone gaming die and more than 200 coins dating from the 4th century B.C. to late Roman times.\n\nA pottery jar containing the remains of two human fetuses was also found amid the foundations of one building. That was unusual, as the ancient Greeks typically buried their dead in organized cemeteries outside the city walls.\n\nLead archaeologist Elena Korka, who has been excavating in the area since 2013, told The Associated Press that her team had only been digging in the rich cemeteries surrounding Tenea until this year. In one, antiquities smugglers dug up two remarkable 6th century B.C. marble statues of young men in 2010 and tried to sell them for 10 million euros.\n\n\u201cThis year we excavated part of the city itself,\u201d Korka said.\n\nExcavation work continues on the cemeteries, located near the modern village of Hiliomodi about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Athens.\n\nArchaeologists discovered nine burials there this year, finding gold, copper and bone jewelry, pottery and coins dating from the 4th century B.C. to Roman times.\n\n\u201cThe citizens seem to have been remarkably affluent,\u201d Korka said, adding that the city probably did well out of trade, standing on a key route between the major cities of Corinth and Argos in the northeastern Peloponnese.\n\nSo far, not much was known about Tenea, apart from ancient references to the reputed link with Troy and to its citizens having formed the bulk of the Greek colonists who founded the city of Syracuse in Sicily.\n\nKorka said more should emerge during the excavations, which will continue over coming years.\n\n\u2033(The city) had distinctive pottery shapes with eastern influences, maintained contacts with both east and west ... and had its own way of thinking, which, to the extent that it could, shaped its own policies,\u201d she said.\n\nTenea survived the Roman destruction of neighboring Corinth in 146 B.C., and flourished under Roman rule. It appears to have suffered damage during a Gothic invasion in the late 4th century A.D. and may have been abandoned around the time of Slavic incursions two centuries later.", "ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) \u2014 Ethiopia has detained the former head of a large military-run industrial conglomerate, a day after the country\u2019s attorney general disclosed that several hundred million dollars was embezzled from the firm.\n\nThe state broadcaster ETV reported that Maj.

And when proper hygiene isn\u2019t respected \u2014 like through sharing of needles \u2014 conditions are more propitious for viruses like Ebola to spread.\n\n\u201cProbably more than 50 percent of cases in Beni have been driven from these tradi-modern health care facilities, and the fact that hygiene and injection practices in these areas are relatively unsafe,\u201d he said.\n\nSalama said the current Ebola outbreak is \u201carguably the most difficult context that we\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d pointing to activities of two armed opposition groups in the region. The outbreak has been \u201camplified\u201d by the health centers, he said.", "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Yet another redistricting lawsuit has been filed in North Carolina, this one challenging General Assembly boundaries that Democrats and election reform advocates say remain illegally tainted by excessive favoritism toward Republicans.\n\nCommon Cause North Carolina, the state Democratic Party and more than 20 Democratic and unaffiliated voters sued GOP mapmakers Tuesday in Wake County court. They allege the lines are illegal partisan gerrymanders that make it virtually impossible for Democrats to win majorities in the House or Senate.\n\nThe plaintiffs want maps last drawn in 2017 \u2014 in response to previous litigation \u2014 struck down for violating the North Carolina Constitution. They also call for new boundaries to be approved for the 2020 elections, which kick off in less than 13 months with candidate filing. A three-judge panel would hear the matter, followed by a likely appeal to the state Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to say enough is enough. Partisan gerrymandering must end now,\u201d Common Cause NC Executive Director Bob Phillips said at a news conference. \u201cIt rigs elections and it\u2019s wrong no matter which party does the deed.\u201d\n\nThe political stakes are great in North Carolina, a presidential battleground state in which Republicans have controlled state government for much of this decade. Barring a new method to draw districts, whichever party wins each legislative chamber in 2020 will get to draw the maps for the next decade. The governor \u2014 currently Democrat Roy Cooper \u2014 doesn\u2019t have veto power in redistricting.\n\nStill, the lawsuit comes a week after Democrats actually won at least 11 additional legislative seats, with most of those victories originating in districts they identified as being wrongly packed or diluted with Democratic voters.\n\nWhile Democrats did end the GOP\u2019s veto-proof control in the legislature, they say they\u2019re being robbed of more seats. According to the litigation, Democratic legislative candidates won about 51 percent of the overall votes cast in their elections but they are expected to win only 44 percent of the General Assembly seats when results are finalized.\n\nState GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse quipped: \u201cOnly North Carolina Democrats would file a lawsuit to overturn districts that they just won.\u201d\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs say just because Democrats had a better year doesn\u2019t undermine their arguments that it\u2019s unlawful to sort voters into districts chiefly to create desired political outcomes. Republicans \u201cdiscriminated against Democratic voters on the basis of their political beliefs and their prior votes,\u201d said Stanton Jones, a Washington-based attorney.\n\nAt least eight lawsuits have been filed challenging North Carolina maps on the basis of racial and partisan bias since the current round of redistricting began in 2011. The lawsuits resulted in the redrawing of congressional lines in 2016 and legislative districts in 2017 \u2014 both to address determined racial bias. The state has spent millions of taxpayer dollars defending the maps.\n\nLegal fees for Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit are being paid in part by an arm of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is led by former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder with a goal of more favorable maps for the party in the 2020s. Holder this fall endorsed state Supreme Court candidate Anita Earls, who as a lawyer represented some who sued over maps earlier this decade. Earls won, so next year five of the seven justices will be registered Democrats.\n\nThe office of Republican Senate leader Phil Berger, who is one of the defendants, mentioned Earls in a statement, saying she should recuse herself if the case reaches the court because of her redistricting work history. Otherwise, Berger spokesman Pat Ryan said, the lawsuit \u201cis a corrupt attempt at judicial gerrymandering, hoping the liberal state court will rewrite the constitution and draw maps favorable to Democrats.\u201d\n\nPartisan gerrymandering claims against state legislative lines are similar to those Common Cause and the Democratic Party filed two years ago in federal court over state congressional districts. Federal judges have twice ruled the congressional map violated protections for Democratic voters. The U.S. Supreme Court, which has never declared district maps anywhere as partisan gerrymanders, is considering whether to hear an appeal in that case.\n\nBy targeting the North Carolina Constitution in Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, the result won\u2019t be dependent on what the U.S. justices decide. It alleges the GOP maps violate the state constitution\u2019s provisions protecting freedom of speech and ensuring people are protected by laws equally and that elections are \u201cfree.\u201d\n\nUnder the partisan gerrymandering claims, those who sued contend GOP legislators used political and election data to manipulate the lines of about 75 House and 20 Senate districts so that Republicans and their candidates won more seats at the expense of Democrats and the voters who support them.\n\n\u201cWhat gerrymandering does is it makes for lazy politics,\u201d said Virginia Brien of Charlotte, an unaffiliated voter and plaintiff. \u201cIt makes for people not having to engage with citizens who have different ideas about how to get something done.\u201d", "FILE - In this Tuesday, March 6, 2018 file photo, Italian composer Ennio Morricone directs an ensemble during a concert of his \"60 Year Of Music World Tour\" in Milan, Italy.

President Donald Trump has soured on Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and she is expected to leave her job as soon as this week. That\u2019s according to two people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is weighing an administration-wide shakeup as he looks to prepare his White House for divided government, but it is unclear who is going and who is staying.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was thought to be out as soon as this week, according to two people with knowledge of the issue, but she is now likely to remain in the post for a longer period because there is no obvious successor in place.\n\nTrump has soured on Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly, in part over frustration that his administration is not doing more to address what he has called a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the two people. But the scope of the contemplated changes is far broader, as Trump gears up for a wave of Democratic oversight requests and to devote more effort to his re-election campaign.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the situation, Trump is also discussing replacing Kelly with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Nick Ayers. Kelly, a retired Marine general, has been credited with bringing order and process to a chaotic West Wing, but he has fallen out of favor with the president as well as with presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAyers, a seasoned campaign operative, would restore a political mindset to the role, but he faces stiff opposition from some corners of the West Wing, with some aides lobbying Trump directly against the move.\n\nOther changes are afoot, as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke are being discussed for replacement. And in an extraordinary move Tuesday, first lady Melania Trump\u2019s office called publicly for the firing of Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel.\n\nFor all the talk of churn, Trump often expresses frustration with aides and then does not take action. Talk of Kelly\u2019s exit has percolated for months, and he remains in place.\n\nNielsen had hoped to complete one year in the job and leave in December, but it appeared unlikely she would last that long, said two people with knowledge of the debate. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nCurbing illegal immigration is Trump\u2019s signature issue \u2014 and one he returns to as a way to rally his most loyal supporters.\n\nBut anyone who takes over at Homeland Security is likely to run up against the same problems that Nielsen faced. The administration has already tried to clamp down at the border, but those efforts have been largely thwarted or watered down because of legal challenges.\n\nTrump also told allies that he never fully trusted Nielsen, whom he associated with President George W. Bush, a longtime foe.

She was tasked with helping states secure elections following interference by Russians during the 2016 election.\n\nShe pushed Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including funding for his border wall, and defended the administration\u2019s practice of separating migrant families, telling a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens \u201cin the United States every day.\u201d But she was also instrumental in stopping the separations.\n\nJust last week, the administration announced that migrants would be denied asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border if they crossed illegally, creating regulations that circumvent immigration laws stating anyone can claim asylum no matter how they arrive to the country. The decision would affect about 70,000 people annually and was immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nNielsen also moved to abandon long-standing regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention, and she requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families, and it is at capacity.\n\nShe got into heated discussions with Trump and White House aides several times over immigration policy as she sought to explain the complicated legal challenges behind immigration law and pushed for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who would replace her. The job requires Senate confirmation, and there is no deputy secretary. Under Secretary for Management Claire Grady would be the acting head if Nielsen left.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Jonathan Lemire in New York contributed to this report.", "GROTON, S.D.

(Greg Lindstrom/Flathead Beacon via AP, File)\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration plans to appeal a federal court ruling that would allow oil and gas drilling on land considered sacred to Native American tribes in Montana and Canada, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said Tuesday.\n\nZinke said it would be inappropriate to allow drilling in northwestern Montana\u2019s Badger-Two Medicine area, site of the creation story for the Blackfoot tribes. He\u2019s asked government attorneys to appeal a September ruling that reinstated a nearly 10-square-mile (26-square-kilometer) oil and gas lease in the area bordering the Blackfeet Reservation and Glacier National Park.\n\nThe lease had been cancelled under President Barack Obama at the urging of the tribes and environmentalists before it was reinstated by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for the Blackfeet Nation and strongly believe resource development in these most sacred of lands would be inappropriate,\u201d Zinke said in a Tuesday interview with The Associated Press.\n\nAn appeal will pit Zinke\u2019s agency against an oil and gas company\u2019s development plans \u2014 a relatively uncommon position for the pro-energy Trump administration.\n\nLease owner Solenex LLC of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, had urged Zinke to uphold its drilling rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed,\u201d Solenex attorney William \u201cPerry\u201d Pendley with the Mountain States Legal Foundation. \u201cWhat Zinke is asking for is the right of a secretary of Interior to cancel any oil and gas lease at any time for any reason.\u201d\n\nSolenex has held the lease for more than 30 years. It has not yet drilled because of numerous bureaucratic delays within the U.S. departments of Interior and Agriculture that prompted the company to sue in 2013.\n\nThe Badger-Two Medicine area is part of the Rocky Mountain Front, a scenic expanse of forested mountains that\u2019s been subject to a long campaign to block oil and gas development and mining.\n\nCongress in 2006 provided tax breaks and other incentives that prompted 29 leaseholders to relinquish their drilling rights, but some leaseholders declined the offers. Fifteen leases in the area were given up voluntarily by Devon Energy in 2016, and the government later canceled what had been the last two leases in the area.\n\n___\n\nFollow Matthew Brown on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MatthewBrownAP", "MANCHESTER, N.H.

Nov. 11, 2018.\n\nTo the outsider, East Texas looks like a pristine forest, unspoiled in many ways \u2014 especially compared to the urban areas just west of here.\n\nThose from the city will take a deep breath of our fresh air, thinking it far less polluted than that they breathe at home.\n\nThat probably isn\u2019t true.\n\nWhile the large cities have millions of vehicles, East Texas is where utility companies have built the power plants that provide electricity to the cities. The result has been a higher amount of air pollution than one might expect.\n\nOur area also is blessed with the tremendous natural resource of plentiful water in streams, rivers and reservoirs. Most look beautiful from the surface and East Texas offers some of the best fishing in our state.\n\nBut the lakes and rivers are facing their own dangers.\n\nThe Environmental Integrity Project \u2014 a Washington, D.C.-based environmental watchdog group \u2014 has issued a report highlighting some of those dangers, most notably effluent from East Texas chicken farms and processing plants.\n\nIt should be noted that the Environmental Integrity Project is a nonprofit group with an agenda to strengthen clean air and water laws. But the data cited in its report come directly from the Environmental Protection Agency and were collected during the administration of President Donald Trump. The evidence is not fake.\n\nAmong the findings was that Pilgrim\u2019s Pride plants in Mount Pleasant were dumping 1,755 pounds of nitrogen a day into the tributaries that feed Lake O\u2019 the Pines, which is one source of Longview\u2019s drinking water. That makes it one of the biggest water polluters in the state, and many times worse than most meatpacking operations across the nation.\n\nWhat that nitrogen does \u2014 along with phosphorus also released by Pilgrim\u2019s \u2014 is deplete oxygen from the water, which in turn makes the lake more hazardous for fish and other animal life. Lake O\u2019 the Pines had already been identified as having lower than optimum levels of dissolved oxygen.\n\nNone of this is to say water from the lake isn\u2019t safe to drink or that the fish there are about to die. What it means is that we must find a way to solve this problem.\n\nOne solution would be to require Pilgrim\u2019s Pride to install its own water treatment plant to reduce the dangerous effects of the effluent. Yes, that would cost the company millions and could impact the price of your chicken dinner.\n\nOther processing plants, such as Tyson Farms, already do this, so it is not unreasonable. Unfortunately, Tyson\u2019s plant in Center also was cited by the report because its treatment system is not working as well as it should. But the negative effluent from the Tyson plant is still only about one-third that from the Mount Pleasant plant.\n\nThere could be other solutions we don\u2019t know about, some even revolutionary, given the pace of science progress today.\n\nBut one must be found, because this situation is not sustainable over the long run. If allowed to continue, conditions at Lake \u2019O the Pines and other waterways will seriously deteriorate. Will that be in 10, 25 or 50 years? We do not know.\n\nWhat we do know is that this problem can be solved. We just need the will to get it done.\n\nState environmental officials have issued recommendations for Pilgrim\u2019s to begin reducing the pollution, but they lack teeth. If Pilgrim\u2019s will not follow the recommendations voluntarily, area lawmakers should act in the coming session to force it and other polluters to act more responsibly.\n\n___\n\nSan Antonio Express-News.

Nov. 12, 2018.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s elections, Republicans across the nation are probably asking themselves one key question: What\u2019s the matter with Kansas?\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s reddest states elected a Democratic woman to serve as governor. Texas Republicans ought to be paying attention \u2014 this could be their future if they don\u2019t take seriously the next legislative session.\n\nThe problem in Kansas began in 2012 when then-Gov. Sam Brownback slashed nearly $4 billion in state income taxes. The goal was to stimulate economic growth and attract businesses. That didn\u2019t happen. The economy actually underperformed neighboring states.\n\nInstead Kansas got underfunded infrastructure and strangled budgets for public schools. Eventually an alliance of Democrats and moderate Republicans rolled back the tax cuts over Brownback\u2019s veto and restored funding.\n\nThis pushback should have been a warning to Kansas Republicans, but the siren song of Trump-style politics must have been too alluring. Their gubernatorial candidate, Kris Kobach, ran on a platform of fear mongering about undocumented immigrants and baseless claims of rampant voter fraud.\n\nFundamental concerns such as public schools, roads and taxes were instead left to Democratic candidate Laura Kelly, a longtime state legislator. Her campaign, as Kelly said during her victory speech, wasn\u2019t the result of a \u201cblue wave\u201d but rather a \u201cwave of common sense.\u201d\n\nHere in Texas, we have heard a call for common sense from Democrats and moderate Republicans alike.\n\nLike those in Kansas, our public schools are in trouble. Texas schools are funded by a mix of state sales taxes and local property taxes. The state has failed to keep up with growth and shifted far too much of the burden onto homeowners. In an attempt to keep state taxes low, lawmakers in Austin have merely undermined our public schools and compelled tax hikes at a local level.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing consensus among Democrats and moderate Republicans \u2014 specifically those in the state House \u2014 to find new revenue sources by closing the \u201cequal and uniform\u201d loophole that benefits commercial properties but not homeowners, and expanding the sales tax to cover currently untaxed goods and services. Meanwhile, the Brownbacks and Kobachs of our state \u2014 notably Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \u2014 spent campaign season talking about sideshow issues like NFL protesters.\n\nCommon sense candidates like Patrick\u2019s opponent Mike Collier got closer than any Democrat in decades to winning a statewide seat. If the Republicans controlling Austin can\u2019t solve the problems facing Texas in the next session, don\u2019t be surprised if the national party finds itself asking in 2022: What\u2019s the matter with Texas?\n\n___\n\nThe Dallas Morning News.

Davidson failed to mention that Crenshaw wears the patch because he lost his right eye in 2012 following the detonation of an IED while serving in Afghanistan.\n\nCrenshaw could easily have been a jerk in return. He wasn\u2019t. He made a simple and transparently true statement that the wounds of our veterans should never be held up for mockery or sport.\n\nThen he did one better. He showed up on SNL next to Davidson and gave us some real laughs, as well as a lesson we can all remember.\n\nIn a political era when people love nothing more than to be offended and insist on apologies for said offenses, we were thrilled to see someone step up as the adult. And we were glad SNL gave Crenshaw the platform it did.\n\nIt was heartening to see a display of grace, humor and humility play out live on national television. We hope others will watch this and learn from it, recognizing that despite our political differences, we\u2019re real people and not cardboard cutouts.\n\nIn a final word, Crenshaw talked about the importance of the phrase \u201cnever forget\u201d and what it means to the relationship between civilians and members of the armed forces. \u201cAnd never forget those we lost on 9/11, heroes like Pete\u2019s father,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just say, Pete, never forget.\u201d\n\nPete\u2019s dad, Scott Davidson, was a New York City firefighter who lost his life on 9/11. Scott Davidson was last seen doing what heroes do: running toward danger and not away from it. In this case, running up the stairs of the Marriott World Trade Center shortly before it collapsed. Crenshaw served in Afghanistan, fighting al-Qaeda and the Taliban in response to the vicious attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nWhat we saw on SNL was a reminder that, as Americans, our lives are inextricably linked. In this age of terror and division, we are stronger when we realize we are one people.\n\n___\n\nBeaumont Enterprise. Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nIt may seem strange to point out that funding for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall will never pass the U.S. House of Representatives when it is controlled by Democrats in the new Congress. After all, money for the wall couldn\u2019t even get through the Republican-controlled House over the last two years. Still, this bad idea keeps trying to avoid its slide into irrelevance, with some proponents even talking about sneaking a bill through the lame-duck session of the outgoing Congress. House members should not waste any more time on the wall and start focusing on more important challenges.\n\nLocal U.S. Reps. Randy Weber and Brian Babin can do their part to move forward by advising their GOP colleagues to forget about the wall and start looking ahead. If enough Republican House members do that, the few die-hard supporters of the wall may finally realize that it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nThe plain fact here is that even many Republicans in Congress thought the border wall was unworkable from the start. Republican Rep. Will Hurd, R-Helotes, appropriately called it the most expensive and least effective way to fight illegal immigration.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Laredo spoke for many is his party when he said, \u201cWe want security, cameras, sensors, personnel, the Border Patrol. . Nobody wants an open border. It\u2019s just how we do it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border already has 700 miles of fencing of varying levels along its 1,954-mile length, and where it\u2019s appropriate an actual barrier might make sense. But a physical wall from California to the Gulf of Mexico would be incredibly expensive and unnecessary, spanning vast stretches of isolated desert with virtually no illegal crossing. Even if the wall could be built, people could probably find a way to go over or under it. Large numbers of foreigners fly into the country now as tourists or students and overstay their visas; a wall 50 feet high wouldn\u2019t stop them.\n\nThe new Congress should focus on common-sense border security. Republicans want that, and Democrats want some kind of deal for the \u201cDreamers,\u201d children brought into this country by their parents years ago but still lacking legal status. Both sides should be able to work out an agreement that does something about both of these goals. They need to break through the bitter partisanship that has poisoned the mood in Washington and understand that one-sided lawmaking just won\u2019t work any more.\n\nIf President Trump won\u2019t accept this, Republican members of Congress should make it clear that they recognize the new political reality. That includes ignoring some wild talk about shutting down the government in the coming lame-duck session if the wall isn\u2019t funded.\n\nThose in the current Congress have some loose ends to tie down before their successors take over. Members should get it done and move on. The bluster of campaigning is over; the serious business of governing must begin.", "Washington State running back Max Borghi, center, is tackled after a short gain by Colorado linebacker Davion Taylor, top, and defensive back Nick Fisher in the first half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Boulder, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)\n\nWhile quarterback Gardner Minshew is getting most of the attention, running backs James Williams and Max Borghi have also helped fuel the rise of No. 8 Washington State this season.\n\nWilliams and Borghi play key roles in the complex Air Raid offense, which is mostly geared to passing.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s 31-7 blowout of Colorado, the Cougars rushed a season-high 33 times for 131 yards. The two running backs added eight catches for 77 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest things was how good our running game was today,\u201d Minshew said afterward. \u201cOur O-line and our running backs hit it hard.\u201d\n\nCoach Mike Leach likes to point out that the Air Raid depends heavily on running backs who serve as blockers and receivers.\n\n\u201cYou have to rush, catch and block at WSU,\u201d Leach said. \u201cNot just one of the three. You have to do all three.\u201d\n\nThe backs have certainly done their part in protecting Minshew, who has been sacked just seven times this season.

The Cougars also have an outside chance of making the College Football Playoff for the first time if they win out.\n\nThe Cougars are where they are thanks in part to Williams, a 205-pound junior, and Borghi, a freshman.\n\nWilliams, who is from Burbank, California, has rushed for 437 yards and nine touchdowns and he leads the team with 63 receptions, good for 506 yards and another three touchdowns.\n\n\u201cJames does a good job of making people miss when he is in space,\u201d Leach said. \u201cHe can do everything you ask a running back to do.\u201d\n\nWilliams said he has improved as a rusher by concentrating on hitting holes.\n\n\u201cI used to have a problem with bouncing things out when I shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Williams said.\n\nWhile Williams is a shifty and powerful rusher, the 5-foot-10 Borghi is low to the ground and rushes through gaps in the line. Leach said they complement each other with their play.\n\nBorghi has rushed for 283 yards and six touchdowns this season, and caught 34 passes for 238 yards and four more scores.\n\nAs a team, the Cougars have rushed for 18 touchdowns this season, three more than their opponents. The Cougars rushed for just eight touchdowns last season.\n\nOf course, they don\u2019t call it the Air Raid for nothing. The Cougars rank first in the nation in passing yardage, but only 128th among FBS teams with an average of 77 rushing yards per game.\n\nBorghi, who was in high school in Colorado at this time last year, has been a revelation. He reminds many of former Stanford standout Christian McCaffrey, who now plays in the NFL. The two have worked out together in the past.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where his ceiling is,\u201d Leach said. \u201cWe are kind of in the business of not having ceilings.\u201d\n\nBorghi spurned offers from Colorado and Stanford to come to Pullman.\n\n\u201cEveryone was projecting us to go 3-9 and have a horrible season,\u201d Borghi said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fun proving everyone wrong, and it\u2019s pretty much us versus everybody.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Louisiana\u2019s health department may have spent as much as $85 million over 20 months for people enrolled in the Medicaid expansion program who didn\u2019t qualify for the government-financed coverage, according to an audit released Tuesday.\n\nLegislative Auditor Daryl Purpera\u2019s office found problems with the agency\u2019s infrequent use of wage data from the state labor department to determine eligibility.\n\nThe report says since Gov. John Bel Edwards expanded the state\u2019s Medicaid program in July 2016, the department has relied on Medicaid recipients to self-report changes in their paychecks in the 12-month period between the initial application for Medicaid and coverage renewal.\n\nAuditors suggested more frequent checks using available state wage data should be used to ensure Medicaid recipients aren\u2019t earning more than allowed to qualify. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other states do quarterly reviews to check eligibility against income data, the report says.\n\nThe report also found errors in the work done by health department caseworkers. In addition, auditors said the agency didn\u2019t double-check income information when federal officials determined people who applied for individual marketplace insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act were instead deemed eligible for the Medicaid expansion program. Those federal officials don\u2019t have access to state wage data, the report says.\n\n\u201cWithout a sufficient process to determine recipient eligibility, LDH cannot ensure that Medicaid dollars are spent appropriately,\u201d Purpera wrote to legislative leaders in the audit.\n\nThe health department said it follows a federally approved verification plan for checking Medicaid recipients\u2019 income when a person applies for the program and renews coverage yearly. It didn\u2019t outline plans to try to recoup money spent for people ineligible during their coverage.\n\nBut Health Secretary Rebekah Gee said the agency was upgrading its system to improve eligibility reviews.\n\n\u201cAfter more than three years of development, the department has launched a new automated system for Medicaid eligibility and enrollment that will improve customer service, boost efficiency and increase the accuracy of eligibility decisions,\u201d Gee said in a statement.\n\nPurpera\u2019s office used a random sample of 100 Medicaid recipients in the expansion program, to check if their income exceeded the threshold for eligibility. Auditors found 82 didn\u2019t qualify for 47 percent of the monthly payments the health department made to Medicaid managed-care companies for their health care coverage from July 1, 2016, through March 31, 2018.\n\nThe monthly fee paid per ineligible recipient averaged $3,824, the report says.\n\nProjecting those results across the entire Medicaid expansion population, auditors wrote, suggests the health department spent anywhere between $61.6 million and $85.5 million on people who weren\u2019t eligible for Medicaid coverage.\n\nMore than 480,000 working poor and other nonelderly adults in Louisiana are enrolled in Medicaid through the expansion program. Adults ages 19 to 64 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,750 for a single adult or $28,680 for a family of three \u2014 are eligible for the coverage.\n\nThe federal government is paying most of the Medicaid expansion cost. Louisiana is paying a share that eventually increases to 10 percent. Lawmakers passed financing tools to help cover the state\u2019s costs, including a tax hike charged on health maintenance organizations.\n\nGee said her department\u2019s new computer system to double-check eligibility will connect with state and federal databases to have real-time verification of citizenship, income and disability information.\n\nIf anyone is found to have intentionally misrepresented income levels, that information will be sent to law enforcement agencies for possible prosecution, the health department said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Melinda Deslatte on Twitter at http://twitter.com/melindadeslatte", "Driver in fatal crash says he spoke to victim before leaving\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) \u2014 An Anchorage man charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash with a pedestrian told police he spoke to the victim and she said she was fine.\n\nRuti Malietufa, 71, is charged with leaving an accident scene without assisting an injured person, a felony.\n\nMalietufa was arraigned Monday.

For perspective, Haslam said the Amazon headquarters proposal could have resulted in 50,000 new jobs in one location, and Nashville currently only has 70,000 jobs downtown.\n\n\u201cI think we realized, Nashville realized and Amazon realized, to do something that big, as much as Nashville has grown, would still be a challenge to infrastructure and to the talent demand,\u201d Haslam said at the news conference.\n\nAmazon\u2019s choice also followed the resounding defeat of a multibillion-dollar Nashville transit ballot measure in the May election, a plan that banked on tax increases to introduce a light rail system, expand bus routes and build a downtown underground tunnel. In fielding proposals for the second headquarters, Amazon stressed the importance of direct access to mass transit.\n\nNashville Mayor David Briley said the city still continues to invest in expanding its existing transit system.\n\nAmazon\u2019s incentives package includes a cash grant for capital expenditures from the state of $65 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs over the next seven years \u2014 equivalent to $13,000 per job.\n\nMeanwhile, Nashville has agreed to give up to a $15 million cash grant based on each job created within the same timeframe. The annual payment from the city, however, will be dependent on the actual number of employees added.\n\nFinally, Amazon will receive a job tax credit to offset 50 percent of Tennessee\u2019s franchise and excise taxes based on $4,500 per job over the next seven years \u2014 worth about $21.7 million.\n\nA free market think-tank, Beacon Center of Tennessee, became a quick critic of the deal. Beacon Center spokesman Mark Cunningham said officials \u201cgot scammed into giving the company more than $100 million in taxpayer giveaways for a consolation prize.\u201d\n\nBut Briley and Haslam contended that Nashville and the state are getting great deals that will quickly pay themselves off. Haslam said he expects 1.6 more jobs in the state for every direct job created, for a total of 13,000-plus.\n\nThe state says Amazon currently has six Tennessee facilities employing more than 6,500 people.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville contributed to this report.", "Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., arrives for orientation for new members of Congress, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in Washington.

The Republican-controlled board is hearing from activists and academics who are defending or decrying proposed edits meant to streamline academic standards for history. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Texas Board of Education preliminarily voted Tuesday night to restore Hillary Clinton and Helen Keller to the state\u2019s history curriculum and to slightly soften language about the Arab-Israeli conflict \u2014 surprising moments of bipartisanship for members who have long waged ideological battles about how students in the nation\u2019s second largest state learn history.\n\nThe moves came after the board\u2019s 10 Republicans and five Democrats heard hours of often impassioned testimony from students, teachers, activists and university experts on proposed edits meant to streamline academic standards for history. A final vote is scheduled for Friday and more changes can still be made.\n\nIn September, the board voted to cut lessons on former secretary of state, senator and 2016 presidential candidate Clinton, as well as Keller, an iconic activist who was deaf and blind.\n\nEmotions often ran high Tuesday, particularly when Gabrielle Caldwell, a 17-year-old hearing- and visually-impaired student, spoke about how Keller was the only connection many people have to the deaf and blind community.\n\n\u201cI am hoping you keep Helen Keller being taught in our schools,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero.\u201d\n\nThe board voted hours after Caldwell\u2019s testimony to restore Keller to third grade curriculums with minimal debate. It also restored a previously trimmed second grade lesson about Women Airforce Service Pilots, civilians who flew during World War II and were the first U.S. women to pilot military aircraft.\n\nThe proposal to again include Clinton sparked more debate but eventually passed easily. Democrats said Texas girls will be inspired by \u2014 and should be taught about \u2014 the first female presidential candidate to earn a major party nomination, while Republicans said they\u2019d heard from other residents demanding to know why Clinton was cut in the first place.\n\n\u201cI think she qualifies as a significant political leader,\u201d said Marty Rowley, a Republican from Amarillo, while noting that he didn\u2019t agree with Clinton\u2019s politics.\n\nTexas has around 5.4 million public school students, more than any state but California. Teaching board-approved lessons isn\u2019t always mandatory, but its sanctioned curriculum can affect what\u2019s published in textbooks.\n\nThe state\u2019s market is large enough that its curriculum sometimes influences what goes into materials used elsewhere around the country \u2014 though that\u2019s less true in recent years as technology allows for tailoring what\u2019s taught to different states and even individual school districts.\n\nOther hot-button curriculum topics went unchanged despite long-standing objections from university professors and other experts. The board refused to modify controversial lessons on the causes of the Civil War and asking students to explore the biblical figure Moses\u2019 influence on the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers.\n\nPolitical lessons referencing Moses have been in Texas curriculums since 2010. A panel of experts had proposed cutting those, but the board voted in September to preserve them. It also retained language that students learn how \u201cArab rejection of the State of Israel has led to ongoing conflict\u201d in the Middle East.\n\nOn Tuesday, the board voted to make rejection of many Arabs of the State of Israel a contributing factor to Middle East conflict. But it didn\u2019t change references to Moses, or instruction on how sectionalism and states\u2019 rights were \u201ccontributing factors\u201d to the Civil War, while also noting in the curriculum that slavery was a \u201ccentral cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe that some of the events that happened long before this became a boiling point for war was the fact that they did not want to be told what to do by the central government,\u201d Pat Hardy, a Republican from Fort Worth, said of the Civil War, adding that southern states were \u201cvery, very independent\u201d and didn\u2019t like Washington telling them what to do.\n\nRuben Cortez, a Democrat from the Texas-Mexico border city of Brownsville, responded: \u201cI think we just need to do the right thing, and I think I better stop talking before I get upset.\u201d\n\nMarisa Perez-Diaz, a Democrat from suburban San Antonio, said the curriculum wording was meant to skirt \u201cthe real issue, which is slavery.\u201d\n\nNo changes were made despite nearly 200 historians and scholars signing a petition circulated by the Texas Freedom Network, a watchdog group and frequent board critic, which said such standards \u201cresurrect the \u2018Lost Cause\u2019 myth, a long-discredited version of history first promoted in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to glorify the Confederate past and reinforce white supremacist policies.\u201d", "CHESHIRE, Conn.

It\u2019s really bad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is happening because we have a problem: global warming, and we must address it. We\u2019ve been talking about this for a very long time. Brilliant scientists have been talking about this for a very long time. We have a very short window where we can make change so must do it.\u201d\n\nThe awards \u2014 celebrating \u201cgame changers, rule breakers and trailblazers\u201d \u2014 included honorees such as Chrissy Teigen, Janelle Monae, Emma Gonzalez and Aly Raisman, as well as presenters such as Claire Danes, John Legend, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Padma Lakshmi.\n\nMJ Rodriguez, who presented Monae\u2019s award, said being around so many strong women was encouraging. \u201cI get to be around women who have implemented so much change in the world, not only through their art, but through their works, their action,\u201d Rodriqguez said. \u201cSo, to be around strong women like that, it makes me feel like I\u2019m doing something right.\u201d\n\nAt the Glamour Women of the Year Awards, Chrissy Teigen talks about the year of the woman, Janelle Monae hypes Michelle Obama's memoir, while Alicia Silverstone urges personal action on climate change. (Nov. 13)\n\nAnother woman getting high praise, although not in attendance, was former first lady Michelle Obama. Monae said she can\u2019t wait to read her new memoir, \u201cBecoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited about it. I\u2019ve already preordered my copy,\u201d Monae said. \u201cShe\u2019s a phenomenal woman, whether she\u2019s writing a book or just talking to her one on one privately. She\u2019s exceptional and I\u2019m so proud of her.\u201d\n\nBut the wildfires came up again and again, with some attendees saying the flames are part of a larger issue \u2014 global warming.\n\n\u201cSo many people have lost their homes and it is climate change. It\u2019s a problem,\u201d said actress Andie MacDowell. \u201cAnd until we start accepting and exploring that and what are we going to do, we\u2019re not going to solve the problem.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://www.glamour.com/inspired/women-of-the-year", "Here are excerpts from recent editorials in Oklahoma newspapers:\n\nThe Oklahoman. Nov. 13, 2018.\n\n\u2014 Teachers and activists not always on same page\n\nDuring this year\u2019s teacher walkouts, activists vowed to \u201cremember in November.\u201d The implied message was Republican candidates would face rough sledding. That didn\u2019t happen. Republicans continued to dominate statewide elections and maintained supermajority control in both legislative chambers.\n\nThat said, education was a top issue and many educators successfully ran for office. But the activist groups making the most noise, including teachers\u2019 unions, had little to do with those outcomes and sometimes stretched the truth to suggest otherwise.\n\nIn May, Oklahoma Parents and Educators for Public Education, a group active on social media, issued candidate endorsements. The group labeled now Gov.-elect Kevin Stitt \u201cdangerous for public ed\u201d because he wanted to fund teacher pay raises without tax increases. The label clearly didn\u2019t hurt Stitt, who receive a record number of votes for a gubernatorial candidate.\n\nThe group slapped its \u201cdangerous\u201d label on numerous Republican and Democratic candidates running for statewide and legislative offices, yet 13 of those candidates won, including Stitt, Sens. Marty Quinn and Mark Allen; Reps. Tom Gann, Sean Roberts, Chad Caldwell, Tommy Hardin, Todd Russ and Lewis Moore; and Reps.-elect Jim Olsen, Denise Crosswhite Hader, Jay Steagall and Ajay Pittman.\n\nSeveral incumbents were declared \u201cdangerous\u201d after they voted for tax increases and teacher raises.\n\nThe Oklahoma Education Association touted the \u201cOklahoma Education Caucus,\u201d a list of teachers or individuals otherwise affiliated with schools who were running for office. The union identified 60 general election candidates as educators, including 56 running for legislative seats. Fifteen of those 56 won election.\n\nBut in its 2018 election guide, the OEA\u2019s Fund for Children and Public Education endorsed just five of the 15 winning teacher candidates. And several winning teachers opposed portions of the OEA\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn its questionnaire, the OEA asked candidates if they would \u201coppose all\u201d the following policies: authorization of new charter schools by the state Board of Education, education savings accounts, and even the Opportunity Scholarship Fund, which provides a tax credit to those who donate to private-school scholarship funds for needy children.\n\nRep.-elect Toni Hasenbeck, a Republican and seventh-grade teacher at Elgin, rejected that demand, writing, \u201cWe must realize Charter Schools are public schools.\u201d Rep.-elect Kelly Albright, a Democrat who teaches third grade at an Oklahoma City charter school, also declined to embrace the union\u2019s anti-school choice position. Sen.-elect David Bullard, a Republican and longtime teacher from Durant, is another school choice supporter.\n\nOn the other hand, Reps. Donnie Condit and Karen Gaddis, two incumbent Democrats and former educators who received OEA endorsements, were ousted.\n\nThe OEA says 25 educators will serve in the Legislature. Four years ago, at least 20 legislators were former teachers, administrators or school board members.\n\nThe Legislature benefits from a diverse membership representing different backgrounds, including teachers. But it\u2019s wrong to assume all educators walk in lockstep or parrot the views of teachers\u2019 unions and activist groups, let alone owe their campaign success to them.\n\n___\n\nTulsa World.

That\u2019s right, the Kaiser foundation is going to pay people $10,000 to live in Tulsa for a year\n\nThe George Kaiser Family Foundation has come up with another bright idea \u2014 a bold and creative plan that is sure to catch a lot of attention.\n\nThe foundation \u2014 the guys behind Gathering Place, Guthrie Green and dozens of other innovative ideas that invest in Tulsa\u2019s current and potential futures \u2014 and the city are rolling out Tulsa Remote, which will offer a $10,000 grant, free working space, discounted rent and more to talented people who will move to and work remotely from Tulsa for a year.\n\nWhat?!\n\nThat\u2019s right, Mr. Programmer, Ms. Entrepreneur, we\u2019ll give you $10,000, and all the rest of that stuff just to telecommute for 12 months. No Austin traffic. No New York City crime. No Boston winter.\n\nThe underlying gamble is this: After 12 months, the young talent will grow to love Tulsa and the remote workers will want to stay here. In itself that\u2019s not such a big payout \u2014 one more white collar worker in Tulsa \u2014 but its potential is fascinating. The program will create a pool of young, tech-savvy innovators and thought leaders who will think of Tulsa as home for at least a year, maybe more. Could we win the race to finding the next Bill Gates? Maybe we\u2019ll create a cohort of smaller success stories \u2014 new Tulsans with new ideas instead.\n\nThere\u2019s not a penny of public money involved. The funds for this effort are provided exclusively by GKFF, which is as it should be. It\u2019s a gamble to see if we can win the hearts and minds of future leaders.\n\nObviously, the folks at the Kaiser foundation love Tulsa, and they\u2019re willing to stake their own money on the chance that other people \u2014 strangers to the city now \u2014 will love it, too, if they just have a little incentive.\n\n___\n\nMuskogee Phoenix.

(AP) \u2014 A study of whether ingredients extracted from marijuana can reduce seizures in children is moving ahead in Mississippi.\n\nThe University of Mississippi Medical Center announced last week that the six-month trial began early last month, after years of bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nThe state Legislature carved out a narrow exception in state law forbidding marijuana possession to allow the study in 2014, but it had been stalled for more than four years awaiting federal approval. While scientific papers have been written about the compound, cannabidiol, Dr. Brad Ingram said this is the first rigorous controlled study.\n\nIngram told The Associated Press that 10 children and teens between 8 and 19 are taking part in the study. All have severe forms of epilepsy and uncontrolled seizures that don\u2019t respond well to current medicines. That means children may not be able to sleep, walk, or do other daily tasks.\n\nThe medical center had to win approval from the FDA and DEA before it could move ahead, and get the National Institutes of Health to agree to give the marijuana to the study. That\u2019s because the marijuana grown at a University of Mississippi center in Oxford is actually owned by the federal government. Ingram said the medical center also had to get its research methods approved internally at the university.\n\n\u201cGiving children a marijuana-containing compound took some work,\u201d he said, noting that drug research typically starts with adults and not children.\n\nThe extract, which is legally a controlled substance, is prepared from a special type of marijuana that has a high concentration of a compound called cannabidiol. There\u2019s a low concentration of THC, the psychotropic element that causes marijuana users to get high. The marijuana is processed in Oxford and shipped to Jackson, where a pharmacist adds it to sesame oil for patients to take orally or through a feeding tube.\n\nIngram says the study aims to find out whether cannabidiol is safe, has harmful interactions with other drugs and helps patients.\n\n\u201cThese kids are very, very sick,\u201d he said. They\u2019re not currently responding to what\u2019s on the market to help.\u201d\n\nHe said preliminary results are encouraging, but it\u2019s too early to draw any conclusions, especially because of the small size of the study. Ingram said that if the study is promising, he will seek to widen the number of participants.\n\nAshley Durval lobbied on behalf of her daughter, Harper Grace, for the bill to be passed. Durval, however, said her daughter isn\u2019t a part of the study because there are other children who are sicker.\n\n\u201cA lot of people got this misconception that just because Harper Grace\u2019s name is on the bill, she would automatically be in the study,\u201d she said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Durval isn\u2019t eager for her daughter to benefit from the medication, if it\u2019s found to be effective.\n\n\u201cDr. Ingram knows where I stand and how bad we want to try it,\u201d she said.\n\nDurval said she has decided not to seek cannabidiol through other channels, even though she said that\u2019s possible with marijuana legalization in some states. However, Durval said she\u2019s now involved with an effort to put a referendum on Mississippi ballots in 2020 allowing wider medical marijuana use.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy .", "", "SHARON, Vt.

(AP) \u2014 Amazon stands to get more than $1.5 billion in grants and tax breaks from New York state in exchange for bringing at least 25,000 workers to a new campus in Queens, a record-setting incentive package that was both cheered and jeered Tuesday by elected officials in the city.\n\nAt a celebratory news conference, Gov. Andrew Cuomo acknowledged that the economic development plan offered to Amazon to move to Long Island City was the richest in state history.\n\nThe company would get city and state help settling into a site along a boat basin on the East River, now occupied by a gritty mix of private industrial buildings, parking lots and city-owned properties. Amazon would invest $2.5 billion of its own money to create the campus, and if it hits its hiring and building targets, the company would get $1.2 billion in tax credits over 10 years plus a cash grant of $325 million.\n\nNew York\u2019s incentives were nearly triple those offered by Virginia, which also landed 25,000 Amazon jobs in the Washington suburbs.\n\nBut Cuomo, a Democrat, insisted it would pay off with $27.5 billion in new tax revenue. He said that amounted to a $9 return for every dollar of public funds spent.\n\n\u201cThis is a big moneymaker for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt costs us nothing \u2014 nada, niente, goose egg. We make money doing this.\u201d\n\nThe plan was immediately assailed by others as a corporate giveaway.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat newly elected to Congress from Queens, said on Twitter that her constituents were outraged that the company would be getting so much public support \u201cat a time when our subway is crumbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on good healthcare, living wages, affordable rent. Corporations that offer none of those things should be met w/ skepticism,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCity Council Speaker Corey Johnson said he was skeptical of the plan and couldn\u2019t understand why a company as rich as Amazon would need any public support. State Sen. Michael Gianaris and City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, also condemned the deal.\n\n\u201cWe are witness to a cynical game in which Amazon duped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth for a promise of jobs that would represent less than 3 percent of the jobs typically created in our city over a 10-year period,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nMore powerful city Democrats, though, lined up in support of the project, which represented a rare moment of close cooperation between Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat but frequent political rival.\n\nDe Blasio, who campaigned for office on a promise to give more thought to regular New Yorkers than big corporations, called the deal \u201can extraordinary day for Queens.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity to create 25,000 mostly well-paying jobs outside well-off Manhattan, he said, trumped concerns about whether the project would overburden the neighborhood\u2019s subways, schools or sewers. He promised it would benefit even residents of a nearby public housing development, one of the nation\u2019s largest.\n\nPart of the deal involved setting aside part of expected new tax revenue for projects that would benefit all of Long Island City and western Queens, not just the area being taken over by Amazon, he said.\n\nNew York\u2019s inventive package would give Amazon roughly $48,000 in benefits for every job it created in the state, compared to $22,000 for Virginia and $13,000 for Tennessee.\n\nAmazon vice president for real estate John Schoettler said the company, which already has a large presence in New York City, planned to start hiring next year.\n\nSecuring part of Amazon\u2019s second headquarters represents Cuomo\u2019s biggest economic development project, topping his \u201cBuffalo Billion\u201d initiative in western New York.\n\nSome of his other initiatives haven\u2019t panned out as hoped. The construction a Tesla solar panel manufacturing plant hasn\u2019t created the number of jobs Cuomo expected.

The list was in two groups: 29 officers whose serious misconduct rendered them problematic as witnesses and 37 others whose offenses were less serious. Those 37 could still testify, but their legal issues had to be shared with defense attorneys.\n\nThe list was drawn up by prosecutors in 2017 at the order of former District Attorney Seth Williams, who ended up resigning in June 2017 after pleading guilty to corruption. Williams created a special police misconduct committee before resigning to identify officers whose testimony might be problematic in criminal cases.\n\nThe lawsuit contends that Krasner is combing through thousands of officers\u2019 personnel files with the intent to add more names to the list. It accuses Kenney, Krasner and Ross of failing to create due process protections for officers and harming the reputations of officers on the list. It asks the court to find that the officials violated officers\u2019 rights and wants it to prevent the mayor and police commissioner from helping Krasner unless due process protections are implemented.\n\nBen Waxman, a spokesman for Krasner, said the office hasn\u2019t seen the lawsuit and could not comment.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nWashington Capitals forward Tom Wilson had his 20-game suspension reduced to 14 games by a neutral arbitrator on Tuesday and became eligible to play immediately, scoring a goal and taking two penalties in 16:47 of ice time at Minnesota in a 5-2 win over the Wild .\n\nWilson already served 16 games of his suspension for an illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist in each team\u2019s preseason finale. The ruling by Shyam Das allowed Wilson to will recoup $378,049 of the $1.26 million he initially forfeited as part of the suspension.\n\nThe 20-game ban handed down by the NHL\u2019s department of player safety came after the 24-year-old Wilson was suspended three previous times in 13 months.\n\n\u201cSome hits, he\u2019s going to have to avoid.

Das also wrote: \u201cThe length of the 20-game suspension imposed was not supported by substantial evidence\u201d and decided on 14 by treating the three-game playoff suspension as six, doubling it given Wilson\u2019s recent history and adding two games for Sundqvist\u2019s concussion and shoulder injury.\n\n\u201cThe league did what they thought was appropriate,\u201d Aston-Reese said recently when asked about Wilson\u2019s latest suspension. \u201cWhen the league comes down like that, you\u2019ve always got to re-think your game.

A gray wolf relocated from the Minnesota mainland to Isle Royale National Park this fall has died. The male wolf was among four taken to the Lake Superior island park as part of a multi-year effort to rebuild its declining wolf population. The other three relocated wolves are doing well. (National Park Service via AP, File)\n\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) \u2014 A gray wolf relocated this fall from mainland Minnesota to Isle Royale National Park has died of unknown causes, officials said Tuesday, a minor setback in a multiyear plan to rebuild the predator species on the Lake Superior archipelago.\n\nThe 5-year-old male was among the first two wolves released at the park Sept. 26 . Staff biologists became concerned in late October when his radio tracking collar indicated he was no longer on the move, park spokeswoman Liz Valencia said.\n\nA team traced the animal and found its carcass, which bore no bite marks or other signs that it had been killed by another wolf. It was taken to a federal wildlife health lab in Madison, Wisconsin, for a necropsy. Results are expected in December, Valencia said.\n\nThe fatality was the second since officials kicked off a plan to take 20 to 30 wolves to the park over the next several years to replenish its depleted population. A female died in a mainland holding facility in September.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not something you\u2019d want to happen but it was not unexpected,\u201d Valencia said. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk operation.\u201d\n\nOthers are likely to die as the Isle Royale project continues, said Rolf Peterson, a Michigan Technological University biologist who studies the park\u2019s wolves and moose. Some won\u2019t make the transition to new habitat smoothly, while others will starve or be killed in territorial disputes with fellow wolves, he said.\n\nPeterson said he hadn\u2019t seen the dead male\u2019s carcass but that hunger or stress were among possible factors.\n\nIt would be hard for a single wolf to bring down even a young moose, he said, although the island has plenty of beaver on which wolves can feed. Park officials shot six moose and spread some of the meat to give the new arrivals a temporary food supply, but it would have been picked over fairly quickly.\n\n\u201cWolves live a very brutal life,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cTheir normal condition is extremely lean.\u201d\n\nIsle Royale\u2019s wolf numbers averaged in the 20s for decades before plummeting more recently, largely because of inbreeding. Only two remained earlier this year.\n\nScientists say predators are needed to prevent the moose herd, which totals about 1,500, from becoming so large that the voracious animals overeat trees and shrubs.\n\nThe other wolf released Sept. 26 is doing well, as are two others that arrived in October, Valencia said. Counting the two aging survivors, the park now has five wolves.\n\nThe newcomers were trapped on the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reservation in Minnesota. More are expected in January from the Canadian province of Ontario. Plans call for relocating additional wolves from Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.", "This Thursday, Nov. 8, 2018 photo shows part of an ingredient label, which lists \"artificial flavoring,\" on a packet of candy in New York. In November 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has decided to give companies two years to purge their products of the six ingredients, described only as \u201cartificial flavors\u201d on packages. The words \u201cartificial flavor\u201d or \u201cnatural flavor\u201d refer to any of thousands of ingredients. (AP Photo/Patrick Sison)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Six artificial flavors are being ordered out of the food supply in a dispute over their safety, but good luck to anyone who wants to know which cookies, candies or drinks they\u2019re in.\n\nThe dispute highlights the complex rules that govern what goes in our food, how much the public knows about it, and a mysterious class of ingredients that has evolved over decades largely outside of public view.\n\nOn food packages, hundreds of ingredients are listed simply as natural flavor or artificial flavor. Even in minute amounts, they help make potato chips taste oniony or give fruit candy that twang.\n\n\u201cThe food system we have is unimaginable without flavor additives,\u201d said Nadia Berenstein, a historian of flavor science based in New York.\n\nThe flavors are also at the center of a dispute over how ingredients should be regulated.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is giving companies two years to purge their products of six artificial flavors \u2014 even though the FDA made clear it believes the ingredients are safe in the trace amounts they are used.\n\nThe six artificial flavors in question, with names like methyl eugenol, benzophenone, ethyl acrylate and pyridine, are used to create cinnamon or spicy notes, fruity or minty flavors, or even hints of balsamic vinegar.\n\nThe FDA and the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association, an industry group, did not respond when asked for examples of products the six ingredients are used in. But they noted in statements that the compounds have natural counterparts in foods like basil, coffee, grapes and peppermint, and that the action does not affect the naturally derived versions.\n\nThe FDA said it had to order the artificial versions out of the food supply because of a lawsuit brought by consumer advocacy groups that cited a 60-year-old regulation known as the Delaney clause. The rule prohibits additives shown to have caused cancer in animals, even if tested at doses far higher than what a person would consume.\n\nIn a statement, the flavor industry group said the Delaney Clause doesn\u2019t allow regulators to assess an ingredient\u2019s risk based on modern scientific understanding, but that changing it would require an act of Congress. As far back as 1981, the Government Accountability Office issued a report saying the clause should be re-examined because of its inflexibility.\n\nChristopher Kemp, a professor of cancer biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, doesn\u2019t think the rule is necessarily too strict a threshold. He said animal studies provide the strongest evidence about cancer risk in humans, and that it is better to err on the side of caution.\n\nErik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the groups that sued over the six ingredients, said it\u2019s also unknown what effect they might have when used in combination with other ingredients. And since they\u2019re listed only as \u201cartificial flavor,\u201d he said people don\u2019t know in what concentrations they\u2019re used in particular products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all secret. You can\u2019t pick up an ice cream or chewing gum or a baked good and have any idea what chemicals are in there,\u201d he said.\n\nBerenstein, the flavor science historian, said the ingredients in flavors don\u2019t have to be specified in part because regulators decided long ago that listing the names of compounds on packages might just confuse people. And she stressed that flavors are used in infinitesimal amounts. In 2015, the flavor industry estimates just 40 pounds of one of the now banned artificial ingredients was produced.\n\nBut Bernstein said a more robust regulatory system might inspire greater public confidence about flavors.\n\nIn a separate but related lawsuit, the FDA is also facing a challenge over its oversight of the universe of ingredients companies can put into foods, including artificial flavors.\n\nNew flavors, sweeteners and other ingredients can go through an FDA petition process to be approved as food additives. But another option lets manufacturers deem their own ingredients to be \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no clear rule for when ingredients should take one path or the other. The artificial sweetener Splenda is an approved food additive. Another sweetener, stevia, was declared GRAS by manufacturers.\n\nThe six artificial flavors in question were approved food additives, along with dozens of other synthetic flavors . The flavor industry group also regularly declares other ingredients like them to be GRAS, without formal review by the FDA.\n\nCritics say GRAS determinations were meant for basic ingredients like salt and vinegar, not highly engineered ingredients. The advocacy groups suing the FDA say the GRAS option has turned into a loophole that lets companies approve all sorts of ingredients without public scrutiny, including artificial flavors.\n\nIn September, a judge allowed the legal challenge to move forward.\n\n___\n\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi .", "VANCOUVER, Wash.

The long-awaited reopening of a vital border crossing between Syria and Jordan earlier this month was supposed to bring relief to Lebanese farmers and traders looking to resume exports to Gulf countries. But the commerce has so far been complicated by politics, high transit fees and fighting over which trucks pass through which country. (AP Photo/Hussein Malla)\n\nAL-MASNAA, Lebanon (AP) \u2014 Lebanese exporters rejoiced last month when the Syrian government opened a key land crossing with Jordan that had been closed by years of war, restoring a much-needed overland trade route to lucrative Persian Gulf markets.\n\nBut lingering disputes between Lebanon and Syria, and political gridlock in Beirut, mean that many Lebanese businesses still rely on longer and costlier transport by sea, further stalling efforts to restore an economy battered by years of war in its larger neighbor.\n\nThe reopening of the Naseeb-Jaber crossing allowed Mohammed Araji, owner of a trucking firm in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa Valley, to retrieve two trucks that had been stranded in Jordan since 2015, when Syrian rebels captured the crossing. Two other of his refrigerator trucks had been parked in front of his house for the last three years.\n\nEven before the crossing officially closed, his brother was briefly abducted by rebels while driving a truck through Syria, underscoring the perils they faced in trying to keep the route open.\n\nThe crossing was Lebanon\u2019s \u201clung,\u201d Araji said, and its closure was a \u201cdeath blow\u201d to the economy, affecting farmers, merchants, industrialists and drivers. So he was pleased when Syrian government forces reopened the crossing and secured the route.\n\nBut for weeks he was unable to find exporters ready to give him shipping contracts. Finally, on Saturday, he sent his first truckloads to Saudi Arabia after offering an exporter an attractive price.\n\n\u201cPeople are still waiting to see what will happen,\u201d he said.\n\nThe land route through Syria, Jordan and Iraq is vital to Lebanon, which is squeezed between Syria, the closed border with Israel, and the sea. Lebanon\u2019s exports plunged from a high of 78 percent of GDP in 2008 \u2014 three years before the start of Syria\u2019s civil war \u2014 to a low of 36 percent in 2017.\n\nBefore Naseeb\u2019s closing, more than 250 trucks a day headed from Lebanon to markets in Syria, Jordan, Iraq and the Gulf. After the closure, that dropped to some 300 trucks in a good month, bound only for Syria, customs officials said.\n\nAn estimated 550,000 tons of vegetables and fruits a year used to be exported through the Syria-Jordan crossing, according to Ibrahim Tarshishi, head of the Bekaa farmer\u2019s union. Since the shutdown, that flow has dropped by nearly 40 percent, to no more than 330,000 tons. Exports from Bekaa to Saudi Arabia have dropped by 60 percent, according to figures from the Bekaa chamber of commerce.\n\nAfter the crossing reopened, Syria and Jordan imposed new transit tariffs on trucks heading to the Gulf. The Syrian increase alone was five-fold, Tarshishi said. Lebanon meanwhile subsidizes transport by sea.\n\nTraders hope improved ties between Syria and Lebanon will lead to reduced tariffs, but Lebanon\u2019s political leaders are fiercely divided between supporters and opponents of President Bashar Assad, and they have been unable to form a government since elections in May.\n\nContacts among Lebanese and Syrian officials remain personal and partisan \u2014 and some complain Syria is using the tariffs to force normalization. Experts say opaque policies and decision-making have also hindered trade.\n\nCharles Zarzour, the head of the government agency for agricultural exports and imports, said the opening of the crossing has at least offered \u201cpsychological relief\u201d to traders.\n\n\u201cGod willing, when we have a government in Lebanon, it lays down a wise policy that serves the country\u2019s interest,\u201d including tariff reductions, he told The Associated Press.\n\nSyrian officials had no immediate comment.\n\nTarshishi has pressed for an end to the sea shipping subsidies and other government action to revive land exports, but in the caretaker government \u201cno one wants to take responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nOn a recent afternoon at al-Masnaa, the Lebanese side of the crossing into Syria, nearly a dozen trucks loaded with bananas were bound for Damascus. Just one truck, carrying cleaning supplies, was heading to Jordan. None were bound for the Gulf.\n\nTalal Darwish, a produce exporter, is still sending his grapes, apples and pears by sea, and on a recent day, workers raced to prepare a shipment bound for Kuwait. By land would be cheaper and faster \u2014 a five-day trip as opposed to 25.\n\nHe has heard talk of efforts to reduce tariffs, but says \u201cwe still don\u2019t know officially, so there is no rush.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Hiba Delwati in Beirut contributed to this report.", "In this Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, photo, a woman carries a fire extinguisher past the logo for Google at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai. Internet traffic hijacking disrupted several Google services Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, including search and cloud-hosting services. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 A Nigerian internet service provider said Tuesday that a configuration error it made during a network upgrade caused a disruption of key Google services, routing traffic to China and Russia.\n\nEven with MainOne\u2019s explanation, there was speculation that Monday\u2019s 74-minute data hijacking might not have been an accident. Google\u2019s search, cloud hosting and corporate-focused G-Suite collaborative tools were among services disrupted.\n\n\u201cEveryone is pretty confident that nothing untoward took place,\u201d MainOne spokesman Tayo Ashiru said.\n\nBut Jake Williams, president of Rendition InfoSec and a former U.S. government hacker, said a skeptic should not rule out meddling by a nation-state with something to gain. The level of corruption in a country like Nigeria is well known, he said.\n\nThe type of traffic misdirection involved can knock essential services offline and facilitate espionage and financial theft. It can also be used to block access to information by sending data requests into internet black holes. Experts say China, in particular, has systematically hijacked and diverted U.S. internet traffic.\n\nBut the problem can also result from human error. It\u2019s very difficult to tell the difference, said Williams.\n\nGoogle said it had no reason to believe the traffic hijacking was malicious.\n\nAshiru said engineers at MainOne, a major west African ISP, mistakenly forwarded to China Telecom addresses for Google services that were supposed to be local. The Chinese company, in turn, sent along the bad data to Russia\u2019s TransTelecom, a major internet presence. Ashiru said MainOne did not yet understand why China Telecom did that, as the state-run company normally doesn\u2019t allow Google traffic on its network.\n\nThe traffic diversion into China created a detour with a dead end, preventing users from accessing the affected Google services, said Alex Henthorn-Iwane, an executive at the network-intelligence company ThousandEyes.\n\nHe said Monday\u2019s incident offered yet another lesson in the internet\u2019s susceptibility to \u201cunpredictable and destabilizing events. If this could happen to a company with the scale and resources available that Google has, realize it could happen to anyone.\u201d\n\nThe diversion, known as border gateway protocol route hijacking, is built into the internet , which was designed for collaboration by trusted parties \u2014 not competition by hostile nation-states. Experts say it is fixable but that would require investments in encrypted routers that the industry has resisted .\n\nThousandEyes said the diversion at minimum made Google\u2019s search and business collaboration tools difficult or impossible to reach and \u201cput valuable Google traffic in the hands of ISPs in countries with a long history of Internet surveillance.\u201d\n\nMost network traffic to Google services \u2014 94 percent as of Oct. 27 \u2014 is encrypted, which shields it from prying eyes even if diverted. But work was interrupted on services like G-Suite, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai in February said had more than 4 million businesses as customers. G-Suite and Google Cloud combined generate about $4 billion in revenue each year.\n\nGoogle did not quantify the disruption other than to say in a statement that \u201caccess to some Google services was impacted.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the phenomenon has occurred before. Google was briefly afflicted in 2015 when an Indian provider stumbled. In perhaps the best-known case, Pakistan Telecom inadvertently hijacked YouTube\u2019s global traffic in 2008 for a few hours when it was trying to enforce a domestic ban. It sent all YouTube traffic into a virtual ditch in Pakistan.\n\nIn two recent cases, such rerouting has affected financial sites. In April 2017, one affected MasterCard and Visa among other sites.

Mike Parson named fellow Republican state Treasurer Schmitt to replace Sen.-elect Josh Hawley as the state's next attorney general on Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. Schmitt was elected treasurer in 2016 after serving as a state senator representing suburban St. Louis. (Kile Brewer/The Jefferson City News-Tribune via AP, File)\n\nJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Tuesday named fellow Republican state Treasurer Eric Schmitt to replace Sen.-elect Josh Hawley as the state\u2019s next attorney general.\n\nSchmitt\u2019s appointment leaves yet another vacancy in an elected statewide office for Parson to fill, which the governor said he\u2019s in the process of doing. Nearly half of Missouri\u2019s statewide executive officeholders have been appointed and not elected to their seats.\n\nParson himself was not elected governor: As the then-lieutenant governor, he took the reins after former Gov. Eric Greitens resigned amid personal and political scandal in June. Voters elected Parson separately from Greitens in 2016. Parson then appointed his replacement , current Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, in a move that Democrats have challenged in court. The case is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court.\n\nSchmitt was elected treasurer in 2016 after serving as a state senator representing suburban St. Louis. Hawley unseated Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill during the Nov. 6 election, and he\u2019s set to be sworn in as the state\u2019s next U.S. senator in January.\n\nParson said he wanted to appoint someone who had already been \u201cthoroughly vetted by the people of Missouri\u201d through an election. He said Schmitt \u201chas a clear understanding and respect for the rule of law, is a proven leader and is fully qualified\u201d to be attorney general.\n\n\u201cAs the lawyer for 6 million Missourians, including the guy driving the big rig working his tail off and the waitress working two jobs to make ends meet, I\u2019m their lawyer,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight for them and make sure they\u2019re treated fairly.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Missouri political scientist Peverill Squire said the appointees will have an advantage when they\u2019re up for election in 2020 and can leverage their offices to build name recognition. That, he said, \u201cmay give the voters less of an opportunity to make those decisions than they might otherwise enjoy.\u201d\n\nHe also said there\u2019s less of a firewall between Parson and his appointees, which could raise concerns if Schmitt is ever called on to investigate the governor, as Hawley did with Greitens.\n\n\u201cThe question then becomes whether that person is in a position where they would be able to challenge the governor if the governor did something that might raise legal or constitutional concerns,\u201d Squire said. \u201cThat\u2019s generally why most states have opted to have an elected state attorney general, because that does provide for an independent view of what\u2019s going on in state politics separate from the governor.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a reporter Tuesday about whether voters should have confidence in their unelected leaders, Parson said: \u201cI hope they do.\u201d\n\nHawley launched an investigation of Google, a review of possible clergy abuse and added Missouri to a multistate lawsuit against former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law during his short time in office. Parson said Schmitt and Hawley will discuss how to handle pending state lawsuits later.\n\nSchmitt grew up in the St. Louis suburbs, graduated from Truman State University and earned a law degree from Saint Louis University. He served as an alderman in his suburban St. Louis home of Glendale before voters elected him to the state Senate in 2008 and again in 2012.\n\nHe\u2019s often said his work in public office has been influenced by his son, Stephen, who was born with a rare condition that causes tumors on his organs. He also has epilepsy, is on the autism spectrum and is nonverbal.\n\nAs a state senator, Schmitt passed legislation to require insurance coverage for some children with autism-related disorders and pushed through a bill allowing epileptic patients to use a cannabis extract for treatment. Schmitt, while running for treasurer, also sponsored a measure that created MO ABLE accounts, which allow someone with a disability or their family to open a tax-exempt savings account to pay for related expenses. The state treasurer oversees the program.\n\nSchmitt also notably sponsored a Missouri law that capped profits that cities and other municipalities can keep from traffic tickets and court fines, a policy goal that gained traction after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson.\n\nBrown\u2019s shooting didn\u2019t involve a traffic stop; the black, unarmed 18-year-old was walking in the street when white police Officer Darren Wilson stopped him in August 2014. But Brown\u2019s death and the sometimes violent protests that followed drew attention to some residents\u2019 and legal advocates\u2019 concerns about the generally white police force\u2019s treatment of people in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb, including the use of police to collect revenue through traffic fines and court fees.\n\nThe Missouri Supreme Court later overturned parts of the law that imposed a lower cap on St. Louis-area municipalities than on other areas of the state.\n\nSchmitt won the treasurer\u2019s seat in 2016 by a 17-point margin over his Democratic rival. According to his office, he received more votes than any other treasurer in state history.\n\nWealthy businessman and prolific Missouri political donor Rex Sinquefield gave $750,000 to Schmitt\u2019s campaign for treasurer.

He was staying at the same tent shelters set up for the first caravan at a sports stadium in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cEver since I left home I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy,\u201d said Hernandez, who sobbed quietly as he thought of the two sons, Mateo and Steven, he left at home. \u201cThey can put a million soldiers or whatever they want on the border, we are going to make the attempt to get across.\u201d\n\nBut things were especially tough for the first caravan. The estimated 6,000 Central Americans left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway toll plaza to wait for rides to their next destination.\n\nThey thought other buses would be waiting for them to take them through hurricane-ravaged Nayarit to the neighboring state of Sinaloa, farther north. But no other buses showed up and few trucks passed to pick them up, leaving many to walk the 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the state line.\n\nMaria Antonia Martinez, 40, of Ocotepeque trudged along with her 7-year-old daughter after failing to get a ride.\n\n\u201cThey told it was five kilometers (three miles), and that wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Martinez said, after walking five hours in the burning sun along an empty highway.\n\nLate Tuesday, hundreds were still stranded at the toll plaza and bedding down in its side lanes for the night. Those with better luck \u2014 the majority \u2014 made it as far as La Concha, in the Sinaloa state municipality of Escuinapa some 220 miles (356 kilometers) to the northwest.\n\nThe Rev. Miguel Angel Soto, director of the Casa de Migrante en Culiacan, said about 2,000 migrants had arrived in that area. He said the Sinaloa government, the Roman Catholic Church and Escuinapa officials were helping the migrants.\n\nThe priest also said the church had been able to get \u201cgood people\u201d to provide buses for moving migrants northward. He said so far 24 buses had left Escuinapa on an eight-drive to Navojoa in Sonora state.\n\nThe first caravan appears intent on taking the Pacific coast route northward to the border city of Tijuana, which was still about 1,350 miles (2,200 kilometers) away. The migrants have come about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) since they started out in Honduras around Oct. 13.\n\nHowever, some small groups broke off along the way and went on ahead, either using buses, trains or long-haul truck rides to get to the border quicker. Small groups were reported in the northern cities of Saltillo and Monterrey, in the region near Texas.\n\nThe Tijuana city government said Tuesday that about 350 migrants had arrived and were receiving food before being sent to shelters around the city.\n\nJason M-B Wells, executive director of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce, said Tuesday in an email that the Tijuana Secretary of Economic Development and local businesses had identified 3,000 jobs for migrants who decide to stay.\n\nMany say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas, and its government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Some 533 migrants had requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mark Stevenson in Mexico City and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.", "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., holds a news conference with Sen.

Gievers also extended the deadline for a legislative race.\n\nJim Bonfiglio, a Democrat running for the Legislature, filed the lawsuit asking that recount deadlines be suspended.\n\nGievers agreed to the delay because Palm Beach does not have enough machines to do four recounts at the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, if Gievers\u2019 ruling will remain in place.

The Trump administration is opening the door for states to provide more inpatient treatment for people with serious mental illness by tapping their Medicaid programs. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar made the announcement Tuesday. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration Tuesday allowed states to provide more inpatient treatment for people with serious mental illness by tapping Medicaid, a potentially far-reaching move to address issues from homelessness to violence.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar made the announcement Tuesday in a speech to state Medicaid directors, a group that represents Republican and Democratic officials from around the country who are confronting common, deeply-rooted social problems.\n\nA longstanding federal law has barred Medicaid from paying for mental health treatment in facilities with more than 16 beds, to prevent \u201cwarehousing\u201d of the mentally ill at the expense of federal taxpayers. Azar said states will now be able to seek waivers from that restriction, provided they can satisfy certain specific requirements.\n\n\u201cWe have the worst of both worlds: limited access to inpatient treatment and limited access to other options,\u201d said Azar, who stressed that inpatient care has to be combined with community-based services.\n\n\u201cGiven the history, it is the responsibility of state and federal governments together, alongside communities and families, to right this wrong,\u201d Azar added. \u201cMore treatment options are needed, and that includes more inpatient and residential options that can help stabilize Americans with serious mental illness.\u201d\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors called it \u201ca hugely welcome development\u201d that will help states build out a range of services for the mentally ill.\n\nThe lack of in-patient treatment beds for people with mental illness is seen as a common denominator among several national problems: homelessness, police shootings, and acts of mass violence by people with serious mental problems.\n\nAdvocates said it may take a year or more to start seeing results of the new federal policy. States must apply for permission to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They must demonstrate that their plans are part of a \u201ccontinuum\u201d or range of services for mentally ill people.\n\n\u201cWe have decades of no movement on this issue,\u201d said John Snook, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit trying to broaden access to mental health treatment. \u201cThis is the sort of opportunity we have to take advantage of.\n\n\u201cEvery day there is a story about police having to shoot someone with serious mental illness or the glut of mentally ill people in the emergency room,\u201d Snook added. \u201cI think the general public will say the federal government is finally recognizing a problem we\u2019ve been seeing on the ground.\u201d\n\nA decades-old law known as the \u201cIMD exclusion\u201d has stood in the way of Medicaid paying for treatment in larger mental health facilities. IMD stands for \u201cinstitution for mental diseases.\u201d\n\nPressure has been building on lawmakers and the administration to ease the restriction, given the combination of the opioid epidemic and recurring mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut to the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nThe Obama administration began loosening restrictions in 2015 and last year the Trump administration cleared the way for Medicaid waivers to provide inpatient treatment for people with substance abuse problems.\n\nAzar said 13 such waivers have been approved and more are in the works. In Virginia, an expansion of residential drug treatment beds has been linked to a sharp drop in emergency room visits due to opioid overdose.\n\nOne concern about waiving the Medicaid restriction for mental health is that it could cause a spike in federal spending. Advocates respond that similar restrictions aren\u2019t imposed on other diseases, and that treatment may well save society money over the long run by avoiding other costs.\n\nMedicaid won\u2019t approve a mental health treatment waiver unless the state can show federal costs will be no greater than would have otherwise been the case absent a change.", "SMITHFIELD, N.C.

Italy's populist government has proposed a budget that would see its deficit bloat to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, more than three times the target of the previous government. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nMILAN (AP) \u2014 Italy\u2019s populist government maintained its controversial 2.4 percent budget deficit in responding to EU demands for changes, but made tweaks during a late-night Cabinet meeting Tuesday, including adding plans to sell off some government real estate.\n\nDeputy Premier Luigi Di Maio told reporters in Rome that the government was not changing the ambitious social spending plans in its draft budget because \u201cit is our conviction that this maneuver is what the country needs to relaunch.\u201d\n\nThe government has insisted that the spending is necessary to promote growth after years of austerity.\n\nA letter to Brussels being prepared by Economics Minister Giovanni Tria would outline plans to raise cash through the sale of secondary real estate, which Di Maio said would have an impact on Italy\u2019s stubbornly high public debt. He didn\u2019t specify what would be sold, but said it would not include \u201cthe family jewels.\u201d\n\nDi Maio also suggested there would not be a safeguard clause that would trigger spending cuts in the event the deficit target was overshot, as Italian media had reported. He said the government was committed to staying within the 2.4 percent of GDP deficit target.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t play sly foxes with the deficit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time we will maintain commitments to Italians made in the government contract. There will be all the cuts of waste, cuts of useless military spending and there are the social measures to give back social rights to Italians.\u201d\n\nEuropean officials have staunchly opposed the 2.4 percent deficit, which is more than three times the target of the previous government, and at a level that would keep Italy from reducing its debt load as it had promised.\n\nItaly\u2019s debt is currently around 130 percent of GDP, far above the EU limit of 60 percent and the second highest in Europe after Greece. The big concern is that doubts about Italy\u2019s debt could rekindle financial turmoil as well as questions about the future of the euro.\n\nThe European Union rejected Italy\u2019s draft budget, saying it broke the rules, and gave the government until midnight Tuesday to submit a new version. The Italian government could face sanctions if it does not comply.\n\nThe plan to sell real estate was unlikely to persuade Brussels, especially since the positive impact is not assured. Selling government properties was also a hallmark of the technical government of Mario Monti, which had forecast in 2011 raising as much as 30 billion euros by 2020 with the sale of government properties.\n\nThe standoff has unsettled investors, who have sold off Italian debt in recent months, pushing up the country\u2019s borrowing rates.

An annual report released Tuesday shows there were more than 7,100 reported hate crimes last year.

David Ake)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Hate crimes across the United States spiked 17 percent in 2017 \u2014 marking a rise for the third straight year \u2014 with a 37 percent increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes, according to an FBI report released Tuesday.\n\nThere were 7,175 reported hate crimes last year, up from 6,121 in 2016. The FBI\u2019s annual hate crimes report defines hate crimes as those motivated by bias based on a person\u2019s race, religion or sexual orientation, among other categories.\n\nThere was a nearly 23 percent increase in religion-based hate crimes, with more than 900 reports of crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions. The FBI said there were 2,013 hate crimes against African-Americans, a 16 percent increase.\n\nSome of the increases may be the result of better reporting by police departments, but law enforcement officials and advocacy groups don\u2019t doubt that hate crimes are on the rise.\n\nThe report\u2019s release comes about two weeks after a gunman shot to death 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue. The suspect in that shooting, Robert Bowers, 46, expressed hatred of Jews during the rampage and later told police that \u201call these Jews need to die,\u201d authorities said. Bowers was charged with federal hate crimes and other charges.\n\n\u201cThis report provides further evidence that more must be done to address the divisive climate of hate in America,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cThat begins with leaders from all walks of life and from all sectors of society forcefully condemning anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate whenever it occurs.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has said it is prioritizing hate crimes prosecutions and created a specialized initiative last month, which includes a website for hate crimes resources.\n\nMore than half of the reported hate crimes in 2017 were motivated by bias against a person\u2019s race or ethnicity, according to the report.\n\nThere were 1,130 reported incidents targeting people because of their sexual orientation, including 679 anti-gay hate crimes, a small increase compared to 2016. Anti-Muslim hate crimes were down about 11 percent, according to the report.\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said the crimes were \u201cdespicable violations of our core values as Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis report is a call to action \u2014 and we will heed that call,\u201d Whitaker said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe Department of Justice\u2019s top priority is to reduce violent crime in America, and hate crimes are violent crimes.\u201d\n\nThe FBI says although the number of attacks has increased, so has the number of law enforcement agencies reporting data on hate crimes. About 1,000 additional police agencies reported information in 2017 compared with previous years, the FBI said.\n\nCritics have long warned that the data may be incomplete, in part because it is based on voluntary reporting by police agencies across the country.\n\nThe Justice Department said last month that 88 percent of police departments that provided data for the 2016 annual report had reported zero hate crimes. An Associated Press investigation in 2016 found that more than 2,700 city police and county sheriff\u2019s departments across the country had not submitted a single hate crime report for the FBI\u2019s annual crime tally during the previous six years.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said some of police departments in major U.S. cities didn\u2019t report hate crimes as part of the annual report, including the Honolulu Police Department, Indianapolis Police Department and police in Kansas City, Kansas. Other departments, like the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and police in Miami, Florida and Newark, New Jersey, reported zero hate crimes.\n\nLast month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the Justice Department\u2019s new hate crime initiative was \u201ctaking on the challenging task of addressing the gap in hate crime statistics\u201d and officials were reviewing the \u201caccuracy of those reports.\u201d\n\nRosenstein cautioned that just because hate crimes aren\u2019t being reported doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t happening.

Without an established chain of command, according to the filing, presidents could select and then remove a series of attorneys general until they got their way.\n\n\u201cAbsent the Attorney General Succession Act, the President could fire the Attorney General (or demand his resignation), then appoint a hand-picked junior Senate-confirmed officer from an entirely different agency, or a carefully selected senior employee who he was confident would terminate or otherwise severely limit the investigation,\u201d the filing states.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment, though the department was expected to release later this week an opinion from its Office of Legal Counsel defending the legitimacy of Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nWhitaker was appointed last year as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

For that sometimes you need a break.\u201d\n\nWith a 1-1 record in round-robin play, Federer will likely need to defeat Kevin Anderson on Thursday to improve his 14-1 record of reaching the semifinals at the season-ending tournament.\n\nIt will be a repeat of a dramatic Wimbledon quarterfinal earlier this season, in which Anderson came from match point down in the third set to win in five on his route to the final.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy I\u2019m getting a chance to play him again and have a rematch,\u201d Federer said. \u201cHopefully I can take my revenge.

While Federer was able to compensate with his serve, Thiem was left exposed.\n\nThe Austrian\u2019s forehand gifted Federer a break for a 2-1 lead and then his volley came up short to help the Swiss star extend that advantage to 5-2.\n\nFederer, who is chasing a 100th ATP Tour title, started to play more relaxed and seemed content with simply keeping the ball in play and waiting for mistakes. It worked, as another forehand mistake from Thiem put Federer in complete control in the second set.\n\nA Federer backhand up the line set up match point and Thiem\u2019s 34th unforced error \u2014 another volley into the net \u2014 ended the day\u2019s second one-sided contest.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel good out there,\u201d Thiem said. \u201cI was playing very, very bad.

Nov. 12, 2018.\n\nLast year President Donald Trump signed the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act \u2014 commonly called the \u201cForever GI Bill\u201d \u2014 a piece of legislation that greatly expanded educational opportunities for U.S. veterans.\n\nAmong its provisions, the bill eliminated the 15-year deadline for using benefits and expanded access to more service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserves. And it offers scholarships for veterans choosing to study science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nThe legislation was hailed as a landmark achievement. But there\u2019s been a glitch. A big one.\n\nIt seems the Department of Veterans Affairs doesn\u2019t have the information technology infrastructure in place to make sure the benefits reach the veterans. The agency\u2019s workload doubled from September 2017 to September 2018 and they just can\u2019t handle it. The VA estimates 82,000 veterans in college are still waiting for housing stipends. That means some have had to go deeply into debt to cover those expenses and others are facing eviction and homelessness.\n\nWhile thousands of veterans never got promised payments, the VA says more than 300,000 others have been issued late payments or incorrect amounts that do not reflect promised increases for 2018. The agency can\u2019t say for sure when they will be reimbursed for the full amount due.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the way to serve those who served this nation. Congress and the White House had good intentions with this bill. But in expanding the GI Bill they did not include needed funding for the VA to expand its IT capabilities. And now our vets are paying the price.\n\nThe House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs has set up a hearing to look into the matter. Will that accomplish anything? We can only hope.\n\nAt the moment, though, there is no telling when the VA will catch up. In the meantime \u2014 even on the Veterans Day federal holiday \u2014 thousands of U.S. heroes were facing financial disaster through no fault of their own.\n\n___\n\nArkansas Democrat-Gazette. Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nOur country has a troubled history of making it difficult for some people to vote. And how. We still have a couple of years to go before we celebrate the centennial of women\u2019s suffrage. And don\u2019t get us started on Jim Crow. But, it must be realized, We the People have made some good progress over the last few decades of expanding voting rights. And with election day officially behind us, it probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a moment to applaud Arkansas\u2019 system.\n\nThe jury is still out on states like Georgia and North Dakota. (The courts will rule concerning them, probably soon.) But here in Arkansas, recent cries about our voter ID law \u201cdisenfranchising\u201d voters fell silent through the last election period when results spoke for themselves.\n\nNot only did our own Supreme Court uphold the state\u2019s revised voter ID law, evidence of much higher voter turnout than the 2014 midterms should serve as proof our state isn\u2019t actively suppressing votes by anyone. (As Casey Stengel used to say, you can look it up. In this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race, more\u2019n 100,000 people voted as compared to 2014.)\n\nOpponents of our state\u2019s voter ID law claimed that requiring voters to purchase an identification card in order to cast a ballot was essentially a poll tax. But that argument falls apart when you realize our state law allows voters to receive a voter ID card without charge from the local county clerk.\n\nUnable to vote on election day? Arkansas allows a registered voter to visit any polling place two weeks before election day for early voting. To make voting even easier, Arkansas has absentee ballots for those who simply cannot make it to a polling station. Forget your ID? A helpful poll worker will provide you with a provisional ballot. Then you just show up later with your identification, and your ballot will be counted just like anybody else\u2019s.\n\nVoter suppression in Arkansas? If anything, our state makes it pretty easy to vote in each and every election.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the system is perfect. This voter registration by mail business is antiquated and needs to be brought into the 21st century. It\u2019s 2018, and our Legislature needs to create an online voter registration system. It\u2019s a bipartisan issue with legislators like Rep. Greg Leding (D-Fayetteville) and Rep. Aaron Pilkington (R-Clarksville) both expressing support for a hypothetical bill that would make this a reality.\n\nThis is how we form a more perfect union. By getting a little more perfect every few years.\n\n___\n\nNorthwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nOne of the worst pieces of political wisdom, if it\u2019s to be called even that, is that you can\u2019t fight city hall.\n\nCertainly, nobody is guaranteed a victory when it comes to political situations, but what makes sense about raising a flag of surrender before one even tries?\n\nWe suppose the equivalent advice for residents living in unincorporated areas would be \u201cYou can\u2019t fight the county courthouse.\u201d It\u2019s untrue, too.\n\nResistance to government action is hard and can require a heaping spoonful of persistence the likes of which few people can sustain. Government is organized -- mostly. By the time neighbors get wind that something\u2019s going on, government might have been \u201cstudying\u201d an issue for months. Neighbors who suddenly find themselves the subject of government action are often disorganized, scrambling to motivate people toward involvement and, even more difficult, finding a common voice that can resonate with political leaders.\n\nSometimes, they just don\u2019t get it right, even when their concerns are worth considering.\n\nIt sounds like that\u2019s may be what happened the other day at the Washington County Planning Board. Residents of the Wedington Woods area west of Fayetteville showed up at a board meeting with concerns about a red dirt mine they believe to be preparing to open near their homes.\n\nThey were essentially told \u201cwrong time, wrong place.\u201d\n\nAbout a half-dozen people appeared at the planning board but were told at the beginning that the rumored project was not on the meeting\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cWe come here today to try to get on the agenda of the Quorum Court,\u201d resident Dick Johnson said. \u201cWe feel like we deserve a place on the Quorum Court\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nCounty attorney Brian Lester tried to help, advising them they needed to get an elected justice of the peace to put their issue on the Quorum Court\u2019s agenda or they can speak during the public comment period at Quorum Court meetings.\n\nWe\u2019ve always been in favor of public comments at public meetings, Can you imagine anyone being against it? You\u2019d be surprised in some city, county or school board settings.\n\nIt\u2019s not bad advice, but Lester\u2019s first suggestion is the stronger option. Benton and Washington counties both have 15 elected justices of the peace. They each represent a section of the county determined by population. So yes, each resident has one justice of the peace they are directly involved in electing. We suggest, however, that all 15 justices of the peace owe it to all county residents to be prepared to listen and act when an issue arises. In this case, every person concerned about the red dirt mine is a resident of the county each justice of the peace has stepped forward to represent.\n\nThings can get dicey this time of year, right after an election. The Washington County Quorum Court, come January, will have nine new faces. That\u2019s nine of 15 spots in which incumbents are in their final days before the new arrivals are sworn in. It may be a while before the rookies have a handle on how to be a member of the Quorum Court. But they did ask for the job.\n\nOur advice: Contact them all, starting with the incumbent but following up quickly with the newly elected member. In short, expect them to represent the residents.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll always vote the way residents want. No vote can satisfy everyone. But good representation is more than just a vote. It\u2019s assisting residents in getting answers.\n\nSome public officials understand that more than others, but we hope the desperate outcry of neighbors in the Wedington Woods area got the attention of county leaders willing to help. At the least \u2014 the very least \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be hard to find a justice of the peace willing to place the matter on the agenda of a future meeting.\n\nPeople want to be heard by their government representatives. City councils and quorum courts are about as close to \u201cthe people\u201d as government gets. If people like those in the Wedington Woods area feel they aren\u2019t being heard by their local government, that\u2019s a shame.", "Former president of Mexico warns of US trade policy\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I.

The UN-OPCW team also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas twice in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOPCW Director-General Fernando Arias said that a coordinator for the team has already been appointed and more experts and analysts are being hired.\n\n\u201cWe are setting up the team of experts,\u201d Arias said, calling it a \u201csmall but very powerful team\u201d with \u201chigh capacities that will be ready to start working in the first weeks of next year.\u201d\n\nThe organization\u2019s member states are meeting next week and must approve its annual budget, which also will cover the new team\u2019s work.\n\nArias said he was optimistic about the outcome of financial negotiations, \u201cand I think that we\u2019ll have a budget for the organization.\u201d\n\nThe team, expected to comprise of about 10 to 12 investigators supported by experts and chemical inspectors who already work at the OPCW, will be able to look back at attacks for which the previous UN-OPCW team did not apportion blame.\n\nOne notorious allegation still being investigated by weapons inspectors is the suspected chemical attack in April in the Syrian town of Douma. An interim report said that weapons inspectors found \u201cvarious chlorinated organic chemicals\u201d at the site of the alleged Douma attack. Arias said that more samples are being studied to reach a final conclusion.\n\nThe OPCW made headlines last month when Dutch authorities revealed that they had foiled an alleged plot by Russian spies to hack into the organization\u2019s WiFi network using equipment stashed in the trunk of a rental car parked at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the OPCW spying allegation, calling the hacking claim a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\n\nArias said the alleged plot was not the first attempted hack.\n\n\u201cWe have had attacks since the beginning of this year - cyberattacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take that very seriously. It is not my mission to investigate the origin but my mission is to protect the IT system of the organization where we have confidential information.

In the process, the company also has taken care of the one thing critics love to hate about Barbie, her very plastic hourglass physique, by offering the outfits in sizes XS to 4X.\n\nThe collaboration, Barbie x Unique Vintage, celebrates 1950s and \u201960s Babs. The company that sells online and in about 500 boutiques around the world plans to go even bigger for Barbie\u2019s big 6-0 next year, offering key fashion moments from across the rest of her decades.\n\nUntil then, for fall, we caught up with all things Barbie x Unique Vintage in the swanky Jewel Suite designed by jeweler-to-the-stars Martin Katz in the Lotte New York Palace hotel on Madison Avenue. Katz paired a few of the looks with some of his own bling, from $36,000 button earrings in a rainbow of sapphires, garnets and tourmaline to a $48,000 cocktail ring of Bombay spinel cabochons and round diamonds.\n\nBarbie for humans: Doll\u2019s early style drops in new vintage fashion collection. (Nov. 12)\n\nAll of the glam pleases Katie Echeverry. She\u2019s the founder, CEO and creative director of Unique Vintage, an 18-year-old company with 60 employees based in Burbank, California. With her long blonde locks and Barbie-esque dimensions, Echeverry said she was a Babs fan as a girl but was also a \u201ctomboy\u201d who loved to play softball.\n\nDuring a recent round of media interviews explaining how the collab came about, Echeverry donned a Kelly-green shawl dress worn by Barbie in 1962 and done by Unique Vintage in a forgiving stretch fabric. Noteworthy was Echeverry\u2019s most definitely un-Barbie upper-arm tattoo, on proud display in the off-shoulder outfit, as she recalled her luck.\n\n\u201cWhen I emailed Mattel, I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d actually reply back, but they did, and I was thrilled,\u201d Echeverry told The Associated Press. \u201cThey ran with it. I couldn\u2019t believe they hadn\u2019t done it before.\u201d\n\nEcheverry worked closely with Mattel but \u201cthey didn\u2019t dictate what I chose.\u201d Mattel opened its archives to her as she went about duplicating outfits, with adjustments to account for the real human form. She said she chose looks that \u201cspoke to me.\u201d\n\nBarbie, the doll, first hit store shelves in 1959. That year, she stepped out in a swirl of gold and white brocade for evening. The dress was among those Echeverry picked and sells for $118 on uniquevintage.com. The matching collar coat with three-quarter sleeves trimmed in faux fur goes for $148.\n\nUnique Vintage has brought Barbie fashion full circle, in a sense. It was a designer for actual women, Charlotte Johnson, who was hired to be the doll\u2019s first fashion creator. A Mattel team took over soon after Barbie\u2019s debut.\n\nEcheverry\u2019s first Barbie go-around dropped in the spring. Social media fans of vintage and of Barbie took notice and sales have been brisk, she said. For fall, her prices range from $88 for an A-shaped Barbie flare skirt in green with a white hem to $198 for the doll\u2019s red matinee sleeveless sheath dress and short jacket trimmed with calico-colored faux fur.\n\nIt was important to Echeverry to choose looks that have remained iconic through the years but were wearable by women in the broad range of sizes she is committed to providing.\n\n\u201cI was like a kid in a candy store,\u201d she said. After the first season went on sale, Echeverry watched the response online, where nostalgia kicked in among fans who recalled favorite outfits, some gushing how they\u2019d always wondered what it would be like to wear the looks themselves.\n\nThat goes a long way in explaining why Echeverry was more than a little dedicated to getting the clothes right.\n\n\u201cI went online and ordered every single vintage outfit myself. Mattel offered to lend them to me, but I was a little nervous about having some of their archives,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our fittings, we literally had the original Barbie dress next to the model. We moved Barbie. When I sourced fabrics overseas, I had Barbie clothes in my pocket and I was making sure we got as close as possible.\u201d\n\nShe was also dedicated to the price points she knows her buyers are after.\n\n\u201cI know our customer and she doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot of money, and I understand that,\u201d Echeverry said.\n\nUnique Vintage sells shoes, hats, gloves, sunglasses and jewelry to complement the Barbie outfits. The company offers a red pillbox hat, for instance, to go with Barbie\u2019s 1962 red flare coat done in a soft felt with the same swing and puffy three-quarter sleeves and bow the doll wore, down to the white lining done in a white poly satin.\n\nBarbie wore a cloche tweed hat with a rose with her \u201cCareer Girl\u201d tweed pencil skirt set in 1963. Unique Vintage offers a black fascinator with a rose instead, for $22.\n\nAs for her afternoon of glam in the Martin Katz suite, with its shiny black grand piano and sparkling crystal ceiling decor on the 53rd floor of the Towers at Lotte, Echeverry was impressed.\n\n\u201cThis is so glamorous. It\u2019s so much fun. The view\u2019s incredible,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile noting Barbie\u2019s evolution as a \u201cstrong kick-ass woman\u201d over the years, Echeverry said she was ready for a bit of her own reality after her recent promotional go-round.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to find me in a dress,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as this interview\u2019s over I\u2019ll be putting on my jeans and my T-shirt and be back to the regular Katie.\u201d", "Journalists stage a protest in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.Italian journalists have protested across the country against insults from prominent figures in the governing 5-Star Movement.

Aides from both parties say moving ahead depends largely on President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senators have reached a tentative accord on the first major rewrite of criminal justice sentencing in a generation, but now it\u2019s up to President Donald Trump to decide if it\u2019s worth making a push for the sweeping bipartisan bill during the lame-duck session of Congress.\n\nThe package has been a top priority of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and senators presented the ideas to Trump at the White House over the summer. Congressional aides and advocacy groups said lawmakers are close to an agreement on the legislation, which would boost rehabilitation efforts for federal prisoners and give judges more discretion when sentencing nonviolent offenders, particularly for drug offenses.\n\nHolly Harris, executive director of Justice Action Network, a lead advocacy group, said, \u201cWe\u2019re hoping for a full-throated endorsement\u201d from the president.\n\n\u201cThis will be the most significant departure from the failed mandatory minimum policies of the 1990s,\u201d Harris said.\n\nThe bill is a rare bipartisan endeavor in a typically log-jammed Congress and has attracted support from a coalition of liberal and conservative groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and groups backed by the political donors Charles and David Koch. Critics say current sentencing guidelines are unfair and have had a lopsided impact on minority communities.\n\nMark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries and a longtime champion of prison reform, said an endorsement from the National Fraternal Order of Police has been critical in generating momentum for the bill.\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of people who want to get this done,\u201d Holden said.\n\nHe said the legislation would save taxpayer dollars by reducing prison populations and giving federal inmates the opportunity to be better people when they leave prison than when they entered. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be in favor of it if it didn\u2019t protect public safety,\u201d Holden said.\n\nThe Senate package overhauls some of the mandatory sentencing guidelines that have been in place since 1994 legislation approved by Congress and signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton. Talks involved a bipartisan group headed by Sen. Chuck Grassley, the GOP chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Dick Durbin, the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, and others.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s backing remains key to proceeding with any final product.\n\n\u201cSenator Durbin has been negotiating in good faith, but there won\u2019t be any agreement on a criminal justice reform compromise unless and until President Trump supports it and asks the Republicans who control both chambers of Congress to move it forward,\u201d said Emily Hampsten, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Democrat.\n\nGrassley said the bill would be easier to pass after the departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was ousted by Trump last week. Sessions was a longtime opponent of criminal justice reform.\n\n\u201cI think we have a commitment from the Justice Department now to work with us on it,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nKushner may play an outsized role in the final outcome after having steered the legislation this far. \u201cHistory will say this was a man with a mission,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe was really the critical voice that was able to hold the bipartisan alliance together.\u201d\n\nThe federal inmate population has been on the decline since 2013, when it peaked at just more than 219,000. The total now stands at about 181,400, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Still, that\u2019s about triple the number of inmates in federal detention 30 years ago.\n\nThe House approved a prison reform bill in May, but the Senate package makes additional changes and adds the sentencing component.\n\nThe Senate approach would allow thousands of federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It would also lower mandatory minimum sentences for some drug offenses. The life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \u201cthree strikes,\u201d would be reduced to 25 years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would test support for the measure during the lame-duck session.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he talked to the president about the legislation Monday night and that he \u201cseemed supportive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more optimistic than I am now, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Graham said.\n\nAll but two Republicans voted for the House bill when it was overwhelmingly approved in May, 360-59. Democratic lawmakers supported the bill by about a 2-to-1 margin, but opponents voiced concerns that it did not go far enough in giving judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime.\n\nThe House bill directs the Bureau of Prisons to conduct assessments for every offender once he or she is sentenced and to offer rehabilitation plans designed to lower the chance of recidivism. The plans would include vocational training, education, counseling and substance abuse treatment.\n\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police said the extra help should be targeted to those with the lowest risk \u201cto re-offend.\u201d The group said that \u201ctruly dangerous offenders,\u201d such as those who traffic in fentanyl or commit crimes while armed, would be ineligible under the compromise legislation it\u2019s worked on with the Trump administration.\n\nThe debate comes after Florida voters approved a measure restoring the voting rights of felons who have served their sentences. The Freedom Partners Action Fund, backed by the Koch brothers, and the ACLU chapter in Florida called the measure a way to provide a second chance for Floridians who have served their time and paid their debts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AP_Politics", "LINCOLN, Neb.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 A Black Panther \u201cslash claw\u201d and a plastic Power Rangers sword are among the items topping a consumer safety group\u2019s annual list of worst toys for the holiday season.\n\nMassachusetts-based World Against Toys Causing Harm, or W.A.T.C.H., unveiled its 46th annual list of the 10 \u201cworst toys\u201d Tuesday at Franciscan Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nJoan Siff, the nonprofit organization\u2019s president, said many of the toys on the list represent choking, eye and other safety hazards that surface year after year, despite the group\u2019s efforts.\n\nSiff advised parents to shop \u201cdefensively\u201d and not be lulled into a false sense of security because a toy is made by a familiar brand or sold at an established retailer. One child is treated in a U.S. emergency room every three minutes for a toy-related injury, according to the Center for Injury and Research at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nA Cabbage Patch Kids ballerina doll that made this year\u2019s list, for example, is marketed to children ages two and above, but includes a removable tutu and headband that can be choking hazards, said James Swartz, a trial lawyer who serves as W.A.T.C.H.\u2019s director.\n\nA slender mallet that comes with VTech\u2019s caterpillar-shaped electronic xylophone \u2014 a toy made for children as young as 18 months old \u2014 is another similar choking threat, he said.\n\nOther toys on the list included a Nerf gun that fires soft discs, a \u201cstomp rocket\u201d that launches foam-tipped projectiles up to 200 feet in the air and a plastic \u201ccutting fruit\u201d set. The cutting set, which includes a toy knife made out of rigid plastic, is made for children who are older than 2.\n\nBut the Toy Association, an industry trade group that represents most of the toy companies named this year, complained the list is biased, inaccurate and \u201cneedlessly frightening\u201d to parents.The association said many of the hazards highlighted by W.A.T.C.H. are clearly spelled out in the products\u2019 packaging and instructions. It also said only two products listed on the nonprofit\u2019s \u201cworst toy\u201d lists from the five years prior were recalled, and those two had already been pulled before W.A.T.C.H. released its list.\n\nSwartz responded by pointing to a list of dozens of toys that have been recalled or pulled from retailers\u2019 shelves from the early 2000s all the way back to the 1970s, in part by the group\u2019s efforts.\n\nAnd he said providing detailed warning labels \u201cdoesn\u2019t absolve\u201d toy makers from needing to simply design safer items. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to shift the responsibility to parents and consumers,\u201d Swartz said. \u201cThey\u2019re really shirking their responsibility.\u201d\n\nSwartz highlighted Hasbro\u2019s retractable plastic claws for Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, an item featured on this year\u2019s list. The toy gloves come with a warning they should not be used to hit or swing at people.\n\n\u201cWhen you call it a slash claw,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s likely one thing a child is going to do with that claw.\u201d", "PRAGUE (AP) \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s highest legal authority has upheld a ban for the operations of the ride-sharing service Uber in Brno, the second-largest city in the country.\n\nUber was banned after a legal complaint by a taxi company supported from Brno City Hall that claimed new taxi services have to be provided only in line with the law.\n\nUber argued it is not a common taxi company but a court ruled it is.\n\nAn appeals court sided with Uber but the Constitutional Court dismissed its decision Tuesday.

Democratic voters accuse Republicans, who hold the majority, of packing black voters into certain districts to make surrounding districts whiter and more Republican.\n\nA three-judge federal court in Virginia ruled 2-1 in June in favor of the Democratic voters and has appointed a redistricting expert to draw a new legislative map with a Dec. 7 deadline. Kirk Cox, the Republican speaker of the Virginia House, said he is weighing whether to ask the lower court to delay the issuance of a new map until after the Supreme Court rules.\n\nArguments probably will take place in late February, with a ruling likely by late June.

Last year, the justices voted 7-1 to throw out an earlier ruling that had upheld the challenged districts.\n\nWhen the lower court got the case back, it concluded that the 11 districts violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause.\n\n\u201cOverwhelming evidence in this case shows that, contrary to this constitutional mandate, the state has sorted voters into districts based on the color of their skin,\u201d Judges Barbara Milano Keenan and Arenda L.

CNN sued the Trump administration Tuesday, demanding that correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s credentials to cover the White House be returned because it violates the constitutional right of freedom of the press. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CNN took its access battle against the Trump administration to court on Tuesday, demanding the reinstatement of correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s White House credentials because their revocation violates the right of freedom of the press.\n\nBesides seeking an injunction to let Acosta return immediately, CNN is launching a case that will test the ability of government officials anywhere to freeze out a reporter who displeases them.\n\nThe White House, never shy about picking a fight with CNN, says bring it on.\n\n\u201cThis is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nThe administration stripped Acosta of his pass following President Donald Trump\u2019s contentious news conference last week, during which Acosta refused to give up a microphone when the president said he didn\u2019t want to hear anything more from him.\n\nSanders initially explained the decision by accusing Acosta of making improper physical contact with the intern seeking to grab the microphone. But that rationale disappeared after witnesses backed Acosta\u2019s account that he was just trying to keep the mic, and Sanders distributed a doctored video that made it appear Acosta was more aggressive than he actually was.\n\nTrump called Acosta a \u201crude, terrible person,\u201d and Sanders on Tuesday accused Acosta of being unprofessional by trying to dominate the questioning at the news conference.\n\nFor its part, CNN believes the White House is trying to silence a reporter.\n\nTrump has made CNN and its reporters a particular target of his denunciation of \u201cfake news\u201d and characterization of the media as an enemy of the people. CNN CEO Jeff Zucker, in a letter to White House chief of staff John Kelly, called Trump\u2019s attitude toward CNN a \u201cpattern of targeted harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Acosta\u2019s press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials and report the business of the nation to the American people,\u201d said Theodore Olson, former U.S. solicitor general and one of CNN\u2019s lawyers on the case.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association backed the lawsuit, filed in Washington, D.C., district court.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him,\u201d said Olivier Knox, president of the correspondents\u2019 group.\n\nCNN would seem to be on strong legal ground, said Katie Fallow, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute. During the Nixon administration in the 1970s, the Secret Service tried to deny credentials to a reporter from the Nation magazine because he had been involved in physical altercations, but was overruled by the D.C. circuit court, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important, particularly as the president continues to push back on the role of an independent press, to stake out the legal rules that should govern this and not let the president block people from speaking based on their viewpoint,\u201d Fallow said.\n\nCNN said Acosta was given no warning of the action, and no recourse to appeal it. Acosta traveled to Paris to cover Trump\u2019s visit there this weekend and, although given permission by the French government to cover a news event, the Secret Service denied him entrance, the company said.\n\nBecause of this, CNN also has a strong argument to overturn the White House stance based on due process grounds, said Jeff Robbins, a lawyer who focuses on media issues for the firm of Saul, Ewing, Arstein & Lehr in Boston.\n\n\u201cPick your poison \u2014 it\u2019s the Fifth Amendment or the First Amendment,\u201d Robbins said.\n\nLegalities aside, the president has never been afraid to fight the media, believing the stance resonates with his supporters.\n\nAnd Acosta is one of the reporters they dislike the most. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who worked for President George W. Bush, last week dismissed the supposed physical contact with an intern as a reason for banishing Acosta, but said he doesn\u2019t belong in the press room because he\u2019s essentially like an opinion columnist instead of a journalist.\n\nAcosta is a \u201cleft-wing activist\u201d more interested in disrupting the president than in asking serious questions, said Brent Bozell, president of the conservative media watchdog Media Research Center.\n\n\u201cNo one reporter has a constitutional right to access the press briefing room,\u201d Bozell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the prerogative of the White House to decide who gets a pass and who does not.\n\nSanders noted that nearly 50 other people from CNN have White House passes.\n\nAcosta has been a polarizing figure even beyond the distaste that Trump and his supporters have for him. The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank, editorialized last week that Acosta\u2019s encounter with Trump at the news conference \u201cwas less about asking questions and more about making statements. In doing so, the CNN White House reporter gave President Donald Trump room to critique Acosta\u2019s professionalism.\u201d", "STEVENSON, Wash.

Cincinnati (5-4) has lost three of its past four games and is on pace to give up the most yards in a season in NFL history. The Bengals have allowed 500 yards in three straight games, a first for any team in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThey fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday, with Lewis taking over as defensive coordinator in addition to his head coaching duties. Lewis said on Monday that there was a plan to help him do both jobs, but didn\u2019t get specific.\n\nThe Bengals talked to Jackson about becoming Lewis\u2019 special assistant, and he readily accepted the position.\n\n\u201cI have a great comfort level with Hue and his ability to assist me with the day-to-day responsibilities on defense, including analyzing our opponents and helping me on game days with the players and defensive coaches,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nLewis hired Jackson in 2004 \u2014 his second season in Cincinnati \u2014 as receivers coach. He spent three years in the job before moving to the Falcons as offensive coordinator, developing a reputation for creativity. He was the Raiders\u2019 offensive coordinator before moving up to head coach in 2011.\n\nAfter his firing in Oakland, he returned to the Bengals in 2012 as a special assistant working with the defensive backs in 2012. He worked with the running backs in 2013 and was promoted to offensive coordinator a year later when Jay Gruden went to Washington.\n\nThe Bengals had one of their best years on offense in 2015, with Andy Dalton leading the AFC in passer rating.

Jackson wasn\u2019t getting along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley, who also was fired.\n\nEven though Jackson will be working with the defense in his latest incarnation in Cincinnati, it\u2019ll create an awkward dynamic. Dalton developed a close relationship with Jackson, who helped him to his greatest success in the NFL. Bill Lazor is in his first full season as the Bengals\u2019 offensive coordinator.\n\nThe offense is missing receiver A.J. Green indefinitely with an injured toe on his right foot. The starting unit managed only one touchdown during a 51-14 loss to the Saints on Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium, even though New Orleans also has one of the league\u2019s worst defenses.\n\nThe Bengals play at Baltimore (4-5) on Sunday, a game that\u2019s pivotal for both teams. Pittsburgh (6-2-1) has started pulling away atop the AFC North. The Ravens have lost three straight games, and quarterback Joe Flacco has an injured hip that could keep him out of Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nCoach John Harbaugh said on Monday that he\u2019ll decide later in the week if Flacco can play. If not, rookie Lamar Jackson will likely get his first NFL start.\n\nThe Bengals haven\u2019t won a playoff game since the 1990 season, the sixth-longest streak of postseason futility in NFL history.

In all, more than 60,000 people were killed in the camp.\n\nAs the trial opened last week, prosecutor Andreas Brendel detailed how prisoners were killed by being given lethal injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts, shot or starved. Others were forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, or put to death in a gas chamber.\n\nRehbogen said he was unaware of a gas chamber in the camp but suggested he did at least know prisoners were being mistreated.\n\n\u201cThe prisoners were in a terrible state, I was ashamed,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cPity would be the wrong word; it\u2019s difficult to find the right words.

Gunfire erupted and six people died. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up a commission of inquiry, headed by former South African president Kgalema Motlanthe, to probe the killings.\n\nDespite widely published photos and video showing the Zimbabwean army soldiers firing on people in Harare\u2019s streets, the generals said under oath that they do not believe the troops shot at people.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that any of the soldiers fired. Yes, they fired in the air, but I do not believe any could have aimed shots at the civilians. I have no reason to believe that one of the soldiers could have shot and killed those people,\u201d said Zimbabwe Defense Forces Commander Gen. Philip Valerio Sibanda, during the nationally televised hearing.\n\nThe tactical commander of the military unit, Gen. Anselem Sanyatwe, told the commission he suspected \u201cmilitant\u201d opposition activists who deserted from the army could have shot at protesters, a claim repeated by Sibanda.\n\nWhen presented with a photo of a kneeling soldier who appeared to be aiming at protesters, Sanyatwe said the man \u201ctook that position because he was avoiding missiles that were being thrown at him.\u201d\n\nSome inquiry commissioners and people in the public gallery were visibly stunned by the generals\u2019 denials.\n\n\u201cIs that your evidence?\u201d asked Lovemore Madhuku, one of the commissioners, adding that evidence by other witnesses showed that the shootings coincided with the military\u2019s deployment.\n\nSibanda countered that he had \u201cheard gunfire well before the troops deployed.\u201d\n\nMotlanthe said the generals\u2019 denials contradicted evidence so far received by the commission from other witnesses who include victims.\n\nPolice testified that they have not turned up information that would determine who killed the civilians.

(AP) \u2014 A city in New York state has found a novel way of motivating residents to pay their back taxes: personal notes handwritten by city officials.\n\nThe idea stemmed from an experiment on late-tax payments, in which the city of Syracuse partnered with researchers at Syracuse University. City officials wrote and signed thousands of notes by hand, rather than sending standard legal letters demanding payment.\n\nThe result was the city collecting nearly $1.5 million more than it predicted traditional methods alone would have brought in. University researchers estimate that the personal approach brought in 57 percent more revenue from delinquent property owners than the city could expect from using more traditional letters.\n\nThe notes took a less threatening approach, focusing on steps the resident could take to avoid late penalties or legal action. Instead of being addressed \u201cdear property owner,\u201d the notes were all personally addressed to the resident. Each had a brief, handwritten message on the outside of the envelope as well, researchers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of positive outcome that occurs when you aren\u2019t afraid to try something new,\u201d Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh said in a statement.\n\nCollecting late taxes is a big challenge for many cities, which often use computer-generated letters to residents threatening action if the money isn\u2019t paid. The researchers said the experiment could have broad applications to a number of different government services. The researchers said they aren\u2019t aware of any other city in the U.S. using the personalized note method to collect taxes.\n\n\u201cThese are small, simple changes that can have huge payoffs,\u201d said Leonard Lopoo, a Syracuse professor and director and co-founder of Maxwell X Lab, a behavioral research center at Syracuse University\u2019s Maxwell School.\n\nThe lab\u2019s managing director, Joe Boskovski, called the experiment common sense, saying treating people as humans can yield results.\n\nThe findings were first reported by The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mahmoud Illean)\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israelis were choosing their next mayors in dozens of locations across the country Tuesday, with the main focus on the largest city of Jerusalem.\n\nThe vote marks the second round of municipal elections in cities where no candidate secured at least 40 percent support in the Oct. 30 vote. The closest watched runoff race is in Jerusalem, Israel\u2019s proclaimed capital and a place of pilgrimage for billions around the world. While the city\u2019s mayor has little influence over Middle East politics and diplomacy, he presides over the day-to-day life in the hotbed of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has a strong symbolic presence both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe polls were taking place amid the most serious violence between Israel and the Islamic militant Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, since they fought a 2014 war. An election in one regional council in southern Israel near the Gaza border was postponed because of the incessant rocket fire and the violence could drive down voter turnout in other locations near Gaza.\n\nJerusalem is Israel\u2019s poorest city. Its diverse population is split nearly evenly between Palestinians Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews and the rest of the Jewish residents \u2014 both secular and observant.\n\nWith the incumbent Nir Barkat stepping down to run for national office, a quartet of candidates squared off in an ugly campaign to replace him. The runoff features Moshe Lion, a longtime political fixture backed by much of the country\u2019s top leadership, facing off against Ofer Berkovitch, a young secular activist pushing a progressive agenda against religious hard-liners.\n\nLion, a former director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office in the 1990s, enjoys the support of key ultra-Orthodox factions and their representatives in government, as well as that of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and powerful figures in the ruling Likud party. But he has little grassroots support of his own and failed to place even a single representative in the municipal council.\n\nThe 35-year-old Berkovitch heads a joint group of secular and modern-Orthodox Jews that makes up the largest block of the incoming council. He has also been buoyed by a historic split in the ultra-Orthodox electorate, which did not vote en masse in the first round.

With many now joining the military and the modern workforce in growing numbers, he said it was natural they would also break out of their traditional voting patterns.\n\n\u201cThere is a groundswell toward real leadership,\u201d Cohen said at a makeshift campaign office where he tried to convince fellow ultra-Orthodox to vote for his candidate. \u201cI\u2019m here to show that there is another kind of ultra-Orthodox Jew.\u201d\n\nFew Palestinians vote since most consider participation as recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. So the result will likely come down to ultra-Orthodox turnout and how many flip to Berkovitch\u2019s side.\n\nEither way, the winner is going to have to deal with deep divisions in the city after a hotly contested campaign.\n\n\u201cThe number one challenge is of course the diversity of the city.

(Stephanie Taylor/The Tuscaloosa News via AP)\n\nMOUNDVILLE, Ala. (AP) \u2014 The recent recovery of three Native American artifacts stolen nearly 40 years ago could be the thread that unravels the mystery of the greatest antiquities theft in this part of the world.\n\nHundreds of pottery vessels, bottles, bowls, ornaments and jewelry items were stolen from the Erskine Ramsey Archaeological Repository at the University of Alabama\u2019s Moundville Archaeological Park in 1980. It was a shot in the dark when archaeologists and others contributed to a reward fund for information, which was announced in May.\n\nThe publicity worked, leading to the recovery of three vessels in August.\n\n\u201cWe were all thinking we\u2019d go to our graves without anything turning up from this burglary,\u201d Jim Knight, curator emeritus of American Archaeology for the Alabama Museum of Natural History at the university, said at a news conference Monday. \u201cThis is one of the most exciting things that has happened during my archaeological career.\u201d\n\nOfficials aren\u2019t releasing any information about the criminal investigation, only saying that no one has been arrested and no one has claimed any of the $25,000 reward money.\n\nThe FBI investigated, but dropped the case in the late 1980s. It is a federal offense to steal \u201cany object of cultural heritage\u201d from a museum. It is also illegal to possess such items knowing that they have been stolen.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a whole lot of hope for actual recovery,\u201d said John Abbott, director of Museum Research and Collections for the Alabama Museum of Natural History. \u201cIn fact, I was stunned when there were some that turned up.\u201d\n\nKnight said in a 2003 interview with The Tuscaloosa News that it would be equally plausible if an artifact surfaced at a flea market in Tuscaloosa or in a multimillion dollar collection in Japan.\n\nKnight helped organize Associates for the Recovery of Moundville Artifacts, which established the reward fund and contributed $13,000. After the announcement of the reward, other donors came up with $12,000 more \u2014 bringing the total in the fund to $25,000.\n\nExcavated in the 1930s, the stolen artifacts made up about 20 percent of the museum\u2019s entire vessel collection. The three that were recovered were ceremonial, Knight said. All were in pristine condition, he said, with no chips or damage and still marked with the original tags.\n\n\u201cThese are special because they depict supernatural creatures,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is extremely important for Alabama\u2019s heritage, for the Southeast and the eastern United States\u2019 heritage.\u201d\n\nOne vessel depicts an engraved skull and skeletal forearm bones and a hand design with straight crosses inside rather than the eye many people are familiar with. The other two vessels depict a winged serpent, a deity that features a rattlesnake tail, wings and deer antlers.\n\n\u201cThere are mammals, birds and serpents combined into this dragon-like creature,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThis was important in Moundville, the rattlesnake god that\u2019s master of the beneath-world.\u201d\n\nBill Bomar, executive director for University of Alabama Museums, noted the advances in research into iconography, symbols and art that have taken place since the theft nearly four decades ago. Faculty and students will also be able to study whether the vessels originated or were traded here.\n\n\u201cAll of this has advanced in the last 40 years, and we haven\u2019t had these artifacts to do those kinds of studies on,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully with these, and any additional ones that are recovered, our information about Moundville is going to increase greatly.\u201d\n\nAlex Benitez, director of Moundville Archaeological Park, said the vessels will soon be on display at the park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited and look forward to putting them on exhibit very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is for all Alabamians.\u201d\n\nThe Mississippian Indians settled in what is now the Moundville area at the beginning of the 11th century. The area reached its peak activity and population around 1300 A.D., when it had about 1,000 residents. Around 10,000 resided in the Black Warrior Valley flood plain.\n\nIt has been referred to as \u201cthe New York City of its time,\u201d Knight said, and nearby residents might not be aware of just how unique the site is.\n\n\u201cI hope this does stir interest,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just among people nationally who may have never heard of Moundville before, but also for the local people who visited for fourth grade Alabama history but have never been back.\u201d", "Police gather outside the I Don't Care Bar and Grill at the scene of an officer-involved shooting Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Muskogee, Okla.

For many families, dressing up in matching pajamas is a Christmas Eve and Christmas morning tradition _ even when the kids get older. (Amy Wilson via AP)\n\nAmy and Kevin Wilson began giving their three sons matching pajamas at Christmas for a reason: They wanted their little ones to get excited about going to bed so that they, the adults, could get ready for Christmas morning.\n\nNow, more than 15 years later, the pajamas have become a cherished family tradition, albeit a silly one. The Wilson boys \u2014 Jack, 20; Owen, 17; and Sam, 13 \u2014 have even pledged to continue the custom with their own families when they are older.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say to me, \u2018I just can\u2019t believe you get your kids to do that,\u2019\u201d says Amy Wilson, of Marietta, Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of their favorite traditions. They never argue with me about wearing them. They\u2019re excited to see what they are each year.\u201d\n\nWilson has watched matching holiday garb become a trend thanks to social media. Photos posted on Facebook and Instagram show a huge variety of styles and patterns.\n\nIn addition to traditional pajamas, Wilson has given her kids Star Wars and animal-themed sleepers. One year, she ordered the infamous bunny suit from the movie \u201cA Christmas Story.\u201d Another time, everyone received wearable blankets that were popularized by late-night TV commercials.\n\nMatching outfits do make for an ideal photo op, says Danielle Lucia Schaffer, a blogger at citygirlgonemom.com. She dresses her four children in matching or coordinating pajamas every year and stages elaborate photo shoots. The kids generally like the clothing but not the photos, said Schaffer, of San Diego.\n\nIn addition to wearing their matching jammies on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning, they put them on for movie nights all winter long.\n\nIf kids are reluctant to don matching outfits, Schaffer recommends recruiting dad to help sell the idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to get your husband on board,\u201d she says.

They were loving all that attention.\u201d\n\nIndeed, matching jammies are a bit of a \u201cthing\u201d at Great Wolf Lodge in Mason, Ohio, says Jason Arthur, the regional director of aquatics. Families wear them to meals and events throughout the holiday season, he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see it grow more and more each year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have one large family that comes back each year. They get a lot of comments about their matching pajamas from the other families. Some even want to take pictures with them.\u201d\n\nMatching clothing is a way for families to strengthen their bonds and announce their connectedness, says Dimitris Xygalatas, an anthropology professor who studies rituals at the University of Connecticut. As families become more far-flung, dressing alike at the holidays may be a way to make the annual gatherings more fun and more over-the-top, he says.\n\n\u201cIf your family only gets together once or twice a year, it needs to be significant \u2014 have more pageantry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need something that says this is a very special occasion.

Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency have urged the operator of Japan\u2019s tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant to urgently come up with a plan to dispose of massive amounts of radioactive water stored in tanks on the compound. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 Experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency urged the operator of Japan\u2019s tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant on Tuesday to urgently decide on a plan to dispose of massive amounts of treated but still radioactive water stored in tanks on the compound.\n\nA 13-member IAEA team told reporters in Tokyo after a weeklong review that managing nearly 1 million tons of radioactive water is critical to the plant\u2019s safe and sustainable decommissioning.\n\nThe IAEA team said in a preliminary report that hundreds of tanks currently used to store the water over large areas of the plant\u2019s compound can only be a temporary solution and must be removed \u201curgently.\u201d\n\nThe cores of three reactors at the plant suffered meltdowns following a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of northeastern Japan.\n\nRadioactive water has leaked from the damaged reactors and mixed with groundwater and rainwater at the plant. The water is treated and stored in large tanks.\n\nMore than 7 \u00bd years since the accident, officials have yet to agree on what to do with the radioactive water. A government-commissioned panel has picked five alternatives, including the controlled release of the water into the Pacific Ocean, which nuclear experts say is the only realistic option. Fishermen and residents, however, strongly oppose the proposal.\n\nThat option faced a major setback this summer when the plant\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., acknowledged that the water, which it said had been carefully treated, was not clean enough. It said the water contains cancer-causing cesium and other elements in excess of allowable limits for release into the environment.\n\nThe IAEA interim report said TEPCO could run out of space for tanks in a few years, and the water storage adds to safety risks and could hamper the decommissioning of the plant, which is already an unprecedented challenge.\n\nIt said the water problem has improved recently because of measures such as an underground frozen wall installed around the reactor buildings to keep the radioactive water from mixing with groundwater. It suggested that TEPCO could further reduce the amount of contaminated water by cutting back on the use of cooling water injected into the reactors because the temperature of the melted fuel has fallen significantly.\n\nIAEA mission leader Christophe Xerri told reporters that it is uncertain whether all of the melted fuel can ever be successfully removed because too little is known about the damage to the cores of the three reactors.\n\nTEPCO and government officials plan to start removing the melted fuel in 2021. Robotic probes inside the reactors have detected traces of damaged fuel but its exact location, contents and other details remain largely unknown.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the information it\u2019s very difficult to say it\u2019s possible or not\u201d to remove all the fuel, Xerri said.\n\nThe team\u2019s final report from its review is expected in late January.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "FILE - In this file photo dated Tuesday, Jan 21 2014, West Ham's Joe Cole controls the ball during the English League Cup match against Manchester City at the Boleyn stadium in London.

(Peter Gust via AP)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 The parent who took a photo of Wisconsin high school boys giving what appears to be a Nazi salute on the steps of a local courthouse said Tuesday he was simply asking the teens to wave goodbye to their parents before they headed to prom and never anticipated the image would draw widespread condemnation.\n\nBut Pete Gust, who has a son in the photo, said he understood why his photo of about 60 boys outside the Sauk County Courthouse in Baraboo last spring offended some people. About two-thirds of the boys have their right arms raised in the gesture, many grinning widely.\n\n\u201cThe optics aren\u2019t good,\u201d Gust told The Associated Press, though he said he didn\u2019t believe the boys were doing a Nazi salute: \u201cThere was never any inkling of that whatsoever. ... There was nothing intended in any way shape or form to simulate anything that was offensive to anyone.\u201d\n\nGust maintained that his camera merely caught the boys\u2019 wave prematurely, saying his \u201cregret is I didn\u2019t get to the apex.\u201d\n\nMany viewers of the photo felt strongly otherwise, with criticism pouring in from individuals and from Jewish organizations including the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in Poland.\n\nOne of the students in the photo also rejected the suggestion that the gestures were anything but a Nazi salute. Jordan Blue, who is pictured without expression and with his arms down, said he believes some of the students did intend to make the salute as a joke.\n\n\u201cIt was very disrespectful to what my beliefs are, and it was a very bad representation of the senior class and the Baraboo School District, because by all means, the Baraboo School District does not support that kind of actions and it is a district that provides many opportunities for the students,\u201d Blue told the Baraboo News Republic. \u201cThis is something that I will never forget.\u201d\n\nGust had posted the photo to his photography business website, Wheel Memories, after it was taken in May. He took it down Monday and posted an apology after it surfaced in social media posts and was shared widely.\n\nIt is so hard to find words...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why every single day we work hard to educate.

Landing Amazon also cements Long Island City\u2019s transformation from a faded manufacturing zone to a vibrant, of-the-moment enclave of waterfront skyscrapers, modernized warehouses and artsy-tech ambience across the East River from midtown Manhattan.\n\nA person familiar with the plans says Amazon will split its second headquarters between Long Island City in New York and Crystal City in northern Virginia. The online retailer is expected to make an official announcement later Tuesday. (Nov. 13)\n\n\u201cI joke that we\u2019re experiencing explosive growth 30 years in the making,\u201d said Elizabeth Lusskin, president of the Long Island City Partnership, a neighborhood development group.\n\nBut Long Island City also has been straining to handle its growth.\n\nDays before Tuesday\u2019s announcement , the city unveiled a $180 million plan to address Long Island City\u2019s packed schools, street design and a sewage system that groans in heavy rain. But those projects will just catch up with current needs, said area City Councilman Jimmy van Bramer.\n\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of people cheerleading for this, but HQ2 has to work for Queens and the people of Queens. It can\u2019t just be good for Amazon,\u201d said van Bramer, a Democrat. After the announcement, he said Amazon had \u201cduped New York into offering unprecedented amounts of tax dollars to one of the wealthiest companies on Earth.\u201d\n\nOnce a bustling factory and freight-moving area, Long Island City saw many of its plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing shriveled in New York City.\n\nThe neighborhood\u2019s rebirth began in the 1980s, when officials broached redeveloping a swath of the waterfront, while artists were drawn by warehouse spaces, affordable rents and a building that is now the MoMA PS1 museum. Silvercup Studios \u2014 where such TV shows as \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u203330 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d have been filmed \u2014 opened in 1983.\n\nLong Island City gained a new commercial stature, and the start of a high-rise skyline, when the banking giant now called Citi opened an office tower there in 1989. But the area\u2019s growth lately has been driven by residential building.\n\nSome 9,150 new apartments and homes have been built since 2010, more than in any other New York City neighborhood, according to the city Planning Department . Thousands more units are in the works.\n\nThe location identified by the state as the spot for Amazon\u2019s new campus is currently a collection of low-rise industrial buildings and parking lots wrapped around a boat basin.\n\nNew York has striven for nearly a decade to position itself as a tech hotspot.\n\nVenture capitalists poured $5.8 billion into New York-area startups last quarter, more than any other region except the San Francisco area, according to the consulting and accounting firm PwC . Established tech giants, including Google and Facebook, have been expanding their New York footprints.\n\nStill, landing HQ2 represents \u201cincredible validation of just how far New York has come,\u201d said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future think tank.\n\nWaiting for a subway, Long Island City community board chairwoman Denise Keehan-Smith could envision Amazon benefiting the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to be careful about it,\u201d she said.\n\nCRYSTAL CITY\n\nIf any place in America can absorb 25,000 Amazon jobs without disruption, it may well be Crystal City, Virginia, where nearly that many jobs have vanished over the last 15 years.\n\nThe neighborhood in Arlington County is bounded by the Potomac River and the nation\u2019s capital on one side, by the Pentagon on another and Reagan National Airport on a third.\n\nDespite its prime location and abundant transportation options, the neighborhood has been hit by a massive outflow of jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office began moving more than 7,000 jobs out of Crystal City in 2003. In 2005, the Defense Department announced plans to move roughly 17,000 jobs elsewhere as part of a base realignment.\n\nArlington County has worked hard to bring in new employers, and had some success. The Public Broadcasting Service moved its headquarters to Crystal City in 2006.\n\nStill, large swaths of the neighborhood remain vacant. Among other challenges, the area has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nCrystal City is populated by \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. The buildings are connected by a network of tunnels populated with food-court style dining options, hair salons and newsstands. The tunnels leave the ground-level outdoor streetscape sometimes looking empty.\n\nBrookings Institution urban planner Jenny Schuetz suggested the buildings may require an upgrade, or even replacement. But she noted that while people often associate tech companies with converted lofts or state-of-the art workspaces, many big Silicon Valley tech companies actually work out of \u201980s-era office buildings.\n\nFor all the talk about antiquated architecture, people who\u2019ve actually worked in Crystal City appreciate its convenience and its worker-friendly features, including the tunnels.\n\n\u201cI loved it here,\u201d said Christine Gentry of Greenbelt, Maryland, as she ate breakfast in a largely empty food court. She works for the Patent and Trademark Office and preferred the days when her office was in Crystal City.\n\n\u201cEverything is accessible here,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it was raining or snowing or sleeting, I never had to go out.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no place better illustrates the vibe of Crystal City than the region\u2019s only revolving restaurant, the Skydome atop the Doubletree Crystal City. Diners enjoy a panoramic view of the D.C. skyline, completing a full rotation every 47 minutes.\n\nSam Getachew, the hotel\u2019s food and beverage manager, said the restaurant fits the neighborhood\u2019s retro atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge draw,\u201d Getachew said. \u201cPeople come for the curiosity of it.\u201d\n\nThe only downside, he said, is that \u201cwhen customers get up to go to the restroom, they don\u2019t know where they are when they come back.\u201d\n\nWhen Amazon announced its plans Tuesday, it said its footprint will extend beyond Crystal City into the adjacent neighborhoods of Pentagon City and Potomac Yard, which have collectively been dubbed \u201cNational Landing\u201d by the region\u2019s economic development officials.\n\n___\n\nBarakat reported from Arlington, Virginia.", "CANTERBURY, N.H.

It was always his race to win or lose, and he lost it. He lost it through his extremism.\n\nRepublicans in Kansas hold a 2-to-1 registration advantage over Democrats. That didn\u2019t change. It\u2019s worth noting that all the other statewide offices \u2014 treasurer, insurance commissioner, attorney general, and secretary of state \u2014 went to Republicans. The Legislature is still dominated by Republicans. Three of the four members of Congress, and both U.S. senators, are from the GOP.\n\nPlus, in the governor\u2019s race, Greg Orman ran as an independent, which was certain to siphon a few votes away from the Democratic candidate.\n\nOur guess is that a more moderate Republican \u2014 a Bill Graves, say, or even a Jeff Colyer \u2014 would have won the race. But Republicans in their primary barely favored Mr. Kobach, who proceeded to go around with a fake machine gun mounted on his campaign vehicle, supposedly to demonstrate his support for gun rights. He also said he would go even further in cutting taxes \u2014 doubling down on Sam Brownback\u2019s disastrous budget experiment \u2014 and he made a national name for himself drawing up laws that essentially cracked down on immigrants.\n\nThen there was the fact that a federal judge ordered him to take remedial law classes and dismissed a voter-ID measure that he had personally defended. He was held in contempt of court and fined.\n\nBy contrast, state Sen. Kelly worked diligently on policy matters in state government. Mr. Kobach was about ideology. Sen. Kelly was about competence.\n\nThe election result is not so much some sort of \u201cblue wave,\u201d or conversion of a deeply conservative state into a liberal bastion. It had little to do with President Trump. Forget all that. It\u2019s not even all that different from past patterns \u2014 Kansas has had several Democratic governors in the past generation.\n\nWhat it shows \u2014 once again \u2014 is that Kansans are reasonable, practical, clear-thinking people who don\u2019t go in much for extremism or flash. Most of the time, they\u2019re going to lean toward Republicans, so long as Republicans don\u2019t go off the deep end. Gov. Brownback went off the deep end with his budget experiment, and Mr. Kobach wanted to go in even deeper, and he wanted to make a show of himself in the process.\n\nIn the end, voters turned away. They preferred competence.\n\n______\n\nThe Topeka Capital-Journal, Nov. 12\n\nSchwab should improve voting\n\nWhen it comes to improving voter participation, Kansas has work to do.\n\nA recent Northern Illinois University study ranked the state ninth most difficult for citizens to cast ballots \u2014 a sad shortcoming powered by Secretary of State Kris Kobach\u2019s misguided obsession over nonexistent voter fraud and the ultraconservative quest to deter voters less likely to support a far-right agenda.\n\nIt led Kansas to a Voter ID requirement that disenfranchised the elderly, poor, minorities and others without an acceptable form of ID, and a proof-of-citizenship law that blocked more than 30,000 citizens from completing voter registrations \u2014 a change ruled unconstitutional.\n\nThe heightened fear of voter suppression due to Kobach-inspired initiatives recently fueled still more skepticism in a diverse western Kansas community.\n\nThe move of the lone polling site from the usual, central location in Dodge City to outside the city limits \u2014 and beyond the reach of public transportation -was clumsy at best. Ford County Clerk Debbie Cox failed to seek out more accessible locations in a city with a roughly 60 percent Hispanic population, one in which many residents don\u2019t have vehicles and flexible work schedules.\n\nAs a result, concerned folks flocked to Dodge City to help educate prospective voters on the change and offer rides to the new polling place (although few reportedly took advantage on Election Day).\n\nFord County did see voter turnout of nearly 45 percent \u2014 more than peer county Finney at about 41 percent. Still, there\u2019s significant room for improvement there and statewide.\n\nUnfortunately, Republican Secretary of State-elect Scott Schwab won his race after endorsing Kobach\u2019s pursuit of laws that hinder voter access. Schwab even said encouraging voter participation isn\u2019t the secretary of state\u2019s responsibility, choosing to ignore the potential good the office could deliver in helping more eligible voters exercise their precious right to cast ballots.\n\nKobach lost the governor\u2019s race to Democrat Laura Kelly in part because of his run on voting rights. Knowing as much, Schwab should reverse course and work toward change such as same-day registration, a proven way to increase voter turnout.\n\nWhile awareness of voting-related hurdles no doubt compelled many Kansans to try harder to vote in Dodge City and elsewhere, it shouldn\u2019t be a struggle. The state must make it easier for citizens to vote and be heard.\n\n____\n\nThe Kansas City Star, Nov. 12\n\nKansas GOP lawmakers ought to accept Governor-elect Laura Kelly\u2019s invitation\n\nIn her first news conference as Kansas governor-elect, Laura Kelly, the longtime Democratic lawmaker moved briskly through the top items on her do-list: Restore LGBT protections for state employees, expand Medicaid to the uninsured and improve public schools.\n\nBut Kelly was also careful not to overpromise. In fact, in one brief statement, she said four different ways that repairing the damage done by deep tax cuts during Sam Brownback\u2019s years as governor will be difficult and will not happen quickly.\n\nBuilding a diverse bipartisan team, she said, \u201cwill take some time and a lot of hard work.\u201d Backfilling the crater created under Brownback \u201cwill be a long, challenging process.\u201d So as not to leave any doubt, she added that \u201cthe rebuilding process won\u2019t be easy.\u201d And, \u201cwe all know we have a very long, challenging road ahead of us.\u201d\n\nOK? OK. Kelly has reason to temper expectations, especially since Republican Senate President Susan Wagle has promised to oppose Kelly\u2019s \u201cvery liberal\u201d spending, and Republican House Speaker Ron Ryckman has said there won\u2019t be any new taxes to pay for the \u201cfree lunch\u201d that \u201cLaura Kelly promised folks on the campaign trail.\u201d\n\nBut expected tax revenues for this fiscal year are up another $291 million just since the last forecast in April, according to numbers released on Friday. Claiming that the state can\u2019t afford to do better is getting harder, and the health care and education platform that Kelly ran on is what Kansans voted for.\n\nHer win wasn\u2019t a squeaker, either; she bested Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach by five percentage points even with independent Greg Orman making it a three-way race.\n\nStill, little of what she ran on can happen without the cooperation of the Republican lawmakers who control both the Kansas House and Senate and are as a group more conservative now.\n\nThe exception is the executive order barring employment discrimination against LGBT Kansans in state offices. She plans to have that drafted and ready to implement even before she takes office in January. And can this please be the last time any Kansas governor has to issue such an order?\n\nIt\u2019s absurd as well as wrong that any Kansan should have to go back and forth between being protected from discrimination under Democratic governors like Kelly and Kathleen Sebelius, who signed such an order more than a decade ago, but then become vulnerable again during Republican administrations, as they were under Brownback and are under Gov. Jeff Colyer.\n\nSo how likely is it that GOP lawmakers will work with Kelly where she does need an assist, on a Medicaid expansion bill that would cover about 150,000 more uninsured Kansans, benefit rural hospitals and the Kansas economy, too?\n\nExpansion passed last year but was vetoed by Brownback before he packed up for his new job in Washington.\n\nGOP state Rep. Dan Hawkins, who has opposed the expansion and chairs the House\u2019s health committee, now calls its passage \u201ca foregone conclusion.\u201d\n\nStephanie Clayton, a moderate House Republican from Johnson County, argues that it\u2019s still going to be tough to push through \u2014 \u201cWhy would it be any easier now than it has been?\u201d \u2014 but not impossible.\n\nTo accomplish that, in Clayton\u2019s view, Kelly will have to \u201clet Republicans think it\u2019s their idea and let them drive it. That\u2019s the way I get things done; just let some dude think it\u2019s his idea.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s restoring public schools that Clayton sees as almost a foregone conclusion, thanks to \u201ca fair amount of Republicans, myself included, who think our constituents have been pretty clear\u201d on that issue.\n\nIn overseeing a settlement in a long-running lawsuit, the Kansas Supreme Court has ordered the state to spend more than $500 million on its public schools, and that fight isn\u2019t over.\n\nSome in her party, Clayton said, will still \u201ctry to do a constitutional amendment\u201d to keep the court from telling the state how much school spending is required. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to work because they don\u2019t have the votes.\u201d\n\nKelly, who also used the word \u201cbipartisanship\u201d repeatedly in her first news conference, promised that state will no longer \u201cget by just doing the minimum.\u201d Especially with revenues up, there\u2019s no reason we should have to.", "The Kansas City Star, Nov. 9\n\nCongress soon will be more diverse. The Missouri and Kansas legislatures? Not so much\n\nA record number of women will head to Congress in 2019. In Florida and Georgia, two emerging Democratic stars were within striking distance of becoming the nation\u2019s first African-American governors. Other non-traditional candidates prevailed in races throughout the country.\n\nThis week\u2019s midterm elections provided hopeful signs that the nation is inching closer to a government that truly represents its citizens.\n\nCongress will look more like America, and that\u2019s good news. But closer to home, there\u2019s a lot more work to do \u2014 notably in Kansas and Missouri, where white men still dominate in politics.\n\nThe number of minority legislators won\u2019t change substantially in either state as a result of these midterms. Women and other non-traditional politicians made only modest gains in Kansas and Missouri.\n\nWhile Kansas elected a woman governor and will send a Native American woman to Congress, the lack of diversity in the Kansas and Missouri legislatures remains an issue and should be a wake-up call for leaders of both political parties. As they look ahead to the next election cycle, they should make recruiting and preparing a new generation of political leaders from varied backgrounds a priority.\n\n\u201cPolitics are a lot like business,\u201d said Kenya Cox, executive director for Kansas African American Affairs Commission. \u201cWhen we start engaging conversations with uncommon voices like African-American or Latina women, we come out with a better product.\u201d\n\nWomen and people of color are beginning to change the landscape of American politics. But a 2017 study by the Reflective Democracy Campaign found that despite being less than one-third of the population, white men still hold a majority of elected positions.\n\nThat is certainly true in Kansas and Missouri.\n\nIn Kansas, 47 of 165 legislators, or 28.5 percent, are women, according to the Center for Women in Politics. Four are black and one identified as mixed race.\n\nOn the Missouri side, 45 of 197, or 22.8 percent, of state lawmakers are women. Six are black.\n\nThe reality is that both Kansas and Missouri are conservative states. Neither has ever had a person of color serving in a statewide elective executive role. And the political parties\u2019 benches in both states look awfully thin when it comes to diverse young leaders who eventually could make bids for higher office.\n\n\u201cI do not think we are apt to see a serious statewide race in Missouri by an African-American anytime soon,\u201d said Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia. \u201cI would, of course, be delighted to be proven wrong.\u201d\n\nA culture of racism, a large white population and an aging population, along with a slowly declining percentage of young people would create challenges for any black gubernatorial candidate, said Garrett Griffin, author of \u201cRacism in Kansas City: A Short History.\u201d\n\nWhile progress has been slow in both states, there were some glimmers of hope in Kansas this week. Voters elected Brandon Woodard and Susan Ruiz, the first openly LGBTQ members of the Kansas House of Representatives. And Davids will be one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress and the first openly LGBTQ person to represent Kansas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say if this is a trend,\u201d said Don Haider-Markel, a political science professor at the University of Kansas. \u201cLGBT candidates have run for the Kansas Legislature in the past and weren\u2019t successful. But it is remarkable that neither (Woodard, Ruiz or Davids) had significant prior political experience.\u201d\n\nTo build on these victories and to continue to improve diversity in both statehouses, political officials in Kansas and Missouri must tackle the barriers that too often leave women, minorities and non-traditional candidates on the sidelines, including access to funding and support from the party. Voter suppression and gerrymandering are issues as well.\n\nA lack of diversity at the state level has stifled both states when it comes to new ideas and different perspectives. And unless Kansas and Missouri political officials begin the work now of cultivating a wide range of women, minority and non-traditional candidates, the needle won\u2019t budge much in 2020.\n\n_____\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Nov. 10\n\nMissourians elected Josh Hawley, but do they really know who he is?\n\nRepublican Senator-elect Josh Hawley will now represent this state on the national stage, having defeated incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill on Tuesday. But Missourians still deserve answers to some crucial questions about their new senator: Who is Josh Hawley, and for whom does he speak?\n\nThe dapper, carefully coiffed, businesslike lawyer won the state attorney general\u2019s race after only two years ago largely by touting his elite degrees from Stanford and Yale Law School. But that person was nowhere to be found these past few months as Hawley, 38, worked to shore up his base across rural Missouri. The person those voters met was a cowboy-booted, plaid-shirted, blue jean-clad regular guy who kept Yale as far away from the conversation as possible.\n\nMcCaskill was the elitist, Hawley insisted. He was the kind of guy who preferred debates on flatbed trailers, or trucks, or whatever you call those things. He portrayed himself as someone you might shuck peanuts with around the cracker barrel at the country store. Kind of like Andy Griffith\u2019s homespun character in the classic 1957 film, \u201cA Face in the Crowd.\u201d\n\nBut it turned out folks didn\u2019t know Griffith\u2019s character as well as they thought. And since Hawley had no public-service history before 2016, Missourians can\u2019t really claim to know him either. Is Hawley the take-no-prisoners attorney general who joined 19 others in a federal lawsuit to destroy Obamacare and its cherished coverage of pre-existing conditions? Or is he the guy who smiled sincerely into the camera, insisting he was the foremost defender of that coverage?\n\nThese questions go to the heart of what Hawley claims he\u2019ll be fighting for when he goes to Washington. On election night, he declared, \u201cTonight, the people of Missouri have said that our way of life and our values are going to renew this country, and that is what we are about, and that is what we are for.\u201d\n\nWhose way of life? Missourians are white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Hispanic and Native American. We are rich, poor, middle class, white collar, blue collar, urban, suburban and rural. Yes, 1.25 million of us voted for Hawley. But 1.1 million, including big majorities in the urban areas that are Missouri\u2019s economic engine, backed McCaskill.\n\n\u201cOur way of life\u201d is all of the above, not just Hawley\u2019s mainly white, non-urban base.\n\nIf you sift out the partisan rhetoric and look closely at Tuesday\u2019s results, Missourians proved themselves actually to be quite moderate politically. Dwarfing the support for Hawley were the 1.57 million votes favoring legalized medical marijuana, or the 1.49 million who supported raising the state\u2019s minimum wage. That\u2019s hardly the profile of a hardline conservative electorate.\n\nHawley knows his way around a plaid shirt and a lawyerly suit. But before he heads to Washington, Missourians still need to know: Who is Josh Hawley, and whose way of life is he defending?\n\n_____\n\nThe St. Joseph News-Press, Nov. 6\n\nThe Californiaization of Missouri\n\nMissouri voters could be forgiven for needing a clothespin while voting on the myriad of statewide ballot issues in last Tuesday\u2019s general election.\n\nDo you think the working poor need a higher wage? Sure. But what about a 50 percent increase to $12 an hour, with an exemption conveniently built in for government employers?\n\nAt candidate forums this fall, few Democrats or Republicans spoke against limiting lobbyist gifts and their potentially corrupting influence on state lawmakers. But the proposed constitutional amendment gives an unelected state demographer the clout to redraw election districts into shapes that would give a Freudian psychologist something to ponder.\n\nMedical marijuana? Of course you don\u2019t want grandma to get nauseous from chemotherapy, so you weigh that with the complexities of three competing measures to legalize cannabis for medical purposes.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, the clothespin is to pinch your nose while filling in the oval for \u201cyes\u201d during Tuesday\u2019s election. Plenty of Missourians were all in, but surely other support came from those who liked certain aspects of this or that but needed the nasal blockage because, let\u2019s face it, each proposal stinks a little.\n\nMissouri\u2019s lawmakers are to blame for this.\n\nFor all the campaign ads attacking Democrats and their \u201cCalifornia\u201d values, Missouri\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature did its best to give us an election ballot resembling something you\u2019d see in the Golden State.\n\nCalifornia had 11 voter initiatives on its ballot, covering issues as diverse as hospital bonds, daylight saving time, rent controls and standards for confined farm animals.\n\nIn Missouri, we\u2019re not that wacky yet. Our seven ballot measures included three on medical marijuana and single issues on ethics reform, the minimum wage, a gasoline tax and bingo regulations.\n\nThe problem with handling so many measures outside the legislative process is that voters are left with a take-it-or-leave-it approach that gets harder to accept when you see the fine print. The other problem is that interest groups use them not to adopt good public policy but to generate wedge issues that drive voters to the polls on behalf of a particular party.\n\nSo reasonable people had to decide whether a major change in legislative redistricting was worth the price of limits on other ethics reform. When a Northwest Missouri lawmaker failed to gain approval for a reasonable step toward medical marijuana, voters were presented a complex array of options that were considerably broader in scope.\n\nEven the gas tax drew criticism for having Highway Patrol funding tucked into the ballot language, although the state\u2019s Hancock Amendment made it necessary to take this tax hike to the voters.\n\nFor the rest, many of these issues were crying out for the kinds of things legislators are supposed to do: engage in debate and find a compromise.", "BERLIN (AP) \u2014 German authorities said Tuesday they suspect a male nurse of killing six elderly patients, and attempting to kill at least three more, after he admitted to injecting them with diabetes medication.\n\nMunich police said the 36-year-old Polish man has acknowledged injecting 12 people in his care with unnecessary insulin shots from April 2017 until his arrest in February this year.\n\nThe suspect, previously identified as Grzegorz Stanislaw Wolsztajn, denies intending to kill them, police said.

The company announced Tuesday that it will open two more bases outside of its Seattle headquarters: one in Arlington, Virginia and the other in New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood.\n\nAmazon, which got its start as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. Its workforce has ballooned to more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart, according to FactSet. That growth has also made its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos one of the world\u2019s richest people, with his stake in Amazon worth more than $135 billion.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the various businesses Amazon has its hand in:\n\nONLINE SHOPPING\n\nOnline sales are still Amazon\u2019s biggest money maker, bringing in $108 billion in revenue last year. That\u2019s slightly more than 60 percent of its total revenue.\n\nBesides Amazon.com, it also owns several smaller sites, including shoe retailer Zappos.com, rare books seller AbeBooks.com, deal site 6pm.com and women\u2019s clothing retailer Shopbop. It recently began selling medication after purchasing online pharmacy PillPack in September for $753 million.\n\nPHYSICAL STORES\n\nAmazon\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar push was its nearly $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods last year, giving it about 500 grocery stores.\n\nIt has created its own shops, too. There are 18 Amazon bookstores, five cashier-less convenience stores and three 4-star stores, which sell toys, cookware and other items. There are also dozens of Amazon pop-up shops inside malls and Kohl\u2019s department stores where shoppers can touch and try out its gadgets.\n\nIts physical locations had revenue of $13 billion in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nWEB SERVICES\n\nThere\u2019s more to Amazon than just shopping. Its Amazon Web Services unit, founded in 2006, provides cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies, and is one of Amazon\u2019s fastest growing businesses.\n\nIt had revenue of $17 billion last year, about 10 percent of its total revenue.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe ads at the top of Amazon search results are becoming a big business for the company. Amazon doesn\u2019t say exactly how much revenue it makes from ads, but an executive said that ad revenue makes up the majority of the \u201cother revenue\u201d listed in its financial reports. In its most recent quarter, its \u201cother revenue\u201d was $2.5 billion, more than double its revenue in the same period the year before.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nAmazon Prime is a way to cement customer loyalty and get them to spend more on the site. For $119 a year or $12.99 a month, members get free shipping, access to its video streaming service and other perks. The company disclosed for the first time earlier this year that it had more than 100 million paid Prime subscribers worldwide. Revenue from subscriptions topped $9.7 billion last year.\n\nGADGETS\n\nAmazon has been churning out some successful gadgets, including: Kindle tablets, Echo voice-activated speakers and Fire TV video streaming devices. The company doesn\u2019t break out revenue for these products.\n\nHOLLYWOOD STUDIO\n\nAmazon produces TV shows for its video streaming service, such as Emmy-winning \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d and films, such as \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Amazon doesn\u2019t break out revenue for its studio.\n\nVIDEO GAMES, AUDIOBOOKS AND MORE\n\nAmazon also owns Twitch, a video streaming service for gamers; Audible, the audiobooks seller; and IMDb.com, an online database of movie and TV show starts, directors and other information. Amazon doesn\u2019t break out revenue for these businesses.\n\nAMAZON BRANDS\n\nInstead of relying on famous brands, Amazon has been creating its own.

At the Baghdad International Fair, Iran's ambassador says he wants to triple trade with Iraq. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim)\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 At this year\u2019s Baghdad International Fair, Iranian businessmen displayed thick, colorful Persian rugs to impressed onlookers while others showcased the latest in Iranian manufacturing in power generators and industrial tools.\n\nFor Iranian companies, the annual Baghdad International Fair is a major event, as exporters in carpets, foodstuffs and heavy equipment look to score sales in Iraq\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\nBut this year\u2019s edition, running this week, is an even bigger deal than usual: Iran, already feeling the bite of newly re-imposed unilateral U.S. sanctions, is turning to its neighbor to soak up its exports in agriculture, manufacturing and energy.\n\nAmbassador Iraj Masjedi promised Iran would grow its already flourishing trade with Iraq. The sanctions, he said, \u201cwill not affect the relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nSince then, Trump announced what he billed the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d sanctions regime against Iran and the country has seen its oil exports plunge and its currency lose more than half its value. The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nHowever, other major economies including Europe, Russia and China have refused to take parallel measures, and Iran can still do business with the outside world.\n\nIraq is Iran\u2019s second largest export market. Since 2003, when the U.S. invasion plunged the country into civil war, Iraq has depended on Iran for everything from food to machinery, to electricity and natural gas.\n\nMasjedi boasted that trade between the two countries was on track to reach $8.5 billion this year and said Iran\u2019s outlook is to reach $22 billion annually -- more than triple its $7 billion in volume in 2017. He did not give specifics.\n\nNon-American companies are free to do business with Iran, so long as they do not also do business with the U.S., or through U.S. financial institutions.\n\n\u201cWe will not tie ourselves to the dollar,\u201d said Masjedi.\n\nMore than 60 Iranian companies are represented at the Baghdad fair, which runs until Nov. 19.\n\nMir Zad, director of Hisam, which sells generators and other electrical equipment, said he was aiming to secure deals worth around $1 million at the fair. He wasn\u2019t concerned about the new restrictions on the dollar; deals could be made in Iraqi dinar, he said.\n\nStill, a substantial portion of trade between the two nations is done in energy and cannot easily be structured outside the new sanctions regime.\n\nIt puts Iraq in a delicate position as a partner of both Washington and Tehran.\n\nWith its electricity sector in tatters, Iraq depends on Iranian gas and power generation to power its economy. A temporary electricity reduction last summer fueled unrest in Iraq\u2019s southern provinces.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last Thursday announced it was granting Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity in Iraq.\n\nIt said the exception would give Iraq time to \u201ctake steps toward energy independence.\u201d\n\nBut it could take a year or longer to secure enough new power to make up for lost imports, said economist Bassim Jameel Antwan.\n\nIn the meantime, Iraq may have little choice but to continue to import from Iran. And Iran\u2019s deep entanglement in Iraq\u2019s political and military affairs further complicates the picture.\n\nIran has the ear of several of Iraq\u2019s top politicians and trains, finances and advises some of the largest militias in the country. While it is precisely this sort of influence the U.S. is aiming to curb, Iran can still play the role of spoiler in Iraqi politics.\n\n\u201cYou plan for one thing, and the result might be something else,\u201d said Antwan.\n\nSince May, Iran\u2019s currency the rial has sank in the black market from 60,000 to the dollar to 148,000 to the dollar. Oil exports fell from 2.5 million barrels per day in May to 1.85 billion in October and are expected to tumble some more.\n\n----\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Vahdat contributed from Tehran.", "FILE - This undated file photo released Wednesday Oct. 24, 2018, by Britain's Blackpool Police, shows an alleged thief bearing a striking resemblance to Ross Geller, the character played by actor David Schwimmer on the TV show \"Friends.\" British police said Tuesday Nov. 13, 2018, that a 36-year-old man has been arrested in London in their hunt for a shoplifter.

(AP Photo/David Longstreath, File)\n\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 The death of a 13-year-old boy who was knocked out during a kickboxing match in Thailand has sparked debate over whether to ban matches involving children.\n\nThe death of Anucha Tasako came after a Muay Thai \u2014 Thai boxing \u2014 match Saturday in the Bangkok suburb of Samut Prakarn. The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand\u2019s Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\u201cThis would have a major impact on the industry,\u201d Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \u201cThose who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\u201d he said. \u201cWe call it \u2018boxing bones.\u2019 You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\u201d\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened before and it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn\u2019t quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn\u2019t have a doctor on standby, which shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha\u2019s death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.", "HILLSBOROUGH, N.C.
