["WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The head of Poland\u2019s financial regulatory body resigned Tuesday following a report alleging that he had sought a multimillion dollar bribe from the owner of a troubled bank in exchange for favors.\n\nMarek Chrzanowski, the director of the Financial Supervision Authority, said he was innocent and described the allegations as \u201cdishonest and unfounded attacks.\u201d But he told the PAP news agency that he was taking the step \u201cout of responsibility for the efficient functioning of the supervision over the financial market and the need for a thorough explanation of the matter for the good of the state.\u201d\n\nThe development comes after the daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported that Chrzanowski sought the bribe during a March meeting with the controlling shareholder of Getin Noble Bank, Leszek Czarnecki, in return for favorable treatment.\n\nCzarnecki recorded the exchange, which the newspaper published.\n\nEarlier in the day, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki asked prosecutors and the security services to look into the claims and said he was summoning the regulator for a meeting the next day.\n\nZbigniew Ziobro, who is both prosecutor general and justice minister, vowed a quick and thorough investigation, which he said he was taking charge of personally.\n\nHe said the investigation would focus on suspicions that a crime was committed by the head of the financial regulator. He noted that a separate investigation is already ongoing into alleged problems at the bank.\n\nThe bank has been losing money and saw its ratings downgraded by Moody\u2019s twice in the past year, most recently in October.\n\nAccording to the allegations, Chrzanowski, the financial regulator, asked the bank owner to hire a certain lawyer and pay him in exchange for protection during the bank\u2019s restructuring. Gazeta Wyborcza reported the amount of the bribe that was sought was 40 million zlotys ($10.5 million).\n\nChrzanowski was appointed in 2016 by then-prime minister Beata Szydlo of the ruling Law and Justice party, which came to power on promises to fight corruption.", "In this photo taken Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018., the head of BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures) Martin J.T.

Gathering this week in Versailles, west of Paris, governments on Friday Nov. 16, 2018, are expected to approve a plan to instead use a scientific formula to define the exact weight of a kilo. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\n\nSEVRES, France (AP) \u2014 The kilogram is getting an update.\n\nNo, your bathroom scales won\u2019t suddenly become kinder and a kilo of fruit will still weigh a kilo. But the way scientists define the exact mass of a kilogram is about to change.\n\nUntil now, its mass has been defined by the granddaddy of all kilos: a golf ball-sized metal cylinder locked in a vault in France. For more than a century, it has been the one true kilogram upon which all others were based.\n\nNo longer.\n\nGathering in Versailles, west of Paris, governments are expected on Friday to approve plans to instead use a scientific formulation to define the exact mass of a kilo. The change is expected to have practical applications in industries and sciences that require ultra-precise measurements of mass.\n\nAnd it will mean redundancy for the so-called Grand K, the kilo that has towered above them all since 1889.\n\nMade of a corrosion-resistant alloy of 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium , the international prototype kilo has rarely seen the light of day. Yet its role has been crucial, as the foundation for the globally accepted system for measuring mass upon which things like international trade depend.\n\nThree different keys, kept in separate locations, are required to unlock the vault where the Grand K and six official copies \u2014 collectively known as \u201cthe heir and the spares\u201d \u2014 are entombed together under glass bell-jars at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in Sevres on the western outskirts of Paris.\n\nFounded by 17 nations in 1875 and known by its French initials, the BIPM is the guardian of the seven main units humanity uses to measure its world : the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for the amount of a substance and the candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilo is the last still based on a physical artefact, the Grand K. The meter, for example, used to be a meter-long metal bar but is now defined as the length that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.\n\n\u201cThis, if you like, is a moment of celebration because it\u2019s like the last standard remaining from 1875 that will finally be replaced by new innovation,\u201d Martin Milton, the BIPM director, said in an Associated Press interview. \u201cEverything else has been recycled and replaced and improved. This is the last improvement that dates back to the original conception in 1875. So that\u2019s a tribute to what was done in 1875, that it\u2019s lasted this long.\u201d\n\nOnly exceedingly rarely, and exceedingly carefully, have the BIPM\u2019s master kilos been gingerly taken out so that other kilos sent back to Sevres from around the world could be compared against them, to be sure they were still properly calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.\n\nAlthough many Americans commonly think of weight in pounds and ounces, the United States is officially a kilo country, too: It was one of the original 17 founders of the BIPM in 1875. The United States\u2019 primary kilo is called K20 and was assigned to the country in 1889 by the BIPM, along with another, K4. One kilo is equivalent to 2.2 pounds.\n\nThe U.S. also has six other platinum-iridium kilos: K79, 85, 92, 102, 104 and 105. They are all looked after by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nTo verify their mass, K20 and other kilos from around three dozen other countries were measured in Sevres against the BIPM\u2019s master kilos in a painstaking calibration exercise from 1988 to 1992. K20 was most recently then measured again at the BIPM in 2014.\n\nEven as humans argued, fought and slaughtered each other by the tens of millions in the 20th century, they shared the kilo. The kilo allocated to China in 1983, as it started to embrace market reforms that subsequently turned it into an economic behemoth, was the first manufactured with ultra-high precision diamond machining. Allocated to Japan in 1894, K39 was later ceded to South Korea in 1958.\n\nThe kilo is \u201ca tribute to man\u2019s ability to collaborate,\u201d Milton says. \u201cIt\u2019s been called a great work of peace, actually, because it\u2019s one of the areas where all of the states of the world come together with absolutely the same objective.\u201d\n\nThe metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck\u2019s constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly difficult to explain . Suffice to say that the update should, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to Sevres for calibration against the Grand K. Scientists instead should be able to accurately calculate an exact kilo, without having to measure one precious lump of metal against another.\n\nMilton says the change will have applications in computing, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, the study of climate change and other sciences where precise measurements are required.\n\n\u201cThe system will be intrinsically correct by reference to the laws of science, the laws of nature,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to depend on just assuming that one particular object never changes.\u201d", "A sea gull flies off holding fish scraps near a former dock facility, with \"Long Island\" painted on old transfer bridges at Gantry State Park in the Long Island City section of the Queens Borough in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. Amazon announced Tuesday it has selected the Queens neighborhood as one of two sites for its headquarters. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon has set its sights on two of the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful metro areas, announcing Tuesday it had chosen a buzzy New York neighborhood and a suburb of Washington for its new East Coast headquarters.\n\nThe online shopping giant ended its 14-month-long competition for second headquarters by selecting Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Virginia , as the joint winners. Both are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nAmazon could have picked a city looking to be revitalized, like Newark, New Jersey. Instead, it decided to be in two of the nation\u2019s centers of power. The reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants. The two sites will each get 25,000 jobs that Amazon said will pay an average of $150,000 a year.\n\nThe company will receive more than $2 billion in tax credits and other incentives. New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion, while Virginia and Arlington are offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The hope is that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost the local economies. But while many see it as an opportunity, not everyone is sold on the idea.\n\n\u201cOffering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\u201d said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands, including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nNew York is the nation\u2019s financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation\u2019s capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won\u2019t appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in a neighborhood of Queens that sits directly across from midtown Manhattan. Once a bustling factory and freight-moving area, many of Long Island City\u2019s plants and warehouses closed as manufacturing left New York. The empty warehouses drew artists looking for affordable rents and businesses followed. Today, the neighborhood is made up of expensive, high-rise condos, with many more under construction.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, an area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard. Large parts are made up of vacant \u201970s and \u201980s-era office buildings. Among other challenges, Crystal City has fought to overcome a reputation for outdated architecture.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon\u2019s new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may become an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area\u2019s tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d said Margo Williams, who lives in nearby Alexandria, Virginia. She said more workers in the area would increase tax revenues and bring better services for the community, but she worries traffic could get worse and the Metro more crowded.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain one of Amazon\u2019s three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including shareholder meetings.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won\u2019t go empty handed. Amazon said the finalist city will be home to a new Amazon office with 5,000 jobs, focused on customer delivery and supply chain. Those jobs will also be paid an average of $150,000 a year, Amazon said.\n\n\u201cYou know, this is a huge win,\u201d said Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. \u201cWhen we got this news, I think all of us were really, really excited about it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAlan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia, Matthew Barakat in Arlington County, Virginia, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, and Karen Matthews in New York contributed to this report.", "City taking closer look at restrictions on use of seal, flag\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich.

One of the main tenets of EU membership is the freedom for citizens to move and work anywhere within the 28-country bloc.\n\nDiscussions over Britain\u2019s exit in March 2019 are still going on and there are doubts as to whether the British Parliament will back any deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes. Though the government has sought to assuage concerns of EU citizens in Britain about their future, talk of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal on future relations is adding to uncertainty.\n\nThe departure of more EU nationals comes at a time when the U.K. labor market is doing well. The number of people in work was up by 350,000 on the year to 32.41 million, with British nationals working up by 448,000 to 29 million. Overall, the unemployment rate is super-low at 4.1 percent despite a 0.1 percentage point rise over the most recent period.\n\nWages are rising, too, with employers seemingly having to respond to scarce labor by giving workers more money. Average earnings over the three months to September, excluding bonuses, were 3.2 percent higher than the corresponding period a year earlier. That is the highest rate since a decade ago, before the global financial crisis pushed the economy into recession.\n\nHow the labor market performs over the coming few months will likely depend on what happens with Brexit. The government has insisted that EU citizens\u2019 freedom of movement will end after a transition period currently expected to last for 21 months past March. What rights they will get after that is still unclear.\n\n\u201cFirms who employ a large share of migrant workers must think now about adjusting to a lower migration environment \u2014 in terms of the workers they employ, what they produce and how they operate,\u201d said the Resolution Foundation\u2019s Clarke.\n\nMost forecasters think that a no-deal Brexit, which would see tariffs slapped on British exports to the EU, border checks reinstalled, and restrictions on travelers and workers, would damage the British economy.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings agency last month said a no-deal Brexit could push the British economy into recession and cause unemployment to spike to 7.4 percent by 2021.", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 All students and staff abducted more than a week ago from a school in Cameroon\u2019s restive North West region have been freed, a leader of the Presbyterian church said Tuesday.\n\nTwo students, the principal and a staff member of Presbyterian Secondary School in the English-speaking northwestern village of Nkwen were released in different intervals, said Fonki Samuel Forba, moderator of the country\u2019s Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe kidnappers had previously released 78 students in Bafut, in northwestern Cameroon.\n\n\u201cThey are still very tired and stressed, so we cannot discuss with them now to hear how and who brought them to Bafut,\u201d said Forba. \u201cI can authoritatively tell you that we did not pay any ransom to secure their freedom.\u201d He gave no further details.\n\nThe 79 students and three staff members were kidnapped by suspected separatists on Nov. 4 in part of Cameroon that has been beset by violence and instability since 2016 when armed English-speaking separatists began a campaign to create a breakaway state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\nTwo days after the kidnapping the Cameroonian army announced it had freed 78 of the hostages.

(AP Photo/David Brauchli, File)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Prince Charles turns 70 Wednesday and is still heir to the throne \u2014 a role he has served since he was a young child.\n\nHe\u2019s not lacking in things to do and shows few signs of slowing down \u2014 he is wealthy, extremely active in matters of great importance to him, and preparing to welcome his fourth grandchild into the world when Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gives birth next spring.\n\nHis destiny, however, is to be king, a position he will automatically assume with the death of his 92-year-old mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWhen that happens, Charles will be bound by the constitutional requirement that the monarch refrain from trying to influence policy. Until then, Charles is free to lobby for action on climate change, support organic farming, and fight genetically modified crops as he sees fit.\n\nHe\u2019s doing all that while increasingly stepping in for the queen and supervising the Prince\u2019s Trust, an ambitious charity he founded 42 years ago that has helped hundreds of thousands of young Britons.\n\nIs the candle-crowded birthday cake a signal that it\u2019s time for the elegantly greying prince to take it easy? Not on your life, says Charles\u2019 wife, Camilla, the duchess of Cornwall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks he\u2019s 70,\u201d she wrote in a birthday tribute in The Telegraph Magazine. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a number to him. There\u2019s no way that he will slow down. You must be joking. I keep saying 70 is getting on a bit. It\u2019s not very old but it is old. You have to slow down a bit.\u201d\n\nThe royal family is in the midst of a slow, understated transition. The patriarch, 97-year-old Prince Philip, has formally retired from public life, although he makes occasional appearances in support of the queen.\n\nFor her part, the queen still maintains a busy schedule, but she no longer makes long haul flights to far flung parts of the 53-nation Commonwealth, and this year she took the unusual step of lobbying the Commonwealth countries to specify that Charles would be the next leader of the group, a position that is not hereditary.\n\nThe support for Charles was unanimous, reflecting not only appreciation for the queen\u2019s work over the decades but a belief that Charles has a strong commitment to the Commonwealth.\n\nCharles has also taken a more visible role representing the queen at some important national events, most recently during the Remembrance Day celebrations honoring Britain\u2019s fallen soldiers. He placed the queen\u2019s wreath at the foot of the Cenotaph monument while she watched from a balcony seat.\n\nBut his working trips abroad and his speeches at home generate precious little buzz as the press focuses on younger, more photogenic royals and their cute offspring.\n\nIn a way, Charles is sandwiched between generations, caught between his mother, a symbol of dignity and continuity who has reigned since 1952, and his two immensely popular sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, who have along with their wives come to symbolize the future of the world\u2019s best known monarchy.\n\nWilliam and Harry also remind many of their mother, the late Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 after a messy divorce from Charles that for a time tarnished his standing with the British public.\n\nIt is William and Harry \u2014 along with their wives Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan \u2014 who appear on the cover of glossy magazines, not the about-to-be-70 Charles. It is the young royals who are seen as glamorous modernizers with the common touch, while Charles is sometimes perceived as dour, preachy and remote.\n\nCamilla says the public doesn\u2019t understand how \u201cincredibly kind\u201d and funny Charles is, and William and Harry \u2014 taking part in a rare BBC interview to mark his father\u2019s birthday \u2014 praise the way he has used his undefined position as Prince of Wales to advocate so many important causes, such as environmental protection.\n\nBut Harry \u2014 who has endeared himself to the British public in part with his impish smile and sunny outlook \u2014 urged his dad to cut back a bit on the doom and gloom that often accompanies Charles\u2019 pronouncements.\n\n\u201cI would encourage him to remain optimistic because I think it can be very easy to become despondent and negative,\u201d Harry said. \u201cBut hopefully with his children and his grandchildren, and a few more grandchildren to come, he can get energy from the family side and then carry on his leadership role.\u201d\n\nHe also had this advice: don\u2019t work so hard, and have dinner earlier.", "Man arrested in shooting death of 12-year-old in Illinois\n\nDECATUR, Ill.

Nathan Deal ordered legislators back to the Capitol primarily to approve $270 million in funding for cleanup and recovery efforts associated with Hurricane Michael\u2019s devastating march across southwest Georgia last month.\n\nBut the House and Senate must also revisit lifting the state sales tax on jet fuel.\n\nControversy erupted over the perk earlier this year when Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Senate Republicans declared they were killing the tax break to punish Delta, one of Georgia\u2019s largest private employers. Lawmakers were outraged when Delta ended fare discounts for National Rifle Association members after the deadly school shootings in Parkland, Florida.\n\nDeal ended up salvaging the tax exemption with an executive order. But state law requires the legislature to ratify that order. If lawmakers approve, the break stays in effect until the fiscal year ends June 30. If the proposal fails, airlines would owe retroactive sales taxes dating to Aug. 1.\n\n\u201cI said last week I thought it was going to have a tough climb,\u201d House Speaker David Ralston told reporters as the session opened Tuesday. \u201cI still think that.\u201d\n\nRalston said he doesn\u2019t know whether the measure would pass the House or not. But he said it\u2019s up to Delta and other airlines to prove not only that they need the tax relief, but that granting it would benefit Georgia\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cI have serious concerns and questions in my own mind that they haven\u2019t done that,\u201d Ralston said.\n\nWhatever happens, lawmakers are expected to work quickly. Ralston and Cagle, who presides over the Senate, predicted Tuesday the session will last just five days.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee planned to take up amending the state budget to include money for hurricane recovery Wednesday. Deal, who leaves office in January, was scheduled to make his case to the committee.\n\nMichael charged into rural southwest Georgia as a powerful Category 3 hurricane in October. Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens\u2019 office says residents filed 68,000 claims worth $700 million in damage and losses to homes, businesses and vehicles. That\u2019s $60 million more than Georgia\u2019s combined insured losses from Hurricanes Matthew and Irma, which struck in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very aggressive and do everything we possibly can to help the farming communities in that part of the state,\u201d Ralston said.\n\nThe session opened on a somber note Tuesday as lawmakers learned Rep. John Meadows, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, had died earlier that morning. Brian Kemp, the GOP candidate for governor, tweeted Tuesday that Meadows died from cancer.\n\nThe 74-year-old Republican served 14 years in the House, representing northern Georgia\u2019s 5th District.

The sky is huge and bright blue, with clouds as fluffy as cotton balls, and the buildings \u2014 few more than three stories high \u2014 leave plenty of room to appreciate the natural backdrop.\n\nBut a messier reality keeps jutting in, from the sign warning, \u201cUS 285 South Subject to Sinkhole 1000 Feet Ahead\u201d \u2014 erected because a brine well for oil and gas operations created a cavern underground that could collapse \u2014 to the flames of flares burning off excess gas, contributing to air pollution and climate change.\n\nMore is coming.\n\nEvery 15 to 20 years, the BLM can reconsider how swaths of public land can be used \u2014 what parts should be protected and where various business activities should be allowed. The agency\u2019s Carlsbad field office is doing that now.\n\nAmong the BLM\u2019s 33 field offices, it\u2019s already one of the five most active for federal onshore oil and gas permitting. Now it is proposing to open nearly 86,000 additional acres to development, including oil and gas.\n\nAs justification, the BLM cited a 2017 executive order from President Donald Trump to \u201cremove barriers to economic prosperity and quality of life in rural America.\u201d\n\nThe BLM said it expects the plan would lead to about 15,600 jobs within 20 years. That\u2019s almost 2,500 more jobs than it thinks would be created under the current leasing scheme.\n\n\u201cIt is in the hottest oil and gas area of the country,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a trade group. \u201cIt\u2019s going to garner a lot of interest from industry . and environmental groups, many of which want to shut down oil and gas development.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s changes reflect a broader trend to undo Obama-era environmental protections for public lands, including a rule that aimed to reduce greenhouse gases and toxic air pollution from industry flaring.\n\nAgency officials in both Washington and New Mexico declined to answer specific questions for this article, instead releasing a short statement saying they are \u201ccommitted to sustainably developing our Nation\u2019s energy and natural resources.\u201d Activities on federal lands in New Mexico supported more than 78,000 jobs and generated $14.9 billion in the 2017 fiscal year, the BLM wrote.\n\nThe BLM is hard-pressed to keep up. Jim Stovall, the district manager overseeing Carlsbad and another field office, acknowledged at a meeting hosted by a think tank and a conservation group in May that the Carlsbad office doesn\u2019t have enough money or staff to enforce all the regulations for activity occurring on the land it manages, according to five people in attendance.\n\nDocuments the BLM provided to the Center through a public-records request show no penalties levied for nearly 95 percent of oil and gas violations identified by the Carlsbad office over a five-year period ending in April. This assumes the agency is accurately recording its enforcement activities. It wouldn\u2019t clarify.\n\nIn January the BLM sent a memo to its field offices, eliminating a required 30-day public comment period before land is leased. And in June, the BLM issued a bulletin directing field offices to skip in-depth environmental assessments for oil and gas projects whenever possible \u2014 something the industry asked for.\n\nThis \u201ccalls into question the adequacy of the process and how much they are putting a thumb on the scale in terms of energy dominance,\u201d said Brent Keith, senior policy advisor for The Nature Conservancy.\n\nThe industry disagrees. The administration is simply directing the BLM to follow the law and bypass duplicative reviews, oil and gas groups said.\n\n\u201cThis is a prudent step that would allow BLM to be more effective and timely in processing applications and permits,\u201d wrote Robert McEntyre, a spokesman for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, which has more than 1,000 members.\n\n__\n\nHELPING HAND\n\nAs it struggles to keep up with demands here, the BLM has sought assistance from an outside source that\u2019s been happy to oblige: the oil and gas industry. Deep ties between the two predate the Trump administration.\n\nIn 2014, during the last boom, the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association donated $800,000 to the BLM\u2019s state office in Santa Fe to help plug holes created by Washington budget cuts. The BLM used the money to hire more employees in the state.\n\nThe agreement was for only one year. But the trade group\u2019s disproportionate access to the bureau continues to this day. The oil and gas association has created \u201cworking groups\u201d for its members to discuss bureau policy, like the land use planning process the Carlsbad field office is working on now. BLM officials regularly attend the meetings, according to current and former employees and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe BLM would not comment on the matter or say whether these meetings are open to the public. McEntyre, with the oil and gas association, said most of the meetings the trade group holds are open only to its members. In some cases, he said, parts of these events are open to non-members.\n\nA sportsman\u2019s group representative who got wind of the meetings asked BLM district manager Stovall last December if he could attend one that was scheduled for January, according to emails released through public-records requests to the environmental group WildEarth Guardians and shared with the Center. Stovall never responded.\n\nSome companies, including Devon Energy and Occidental, have separate, quarterly meetings with staff in Stovall\u2019s district. Emails show Stovall has gone to dinner with company officials the night before some of those meetings. The BLM declined to make Stovall available for an interview.\n\nIn managing lands, the BLM must sort through conflicting ideas about what, exactly, is in the public interest. Giving one industry lopsided access can lead to decisions that are, or seem to be, skewed, legal experts said.\n\n\u201cIf it appears they\u2019re not acting impartially, then it undermines public confidence in the process,\u201d said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group based in D.C.\n\nThe New Mexico Oil and Gas Association and some current and former BLM officials say there\u2019s nothing nefarious about their interactions. Field office staff need to meet frequently with oil and gas companies because they have a significant impact on the land, an office employee told the Center on condition of anonymity because of a ban on speaking to the national media.\n\nBecause so much of the state\u2019s oil and gas is on federal lands, the industry has \u201ca vested interest in how BLM performs its work, and it only makes sense that producers, as their largest customers, would work collaboratively to safely produce energy in New Mexico,\u201d wrote McEntyre, the association\u2019s spokesman.\n\nJesse Juen, who signed the $800,000 donation agreement with industry when he was the BLM New Mexico state office director, said the agency needed the money to beef up enforcement and compliance. The arrangement was carefully vetted, said Juen, now a board member of the Public Lands Foundation, a nonprofit whose members are largely current and former BLM employees.\n\n\u201cI never viewed the effort as catering to industry, but looked at it as an opportunity to help better manage the public lands on all fronts,\u201d Juen wrote in an email to the Center.\n\nThe irony, said Mark Squillace, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School, is that the government can recover permit-processing costs through fees from applicants. A donation shouldn\u2019t be necessary, he said.\n\n\u201cThe way this plays out is that these organizations are in the position of appearing to do a favor for the government,\u201d said Squillace, a special assistant with the Interior Department\u2019s solicitor\u2019s office during the Clinton administration. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that it\u2019s being done in a way that pushes the BLM to support the (oil and gas industry\u2019s) agenda.\u201d\n\nThe New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said it gave the money because the Obama administration \u201cfailed to support local BLM offices.\u201d The donation followed applicable guidelines, McEntyre wrote.\n\nThe Center identified at least two other oil and gas associations that have made similar donations to the BLM. One, the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, said in a written statement that the average permit processing time in the Oklahoma field office has dropped significantly since the donation was made, without preferential treatment for members of the trade group or \u201cimproper influence on regulators.\u201d\n\n__\n\nSTRUGGLING TO ADJUST\n\nCarlsbad is best known for its namesake caverns, part of a fossil reef that 265 million years ago formed the coastline of an inland sea. Inside the park\u2019s Big Room, among the largest cave chambers in North America, backlit rocks jut out from above and below, eerie and otherworldly. Aboveground is a desert wilderness of weathered rocks covered in yellow grass, dotted with flowering cacti.\n\nBut development isn\u2019t far off. Flares on the side of the road are less than 10 miles away.\n\nThe National Park Service said \u201cexcellent air quality is critical\u201d for the area around the caverns, and it\u2019s begun using a portable monitor to detect ozone \u2014 a type of air pollution that\u2019s bad for sensitive plants and people\u2019s lungs \u2014 as oil and gas activities increase. In 2016, the agency warned in a letter to the BLM that the park was at a tipping point; as drilling moved closer, staffers worried about nitrogen emissions that would harm native plants and wildlife.\n\nHunters, meanwhile, report seeing less game on public lands than they used to, and the acreage on which they can hunt has shrunk, according to the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. And ranchers, even those who have benefited financially from oil and gas operations on their land, say they are getting overrun. Smith started a business to help his fellow ranchers deal with problems, such as companies cutting fences, causing cattle to scatter.\n\nSmith\u2019s business partner, J.W. Todd, supports drilling, as many here do. He likes the idea of \u201cenergy freedom\u201d the Trump administration is pitching \u2014 but not how it\u2019s playing out.\n\nHe wants to own a ranch. He\u2019s getting closer to that goal and now leases one near Carlsbad. This life is his idea of paradise: \u201cI always envisioned myself being a cowboy out in the West, where you can ride for days and just see grass and countryside.\u201d\n\nBut Todd knows oil and gas production is only expected to grow.\n\n\u201cIf the magnitude is what they say it will be,\u201d he said, \u201cwe won\u2019t be able to adjust.\u201d\n\n__\n\nRachel Leven is a reporter for the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative reporting organization in Washington, D.C.

(Rich Saal/The State Journal-Register via AP)\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) \u2014 Advocates for Abraham Lincoln\u2019s museum pleaded with Illinois lawmakers Tuesday to use state funds to help keep a throng of historic artifacts in his hometown despite questions about whether one of the relics \u2014 a stovepipe hat \u2014 actually belonged to the 16th president.\n\nLawmakers grilled Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation leaders over the $9.2 million it still owes on the loan it took in 2007 to buy a collection of as many as 1,500 Lincoln-related items from private collector Louise Taper. The note comes due in October 2019, and the foundation has said it will have to auction parts of the collection if it can\u2019t raise the balance.\n\nBut fundraising isn\u2019t easy in the face of negative publicity. A report this fall found that the foundation had secretly sought expert advice and a DNA test on a period stovepipe hat in Lincoln\u2019s size that failed to delineate a clear connection. Questions about whether administrators of the museum and library were properly informed have strained relations .\n\nThe Taper collection is a smorgasbord of Lincoln memorabilia. Along with thousands of pages of documents dating to the president\u2019s grandfather, Col. Abraham Lincoln, it includes the bloodied kid gloves Lincoln had in his pocket the night he was killed at Ford\u2019s Theater, the quill pen left on his desk; his presidential seal, replete with wax left on it from its last use; and a notebook with his earliest known writings.\n\n\u201cLincoln always knew he would come back to Springfield and that\u2019s where his most iconic personal effects deserve to stay, right here in the land of Lincoln,\u201d foundation CEO Carla Knorowski testified. In a line borrowed from Lincoln\u2019s first inaugural address, she added an \u201cappeal to the better angels of your nature.\u201d\n\nThe foundation has sought $5 million from the hotel occupancy tax money collected for tourism promotion. Knorowski said Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s administration agreed in May but has since backed off.\n\nRauner spokeswoman Elizabeth Tomev said the Republican supports a \u201cvibrant\u201d Lincoln museum but his staff is waiting for a detailed business plan and other debt-repayment data requested last spring.\n\nSold for $25 million, Taper donated $2 million worth of items. The foundation borrowed $23 million and has paid $13 million in principal and $8 million in interest. The loan has been refinanced \u2014 once at a higher rate for a shorter term, Rep. Jeanne Ives noted \u2014 and it stands at $9.2 million despite annual foundation fundraising collections averaging $3.5 million.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand how your foundation directors have allowed this to go on for so long,\u201d said Ives, a Wheaton Republican.\n\nIves read from an appraisal in 2017 that questioned the authenticity not only of the hat but of a clock allegedly from Lincoln\u2019s Springfield law office and a hand fan Mary Lincoln took to the theater the night her husband was shot. State historian Samuel Wheeler, who called the collection \u201cworld class,\u201d said research continues on all three items.\n\nDespite questions, the foundation said an appraisal of just 40 items that it hasn\u2019t identified found a fair-market value of $10.3 million. Knorowski said it\u2019s unclear how many items would have to be sold to satisfy the debt. The foundation is seeking an auction house to be ready for a sale.\n\nAdding a touch of theater to the proceedings was Lincoln presenter Randy Duncan of Carlinville , invited by Rep. Ann Williams, the Chicago Democrat who chairs the House Tourism, Hospitality and Craft Industries Committee.\n\nDuncan appeared this time without the traditional Lincoln-style top hat, a nod to the ongoing controversy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to my legacy than just a hat,\u201d the Lincoln portrayer said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Political Writer John O\u2019Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnor .", "EVANSVILLE, Ind.

Its support isn\u2019t guaranteed: May is under pressure from pro-Brexit ministers not to make further concessions to the EU on the key issue of the Irish border.\n\nA spokesman for chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier urged caution, saying a deal wasn\u2019t yet finalized and the bloc would \u201ctake stock\u201d Wednesday.\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 other EU countries are also due to hold a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.\n\nBritain wants to seal a deal this fall, so that Parliament has time to vote on it before the U.K. leaves the bloc on March 29. The European Parliament also has to approve any agreement, as do all 28 EU nations.\n\nOfficials have said for weeks that agreement on divorce terms and a framework for future U.K.-EU relations was 95 percent complete, and for several days negotiators have been meeting late into the night in Brussels in a bid to close the remaining gaps.\n\nThe main obstacle has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s hard-won peace process \u2014 but they have differed on how to achieve that.\n\nIrish national broadcaster RTE said the draft agreement involves a common customs arrangement for the U.K. and the EU, to eliminate the need for border checks, with special provisions for Northern Ireland and a review mechanism to oversee its functioning.\n\nA sticking point in talks has been Britain\u2019s insistence that any such customs arrangement must be temporary. The EU says that in order to guarantee an open border, it can\u2019t have a time limit.\n\nThe pound rallied on news of a deal, rising 1.5 percent against the dollar to $1.3038.\n\nBut May faces pressure from pro-Brexit Cabinet members and lawmakers not to agree to an arrangement that binds Britain to EU trade rules indefinitely.\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, a staunch \u201cBrexiteer,\u201d said the deal was unacceptable and Cabinet ministers should \u201cchuck it out.\u201d\n\nMay also faces growing opposition from pro-EU lawmakers, who say her proposed Brexit deal is worse than the status quo and the British public should get a new vote on whether to leave or to stay.\n\nOpposition from both sides of the Brexit divide means May could struggle to get a deal approved by Parliament.\n\nMay\u2019s Conservative Party doesn\u2019t hold a majority of seats in the House of Commons, and relies on 10 lawmakers from Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party to win votes. The DUP is wary of any border compromise that could bind Northern Ireland to the EU.\n\nDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party wouldn\u2019t accept \u201cthat our laws would be made in Brussels, not in Westminster or Belfast. That is the fundamental red line.\u201d\n\nIf there is no final agreement soon, U.K. businesses will have to start implementing contingency plans for a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit \u2014 steps that could include cutting jobs, stockpiling goods and relocating production and services outside Britain.\n\nEven with such measures in place, the British government says leaving the EU without a deal could cause major economic disruption, with gridlock at ports and disruption to supplies of foods, goods and medicines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission published a sheaf of notices outlining changes in a host of areas in the event of a no-deal Brexit. They point to major disruption for people and businesses: U.K. truckers\u2019 licenses won\u2019t be valid in the EU, British airlines will no longer enjoy traffic rights, and even British mineral water will cease to be recognized as such by the EU.\n\nThe EU said Tuesday it was proposing visa-free travel for U.K. citizens on short trips, even if there is no deal \u2014 but only if Britain reciprocates.\n\nFor now, whether or not there is a deal relies on volatile British politics, and the outcome is hard to predict.\n\n\u201cThis side of the Channel we are very happy with a balanced solution to the Northern Irish dilemma,\u201d said Tom Vandenkendelaere, a Christian Democrat member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe other side of the Channel?

(AP Photo/Egill Bjarnason, FILE)\n\nREYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) \u2014 For those hoping for ever cheaper fares on long-haul flights, this month\u2019s takeover of Icelandic airline Wow is not good news.\n\nThe struggling airline, which specializes in ultra-cheap flights between North America and Europe, was taken over by Iceland\u2019s flagship carrier, Icelandair, for just $18 million. Its rescue is a reality check for an industry hoping to apply the budget flying model to long-haul routes.\n\nAnd for now it means that passengers from, say, Washington will likely have to pay more than the $99 teaser rates previously offered for the six and half-hour trip to the Icelandic capital, which serves as a stopover to mainland Europe.\n\n\u201cIt simply costs more than $99 to fly between continents and Wow air has not found ways around it,\u201d said Kristjan Sigurjonsson, editor of local travel news site Turisti.\n\nWhile Wow will continue as a separate brand for now, Sigurjonsson says it\u2019s unclear whether Icelandair will have it continue offering such low fares in an attempt to compete with Norwegian Air, which is offering cheap flights at a loss to gain market share.\n\nBut for now, the numbers don\u2019t add up for budget long-haul flying.\n\nPart of the business model for low-cost flying across the Atlantic depends on getting cheaper airport slots, both by departing at odd hours and by flying to smaller cities in the United States. Wow flies to St Louis and Pittsburgh, for example. The low fares, in turn, mean planes are typically full.\n\nWow flies across the Atlantic with single-aisle, narrow-body Airbus A321 jets. Being smaller than a widebody plane makes them easier to fill, an important consideration in keeping down costs per seat. They are also cheaper than two-aisle planes. Wow\u2019s jets are relatively new, meaning they are more fuel-efficient than some competitors\u2019 fleets.\n\nHowever, those savings have been squeezed in the past couple years as oil prices have risen. The U.S. benchmark for oil has risen 50 percent from late 2016 to a peak of $75 in September this year, before easing back somewhat.\n\nFor a budget airline like Wow, where margins are already tight, that means a direct hit to earnings. On top of that, wages have been rising sharply in Iceland, where its employees are based.\n\nFounded in 2012, the airline expanded fast to 37 destinations and reported up to 60 percent annual growth in passenger numbers. Its revenue per passenger, however, has not kept up and fell by about 20 percent in 2017, according to the last earnings report.\n\nAbout 70 percent percent of Wow\u2019s passengers travel between Europe and North America. Combined with Icelandair, the airlines will carry about 3.8 percent of transatlantic passengers, according to analysts at Icelandair.\n\nExperts say that what budget airlines like Wow lack is the big source of money from transatlantic flying: business travelers. The New York-London route is the most lucrative in the world, thanks to the amount of business travelling done between the two financial hubs. British Airways takes in a reported $1 billion a year between those cities alone.\n\nBudget airlines have been trying to tap that market. Wow created a new business-class scheme and in a presentation to investors this year it predicted that would help it make a profit this quarter. Norwegian Air has also offered \u201cPremium class without the premium price,\u201d reportedly with modest success.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether companies booking trips will agree to pick budget airlines over established carriers that are often seen as more reliable because they have bigger fleets and deeper pockets.\n\n\u201cThe established airlines have loyalty programs that hold tight to the most lucrative clients,\u201d said Skarphedinn Steinarsson, former CEO of low-cost carrier IcelandExpress and the director of the Icelandic Tourist Board. \u201cIt takes longer to win this group over than the typical bargain-hunter.\u201d\n\nFor now, it is the flagship carrier coming out on top.\n\nWow founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen urged his staff Monday to \u201clook at this as an opportunity to continue our journey now as a part of a much stronger group\u201d.\n\nThe charismatic boss, who has in the past mocked Icelandair as \u201coutdated\u201d and used his image to represent the airline, acknowledge defeat with much understatement: \u201cIt was not part of the original game plan.\u201d", "In this Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, photo Lauren Ray pets her 9-month-old dog Bear in her Milwaukee home.

Nielsen said sales of pet food free of genetically modified ingredients jumped 29 percent last year. Sales of pet food without artificial preservatives and colors grew 4 percent.\n\nAmericans spent $69.5 billion on their pets last year, up 4 percent from the year before, according to the American Pet Products Association.\n\nPet food has long mimicked human food, says John Owen, a senior food analyst for market researcher Mintel.

Some brands claim to mimic ancestral diets, with kibbles made from venison or wild boar. Cans of cat food feature tilapia, rabbit and pumpkin.\n\nSensing the growing trend, two big food companies \u2014 J.M. Smucker Co. and General Mills \u2014 spent billions to acquire the natural pet food brands Nutrish and Blue Buffalo earlier this year.\n\nAshley Murphy, a 33-year-old project manager in Atlanta, has been watching the amount of sugar and preservatives in her own food. That made her question the ingredients in the food she feeds her dog Maddie, a Jack Russell mix.\n\nMurphy recently switched to Canidae Grain Free Pure Ancestral dry dog food after reading the ingredients on lots of bags. Murphy wanted a food with more meat, fewer fillers like grains and corn, and fewer chemicals.\n\n\u201cMinus some of the minerals and some of the fermentation products at the very bottom of the list, I can pronounce every single ingredient in her new food,\u201d said Murphy, who said she doesn\u2019t mind spending more for the food.\n\nOwen says young people like Murphy are driving the trend in natural pet food. He expects it will keep growing and lead to even more \u201cnatural\u201d innovations, like freeze-dried raw food.\n\nCoughlin says the majority of pet food Petco sells now doesn\u2019t contain artificial ingredients. Still, the change isn\u2019t insignificant; Petco sells around $100 million worth of dog and cat food with artificial ingredients each year.\n\nCoughlin said food with those ingredients will start coming off the shelves in January. Some suppliers are reformulating their food; others simply won\u2019t sell through Petco anymore, he said. Food with artificial ingredients that isn\u2019t sold by May will be donated to animal shelters.\n\nEventually the store plans to expand its ban on artificial ingredients to foods it sells for other animals, he said.\n\nDr. Whitney Miller, Petco\u2019s top veterinarian, said there is limited research into the impact of artificial ingredients on dogs and cats. And Dr. Hollie Rebo, a veterinarian based in Dearborn, Michigan, said consumers shouldn\u2019t be overly concerned since pet food makers already limit those ingredients because they add costs.\n\nWhen they do add things like artificial colors, it\u2019s because it makes the food more palatable to humans.\n\n\u201cI love the idea of getting rid of a lot of useless junk, but it\u2019s really there to sell more product,\u201d she said.", "U.S. Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., declares victory over Republican challenger U.S. Rep.

But a week after the voting, Democrats are riding higher than they thought on election night.\n\nAs vote counting presses on in several states, the Democrats have steadily chalked up victories across the country, firming up their grip on the U.S. House and statehouses. The slow roll of wins has given the party plenty to celebrate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to claim victory for his party on election night. But the Democrats, who hit political rock bottom just two years ago, have now picked up at least 32 seats in the House \u2014 and lead in four more \u2014 in addition to flipping seven governorships and eight state legislative chambers.\n\nThey are on track to lose two seats in the Senate in a year both parties predicted more. On Monday night, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema won Arizona\u2019s Senate race, beating Republican Rep. Martha McSally to take the seat held by retiring GOP Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema has won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake. She won a tight race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead. (Nov. 13)\n\nThe blue shift alters the trajectory of Trump\u2019s next two years in the White House, breaking up the Republican monopoly in Washington. It also gives Democrats stronger footing in key states ahead of the next presidential race and in the redrawing of congressional districts \u2014 a complicated process that has been dominated by the GOP, which has drawn favorable boundaries for their candidates.\n\nTrump and his allies discounted the Democratic victories on Monday, pointing to GOP successes in Republican-leaning states.\n\n\u201cThanks to the grassroots support for @realDonaldTrump and our party\u2019s ground game, we were able to #DefyHistory and make gains in the Senate!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, citing Senate wins in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee, among others.\n\nIndeed, just once in the past three decades had a sitting president added Senate seats in his first midterm election. But lost in McDaniel\u2019s assessment was the difficult 2018 Senate landscape for Democrats, who were defending 10 seats in states Trump carried just two years ago.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview: \u201cI believe in facts. And the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party had a historic night at the ballot box \u2014 and we are not resting,\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOur goal was to compete everywhere, to expand and reshape the electorate everywhere \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats found success by attracting support from women, minorities and college-educated voters. Overall, 50 percent of white college-educated voters and 56 percent of women backed Democrats nationwide, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.\n\nDemocrats featured historic diversity on the ballot.\n\nTheir winning class includes Massachusetts\u2019 first African-American female member of Congress, Ayanna Presley, and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Talib and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar, the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, along with Kansas\u2019 Sharice Davids, the first lesbian Native American.\n\nThey also won by running candidates with military backgrounds who openly embraced gun ownership, such as Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb and Maine\u2019s Jared Golden, who is poised to win his contest because of the state\u2019s ranked-choice voting system.\n\nThe Democrats needed to gain 23 seats to seize the House majority. Once all the votes are counted, which could take weeks in some cases as absentees and provisional ballots are tallied, they could win close to 40.\n\nDemocrats have not lost a single House incumbent so far. Yet they defeated Republican targets such as Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Dana Rohrabacher of California.\n\nThey could win as many as 19 House races in districts carried by Trump two years ago, according to House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.\n\nTen House races remained too close for the AP to call as of Monday evening.\n\nFar more of the Senate landscape was decided early, although contests in Florida and Mississippi remain outstanding.\n\nWhile there were notable statehouse Democratic losses in Iowa and Ohio, the party flipped governorships in seven states: Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Kansas, New Mexico and Maine.\n\nRepublicans now control 25 governorships nationwide compared to 23 for Democrats. High-profile contests in Florida and Georgia remain outstanding, though Republicans hold narrow leads in both states.\n\nOvershadowed perhaps by the higher-profile statewide elections, Democratic gains in state legislatures could prove deeply consequential.\n\nOverall, they flipped state legislative chambers in eight states this midterm season, including Washington state\u2019s Senate in 2017. The others include the state Senates in Maine, Colorado, New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut in addition to the state Houses of Representatives in New Hampshire and Minnesota.\n\nWith hundreds of races still too close to call, Democrats have won at least 370 new state legislative seats nationwide, according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, although the new seats were offset by Republican wins in some cases. The pickups include surprises in West Virginia, where Democrats knocked off the GOP majority leader-designate in the House and the majority leader in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have elected a new generation of inspiring leaders and we know that a new era of democratic dominance is on the horizon,\u201d said the committee\u2019s executive director Jessica Post.\n\nStill, Republicans will control the majority of state legislative chambers, governorships, the U.S. Senate and the White House.

Her Malala Fund has invested, she said at the time, a total of $6 million for schools and to provide books and uniforms for schoolchildren in Pakistan.", "GREENSBORO, N.C.

(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump sought to intervene in Florida\u2019s legally mandated vote recount Tuesday, calling on the state\u2019s Democratic senator to admit defeat and again implying without evidence that officials in two pivotal counties are trying to steal the election.\n\n\u201cWhen will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?\u201d Trump said in a morning tweet. \u201cThe characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u2018find\u2019 enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\u201d\n\nThere have been bumps as Florida undergoes recounts for both the governor and Senate races. Palm Beach County said it won\u2019t finish its recount by the Thursday deadline. In oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff\u2019s deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, a compromise aimed at alleviating concerns. Those counties are both Democratic strongholds.\n\nStill, the state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which are run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nMeanwhile, a flurry of legal action continued. Nelson and a Democratic campaign committee filed two more lawsuits on Tuesday, including one that asks a federal judge to set aside looming deadlines for a machine recount as well as a hand recount, if it is ordered.\n\nAP's Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace explains why outstanding races in Florida and Georgia have become so significant, that even President Donald Trump has taken to twitter about one of them. (Nov. 12)\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this year, the Florida recount was personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state in the waning days of the election and put his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing former Rep. Ron DeSantis. After Election Day, Trump\u2019s aides pointed to the GOP\u2019s seeming success in the state as a validation that the president\u2019s path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \u201cobviously has his opinion\u201d on the recount.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly frustrating to watch,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\u201d\n\nSchumer said election officials should have all the time they need to count every vote, rather than Sunday\u2019s deadline. Nelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed two lawsuits aimed at that goal. One lawsuit questions rules used by the state for hand recounts, while a second asks a federal judge to give counties more time to complete both a machine and a hand recount. Right now counties are doing a machine recount.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, contended there was no legal need for the existing deadlines since the Senate winner would not be sworn in until January.\n\nStill, there\u2019s not much choice but for Florida to go through the process. State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Republican Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nThe recount process has drawn a sharp focus on several county election officials, especially Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n\nSnipes has drawn criticism from Trump and other high-profile Republicans as her county\u2019s election returns showed a narrowing lead for Scott during the ballot-counting in the days after Election Day, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 who appointed her in 2003 \u2014 said she should be removed. Asked about those criticisms Tuesday, she hinted that she may not run for re-election in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cI\u2019ll check with my family and they\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to about 200 supporters in Orlando church Tuesday night, Gillum said claims without evidence by Trump, Scott and Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio that electoral fraud was taking place were sowing seeds that could undermine confidence in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cDisenfranchisement shows up with the president of the United States, the sitting governor of the state of Florida, the junior senator of the United States from the state of Florida when they take to Twitter, and Facebook and ... accuse the supervisor of elections, or an entire county for that matter, of fraud, of stuffing the ballot box, of doing everything they could do manipulate the outcome of the election without a shred of evidence. That is called disenfranchisement,\u201d Gillum said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said the county\u2019s 11-year-old tallying machines aren\u2019t fast enough to complete the recount by Thursday. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor\u2019s race. If the deadline is not met in a race, the results it reported Saturday will stand.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Gary Fineout and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida; Mike Schneider in Orlando; and Alan Fram, Darlene Superville and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "FILE - In this Sept. 13, 2016, file photo, George Zimmerman looks at the jury as he testifies in a Seminole County courtroom in Orlando, Fla. On Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, Zimmerman is expected to enter a no contest plea to resolve a misdemeanor charge of stalking a private investigator in the latest run-in with the law for the neighborhood watch leader who killed Trayvon Martin. (Red Huber/Orlando Sentinel via AP, Pool, File)\n\nSANFORD, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida judge agreed to let former neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman serve probation for a year after his attorney entered a no contest plea Tuesday to resolve a misdemeanor charge of stalking a private investigator associated with a documentary on the black teenager Zimmerman killed.\n\nSeminole County Judge Mark Herr admonished Zimmerman to understand that \u201cwords matter.\u201d Under a no contest plea, a defendant doesn\u2019t admit guilt, and a conviction is withheld if the conditions of the plea are met. Zimmerman wasn\u2019t at the courthouse during the hearing.\n\n\u201cPlease counsel him,\u201d the judge told his attorney, Zahra Umansky. \u201cWords do matter.\u201d\n\nThe private investigator, Dennis Warren, said after the hearing that Zimmerman didn\u2019t get the sentence he deserved but believed \u201cwe got the best we could.\u201d He said he had hoped the case would have been handled as a felony rather than a misdemeanor.\n\nThe private investigator said he didn\u2019t think Zimmerman could get through a year without violating his probation.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t stay away from trouble. He\u2019s toxic,\u201d Warren said.\n\nZimmerman was accused of sending threatening messages to Warren. The private investigator was hired by a documentary filmmaker who was working on a series on Trayvon Martin, the black teen who was fatally shot by Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman, who identifies as Hispanic, was acquitted of all charges in the case, which raised questions about race and Florida\u2019s \u201cstand your ground\u201d self-defense law. That law allows people to use force without retreating if they feel threatened. Critics say the law allows black men to be victimized by gun violence\n\nThe documentary was produced by rapper Jay-Z.\n\nReading a victim impact statement in court, Warren said Zimmerman made scores of harassing emails and telephone calls, threatening the private investigator and his family starting last December. The threats included details about his life that few people knew, such as where he was traveling and on what airline, said Warren, who got extra security for his house.\n\n\u201cThe threats were for me to immediately stop what I was doing or he was going to harm me,\u201d said Warren, who added he believed Zimmerman still had \u201ca propensity for violence.\u201d\n\nWhen Warren started describing how he felt mistreated by Zimmerman\u2019s attorney during a deposition, the judge stopped him after Umansky objected.\n\n\u201cI feel your pain, Mr. Warren ... Let\u2019s keep it to Mr. Zimmerman, not counsel,\u201d Herr said. \u201cHe is going to be watched and hopefully, it will never happen again. Hopefully.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of Tuesday\u2019s agreement, Zimmerman has to report for probation by Thursday and can do it by telephone. He can have no contact with Warren and his wife for a decade.\n\nSince Zimmerman\u2019s 2013 acquittal in Martin\u2019s fatal shooting, Zimmerman has had several run-ins with the law, including two cases of domestic aggravated assault that were later dropped\n\nThe judge expressed hope that Zimmerman would avoid making future appearances at the Seminole County Courthouse.\n\n\u201cWe would like to not have to see his name for a while,\u201d Herr said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP", "In this Friday, Aug. 10, 2018 photo, Jamie Casey, right, speaks with Brian Peets at a homeless camp in New Bedford, Mass., on Friday, Aug. 10, 2018. \u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself.

Pleas to struggling souls to surrender to God. Funerals for members of their flock who didn\u2019t make it.\n\nClergy members have become spiritual first responders in the opioid crisis, often leaving the pulpit to minister on the streets.\n\nThey can be reverends, rabbis, priests or pastors. Though their faiths differ, they invariably approach people with addiction as equals. No Bible-thumping, no blaming. Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation\u2019s all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, \u2019God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\u201d Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \u201cWhy are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\n(Nov. 13)\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\n(Nov. 13)\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \u201cYou guys Catholics or something?\u201d He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls.\n\n___\n\nMichael Hill is a multi-format AP journalist based in Albany, New York.

Hill drew a penalty on his celebration. (AP Photo/Ed Zurga)\n\nNFL players seem to have run out of creative ways to celebrate.\n\nEither that, or they\u2019ve decided to pay homage to the players they grew up watching, even if it costs them some funds for injecting fun into the game.\n\nChiefs receiver Tyreek Hill was the latest to go old school when he commemorated his second touchdown in Week 10 by commandeering the CBS camera like Cincinnati\u2019s Chad Ochocinco once did.\n\n\u201cThe celebration just came into my head,\u201d said Hill, whose actions netted an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and a coach Andy Reid\u2019s ire.\n\n\u201cThat was too much,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe NFL, which has relaxed celebration rules, might agree.\n\nHill\u2019s stunt came days after Saints receiver Michael Thomas was fined $30,000 for using a phone as a prop, a la Joe Horn, and Titans safety Kevin Byard was dinged $10,026 for celebrating an end zone interception on the Cowboys\u2019 midfield star logo, just like Terrell Owens did in 2000.\n\nSaints tight end Ben Watson added a little twist to his celebration when he stuffed the football under his jersey to signal his wife\u2019s pregnancy just like ... Ben Watson did, back in 2009.\n\nWhen Watson, 37, scored against the Rams last Sunday, he let the world know he and his wife, Kristen, are expecting twins by stuffing the ball under the front of his jersey and holding up five fingers on one hand as he often does to honor his five children.\n\nThen he held up two more fingers on his other hand in honor of the twins on the way.\n\nNine years ago, Watson similarly stuffed the ball under his jersey after scoring as Kristen was close to full term with their first child, Grace. He was fined shortly thereafter for using the ball as a prop.\n\n\u201cSo the cool thing is I will be able to say (to his twins) that, \u2018When I did it for Grace, I had to pay.

You must have been in elementary school back then.\u2019 But that was pretty good. I\u2019ve got to give him props on that one.\u201d\n\nNo pun intended, of course.\n\nByard said Friday his $10,026 fine was worth it because his interception denied the Cowboys a touchdown and sparked a 28-7 run in Tennessee\u2019s 28-14 win in Dallas on Monday night.\n\nByard said he expected the Cowboys to take offense when he sprinted to the 50-yard line to pose on the star, then began a sort of Irish jig when teammates joined him at midfield.\n\n\u201cI was actually expecting someone to knock my head off,\u201d Byard said. \u201cI was like, if we get enough guys to the 50, we are just going to start dancing on the star.\u201d\n\nCowboys running back Byron Jones quickly shoved Byard away, playing the part of George Teague, who blasted Owens when he did the same thing while with the 49ers 18 years ago.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do that,\u201d Jones said.\n\nByard met with his coach, Mike Vrabel, who had a big problem with his DB\u2019s actions.\n\nVrabel said he wants players to celebrate with each other and not stand up an opponent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what we want to do,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nByard said his over-the-top celebrations are history.\n\nOther takeaways from Week 10 included a stumbling, bumbling Tom Brady, a shoutout from the Rams to Halle Berry and Sean McVay\u2019s decision to train at altitude in preparation for Monday night\u2019s showdown between the Rams and Chiefs, who are both 9-1.\n\nALTITUDE ACCLIMATION: Last year, Bill Belichick decided to stay in Colorado after a win at Denver to acclimate to the altitude of Mexico City\u2019s Azteca Stadium (elevation 7,200 feet) by practicing at the Air Force Academy (6,621 feet).\n\nIt paid off in a 31-8 drubbing of the Oakland Raiders, who stayed home and prepped at sea level.\n\nMcVay said the trade-off is scrubbing the team\u2019s routine, but the wildfires and mass shooting in Thousand Oaks has made training in Southern California anything but normal anyway.\n\nThe Rams will train in the Rocky Mountains on Thursday through Saturday before flying to Mexico, and McVay said a second charter with family members will fly out from L.A. to Colorado later in the week.\n\n\u201cI think it really served us well last year when we went to Jacksonville before we played in London,\u201d McVay said. \u201cStaying out there, kind of a way to connect with the team.

Hours later, the Bulls (3-0) won their second road game this season by beating Southern Illinois 62-53 .\n\n\u201cI told (the players) congrats, and I just said, listen, if you\u2019re going to sit on your phones all day and search your name and Buffalo basketball, it\u2019s a negative,\u2019\u201d fourth-year coach Nate Oats told The Associated Press after Monday night\u2019s win. \u201cWe can use it for a positive and it should motivate you to play even harder to prove these voters right, that they know what they\u2019re talking about, that now more people are going to be watching us.\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s make sure that all these accolades we get this year, we use them as positives and they don\u2019t turn into negatives for us.\u201d\n\nUnlike teams that fly largely unnoticed until the wins pile up in February, Buffalo needed only a week of the regular season to make its move.\n\nPart of that carries over from one of the biggest March moments in last year\u2019s NCAA first round: a blowout win against an Arizona team that featured No. 1 overall NBA draft pick Deandre Ayton. The Bulls lost to Kentucky in the second round to close a 27-win season, which sustained momentum from the program making its first NCAA trip in 2015 \u2014 under current Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley \u2014 and then going twice more in Oats\u2019 first three seasons.\n\nThen, on Friday , Buffalo beat then-No. 13 West Virginia behind 43 points and 14 rebounds from CJ Massinburg.\n\nBuffalo has a couple of notable nonconference games on the schedule in December, including consecutive road games at No. 15 Syracuse and No. 24 Marquette.\n\nIn the meantime, the Bulls don\u2019t play again until Nov. 21 against Dartmouth, though Oats figures his team can use the break. The Bulls are unbeaten despite shooting less than 40 percent through the first three games, including 26 percent from 3-point range.\n\nFix that, and Buffalo could be staying in the AP Top 25 a while.\n\n\u201cThe way our shooting\u2019s gone, it may not be the worst to have nine days off,\u201d Oats said. \u201cWe can regroup. ...

That one turned out to be the final stop in the Wildcats\u2019 romp through the postseason, ending with a second NCAA title in three seasons.\n\nDUKE ON TOP\n\nDuke\u2019s blowout of then-No. 2 Kentucky vaulted the Blue Devils from No. 4 in the preseason to No. 1 on Monday, giving them a record number of appearances atop the AP Top 25.\n\nDuke made the move by claiming the top spot for all 19 voters who had Kentucky as preseason No. 1 while also causing 23 voters to switch from Kansas in the preseason to Duke this week.\n\nThe Blue Devils play as the No. 1-ranked team Wednesday at home against Eastern Michigan.\n\nCONFERENCE WATCH\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference has a national-best seven ranked teams with Duke, fourth-ranked Virginia, UNC, No. 14 Florida State, Syracuse, No. 16 Virginia Tech and No. 19 Clemson. The Southeastern Conference is next with five ranked teams, led by fifth-ranked Tennessee, ninth-ranked Auburn and 10th-ranked Kentucky.\n\nWATCH LIST\n\nWest Virginia leads the list of teams receiving votes after falling out of the poll following the Buffalo loss, so the Mountaineers could play their way back in with a good showing in the eight-team Myrtle Beach Invitational in Conway, South Carolina.\n\nIndiana has a game that could help its chances with Wednesday\u2019s visit from Marquette, which is ranked for the first time in five years.

In fact, when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recording he was so shocked that he said \u2018this one probably took heroin. Only someone who took heroin would do it,\u2019\u201d Erdogan was reported as saying in comments published in pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak.\n\nErdogan did not elaborate on how and when the Saudi official heard the recording of the killing of the Saudi citizen.\n\nTurkey says Khashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post columnist and often criticized the crown prince, was killed by a 15-member assassination squad sent from Riyadh.

The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.\n\nKuwait and Bolivia called for the closed Security Council consultations.\n\n___\n\n11:40 p.m.\n\nIsrael\u2019s U.N. ambassador says Security Council members that want to blame Israel for the latest fighting with the Hamas militant group in Gaza are \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d and rejects those who call for restraint by both sides.\n\nDanny Danon told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York that \u201cthere is no such thing as both sides.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is Hamas that attacks and fires over 460 missiles at civilians and there is Israel that protects its people.\u201d\n\nDanon said ahead of closed Security Council consultations late Tuesday that the council must condemn only Hamas \u201cfor its aggressive assault on civilians.\u201d\n\nAsked about an undercover Israeli military operation that sparked the Hamas attacks and Israeli bombing of Gaza, Danon said: \u201cWe take action to protect our people and we will continue to do that.\u201d\n\n___\n\n9 p.m.\n\nThe Palestinian U.N. ambassador says Egyptian mediators are in Israel trying to get the government to agree on a Gaza cease-fire.\n\nRiyad Mansour, who represents the Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York on Tuesday that \u201cwe are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, says it agreed to the Egyptian cease-fire proposal. There has been no word yet from Israel.\n\nMansour says \u201cthe Palestinian side is holding the quietness in order to allow for the Egyptian efforts to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe says Abbas is returning from Kuwait for emergency meetings.\n\nMansour condemned Israel for starting the cycle of violence with a botched undercover military operation on Sunday.\n\nAt the Palestinians\u2019 request, he said, Kuwait and Bolivia have asked for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on the Israeli actions. China, the current council president, has called for closed consultations late Tuesday.\n\n___\n\n8:40 p.m.\n\nSome Palestinians in Gaza are celebrating and Israelis in southern Israel are protesting an emerging cease-fire deal to end more than 24 hours of heavy fighting.\n\nGazans see the cease-fire as a win for Hamas, for having brought Israel to heel with a barrage of rocket fire. Amid an apparent lull in violence, hundreds of Hamas supporters took to the streets in sporadic gatherings, cheering for the group\u2019s military wing.\n\nIn the southern Israeli town of Sderot, which has been pounded by rockets, dozens of protesters burnt tires, blocked traffic and chanted \u201cdisgrace\u201d at what they saw as the government\u2019s caving in to militant violence.\n\nWhile there has been no word from Israel, Gaza militants earlier Tuesday announced they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire.\n\n___\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nPalestinian militant groups in the Gaza Strip say they have accepted an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire amid a major flare-up of violence with Israel.\n\nHamas and smaller armed groups announced the cease-fire in a joint statement late Tuesday.\n\nThe deal would end the heaviest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas since a 2014 war.\n\nTerms of the deal were not immediately known, and there was no immediate comment from Israel.\n\n___\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nThe leader of the Hamas militant group has signaled a readiness to halt the latest round of fighting with Israel.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh said Tuesday that his group will stop its rocket fire on Israel if Israel halts its airstrikes.\n\nIn a statement, Haniyeh said \u201cthe Palestinian resistance is defending its people and itself before the Israeli aggression,\u201d adding that \u201cif the occupation stops its aggression, it\u2019s possible to return to the cease-fire understandings.\u201d\n\nGaza militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel over the past 24 hours as Israel has struck militant targets across Hamas-ruled Gaza. The violence was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid on Sunday in which seven Palestinians and an Israeli officer were killed.\n\n___\n\n5 p.m.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Security Cabinet has ordered the military to continue strikes in Gaza \u201cas is necessary,\u201d signaling that the latest flare-up of violence may be far from over.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet Tuesday to plot a way forward amid the fighting. Rocket fire and airstrikes continued throughout the six-hour meeting.\n\nThe Israeli military says some 400 rockets and mortar shells have been launched from Gaza since Monday afternoon, with about 100 of them intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system.\n\nIsrael said it has struck more than 100 targets it says are linked to militants in Gaza, including a strike that destroyed the TV station of the ruling Hamas militant group.\n\nAt least seven Palestinians, among them five militants, have been killed during the fighting. A Palestinian man working in Israel was killed after a rocket hit the building he was in.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nIsraeli media are reporting that a meeting of the Security Cabinet has ended after more than six hours.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the meeting of ministers Tuesday to plot a way forward amid an intense flare-up of fighting with the Islamic militant group Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nNo official statement was released following the meeting, and it remained unclear what if anything had been decided.\n\nThe heavy exchange of fire, which was triggered by a botched Israeli undercover raid into Hamas-ruled Gaza late Sunday, marked the most serious escalation since an Israel-Hamas war in 2014.\n\n___\n\n11:55 a.m.\n\nThe man killed in a Palestinian rocket attack in southern Israel has been identified as a 48-year-old Palestinian laborer who had been working in the Israeli city of Ashkelon.\n\nRelatives say Mahmoud Abu Asbeh had worked in Ashkelon for 15 years, leaving his West Bank village of Halhoul each Sunday and returning home on weekends.\n\nHis cousin Jihad Abu Asbeh called it a \u201cbig shock\u201d and says the entire village is sad. He says it was \u201cGod\u2019s will and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d\n\nMahmoud\u2019s body was found in the rubble of a building struck by a rocket fired from Gaza. His cousin says Mahmoud was married with six children.\n\n___\n\n8:55 a.m.\n\nThe armed wing of Hamas says it will step up attacks and fire rockets at Israeli towns of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continues to carry out airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nThe warning was issued on Tuesday, hours after a rocket fired from Gaza killed an Israeli man in a direct hit on a residential building in the coastal town of Ashkelon. The rocket was fired after an Israeli airstrike destroyed Hamas\u2019 TV building in Gaza.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said in a statement that Ashkelon \u201chas entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\u201d\n\nHe says that Ashdod and Beersheba \u201care the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\u201d\n\nOf the three cities, Ashkelon is closest to Gaza.\n\n___\n\n8 a.m.\n\nIsraeli medical services say a man has been killed by a rocket that hit an apartment building in southern Israel and a woman was critically wounded.\n\nMagen David Adom says the two were trapped in an apartment in Ashkelon that was struck by a rocket from Gaza early on Tuesday. It\u2019s the first casualty in Israel from the most intensive wave of attacks since the 2014 Gaza war.\n\nGaza militants pummeled Israel overnight with dozens of rockets and the Israeli military responded with strikes against militant targets in Gaza.\n\nThe military says there were some 370 launches from Gaza since the current round began on Monday afternoon. About 100 of them were intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome defense system.\n\nIsrael has struck more than 100 militant targets in Gaza.", "Employees at the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections office feed ballots through a machine as they count votes during a recount, Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in West Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump sought to intervene in Florida\u2019s legally mandated vote recount Tuesday, calling on the state\u2019s Democratic senator to admit defeat and again implying without evidence that officials in two pivotal counties are trying to steal the election.\n\n\u201cWhen will Bill Nelson concede in Florida?\u201d Trump said in a morning tweet. \u201cThe characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u2018find\u2019 enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\u201d\n\nThere have been bumps as Florida undergoes recounts for both the governor and Senate races. Palm Beach County said it won\u2019t finish its recount by the Thursday deadline. In oft-criticized Broward County, additional sheriff\u2019s deputies were sent to guard ballots and voting machines, a compromise aimed at alleviating concerns. Those counties are both Democratic strongholds.\n\nStill, the state elections department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which are run by Republican appointees, have said they have seen no evidence of voter fraud. A Broward County judge challenged anyone who has evidence of fraud to file a report.\n\nMeanwhile, a flurry of legal action continued. Nelson and a Democratic campaign committee filed two more lawsuits on Tuesday, including one that asks a federal judge to set aside looming deadlines for a machine recount as well as a hand recount, if it is ordered.\n\nAP's Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace explains why outstanding races in Florida and Georgia have become so significant, that even President Donald Trump has taken to twitter about one of them. (Nov. 12)\n\nPresidents have historically sought to rise above the heated partisan drama surrounding election irregularities. Former President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t so publicly involved when a recount and legal process in the 2008 election delayed a Democrat taking a Minnesota Senate seat until July 2009. Former President Bill Clinton struck a lower tone during the 2000 presidential recount, which also centered on Florida.\n\nBut this year, the Florida recount was personal for Trump. He aggressively campaigned in the state in the waning days of the election and put his finger on the scales of the Republican gubernatorial primary this summer by endorsing former Rep. Ron DeSantis. After Election Day, Trump\u2019s aides pointed to the GOP\u2019s seeming success in the state as a validation that the president\u2019s path to re-election remained clear \u2014 a narrative that has grown hazier as the outcomes have become less certain.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp said Tuesday the president \u201cobviously has his opinion\u201d on the recount.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly frustrating to watch,\u201d she said.\n\nU.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is attempting to bully Florida election officials out of doing their jobs. Schumer and Nelson, both Democrats, spoke with reporters Tuesday in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plain wrong. It\u2019s un-American.\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIf he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing and lying about the vote in Florida, and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scale of justice.\u201d\n\nSchumer said election officials should have all the time they need to count every vote, rather than Sunday\u2019s deadline. Nelson and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed two lawsuits aimed at that goal. One lawsuit questions rules used by the state for hand recounts, while a second asks a federal judge to give counties more time to complete both a machine and a hand recount. Right now counties are doing a machine recount.\n\nMarc Elias, a campaign attorney for Nelson, contended there was no legal need for the existing deadlines since the Senate winner would not be sworn in until January.\n\nStill, there\u2019s not much choice but for Florida to go through the process. State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. In the Senate race, Republican Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. In the governor\u2019s contest, unofficial results showed Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis ahead of Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points.\n\nOnce the recount is complete, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or less, a hand recount will be ordered, meaning it could take even longer to complete the review of the Senate race if the difference remains narrow.\n\nThe recount process has drawn a sharp focus on several county election officials, especially Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n\nSnipes has drawn criticism from Trump and other high-profile Republicans as her county\u2019s election returns showed a narrowing lead for Scott during the ballot-counting in the days after Election Day, and even former Gov. Jeb Bush \u2014 who appointed her in 2003 \u2014 said she should be removed. Asked about those criticisms Tuesday, she hinted that she may not run for re-election in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is time to move on,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cI\u2019ll check with my family and they\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to about 200 supporters in Orlando church Tuesday night, Gillum said claims without evidence by Trump, Scott and Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio that electoral fraud was taking place were sowing seeds that could undermine confidence in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cDisenfranchisement shows up with the president of the United States, the sitting governor of the state of Florida, the junior senator of the United States from the state of Florida when they take to Twitter, and Facebook and ... accuse the supervisor of elections, or an entire county for that matter, of fraud, of stuffing the ballot box, of doing everything they could do manipulate the outcome of the election without a shred of evidence. That is called disenfranchisement,\u201d Gillum said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Palm Beach, Elections Supervisor Susan Bucher said the county\u2019s 11-year-old tallying machines aren\u2019t fast enough to complete the recount by Thursday. The county is doing the Senate race first and will then do the governor\u2019s race. If the deadline is not met in a race, the results it reported Saturday will stand.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Gary Fineout and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee, Florida; Mike Schneider in Orlando; and Alan Fram, Darlene Superville and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics .", "Hamas says it will fire rockets at Israeli towns of Beersheba, Ashdod if Israeli airstrikes on Gaza continue", "", "US airman in Japan dies in stabbing, Japanese woman arrested\n\nTOKYO (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Air Force says a U.S. airman in Japan has been stabbed and later died at a hospital.

Nahziah Carter added 11 points off the bench.\n\nOlin Carter III led the Toreros (2-1) with 17 points and Isaiah Pineiro added 14 despite foul trouble that limited his time in the first half. Yauhen Massalski had 12 points and 11 rebounds and helped the Toreros take a 32-31 lead at halftime.\n\nSan Diego scored 16 straight points that spanned the end of the first half and opening minutes of the second and took a nine-point lead with 16 minutes left.

Dickerson pulled Washington even at 59-all and two free throws from Hameir Wright gave the Huskies a 61-60 lead. Washington\u2019s final seven points came at the free throw line, but it was Nowell\u2019s final two that proved the most important.\n\nMassalski was fouled with 29 seconds left and the Toreros trailing 64-62. He hit the first but the second free throw rimmed out. Nowell was fouled and hit both free throws, and Washington escaped. The Huskies were 15 of 17 at the line for the game.\n\n\u201cWe have to play with that sense of urgency for longer periods of time,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cHow many times did we get eight-point leads and we gave it back?

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul)\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 When U.S. forces and their Afghan allies rode into Kabul in November 2001 they were greeted as liberators. But after 17 years of war, the Taliban have retaken half the country, security is worse than it\u2019s ever been, and many Afghans place the blame squarely on the Americans.\n\nThe United States has lost more than 2,400 soldiers in its longest war, and has spent more than $900 billion on everything from military operations to the construction of roads, bridges and power plants. Three U.S. presidents have pledged to bring peace to Afghanistan, either by adding or withdrawing troops, by engaging the Taliban or shunning them. Last year, the U.S. dropped the \u201cmother of all bombs\u201d on a cave complex.\n\nNone of it has worked. After years of frustration, Afghanistan is rife with conspiracy theories, including the idea that Americans didn\u2019t stumble into a forever war, but planned one all along.\n\nMohammed Ismail Qasimyar, a member of Afghanistan\u2019s High Peace Council, wonders how U.S. and NATO forces \u2014 which at their peak numbered 150,000 and fought alongside hundreds of thousands of Afghan troops, were unable to vanquish tens of thousands of Taliban.\n\n\u201cEither they did not want to or they could not do it,\u201d he said. He now suspects the U.S. and its ally Pakistan deliberately sowed chaos in Afghanistan to justify the lingering presence of foreign forces \u2014 now numbering around 15,000 \u2014 in order to use the country as a listening post to monitor Iran, Russia and China.\n\n\u201cThey have made a hell, not a paradise for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAfghanistan is rife with such conspiracy theories. After last month\u2019s assassination of Kandahar\u2019s powerful police chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq, social media exploded with pictures and posts suggesting he was the victim of a U.S. conspiracy. Recent insider attacks, in which Afghan forces have killed their erstwhile U.S. and NATO allies, have attracted online praise.\n\n\u201cIn 2001 the Afghan people supported the arrival of the United States and the international community wholeheartedly,\u201d said Hamid Karzai, who was installed as Afghanistan\u2019s first president and twice won re-election, serving until 2014.\n\n\u201cFor a number of years things worked perfectly well,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cThen we saw the United States either changed course or simply neglected the views of the Afghan people and the conditions of the Afghans.\u201d\n\nHe blames the lingering war on the U.S. failure to eliminate militant sanctuaries in neighboring Pakistan, the bombing of Afghan villages and homes, and the detention of Afghans in raids.\n\nOthers blame the notoriously corrupt government, which Karzai headed for more than a decade, and which is widely seen as yet another bitter fruit of the American invasion.\n\n\u201cAll the money that has come to this country has gone to the people in power. The poor people didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d said Hajji Akram, a day laborer in Kabul\u2019s Old City who struggles to feed his family on around $4 a day. \u201cThe foreigners are not making things better. They should go.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Afghans. The United States\u2019 own inspector general for Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction offered a blistering critique in a speech in Ohio earlier this month.\n\nJohn Sopko pointed out that the U.S. has spent $132 billion on Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction \u2014 more than was spent on Western Europe after World War II. Another $750 billion has been spent on U.S. military operations, and Washington has pledged $4 billion a year for Afghanistan\u2019s security forces.\n\nThe result?\n\n\u201cEven after 17 years of U.S. and coalition effort and financial largesse, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest, least educated, and most corrupt countries in the world,\u201d Sopko said. \u201cIt is also one of the most violent.\u201d\n\nHamidullah Nasrat sells imported fabrics in the capital\u2019s main bazaar on the banks of the Kabul River, a fetid trickle running through a garbage-filled trench. He remembers welcoming the overthrow of the Taliban, who had shut down his photography studio because it was deemed un-Islamic.\n\n\u201cAfter the Taliban we were expecting something good, but instead, day by day, it is getting worse,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is it that a superpower like the United States cannot stop the Taliban? It is a question every Afghan is asking.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014. Since then, the Taliban have carried out near-daily attacks on rural checkpoints and staged coordinated assaults on major cities. Authorities stopped publishing casualty figures earlier this year, deeming them classified. An Islamic State affiliate has meanwhile carried out massive bombings against the country\u2019s Shiite minority.\n\nAfghans who have recently served on the front lines complain of faulty equipment, inadequate supplies and reinforcements that show up late and ill-equipped, if at all.\n\nTameem Darvesh served in the Afghan army for nearly five years in the southern Helmand province. This year he went on holiday and never returned, trading his $180 monthly salary for work as a day laborer making much less. He said morale is at an all-time low, with many soldiers expressing sympathy for the Taliban.\n\nJawad Mohammadi served for more than seven years in the security forces until 2015, when he stepped on a land-mine he was tasked to clear and lost both his legs. He was just 25 years old.\n\nHe recalls how the foreign instructors told him to always check his mine detector by waving it over a piece of metal before heading out into the field. But whenever a device failed to respond, his Afghan commander would tell him to use it anyway.\n\n\u201cI was told that\u2019s all we have. That\u2019s what we were given, you just have to use it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next time he went out with a faulty device, his foot found a bomb the detector had missed.\n\n\u201cI felt myself being thrown through the air. I looked and I saw my legs were near me and there was so much blood. I yelled: \u2018Please help me.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.", "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 More than 100,000 rides were taken last month through Honolulu\u2019s self-service bicycle rental platform, marking a record number of rides in single month, the operator said.\n\nBikeshare Hawaii, the manager of Biki, is planning to add 300 more bikes and about 30 more rental stations by the end of the year.\n\nBiki launched in June 2017, offering about 1,000 rental bikes at 100 stations throughout urban Honolulu.

(AP) \u2014 More Wisconsin schools and districts are meeting or exceeding expectations than the past two years, but more also had their scores reduced for absenteeism than in either of the previous report cards, based on data released Tuesday.\n\nThe report cards from the state Department of Public Instruction measure performance of 2,114 public schools, 281 private choice schools and 422 school districts. The report cards, in their third year, are designed to be used by people living in the districts to hold schools accountable for their performance and growth, or reduction in scores, from year to year.\n\nIn total, nearly 84 percent of schools met or exceeded expectations this year. That is up from about 82 percent each of the previous two years. Nearly all school districts \u2014 96 percent \u2014 met or exceeded expectations this year. That is up from 95 percent last year and 91 percent two years ago.\n\nThe highest ranking for a school or district is five stars, indicating that they significantly exceeded expectations. This year, 49 districts and 327 schools got that highest rating. Most \u2014 206 districts and 768 schools \u2014 received the second-highest four-star rating, meaning they exceeded expectations.\n\nNo districts received the lowest one-star rating meaning they fail to meet expectations. Ninety-five schools got one star.

Poverty rates were even higher \u2014 78 percent \u2014 for schools that failed to meet expectations.\n\nBut those with the highest five-star rating had less than 25 percent of students in poverty.\n\nSix districts and 138 schools had fluctuations of 10 or more points from the prior year, a large change that carries a notation because it is outside expectations for a yearly score. That is down from last year, when 24 districts and 162 schools had large changes in scores.\n\nLaura Pinsonneault, director of DPI\u2019s office of educational accountability, said scores are more stable with three years of using the Forward Exam to measure student achievement, rather than comparing with a different test.\n\nThe ratings are based on four areas: student achievement in English language arts and math; student growth; closing gaps between student groups; and measuring readiness for graduation and postsecondary success.\n\nScores are reduced for missing goals, including have absenteeism greater than 13 percent.\n\nThis year, three districts and 125 schools had points deducted for high absenteeism, the most ever recorded over the three years of the report card.

The elder Wiley, 77, was a tire-recapper, and the family lived in Alaska for many years before moving to Butte County decades ago.\n\nJames Wiley said his father was a stoic veteran, and the two had not spoken in six years. \u201cHey, I lost him a long time ago,\u201d the younger man said.\n\nFoss, 63, moved to Paradise eight years ago because the high cost of living pushed him out of the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his daughter, Angela Loo.

At the Neighborhood Church in Chico, counselors, chaplains and nursing students from California State University, Chico, were available to help.\n\nVolunteers cooked meals, and there was a large bulletin board with information about missing people.\n\nEddie Lazarom, who fled Paradise on foot before getting a lift from a UPS truck, was among those staying at the church. He said he had yet to hear from his three grandchildren, ages 22, 24 and 28.\n\n\u201cI am really worried about them. They have common sense, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019d hate to find out later that they burned up,\u201d he said.\n\nGreg Gibson came to the shelter for information about his neighbors. He doesn\u2019t know if they tried to leave or not but says the fire exploded so quickly that if they hesitated, they would have had trouble.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast. It would have been such an easy decision to stay, but it was the wrong choice,\u201d Gibson said.\n\nThe search for the dead was drawing on portable devices that can identify someone\u2019s genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\n\u201cIn many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it\u2019s just such a lengthy process,\u201d says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners\u2019 office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nStill, experts said Tuesday that authorities may first try more traditional methods of identification such as examining dental records. That\u2019s in part because victims might have undergone dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Medical records of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants can also be helpful.\n\nBefore the Paradise tragedy, the deadliest single fire on record in California was a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29.\n\nAt the other end of the state, firefighters made progress against a massive blaze that has killed two people in star-studded Malibu and destroyed well over 400 structures in Southern California .\n\nThe flames roared to life again in a mountainous wilderness area Tuesday, sending up a huge plume of smoke near the community of Lake Sherwood. Still, firefighters made gains.

In Iran, the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions last week on oil exports is expected to drive up inflation there to more than 40 percent by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe findings, which came in the IMF\u2019s new regional outlook report, said the overall fiscal deficit for the Mideast\u2019s oil exporters is projected to decline from around $118 billion last year to $41 billion this year, before narrowing to $3 billion in 2019.\n\nFor Saudi Arabia, growth projections remain unchanged despite fallout from the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month. International outrage prompted big name executives and officials to back out from attending a major investment conference in Riyadh after the killing. IMF chief Christine Lagarde was among the high-level participants who pulled out of the summit.\n\nStill, it\u2019s too early to tell what the impact of this could be on the Saudi economy, where the price of oil remains a key determinant, said the IMF\u2019s Mideast and Central Asia director Jihad Azour.\n\n\u201cThere are several more important issues that factor in play. The evolution of oil price. The level of export of oil. The spending in government. The pace of reforms,\u201d Azour told The Associated Press.\n\nThe IMF projects that Saudi Arabia\u2019s economy will see 2.2 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent next year, after shrinking 0.9 percent last year. Saudi Arabia is aiming to balance its budget by 2023.\n\nIran\u2019s economy is expected to contract by 1.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, the report said. This comes after Iran\u2019s economy saw growth of 12.5 percent in 2016 and 3.7 in 2017, after sanctions had been temporarily lifted.\n\nAzour said one of the most pressing issues facing Iran is aligning the official local currency exchange rate with black market rates.\n\nThe IMF cautions that global oil prices, while potentially buoyed in the near-term by cuts in Iranian oil supply, are expected to slide down to around $60 a barrel in the next three to four years.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude, which had been trading above $80 a barrel recently, now hovers around $70 after U.S. sanctions waivers for countries that import heavily from Iran, which accounts for 5 percent of global oil exports.\n\n\u201cFor Saudi and other GCC countries, we believe it\u2019s not now the time to be complacent,\u201d Azour said, referring to other Arab oil-exporting countries in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe IMF is urging oil-exporters in the region to curb subsidies to reduce spending, expand taxes to boost revenue and narrow the public sector wage bill by attracting foreign investment and encouraging the private sector to create more jobs.\n\nThe IMF also warns that at least 25 million new jobs need to be created in the next five years to keep unemployment rates the same across the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAzour said a country like Egypt, where economic growth this year and last exceeded 5 percent, needs to create 700,000 to 1 million new jobs per year to keep it\u2019s unemployment rate from rising.", "A member of the Sacramento County Coroner's office looks for human remains in the rubble of a house burned at the Camp Fire, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Paradise, Calif.

She stopped by a protest in the office of the senior-most Democratic House veteran, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who permitted the demonstration by 200 or so activists. Pelosi has pledged to reinstate a special committee on climate change.\n\nPelosi also expects Democrats to elect her speaker, second in line to the presidency, for the second time. Ocasio-Cortez has not said whether she\u2019ll vote for the California Democrat. Others, such as Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, have said they will oppose Pelosi.\n\nBut still other freshmen lawmakers have fallen in line. They\u2019re under pressure from a parade of powerful, moneyed interest groups such as NARAL and the AFL-CIO that support Pelosi and could be helpful \u2014 or not \u2014 in re-election bids that effectively have already begun.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s tremendous value in experience and knowing how to move legislation and knowing every trick possible,\u201d Rep.-elect Veronica Escobar, for whom Pelosi campaigned, said in an interview. She\u2019s supporting Pelosi, she said, but there should be \u201ca leadership pipeline\u201d to carry younger faces into the House\u2019s highest ranks.\n\n\u201cWithout her, major pieces of legislation would have never gotten passed,\u201d such as the Affordable Care Act, said incoming Rep.

(AP Photo/ Cheryl Senter, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the days after the midterm election, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker worked the phones with Democratic luminaries in Iowa. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock courted high-dollar donors in New York. Other Democrats openly mused about their White House ambitions on live television.\n\nMotivated by an urgency to unseat President Donald Trump and the prospect of a historically large primary field, Democrats see little incentive to delay or downplay their 2020 presidential hopes. Their more transparent approach is upending one of Washington\u2019s favorite \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they\u201d parlor games and pushed the campaign calendar up earlier than ever before.\n\n\u201cNo one is waiting for anyone in the race to run for president,\u201d said Jim Messina, who managed President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cThose days are long, long over.\u201d\n\nRunning for president used to involve a familiar routine, with potential candidates spending months publicly demurring about their ambitions and professing to be content in their current roles. Advisers labored to keep meetings with donors and potential staff under wraps ahead of formal, carefully choreographed campaign announcements.\n\nThis time around, many Democrats believe it would be too risky to wait much longer before making their intentions known, particularly those with lower national profiles who could quickly be overshadowed by a field that could have more than two dozen candidates.\n\nThere are practicalities to consider, given the limited supply of money and top-flight staff available to run a campaign. But another driving factor is more visceral: Democrats are simply eager to take on the president.\n\n\u201cThis is starting very fast,\u201d said former Iowa Democratic Party Chairwoman Sue Dvorsky. She said that given the imperative to beat Trump, \u201cit kind of needs to.\u201d\n\nTwo long-shot Democrats have already declared their candidacy.\n\nWest Virginia state Sen. Richard Ojeda, a retired Army paratrooper who lost a race for Congress last week, announced his plans to run for president on Monday. Ojeda joins Maryland Rep. John Delaney, who has been running for the Democratic nomination since July 2017, and has already traveled to Iowa 19 times and made 12 trips to New Hampshire.\n\nDelaney said he believes that his early start will help put him at an advantage ahead of would-be rivals.\n\n\u201cWe not only know what the talent is, but they know us and they know about our message,\u201d said Delaney, whose campaign currently has about 10 staffers in Iowa. He expects that number to grow to at least 20 by January and 100 by June.\n\nHigher-profile Democrats have also started to lift the veil on their White House hopes.\n\nOn Monday, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, said he was \u201cseriously looking at\u201d a presidential campaign, saying in an interview that his election to a third term shows \u201ca strong progressive can win.\u201d He called his Senate campaign \u201ca blueprint for our nation in 2020.\u201d\n\nNew York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was also up front about her White House ambitions, telling ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d Monday that she was indeed considering a campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe right now every one of us should figure out how we can do whatever we can with our time, with our talents, to restore that moral decency, that moral compass and that truth of who we are as Americans,\u201d Gillibrand said.\n\nUnlike in 2016, when Hillary Clinton\u2019s shadow loomed large over the party, Democrats enter the 2020 campaign without a clear favorite. Former Vice President Joe Biden occupies the most similar role, with broad name recognition and a deep political network.\n\nBut Biden associates say he is still conflicted about whether to run, and he has pointedly said other would-be 2020 candidates should not defer to his plans. Biden is expected to make a decision by January.\n\nBooker has been among the most aggressive in courting supporters in early-voting states. After the midterms, he called each member of the Iowa Democratic statewide ticket, for whom the New Jersey senator campaigned ahead of the midterm, the day after the election.\n\nBooker was in touch with former Gov. Tom Vilsack, a veteran Democrat in the early-voting state, as well as candidates and operatives in other early-voting states he visited this fall.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, who would be considered an early favorite in the White House race, also called candidates she campaigned for in early-voting presidential states, including Deidre DeJear, who was Iowa\u2019s first African-American woman nominated for statewide office but lost in her bid for secretary of state.\n\nMontana\u2019s Bullock, who has made several stops in Iowa this year, traveled to New York after Election Day to meet with potential donors. Though Bullock has a lower profile than many possible Democratic contenders, he has an experienced team of political advisers, including chief of staff Tom Lopach \u2014 the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2014 and Nick Baldick, a veteran Democratic strategist.\n\nBullock also sent a staffer to Iowa to work for Tim Gannon, who lost his race for state agriculture secretary last week, a move aimed at giving Bullock an early foothold in the crucial caucus state.\n\nAnd while the midterms showed that Trump remains a powerful force in the GOP, at least two Republicans are considering taking Trump on: retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nKasich will be in New Hampshire on Thursday for a speech at a First Amendment event. Ahead of his remarks, Kasich will have private meetings with several prominent New Hampshire Republicans, including state and county GOP chairs.\n\n___\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

But a week after the voting, Democrats are riding higher than they thought on election night.\n\nAs vote counting presses on in several states, the Democrats have steadily chalked up victories across the country, firming up their grip on the U.S. House and statehouses. The slow roll of wins has given the party plenty to celebrate.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was quick to claim victory for his party on election night. But the Democrats, who hit political rock bottom just two years ago, have now picked up at least 32 seats in the House \u2014 and lead in four more \u2014 in addition to flipping seven governorships and eight state legislative chambers.\n\nThey are on track to lose two seats in the Senate in a year both parties predicted more. On Monday night, Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema won Arizona\u2019s Senate race, beating Republican Rep. Martha McSally to take the seat held by retiring GOP Sen.

Kyrsten Sinema has won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake. She won a tight race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead. (Nov. 13)\n\nThe blue shift alters the trajectory of Trump\u2019s next two years in the White House, breaking up the Republican monopoly in Washington. It also gives Democrats stronger footing in key states ahead of the next presidential race and in the redrawing of congressional districts \u2014 a complicated process that has been dominated by the GOP, which has drawn favorable boundaries for their candidates.\n\nTrump and his allies discounted the Democratic victories on Monday, pointing to GOP successes in Republican-leaning states.\n\n\u201cThanks to the grassroots support for @realDonaldTrump and our party\u2019s ground game, we were able to #DefyHistory and make gains in the Senate!\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted, citing Senate wins in Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Tennessee, among others.\n\nIndeed, just once in the past three decades had a sitting president added Senate seats in his first midterm election. But lost in McDaniel\u2019s assessment was the difficult 2018 Senate landscape for Democrats, who were defending 10 seats in states Trump carried just two years ago.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in an interview: \u201cI believe in facts. And the fact of the matter is, the Democratic Party had a historic night at the ballot box \u2014 and we are not resting,\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOur goal was to compete everywhere, to expand and reshape the electorate everywhere \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats found success by attracting support from women, minorities and college-educated voters. Overall, 50 percent of white college-educated voters and 56 percent of women backed Democrats nationwide, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.\n\nDemocrats featured historic diversity on the ballot.\n\nTheir winning class includes Massachusetts\u2019 first African-American female member of Congress, Ayanna Presley, and Michigan\u2019s Rashida Talib and Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar, the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, along with Kansas\u2019 Sharice Davids, the first lesbian Native American.\n\nThey also won by running candidates with military backgrounds who openly embraced gun ownership, such as Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb and Maine\u2019s Jared Golden, who is poised to win his contest because of the state\u2019s ranked-choice voting system.\n\nThe Democrats needed to gain 23 seats to seize the House majority. Once all the votes are counted, which could take weeks in some cases as absentees and provisional ballots are tallied, they could win close to 40.\n\nDemocrats have not lost a single House incumbent so far. Yet they defeated Republican targets such as Reps. Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Dana Rohrabacher of California.\n\nThey could win as many as 19 House races in districts carried by Trump two years ago, according to House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm.\n\nTen House races remained too close for the AP to call as of Monday evening.\n\nFar more of the Senate landscape was decided early, although contests in Florida and Mississippi remain outstanding.\n\nWhile there were notable statehouse Democratic losses in Iowa and Ohio, the party flipped governorships in seven states: Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Kansas, New Mexico and Maine.\n\nRepublicans now control 25 governorships nationwide compared to 23 for Democrats. High-profile contests in Florida and Georgia remain outstanding, though Republicans hold narrow leads in both states.\n\nOvershadowed perhaps by the higher-profile statewide elections, Democratic gains in state legislatures could prove deeply consequential.\n\nOverall, they flipped state legislative chambers in eight states this midterm season, including Washington state\u2019s Senate in 2017. The others include the state Senates in Maine, Colorado, New York, New Hampshire and Connecticut in addition to the state Houses of Representatives in New Hampshire and Minnesota.\n\nWith hundreds of races still too close to call, Democrats have won at least 370 new state legislative seats nationwide, according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, although the new seats were offset by Republican wins in some cases. The pickups include surprises in West Virginia, where Democrats knocked off the GOP majority leader-designate in the House and the majority leader in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have elected a new generation of inspiring leaders and we know that a new era of democratic dominance is on the horizon,\u201d said the committee\u2019s executive director Jessica Post.\n\nStill, Republicans will control the majority of state legislative chambers, governorships, the U.S. Senate and the White House. And even before the new Democrats take office, attention has begun to shift toward 2020.\n\nMany Democrats have yet to shake off the stinging losses of 2016. Publicly and privately, Democrats are lining up for the chance to take down Trump in two years.\n\n\u201cThis is step one of a two-step process to right the ship,\u201d Guy Cecil, chairman of the pro-Democrat super PAC Priorities USA, said of the midterms. \u201cDemocrats have every reason to be optimistic.\u201d", "The Capitol is seen in Washington, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, before Congress returns to work Tuesday for the first time following the midterm elections.

Newly emboldened Democrats are in no mood to cooperate over wall money. Instead, they\u2019ll be pushing to protect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe from acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has criticized the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAll sides must agree to a federal funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown from beginning on Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats are anything but lame ducks,\u201d Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi wrote Monday to colleagues, saying Democrats are \u201cflying high and taking pride\u201d in the greatest Democratic sweep of the House since the Watergate election of 1974. They picked up at least 32 seats, with several races still undecided.\n\n\u201cWe have great opportunity, and therefore great responsibility to get results for the American people,\u201d Pelosi wrote. Democrats \u201cneed to be unified, find common ground with Republicans in our legislative engagements, but stand our ground when we must.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, dozens of new House lawmakers and a handful of new senators arrived for a whirlwind orientation session.

GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana is expected keep his spot unchallenged. And new to leadership will be Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in the No. 3 position of conference chair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive,\u201d Cheney, running unopposed, told The Associated Press.\n\nSenators will also select their leaders, but few surprises are expected. On the Democratic side, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is set to return as leader, even though the party lost several seats in the election.\n\nSchumer suggested Democrats would use the lame-duck session to fight to protect special counsel. \u201cPeople are really concerned about this,\u201d Schumer told CNN.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has predicted a \u201clively\u201d lame-duck session. The Kentucky Republican has said legislation to protect Mueller is \u201cunnecessary\u201d because the investigation is \u201cnot under threat.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is poised to again lead Republicans, but term limits are pushing GOP Whip John Cornyn of Texas out of the No. 2 spot, making way for South Dakota Sen. John Thune to move up. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri will round out the team, and Cornyn will still have a seat at McConnell\u2019s table of counselors.\n\nMcConnell is also trying to add a female senator to a lower leadership spot, seeking to address the optics of having an all-male leadership slate in a year that brought a record number of women to Congress.\n\nThe biggest leadership race is Pelosi\u2019s bid to return as the first female House speaker, a contest she says she\u2019s \u201c100 percent\u201d confident she will win despite a public campaign by some incumbent and newly elected Democrats to oust her. Preliminary voting won\u2019t unfold for House Democrats until after Thanksgiving.\n\nAmid the leadership shuffle, lawmakers have several pieces of legislation they want to finish by year\u2019s end, including a farm policy bill and legislation overhauling Congress\u2019 handling of sexual harassment claims. The Senate will try to confirm more of Trump\u2019s judicial and administrative nominees, including a vote this week on Michelle Bowman to be a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.\n\nBut first they appeared headed toward a showdown over Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump spent weeks ahead of the midterm election rallying fears over a migrant caravan heading toward the border and promised voters that Republicans would bring tougher border security.\n\nHouse Republicans have already approved $5 billion for Trump\u2019s wall, but in the Senate, where Republicans need Democratic support to prevent a filibuster, a bipartisan bill allocates $1.6 billion.\n\nMcCarthy upped the stakes by introducing legislation for the full $25 billion the White House wants in border funds as he tries to shore up support from conservatives ahead of the GOP leadership election.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how hard Republicans will be willing to fight for the wall, given that dozens of House GOP lawmakers are serving their final days in Congress after retiring or losing their re-election races. Ryan had promised a \u201cbig fight\u201d over the border money and McConnell said a mini-shutdown may be necessary to help Trump \u201cget what he\u2019s looking for\u201d on the wall.\n\nRep.

(Avontea Boose via AP)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A suburban Chicago alderman called Tuesday for prosecutors to investigate the fatal shooting of a black security guard by a white police officer outside the bar where the guard worked.\n\nAuthorities have said little about the scene that ended early Sunday with the death of 26-year-old Jemel Roberson, who was apparently wearing a hat emblazoned with \u201csecurity\u201d across the front when he was shot outside Manny\u2019s Blue Room in Robbins, a predominantly black community just south of Chicago.\n\nAt the time, according to witnesses and a lawsuit, Roberson was attempting to detain a suspect in a separate shooting that wounded several other people at the tavern.\n\n\u201cHere is a security guard who is subduing a suspect,\u201d but the officer \u201cjust sees a black man with a gun and kills him,\u201d Alderman Keith Price said.\n\nPrice said he learned from witnesses that there are security cameras inside and outside the bar. He urged the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to launch an investigation.\n\nThe Illinois State Police declined to comment on their investigation. A spokeswoman for the sheriff\u2019s department, which is also investigating, said she did not know if there were security cameras at the bar.\n\nAnother security guard at the tavern said the officer jumped onto the bar and waved an assault rifle before running outside and fatally shooting the guard, an attorney said Tuesday.\n\nGregory E. Kulis, who on Monday filed a civil rights lawsuit against the officer and the community where he works, said the surviving guard told him that the officer pointed a gun at him until he screamed at him that he was a security guard.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when he jumped off the bar, waving the gun, and ran outside the door,\u201d said Kulis, who declined to identify the other security guard. The name of the officer, who is from the community of Midlothian, has not been released either.\n\nIn a statement, Midlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said only that the officer shot \u201ca subject with a gun.\u201d The officer has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard in such shootings until the investigation is complete, the chief said.\n\nProtesters gathered Tuesday outside the Midlothian Police Department, some carrying portraits of Roberson. A memorial of candles took shape nearby.\n\nThough shootings of security guards and off-duty police officers by law enforcement are fairly rare, they have happened.\n\nIn 2009, an off-duty black New York City police officer wearing street clothes and holding his service weapon, was shot and killed by police as he chased a man who had broken into his car.\n\nIn that same year, undercover officers in Brooklyn responding to a report of a bar fight shot and killed a 43-year-old security guard who, police said, pointed a gun at them.\n\nA year earlier, in White Plains, New York, a black off-duty Mount Vernon officer who was holding an assault suspect at gunpoint was fatally shot by a Westchester County officer.\n\nA 73-year-old night watchman at a recycling center was fatally shot by officers in 2012 in Florida after they spotted him carrying a gun when they arrived in response to a call of an intruder. Police later said the man was not wearing anything that identified him as a security guard.\n\nAnd in 2000, an off-duty black police sergeant in Rhode Island was shot and killed by two uniformed colleagues as he tried to break up a fight in a parking lot.\n\nKulis would not say if he thinks race played a role in Chicago-area shooting, but the fact that the officer is white and Roberson was black has prompted some \u2014 including a prominent local African-American newspaper columnist \u2014 to question the officer\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cI believe a police officer showing up at a chaotic scene where a white man has a gun would have at least hollered for him to put the gun down before opening fire,\u201d Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell wrote after the shooting. \u201cBut too often, black men are not given the benefit of the doubt.\u201d\n\nKulis said he is trying to gather information about the officer, who he said came to the Midlothian department four years ago from another department and is a member of a SWAT team.\n\nFootage from surveillance or body cameras could explain whether Roberson was clearly identifiable as a security guard. Audio could determine what, if anything, was said to the officer before the shooting and whether, as witnesses have told the media, they shouted to the officer before he fired that Roberson was a security guard.\n\nSuch footage could also help investigators determine what kind of charges should be filed against the man who is suspected of firing a gun inside the bar. The man was one of four people who suffered non-life threatening gunshot wounds.\n\nIn his $1 million federal lawsuit, Kulis contends that the officer who shot Roberson violated the man\u2019s 4th Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cThe use of force is considered a seizure, and he needed probable cause to use force and he did not have that,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Monika Mathur in Washington contributed to this report.", "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Portland\u2019s incumbent mayor has filed initial paperwork that allows him to begin raising money for next year\u2019s mayoral race.\n\nDemocratic Mayor Ethan Strimling filed the initial campaign paperwork last Monday, one day before Election Day.

(AP Photo/Yong Teck Lim)\n\nSINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 China\u2019s premier sought Tuesday to reassure its neighbors that Beijing will push ahead with reforms needed to support growth across the region and also keep the peace in contested waters in the South China Sea.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said his government will favor reforms in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy over temporary boosts from economic stimulus as China copes with a gradual slowing of growth and a trade war with the United States.\n\nChina can energize its slowing economy by adjusting policies, such as streamlining procedures like business registrations, taxes and fees, Li said in a lecture on the sidelines of the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that brings together leaders from the U.S. and across the region.\n\n\u201cDespite the downward pressure, we will not resort to massive stimulus. We will make adjustments as appropriate. We want to energize the market, in particular, market entities, and we have the conditions to do that,\u201d Li said in the wide-ranging speech that touched on China\u2019s role in regional development.\n\nLi said the government also will \u201ccrack down harshly\u201d on businesses that infringe on patents and other intellectual property rights and engage in \u201cother cheating activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina will not stop in its opening up. The door will only open wider and China will continue to deepen reform. Reform and opening up have brought China to where it is today,\u201d Li added.\n\nChina and the U.S. are locked in a trade dispute over Washington\u2019s complaints that China uses predatory tactics to acquire technologies that could undermine U.S. industrial leadership. The two countries have raised import duties on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods, including soybeans, electric cars and whiskey.\n\nWhile they have rebuffed U.S. demands that Beijing tone down its technology ambitions, China\u2019s leaders have sought to enhance their own market opening credentials by lowering tariffs and easing access for foreign companies operating in China for some industries.\n\nIn the quarter that ended in September, China\u2019s economic growth slowed to 6.5 percent from a year earlier, down from the previous quarter\u2019s 6.7 percent. The deceleration reflects long-term efforts to guide the economy toward a more sustainable model of growth and away from excessive reliance on construction spending and exports. But the trade tensions with Washington are adding to the challenges for the Communist leadership, with the two countries imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of each other\u2019s goods.\n\nLi expressed hopes for a compromise. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are to meet at the Group of 20 summit in Argentina this month.\n\n\u201cWe hope that negotiations will be carried out on the basis of mutual respect, balance, mutual benefit and good faith, so that a solution can be found acceptable to both sides,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meetings in Singapore this week will be followed by an annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Papua New Guinea.\n\nBoth gatherings address similar concerns about trade, economic integration, regional security and development.\n\nLi also said China was hoping to see within three years a regional \u201ccode of conduct\u201d governing activities in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region.\n\nOver U.S. objections, Beijing has moved to cement its claim to most of the South China Sea, including by building artificial islands and military airstrips atop coral reefs. Talks on a code that would belatedly constrain such activities have made slow progress.\n\n\u201cChina and ASEAN countries will benefit in that process. It will also be conducive to free trade and go on to serve the interest of other parties,\u201d Li said.\n\n\u201cI want to reaffirm here that China will stay firm on the course of peaceful development,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we hope is to have a harmonious relationship with our neighbors and together, we benefit from our good neighborliness.\u201d", "CONWAY, Ark.

Poliquin filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday against Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap in an attempt to stop a tabulation of ranked-choice ballots in his race against Democratic challenger Jared Golden. (AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 Fighting for political survival, Republican U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin joined a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to overturn Maine\u2019s new voting system, used for the first time last week in U.S. House and Senate elections.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a federal judge to stop the vote tabulations and to declare ranked-choice voting to be unconstitutional, clearing the way for Poliquin to be declared the victor. The secretary of state declined a separate request to stop the election process without a court order.\n\nThe first round of voting on Election Day ended with Poliquin and Democrat Jared Golden both collecting 46 percent of the vote in Maine\u2019s huge, largely rural 2nd Congressional District, with Poliquin maintaining a slim edge of about 2,000 votes in unofficial returns.\n\n\u201cI won the election fair and square,\u201d Poliquin said Tuesday, declaring the lawsuit is necessary to test the constitutionality of the voting system.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Poliquin, who is seeking a third term, and three Republican activists contend he should be declared the winner because he has the most first-place votes. But the ranked-choice system requires additional voting rounds because neither he nor Golden won an outright majority.\n\nThe lawsuit says the \u201cfoundation of our \u2018democratic process\u2019 is the right of all qualified voters to cast their votes effectively.\u201d It suggests that the ranked voting system \u201cdenies Plaintiffs the opportunity to cast their votes effectively.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit makes several arguments, including that the voting system violates the \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d principle, violating the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nPoliquin\u2019s Democratic challenger decried the 11th-hour attempt to derail the process following the most expensive congressional race in Maine history.\n\n\u201cAny attempt by Bruce Poliquin to change the rules after votes have already been cast is an affront to the law and to the people of Maine,\u201d Jon Breed, Golden\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement Tuesday. If Poliquin were really concerned, Breed said, he should have sued before the election.\n\nPoliquin\u2019s lead attorney, former Federal Election Commission Chairman Lee Goodman, brushed aside concerns about the timing of the lawsuit. He said it wasn\u2019t filed sooner because it was unclear whether additional tabulations were going to be necessary to determine a winner.\n\nDemocratic Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap said that his office would continue to process ballots and that it would review with legal advisers any court order to stop. Election workers had more than 100 towns to go by midday Tuesday, he said.\n\nSupporters argue the system already has cleared legal challenges. Several courts, including the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, have upheld the constitutionality of ranked-choice voting, supporters said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these kinds of post-election sore loser lawsuits across the country,\u201d said Rob Richie, of FairVote, an electoral reform group that pressed for Maine\u2019s adoption of the system.\n\nPoliquin, however, insisted the lawsuit is not just about sour grapes over the possibility Golden could walk away as the winner. He said it\u2019s his \u201cduty\u201d to test the system at the federal level.\n\n\u201cNot addressing this important constitutional matter would be completely irresponsible and not doing my job,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ranked-choice voting system approved by referendum in 2016 lets voters rank candidates from first to last on the ballot. It provides for eliminations of last-place candidates and reallocations of votes to ensure that the winner gets a majority.\n\nThe system is touted as a way to let people caste votes for third-party or independent candidates without concern for political \u201cspoilers\u201d or vote-splitting. Critics, including Poliquin, say it\u2019s confusing.\n\nLast-place candidates are eliminated one by one if no one receives a majority of the vote. Then the losers\u2019 second-choice votes are counted. The process can be repeated as many times as is necessary until there\u2019s a majority winner.\n\nIn this case, two independents in the four-way race who together collected about 8 percent of the vote will be eliminated, and it\u2019s possible the reallocation of votes could end up favoring Golden even though he did not collect the most first-round votes.\n\nFor now, the system is used only in federal races and in statewide primary elections in Maine. It cannot be used in the governor\u2019s race or legislative races because of concerns it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.\n\nDemocratic Gov.-elect Janet Mills has vowed to seek to amend the constitution so the system can be used in all elections.\n\nThere was no controversy in Maine\u2019s other House race and Senate race. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent Sen. Angus King each won with a majority of the vote, making further tabulations unnecessary.\n\n___\n\nSharp reported from Portland, Maine.

Among 540 schools surveyed, total international enrollment held level while the number of new students fell by about 2 percent, marking the third straight year of declines.\n\nCompared to the previous year, more schools attributed decreases to challenges in the visa process, the U.S. social and political climate, and student decisions to enroll in other countries.\n\nAt the University of Central Missouri, foreign enrollment surged to 2,600 in 2016 before plummeting to just 650 this year, according to data obtained by The AP. University officials have noticed increased competition but also cite the nation\u2019s political climate.\n\n\u201cWe have had conversations with parents who feel like their children will not be safe here, that their son or daughter may not be physically safe,\u201d said Karen Goos, the school\u2019s assistant vice provost for enrollment management. \u201cI do think that it\u2019s a contributing factor.\u201d\n\nAt Purdue University, one of the nation\u2019s biggest hubs for international students, total foreign enrollment fell by 2 percent this year. Officials said they intentionally admitted fewer undergraduates from abroad amid worries that they might not accept the offer.\n\n\u201cThere was concern that students might not find the U.S. to be as an attractive destination given certain political rhetoric these past two years,\u201d Michael Brzezinski, Purdue\u2019s dean of international programs, said in an email.\n\nLosing foreign students can carry financial implications for schools that rely on them for revenue. Unlike U.S. citizens, who often get scholarships or discounts, students from abroad are typically charged full tuition.\n\nAt Central Missouri, the declines have worsened a budget hole that led to more than $20 million in cuts last year.\n\nAt the same time, some other nations have drawn surging numbers of students from abroad. Canada reported a 20 percent jump in 2017, while Australia saw a 12 percent increase. Both countries have set ambitious goals to bolster international enrollments in the coming years.\n\nYet officials in Australia said they shouldn\u2019t be blamed for America\u2019s slowdown. Phil Honeywood, CEO of the International Education Association of Australia, said pinning it on competition is \u201cpure blame shifting,\u201d adding that Australia hasn\u2019t significantly changed its recruiting strategy over the past two years.\n\n\u201cRather, everything we hear from prospective students and their education agents in Muslim countries and Latin American nations is that they no longer feel welcome or safe studying at U.S. colleges under President Trump,\u201d Honeywood said in a statement.\n\nDespite the downturn in new students, officials behind the report are optimistic that the U.S. will rebound. While foreign students account for a heavy share of the overall enrollment in Australia and other countries, they account for just 5 percent of all students in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has real competition,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWhat we have going for us, though, is we have more space and capacity.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that the number of U.S. students studying abroad ticked up by 2 percent last year, continuing eight years of slow but steady growth. Europe remained the top destination, followed by Latin America and Asia.\n\n___\n\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbinkley", "FILE - In this May 22, 2018, file photo, Tyler Barriss, of California, appears for a preliminary hearing in Wichita, Kan. Barriss is accused of making a hoax phone call that led police to fatally shoot an unarmed man in Wichita, Kan., in December 2017. Barris is set to change his plea in federal court. (Bo Rader/The Wichita Eagle via AP, File)\n\nWICHITA, Kan. (AP) \u2014 A California man pleaded guilty Tuesday to making a hoax call that ultimately led police to fatally shoot a Kansas man following a dispute between two online gamers over $1.50 bet in a Call of Duty WWII video game.\n\nTyler R. Barriss , 26, admitted to making the false report resulting in a death, as well as cyberstalking and conspiracy related to the deadly swatting calls in Kansas. The deal with prosecutors will send him to prison for between 20 and 25 years, if the judge accepts it. He had previously pleaded not guilty in Kansas.\n\nAs part of the plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Barriss pleaded guilty to a total of 51 charges that included federal charges initially filed in California and the District of Columbia related to other fake calls and threats .\n\nDefense attorney Richard Federico told the court his client is accepting responsibility and is attempting to \u201cclear the deck\u201d of all federal charges.\n\nBarriss, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, stood with his hands folded in front of him as he entered his pleas.\n\n\u201cWithout ever stepping foot in Wichita, the defendant created a chaotic situation that quickly turned from dangerous to deadly,\u201d U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said in a news release. \u201cHis reasons were trivial and his disregard for the safety of other people was staggering.\u201d\n\nIn the case from the District of Columbia, Barriss pleaded guilty to two counts for making hoax bomb threats in phone calls to the headquarters of the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the California case, he pleaded guilty to 46 counts for making false reports that bombs were planted at high schools, universities, shopping malls, and television stations. He called from Los Angeles to emergency numbers in Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Massachusetts, Illinois, Utah, Virginia, Texas, Arizona, Missouri, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Michigan, Florida and Canada.\n\nHis sentencing was set for Jan. 30.\n\nAlso charged as co-conspirators in the federal case in Kansas are online gamers Casey Viner, 18, of North College Hill, Ohio, and Shane Gaskill, 20, of Wichita. They have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to obstruct justice, wire fraud and other counts. Their trial is scheduled for Jan. 8 in U.S. District Court in Wichita.\n\nViner allegedly became upset at Gaskill while playing the popular online game. Authorities say Viner then asked Barriss of Los Angeles to \u201cswat\u201d Gaskill at an address that Gaskill had previously provided him. Swatting is a form of retaliation sometimes used by gamers, who call police and make a false report to send first responders to an online opponent\u2019s address.\n\nBarriss is accused of calling Wichita police from Los Angeles on Dec. 28, 2017, to report a shooting and kidnapping at a Wichita address. Authorities say Barris researched the address Viner had given him for Gaskill and verified it was a home. When Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he began communicating with Barriss through direct messages in which he also gave him that same old address and dared him to swat him.\n\n\u201cPlease try some s---. I\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d Gaskill wrote in the direct messages cited in the indictment.\n\nA police officer responding to the call fatally shot the new resident Andrew Finch, 28, after he opened the door.\n\nIt is unclear what will become of separate state charges. Barriss is scheduled for a separate Jan. 7 trial in Sedgwick County District Court on state charges of involuntary manslaughter, giving a false alarm and interference with a law enforcement officer.", "In this Nov. 2, 2018 photo, Honduran transgender Alexa Amaya, who is part of a group of 50 or so LGBTQ migrants traveling with the migrant caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, uses a compact mirror to apply makeup while riding in the back of a flatbed truck to Sayula, Mexico. \"I know it will be difficult to win asylum,\" said Alexa, a 24-year-old from Copan Honduras, \"but we have to make the attempt.\" (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nMATIAS ROMERO, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Dozens of transgender women and gay men in the caravan moving through Mexico with hopes of seeking asylum in the United States have banded together for protection \u2014 not from the uncertainty of a journey fraught with danger from the gangs who prey on migrants but from their fellow travelers.\n\nFleeing violence and discrimination back home because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, these LGBTQ migrants have found the journey north to be just as threatening amid catcalls and even physical abuse.\n\n\u201cSweet little thing!\u201d \u2033Baby, where you going?\u201d \u2033How much do you charge?\u201d These all-too-familiar jeers are spewed at them as they make their way with the caravan of several thousand.\n\nLoly Mendez, a 28-year-old who began transitioning to a woman in her native El Salvador, knows all too well the dangers her fellow transgender migrants faced back home: Her best friend, also a transgender woman, was murdered for doing the same.\n\nThen Loly herself began getting threats \u2014 \u201cthat if my breasts were going to grow, they would cut them off,\u201d she said. They were always anonymously delivered, which only made her more fearful and finally drove her to flee.\n\n\u201cIn my country there is violence, a lack of work and opportunities,\u201d said Loly, who like many of the transgender women in the group preferred using only her first name. \u201cIn the caravan there is also violence \u2014 against the LGBTQ community.\u201d\n\nLoly linked up with the caravan in Tapachula, in southern Mexico, and hopes to work in the United States and save up to start a beauty products company \u2014 perhaps in Los Angeles or New York. It\u2019s something she has planned for a long time, all the way down to the business\u2019 logo, but she\u2019s never had the money.\n\n\u201cI am going to a country where I know I will achieve my dreams,\u201d Loly said, hopefully.\n\nReports are common in much of Central America of LGBTQ people being murdered, assaulted and discriminated against, due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nBut getting U.S. asylum is difficult even with proof someone has been the victim of persecution for being transgender, said Lynly Egyes, director of litigation at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California.\n\nIt often takes days or weeks for transgender immigrants to get a hearing before an asylum officer. If they are allowed to move forward in the process, many are traumatized and struggle to tell their story, Egyes said. They are also much less likely to be granted asylum without a lawyer.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrifying process, and not everybody makes it through,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the migrants have said they joined the caravan because it offered safety in numbers. The 50 or so LGBTQ migrants traveling together, most of them in their 20s but some as young as 17 or as old as 60, say they, too, banded together for safety \u2014 a sort of caravan within the caravan.\n\nSticking out in their bright-colored clothing and makeup, the group has suffered verbal harassment, especially from men, and has been the victim of robbery and other aggressions. One recent day as they walked in a row on the highway to Isla, in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz, a group of fellow migrants passed by on a flatbed truck and showered them with water, oranges, rinds and other refuse.\n\nFearful of being attacked more violently or sexually assaulted, they stick by each other\u2019s sides 24 hours a day, walking and sleeping in a group and even using the buddy system for going to the bathroom.\n\nIn Matias Romero, in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, rather than sleep outdoors they took over an abandoned hotel damaged in last year\u2019s deadly earthquake. Dirty, windowless and with no electricity or running water, it was nonetheless a place to have a roof over their heads and be safe. They bathed by the light of a small lantern, dressed themselves and applied makeup as dozens of men milled about outside.\n\nEach night \u201cthe girls,\u201d as they call themselves, sift through piles of donated clothing to try to look as sharp as possible. And they face a dilemma: Where to dress and relieve themselves?\n\n\u201cWe have problems when it comes time to go to the bathroom,\u201d said Nakai Flotte, a transgender woman and activist. \u201cWe bathe in the men\u2019s, sometimes in the women\u2019s, but it\u2019s difficult. There isn\u2019t one for us.\u201d\n\nFlotte was accompanying the migrants to provide support and information about making asylum claims.\n\nThe U.S. \u201cshould take into account their condition of vulnerability and violence,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a decision by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions this year to deny asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence could also have a negative impact on transgender women and men because many are victims of gang violence who are targeted for being transgender.\n\n\u201cI know it will be difficult to win asylum,\u201d said Alexa Amaya, a 24-year-old from Honduras, \u201cbut we have to make the attempt.\u201d\n\nThe caravan has traveled more than 1,000 miles (more than 2,000 kilometers) in the month since its initial participants set out from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and as it traverses Mexico\u2019s central highlands it\u2019s still about the same distance from its goal of Tijuana, across the border from San Diego. It\u2019s unclear how many will make it. A similar caravan earlier this year fizzled to just about 200 who reached the U.S. frontier.\n\nMuch of the trek has been on foot, but hitching rides in pickup trucks, minibuses and tractor-trailers has been crucial lately, especially on days when they travel 100 miles or more. For the LGBTQ group, it\u2019s been tougher to find those rides.\n\n\u201cA taxi driver kicked us out of his car,\u201d said Lady Perez, a 23-year-old from Honduras, adding that sometimes truck drivers who often transport migrants for a small fee have doubled or tripled the price for her group.\n\nLady began identifying as transgender at age 5, and her father ultimately disowned her. She was subjected to insults and beatings, her boyfriend was killed and she was warned to leave Honduras or else.\n\n\u201cIn our country the rights of the LGBTQ community are not respected, and anti-social groups take advantage of that,\u201d Lady said.\n\nWalking on the highway in a black miniskirt, red lipstick and black eyeliner, she said many men in the caravan have been harassing her and the others.\n\n\u201cThey have denigrated us. Supposedly you\u2019re emigrating from your country because of the violence, the discrimination, the homophobia, and it turns out that in the very caravan you face this kind of violence,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the face of the near-constant harassment, march organizers and human rights workers have sought to provide the group some security in the form of two men in green vests who travel with them and try to ward off any attacks.\n\nIf the verbal harassment doesn\u2019t cross the line, \u201cwe feel protected,\u201d Loly said. \u201cIf someone does cross the line, human rights is with us to protect us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Astrid Galvan in Phoenix contributed to this report.", "U.S. Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., smiles after her victory over Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Scottsdale, Ariz. Sinema won Arizona's open U.S. Senate seat in a race that was among the most closely watched in the nation, beating McSally in the battle to replace GOP Sen. Jeff Flake. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri)\n\nIn a year of liberal challenges to President Donald Trump, an avowed centrist scored the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest coup -- flipping a red state\u2019s U.S. Senate seat.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake to become the first woman to win a U.S. Senate seat in the state. The race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally was tight enough that a winner wasn\u2019t decided until Monday, after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead.\n\nSinema\u2019s win achieves a longtime Democratic goal of making Arizona, with its growing Latino population, a competitive state. And she did it by pointedly not running against the president, or even critiquing his hardline immigration stance.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t put the progressive bit in her mouth and run with it,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a GOP strategist in Phoenix. \u201cShe spit it out and did something else.\u201d\n\nSinema targeted moderate Republican and independent women by painting herself as a nonpartisan problem-solver who voted to support Trump\u2019s agenda 60 percent of the time. Her nearly single-issue campaign talked about the importance of health care and protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRep. Kyrsten Sinema has won the Arizona Senate seat being vacated by Republican Jeff Flake. She won a tight race against Republican Rep. Martha McSally after a slow count of mail-in ballots gave her an insurmountable lead. (Nov. 13)\n\nShe knew McSally was vulnerable there because she backed the Republicans\u2019 failed attempt to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nSinema tailored her campaign for conservative-leaning Arizona rather than the national environment, but it may be a guide for Democrats who hope to expand the electoral map in 2020. While some liberals won important races in California, Colorado and Kansas, the left\u2019s highest-profile champions disappointed on Election Day.\n\nRep. Beto O\u2019Rourke fell short in his challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas. Stacey Abrams trails her Republican opponent in the still undecided bitter Georgia gubernatorial race, and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who once led in the polls in the race for Florida governor, is now awaiting the results of a recount.\n\nSinema prevailed while the Democratic candidate for governor, David Garcia, ran as an avowed progressive and got trounced by Republican incumbent Doug Ducey.\n\n\u201cKyrsten was the perfect candidate for this race,\u201d said Democratic strategist Chad Campbell, who previously served with Sinema in Arizona\u2019s state legislature. \u201cWe saw that with Garcia.\u201d\n\nSinema first came to prominence as an openly bisexual Green Party activist in Phoenix, and McSally raked the Democrat over her protests against the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Sinema was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature in 2004 and carved out a reputation as a liberal who could work with her conservative colleagues.\n\nBy the time she was elected to Congress representing a suburban Phoenix swing district in 2012, Sinema had completely remade herself into a centrist. She voted against Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader, supported relaxed regulations on banks and a law to increase penalties on people illegally re-entering the country. She supported a bill making it easier to deport immigrants identified by police as gang members.\n\nDuring the Senate campaign, Sinema stuck to her centrist message, almost robotically at times. She faced only a nominal primary challenge from her left and was free to burnish her nonpartisan credentials, unlike McSally, who faced two primary challengers from the right and tied herself to Trump.\n\nOn Election Day, Sinema swung by Arizona State University\u2019s downtown Phoenix campus to hand out doughnuts and gleefully posed for photos. She has four degrees from the school and teaches two classes there.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do for people who are a little more on the left?\u201d voter Petra Morrison asked. The candidate said she wasn\u2019t focused on party labels or ideology. Morrison later told a reporter she was going to vote for Sinema, even though \u201cshe seems to come across as a Democrat in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nThough Sinema wooed moderates, she needed liberals like Morrison in her corner for her win. She benefited from a longtime organizing push by activists who especially targeted the state\u2019s young, growing and Democratic-leaning Latino electorate. \u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years and even more, this mobilization and galvanizing,\u201d said Lisa Magana, a professor in ASU\u2019s School of Transborder Studies.\n\nHistorically Republicans have countered the growth of Arizona\u2019s Hispanic population by winning white voters by ever-bigger margins. But Sinema fought this strategy to a standstill among two key groups of whites -- younger voters and women.\n\nWhite women split their vote between Sinema and McSally, according to AP VoteCast. While whites ages 45 and older favored McSally, those under 45 were evenly divided between the Democrat and Republican. Meanwhile, Latinos favored Sinema by roughly 2 to 1. VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 115,000 voters, including 4,128 voters in Arizona.\n\nAnd though Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration seemed pitched to Arizona voters\u2019 anxieties about the border, both Democratic and Republican polls throughout the race showed the president had more people disapproving of him.\n\nTrump visited only once on McSally\u2019s behalf in mid-October. The following week, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego said there was a notable spike in Latinos returning their early ballots; most Arizona residents vote by mail.\n\n\u201cIt was like they spent the weekend at the kitchen table\u201d filling out the ballots in anger, Gallego said.\n\nAnnette Villelas was one of those angry voters. She registered for the first time so she could vote for Democrats and against Trump. It wasn\u2019t just the way the president deals with immigrants, she said after shaking Sinema\u2019s hand at a Phoenix taco shop.\n\n\u201cThe way he talks just to the public, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Villelas said. \u201cI want to vote and get him out and get someone in for the people.\u201d\n\nRon Horsford, a 50-year-old Republican, was at the same event and said he was excited to vote for Sinema. He liked her message of \u201cI\u2019m going to work with the other side.\u201d\n\nThe question for Democrats in Arizona is whether they can attract voters like Horsford and Villelas in 2020. Not only does the party hope it can put the state in play in the presidential race, voters will get their first chance to select John McCain\u2019s successor. Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, who was appointed after McCain\u2019s death, has pledged not to run.\n\nDespite its image as a staunch Republican bastion, Arizona is attracting younger, educated voters from elsewhere in the United States. In this election, Democrats expanded their share in the state Legislature, though they\u2019re still the minority. They took a 5-4 majority in the state\u2019s congressional seats and remain competitive in two down-ballot and uncalled statewide races.", "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Attorneys for Kentucky\u2019s socially conservative governor and the state\u2019s only abortion clinic opened their latest legal fight Tuesday, this time over a lawsuit challenging a new state law aimed at a common second-trimester procedure to end pregnancies.\n\nAnti-abortion activists gathered outside the federal courthouse and inside the courtroom as the trial began over the law that its critics, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, say would amount to an impediment for women seeking abortions in their second trimester.\n\nDuring opening statements, an attorney for the clinic told the judge that the law is unconstitutional because it would \u201call but eliminate\u201d abortions for women past the 14th week of pregnancy. ACLU attorney Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said the procedure targeted by the state law is \u201csafe and medically proven,\u201d and she accused the state\u2019s lawyers of \u201cdemonizing\u201d the method with inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nSteve Pitt, lead attorney for Republican Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s legal team, described the procedure as \u201cbrutal, gruesome and inhumane\u201d that results in a fetus being torn apart \u201climb by limb.\u201d He stressed the need to protect the weak, adding: \u201cThere are none so weak as an unborn child.\u201d\n\nPitt said the law does not create a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d for women seeking abortions. It doesn\u2019t ban the procedure, he said, but requires that other methods be used first to cause fetal demise. Kolbi-Molinas said those methods can result in medical risks to patients. Pitt countered that those methods amount to a \u201cvery simple process\u201d for doctors.\n\nThe measure \u2014 passed this year by Kentucky\u2019s GOP-led legislature and signed by Bevin, a fervent abortion opponent \u2014 was suspended soon after the clinic filed the lawsuit, pending the outcome of the trial.\n\nBefore the trial began, a group of anti-abortion activists gathered in a prayer circle outside the federal courthouse.\n\nOne of the participants, Joyce Ostrander of Lexington, said she wanted to show her support for what she considers a \u201creasonable statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would anybody defend dismembering a live, unborn child when there are other options?\u201d she said.\n\nAbortion opponents, many dressed in red, sat in the courtroom as the trial began in U.S. District Court in Louisville. The trial is expected to last several days and both sides will present of number of witnesses, including doctors.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical hour for Kentucky, for the lives of the unborn,\u201d Republican state Rep. Addia Wuchner, who co-authored the measure, said during a rally outside the courthouse.\n\nChief District Judge Joseph H. McKinley Jr. is presiding over the trial without a jury and will issue a decision later.\n\nLawyers for the clinic say the new law amounts to an unconstitutional intrusion on an abortion procedure known as \u201cdilation and evacuation.\u201d The procedure was used in 537 of 3,312 abortions done in Kentucky in 2016, according to state statistics.\n\nThe state\u2019s lawyers argue the law would still allow use of the D&E procedure, but only after doctors use a \u201cmore humane way\u201d to induce fetal death through another procedure.\n\nClinic attorneys note that similar laws in some other states were struck down, though some cases are being appealed.\n\nUnder the Kentucky law, abortion providers violating the law would be guilty of a felony carrying up to five years in prison. Women undergoing such abortions would not face prosecution.\n\nKentucky Republicans have pushed through measures putting limits and conditions on abortion since assuming complete control of the state\u2019s legislature in 2017. Those actions have spurred a series of legal fights between Bevin\u2019s administration and Kentucky\u2019s only remaining abortion clinic, EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center in Louisville.\n\nTwo abortion-related laws have been struck down in court since, but Bevin\u2019s administration has appealed both cases.\n\nOne of those laws, enacted in early 2017, would require doctors to perform ultrasounds and then show and describe the ultrasound images to pregnant women, who could avert their eyes. The other law, passed two decades ago, required a Kentucky abortion clinic to have written agreements with a hospital and ambulance service in case of medical emergencies. Bevin\u2019s administration cited that law in a fight that threatened the state\u2019s last abortion clinic.", "Elementary school students walk down a snowy street in Montpelier, Vt., Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 After two federal court rulings and a flurry of legal filings over a 24-hour period, uncertainty still hangs over Georgia\u2019s midterm elections, including the still undecided race for governor.\n\nUnofficial results in one of the nation\u2019s hottest midterm contests give Republican Brian Kemp a slim majority. But Democrat Stacey Abrams maintains that enough uncounted absentee, mail-in and provisional ballots remain to force a Dec. 4 runoff and keep alive her bid to become the first black woman in American history to be elected governor of a state.\n\nIn the week since voters went to the polls, arguments over certain provisional and absentee ballots have been presented at a dizzying pace before several different judges in federal court.\n\nAmong them was a lawsuit filed Sunday by Abrams\u2019 campaign seeking an extension by one day of the deadline for county election officials to certify their results. As a hearing drew to a close just before the 5 p.m. Tuesday deadline, U.S. District Judge Steve Jones said he wouldn\u2019t extend the deadline because all the counties had likely already certified their results or were about to, and there were other protections in place.\n\nAll but 16 of the state\u2019s 159 counties had certified their results by Tuesday evening, Secretary of State spokeswoman Candice Broce said in an email.\n\nAP's Washington Bureau chief Julie Pace explains why outstanding races in Florida and Georgia have become so significant, that even President Donald Trump has taken to twitter about one of them. (Nov. 12)\n\nJones said he hopes to rule on the other requests from Abrams\u2019 campaign by noon Wednesday.\n\nThe campaign has asked him to order county election officials to accept any absentee ballots on which there was missing or insufficient information as long as that doesn\u2019t \u201csubstantially obstruct\u201d officials from verifying the absentee voter\u2019s identity. It also asked him to order county election officials to accept information that\u2019s submitted to fix issues with provisional ballots, and to count those votes until 5 p.m. Wednesday. And it asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in the wrong county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct.\n\nLawyers for state and county election officials argued that the Abrams campaign was trying to use an 11th hour lawsuit to rewrite the state\u2019s election laws. County election officials have been properly counting ballots and have been able to complete their duties in the time allowed by state law, they argued.\n\nIn a separate case, U.S. District Judge Leigh May on Tuesday ordered Gwinnett County election officials not to reject absentee ballots just because the voter\u2019s birth year is missing or wrong and to count any that were cast in the Nov. 6 election. She also ordered the county to delay certification of its election results until those ballots have been counted.\n\nRepublican Gov. Nathan Deal appointed Robyn Crittenden last week to replace Kemp, who resigned as secretary of state after declaring victory in the governor\u2019s race. Crittenden had issued guidance to county election officials on the absentee ballot issue Monday.\n\nJones said he will consider whether he should effectively extend May\u2019s order to Georgia\u2019s other 158 counties. He said that under Crittenden\u2019s guidance, counties don\u2019t have to reject absentee ballots that are missing a year of birth if there\u2019s enough other information to verify the voter but her guidance fails to say they shouldn\u2019t reject them. He said that could cause absentee voters to be treated differently, depending on where they live.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg late Monday ordered state officials not to do their final certification of election results before 5 p.m. Friday. State law sets a Nov. 20 deadline.\n\nState elections director Chris Harvey testified last week that the state had planned to certify the election results Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any runoff contests, including those already projected in the races for secretary of state and a Public Service Commission seat.\n\nTotenberg also ordered the secretary of state\u2019s office to establish and publicize a hotline or website where voters can check whether their provisional ballots were counted and, if not, the reason why. She also ordered the secretary of state\u2019s office to review or have county election authorities review the eligibility of voters who had to cast provisional ballots because of registration issues.\n\nMeanwhile, protesters, including a state senator, were arrested Tuesday during a demonstration at the Georgia Capitol calling for uncounted ballots to be tallied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being arrested because I refused to leave the floor of this building where I\u2019m a state senator,\u201d Sen.

I was standing peacefully beside constituents I represent.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Safety said a total of 15 people were arrested on charges of disrupting orderly conduct of official business and were taken to the Fulton County jail.\n\nAfter being released from the jail later Tuesday, Williams said she was targeted as a black woman. The Abrams campaign called for charges against Williams to be dropped.\n\nThe Georgia Constitution states that legislators \u201cshall be free from arrest during sessions of the General Assembly ... except for treason, felony, or breach of the peace.\u201d\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp with a lead just shy of 60,000 votes out of more than 3.9 million cast. Abrams would need a net gain of about 21,000 votes to force a runoff.\n\nThe Associated Press has not called the race.\n\nKemp\u2019s campaign has repeatedly called on Abrams to concede, calling her campaign\u2019s lawsuit \u201ca disgrace to democracy\u201d that ignores mathematical realities.\n\nThe Georgia Republican Party which on Tuesday joined the secretary of state\u2019s office in defending against the lawsuit, said in an emailed statement that Democrats were trying to \u201csue their way to a win\u201d after losing at the ballot box.\n\nAbrams\u2019 campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, told reporters after the hearing that, \u201cOur quest for basic fairness continues and that is we want every single vote to be counted here in Georgia.\u201d\n\nShe accused Kemp, as the state\u2019s top elections official, of running a \u201cchaotic\u201d election that was characterized in long lines and an unusually high number of voters having to cast provisional ballots.\n\n___\n\nFollow Barrow and Brumback on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP and https://twitter.com/katebrumback .", "Minnesota's Amir Coffey, right, and Utah's Vante Hendrix chase the loose ball in the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Jim Mone)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 From key players healed after injuries to multi-talented newcomers filling out the rotation, Minnesota has a much deeper team than last season.\n\nGabe Kalscheur is part of that fresh start, set up to help the Gophers fix a long-running weakness in outside shooting.\n\nKalscheur went 5-for-6 from 3-point range and had 19 points in his second college game as all five Minnesota starters scored in double digits, guiding the Gophers past Utah 78-69 on Monday night.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really confident in his ability to shoot when teams are trying to zone us, and that\u2019s something that we were really missing for a very long time since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d said senior power forward Jordan Murphy, who had 11 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.\n\nThe Gophers finished 10th, 11th and 14th in the Big Ten in 3-point shooting the last three seasons. Kalscheur is 7 for 9 so far. One of three freshmen from the Twin Cities area and less-heralded than four-star recruit Daniel Oturu, the 6-foot-4 Kalscheur even surprised coach Richard Pitino by forcing his way into the starting lineup at shooting guard with his maturity and hustle during preseason practices.\n\n\u201cI needed to have a guy who was smart out there and was going to be solid,\u201d Pitino said.\n\nAmir Coffey had 14 points and six assists, Oturu pitched in 13 points and Dupree McBrayer added 11 points and six assists for the Gophers (2-0), who registered 20 assists to just 11 turnovers.\n\nSedrick Barefield and Vante Hendrix each scored 14 points for the Utes (1-1), who trailed for the final 25 minutes of the game. Novak Topalovic, the 7-foot graduate transfer, had 13 points and three rebounds. Donnie Tillman added nine points and nine rebounds.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we were awestruck by any kind of environment. I thought some of our young kids actually stepped up and had pretty good road games,\u201d coach Larry Krystkowiak said. \u201cIt\u2019s just consistency.\u201d\n\nCoffey\u2019s 3-pointer with 5:53 left in the first half gave the Gophers the lead for good at 20-18, and he followed with a steal of Timmy Allen for a fast break and a dunk. Kalscheur sank his fourth 3-pointer of the half for a 33-26 advantage at the intermission.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of an unknown commodity,\u201d Krystkowiak said. \u201cHe got hot, and we didn\u2019t do a good job of having a hand up, and that\u2019s the difference.\u201d\n\nThe Utes led the Pac-12 in defense last season, allowing an average of 68.5 points per game on 41 percent shooting from the floor. The Gophers made 17 of 28 field goals (60.7 percent) in the second half, a tone set early by Kalscheur.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just got a pro mentality, so every time he shoots nobody\u2019s surprised when it goes in,\u201d Pitino said.\n\nDOWN THE STRETCH\n\nWith a jumper from the wing by Michael Hurt off a fast break, the Gophers took their biggest lead of the game at 57-42.\n\nThe Utes used some full-court press and a surge by Barefield, their only returning starter, to cut the deficit to 62-57 on a step-back jumper with 6:13 remaining. But the Gophers responded with a dunk by Oturu off a lob pass from McBrayer, and a jump shot by McBrayer in the final minute brought the lead back to 13 points.\n\n\u201cWith some of the freshmen, they were a little down at times. Even myself, and I\u2019m a sophomore now,\u201d Tillman said. \u201cBut that\u2019s basketball for you.

One of the freshmen, Both Gach, once played in the Minnesota state tournament with Austin High School. He sank both of his 3-point attempts.\n\nMinnesota: This was the only game at Williams Arena for the Gophers in a 28-day stretch, a strange schedule that includes a local game against Oklahoma State on Nov. 30 at U.S. Bank Stadium, the home of the NFL\u2019s Vikings and the site of this season\u2019s NCAA Final Four.

China on Nov. 12, 2018, says it is suspending rule changes allowing trading in tiger and rhinoceros parts, after the move to reverse a ban sparked an outcry from environmental groups. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan, File)\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 China is postponing its decision to allow trading in tiger and rhinoceros parts a bare two weeks after the easing of the ban had raised fears the country was giving legal cover to poaching and smuggling of endangered wildlife.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency quoted Cabinet official Ding Xuedong as saying Monday that the change had \u201cbeen postponed after study.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts. Illegal acts will be dealt with severely,\u201d Ding, an executive deputy secretary-general of the State Council was quoted as saying.\n\nThe Xinhua report said the ban on the import and export of rhino and tiger parts and their use in traditional Chinese medicine would also be maintained. Ding\u2019s comments did not address whether the postponement meant the decision would be revived.\n\nThe traditional medicinal uses of tiger bone and rhino horn have continued despite no proof of their effectiveness and the decreasing wild populations. China has also long tolerated the farming of tigers and the semi-legal sale of their parts.\n\nLate last month, authorities said they would allow trading in products made from tigers and rhinos under \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d bringing condemnation from conservation groups. Farming of non-native rhinos is not known in China but the changing law raised speculation it was being planned.\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund said overturning the ban would have \u201cdevastating consequences globally\u201d by allowing poachers and smugglers to hide behind legalized trade.\n\nChina\u2019s authoritarian Communist Party-led government rarely responds to international pressure and the reversal appeared to reflect concerns over the country\u2019s reputation as a supporter of environmental preservation. China, home to the highly endangered giant panda, has frequently been named as a top market for endangered wildlife products including ivory and skin from African elephants and meat and scales from the anteater-like pangolin, native to Africa and southern Asia.\n\nReacting to the latest development, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States called for China to completely ban the trade in tiger and rhino products.\n\n\u201cTo truly protect tigers and rhinos we need an official written proclamation from the State Council that permanently reinstates a complete ban. Full stop,\u201d Iris Ho, senior specialist for Wildlife Program and Policy at Humane Society International was quoted as saying in a news release. \u201cSpecies extinction is irreversible and we cannot afford any missteps,\u201d Ho said.\n\nAlong with other animal protection organizations, the Humane Society International and the Humane Society of the United States have filed a legal appeal for a ban on U.S. imports of all wildlife and their parts from China \u201cunless or until China formally reinstates a complete ban on domestic trade in tigers and rhinos and their parts and products,\u201d the groups said in a statement.\n\nAn estimated 3,890 tigers remain alive in the wild, according to a report presented during the Third Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in 2016.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Eli Manning showed he still has what it takes to lead the kind of game-winning drive that earned him two Super Bowl MVP awards.\n\nManning capped a 75-yard drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard with 53 seconds left and the New York Giants snapped a five-game losing streak by beating the San Francisco 49ers 27-23 on Monday night.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get old,\u201d said Manning, whose 36 game-winning drives are the third most in the NFL since he entered the league in 2004. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun playing in those games and having a two-minute drive to win it. Those are the situations you want to be in. You want to have a chance.\u201d\n\nThe Giants (2-7) have failed to capitalize on those late-game situations this season, losing five games by seven or fewer points as part of a disappointing stretch that has put the 37-year-old Manning\u2019s status as starting quarterback in question.\n\nBut Manning delivered against the 49ers (2-8) to give New York a much-needed win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Eli is really good at, engineering those come-from-behind drives,\u201d coach Pat Shurmur said. \u201cThat was terrific. He hung in there and made some really good throws and got us into the end zone. That\u2019s the sign of a good quarterback.\u201d\n\nManning threw two TD passes to Odell Beckham Jr. and then engineered the late game-winning drive with help from a pair of third-down penalties against Malcolm Smith and Ahkello Witherspoon.\n\nSaquon Barkley then had a 23-yard catch to get the ball into the red zone and Manning connected with Shepard on third down to give the Giants the win.\n\n\u201cI just saw man-to-man coverage,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve been practicing. I was able to capture the outside edge and Eli put the ball in a perfect place.\u201d\n\nMatt Breida ran for 101 yards and scored two touchdowns for the 49ers (2-8), who were unable to win consecutive games under third-string quarterback Nick Mullens. Breida\u2019s 23-yard run helped set up a 30-yard field goal by Robbie Gould that gave the Niners a 23-20 lead with 2:46 to play.\n\nBut the 49ers allowed the go-ahead score and couldn\u2019t pull it out at the end as Mullens\u2019 pass from the Giants 21 sailed out of the end zone on the final play.\n\n\u201cThose are the plays you have to make to finish the game,\u201d Mullens said. \u201cThat was a moment of truth, and I didn\u2019t get the job done. I have to play better in those moments of truth. We all have to play better.\u201d\n\nMullens wasn\u2019t nearly as sharp as he was in his NFL debut against the Raiders on Nov. 1 when he joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in the first career game.\n\nMullens threw for 250 yards and had an 11-yard TD pass to Breida that made it 20-10 early in the third quarter. But Mullens also threw two interceptions with the first setting up a 10-yard TD pass from Manning to Beckham .\n\nThose two connected again on a 20-yard score in the third quarter as New York rallied from 10 points down to tie the game in the second half.\n\nHARD HIT\n\nNiners receiver Marquise Goodwin was hit in the helmet by Alec Ogletree on a catch late in the third quarter and briefly left the game. On his first play back in to start the fourth quarter, a pass from Mullens deflected off Goodwin\u2019s hands for the second interception of the game by B.J. Goodson . Goodwin was slow to get up after that play and went back into the medical tent for observation. Goodwin returned to the game later in the fourth quarter.\n\nBAD REACTION\n\nWitherspoon got beat on Beckham\u2019s second TD catch and immediately threw his hands up in disgust because he didn\u2019t get the safety help he expected from Antone Exum. Teammate Richard Sherman and coaches talked to Witherspoon on the sideline to tell him not to show up a teammate.\n\n\u201cMan up. Don\u2019t put that on tape,\u201d coach Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with that when we come in.\u201d\n\nCENTURY MARK\n\nBarkley rans for 67 yards and added 33 receiving to join Eric Dickerson as the only players since the merger to gain at least 100 yards from scrimmage in eight of their first nine career games.\n\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY\n\nThe Giants entered the game converting just 40 percent of their red zone trips into TDs. They missed a golden opportunity for one late in the first half. On a third down from the 3, the 49ers left Beckham unguarded in the slot but Manning stuck with a run play to Barkley that gained only 1 yard. New York settled for a field goal that tied the game at 10.\n\nPLAYING FOR PARADISE\n\nNiners GM John Lynch welcomed the high school football team from Paradise, a town destroyed by the wildfires in Butte County, about 175 miles north. Players and cheerleaders from the school were on the field for the national anthem. The Niners raised more than $100,000 to support relief and recovery efforts.\n\nThe air quality for the game was at an unhealthy level because of the fires. The Air Quality Index was at 161 at kickoff, which is in the unhealthy zone, and smoke could be smelled throughout the stadium. The NFL had monitored the situation but the AQI never got near 200, the level where the game would have needed to be moved.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: Host Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\n49ers: Visit Tampa Bay on Nov. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Dallas Stars forward Jason Spezza (90) looks for a rebound off of Columbus Blue Jackets goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky (72) during the third period of an NHL hockey game, Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Dallas.

At 1:29 of the second period, 25 seconds after Benn went off for slashing, Atkinson took a pass from Seth Jones at the top of the right faceoff circle and sent a wrist shot past Khubodin.\n\nThe Stars blocked 15 shots in the period and tied the game 1-1 at 18:20 when Radulov put a wrist shot from the right circle into the upper left of the net.\n\nIt was Radulov\u2019s sixth goal in eight games.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas guard Lagerald Vick followed his underwhelming season-opening performance against Michigan State with what Bill Self called the best offensive performance of anybody he\u2019s ever coached.\n\nVick went 8 for 8 from outside the 3-point arc. He hit two more deep 2s with his foot on the line. And the only shots he missed were a short hook and what Self called \u201ca dipsy-do layup,\u201d giving the senior a career-high 32 points in an 84-68 victory over Vermont on Monday night.\n\n\u201cHe was fabulous,\u201d Self said. \u201cHe was great. He carried us.\u201d\n\nVick got some help from Udoka Azubuike, who had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Devon Dotson, who kept finding Vick open on the perimeter while adding 10 points and 10 assists for the second-ranked Jayhawks.\n\n\u201cIt was really just confidence,\u201d Vick said, \u201cCoach and my teammates giving it to me before the game. Just going out there and really playing for the team.\u201d\n\nKansas (2-0) was jumped by Duke for the top spot in the AP poll earlier in the day, even though it beat the No. 10 Spartans in the Champions Classic last week. And for most of their game against the Catamounts (1-1), the Jayhawks did little to prove the voters wrong.\n\nThey led just 40-36 at halftime before two big runs allowed Self to breathe easy.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cwas a really good team we played tonight.\u201d\n\nAnthony Lamb had 24 points, Ernie Duncan added 17 and Stef Smith scored 13 for the Catamounts, who have lost nine straight to ranked teams dating to a win over Boston College in 2006.\n\nThe Catamounts looked as if that streak might end when they went on an early 18-4 run, hitting a series of quick 3-pointers while double-teaming Azubuike on defense whenever he got the ball.\n\nThe Jayhawks\u2019 7-footer still muscled his way to 12 first-half points.\n\n\u201cI think we came out shooting really hot from 3 and that kind of grabbed their attention,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe could feel them turn it up a notch as we got going.\u201d\n\nBut while the Catamounts sent waves of bodies at Azubuike inside, and made fellow Kansas forward Dedric Lawson a non-factor, they didn\u2019t account for Vick on the perimeter.\n\nAfter struggling mightily in the Jayhawks\u2019 season-opening win over the Spartans, Vick poured in four first-half 3s and piled up 16 points. Most of them came as the Jayhawks struggled to run offense through their two freshman guards, Dotson and Quentin Grimes.\n\nEventually, the Jayhawks\u2019 depth and talent wore down Vermont.\n\nIt was 44-40 before Azubuike added another of his rim-rattling dunks and then scored on a putback. Vick followed a jumper with his sixth 3-pointer and added his seventh a couple of minutes later as the Jayhawks\u2019 lead swelled to 61-45 midway through the second half.\n\n\u201cAzubuike was a monster down low,\u201d Vermont coach John Becker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to know what to do with him. If you double him, you have guys making 3s.\u201d\n\nVermont went on one last run to get its deficit under 10, but Azubuike added two more baskets and Vick curled in his eighth 3-pointer. That matched Mario Chalmers for most in the Self era at Kansas and left Vick trailing only Terry Brown, who hit 11 in a game in 1991.\n\nVick finished 12 of 14 from the field in helping Kansas win its 46th straight home opener.\n\n\u201cVick was unbelievable tonight,\u201d Becker said. \u201cSometimes you just have to tip your hat to a guy.\u201d\n\nSTATS AND STREAKS\n\nVermont has not beaten a Big 12 opponent since former member Colorado in 2008. ... The Catamounts had 11 assists to 12 turnovers. ... Kansas has not dropped a home opener since losing to Vanderbilt on Dec. 2, 1972. ... The Jayhawks finished 12 of 19 from the 3-point line.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nVermont: The favorites to win America East did nothing to diminish their outlook, standing toe-to-toe with the reigning Big 12 champs for nearly 30 minutes. In a league where they should match up better physically, keep an eye on Vermont to roll toward another NCAA Tournament appearance.\n\nKansas: Lawson followed his excellent debut against the Spartans, when he had 20 points and 14 boards, with a dud at the Phog.

Jackson also worked with the Bengals as a defensive assistant and wide receivers coach and is extremely tight with Lewis and a favorite of Bengals owner Mike Brown.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t be long before the Browns see him again. Following a bye week, Cleveland visits Cincinnati on Nov. 25. The Browns (3-6-1) will host the Bengals (5-4) on Dec. 23.\n\nThis is the second time Lewis has re-hired Jackson, who returned to Cincinnati in 2012 after he was fired as Oakland\u2019s coach.\n\nJackson\u2019s hiring came a few hours after Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, a day after an embarrassing 51-14 loss to the New Orleans Saints. The Bengals are allowing a league-high 454.6 yards per game.\n\nJackson figured to land on his feet at some point following his dismissal in Cleveland, where he was brought back for a third season despite going 1-31 in his first two. However, the team continued to struggle and Jackson had issues with offensive coordinator Todd Haley, who was also let go.\n\nSince his firing, Jackson has done several TV interviews in which he has maintained he should have never given up play-calling duties to Haley.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FILE - In this July 21, 2011, file photo, Stan Lee poses for a portrait at the LMT Music Lodge during Comic Con in San Diego.

Fair enough. But part of Lee\u2019s genius was his ability to be a master of collage.\n\nLike a Bob Dylan or a Gene Roddenberry, Lee took cultural threads \u2014 elements already afoot in society \u2014 and constructed his own quilt. While his source material was sometimes derivative, what he stitched was something new under the sun.\n\nAnd within his emerging pantheon of white male angst, Lee was often an enthusiastic champion of progressive views about race, if not always gender. The now-fabled Black Panther first appeared in a Marvel comic book in 1966, becoming one of the earliest mainstream superheroes of African descent, though it took until 1973 for him to snag a marquee spot in a comic entitled \u201cJungle Action.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us is all that different from each other. We all want essentially the same things outta life,\u201d Lee wrote in the pages of Marvel Comics in February 1980. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we all stop wasting time hating the \u2018other\u2019 guys. Just look in the mirror, mister \u2014 that other guy is you.\u201d\n\nMarvel is a calibrated commercial juggernaut now, its stories drowning in the merchandise that amplifies them. It has been dismissed as mass-produced storytelling for a mass-produced age. Yet somehow, among the things Lee manages to leave behind is a lingering sense \u2014 snake oil, maybe, but potent nonetheless \u2014 that with Marvel\u2019s tales, still, anything might happen.\n\nBecause, as Stan Lee knew well before America did, we still want our fantastic, unlikely superheroes to be just like us. Or, more saliently, we want to believe that we can be just like them. And who knows what they might do to prevail because, after all, who really knows what we might do? Maybe we can be heroes, sure, but the rent\u2019s still due on the 15th.\n\n___\n\nTed Anthony, director of digital innovation for The Associated Press, writes frequently about American culture.

But part of Lee\u2019s genius was his ability to be a master of collage.\n\nLike a Bob Dylan or a Gene Roddenberry, Lee took cultural threads \u2014 elements already afoot in society \u2014 and constructed his own quilt. While his source material was sometimes derivative, what he stitched was something new under the sun.\n\nAnd within his emerging pantheon of white male angst, Lee was often an enthusiastic champion of progressive views about race, if not always gender. The now-fabled Black Panther first appeared in a Marvel comic book in 1966, becoming one of the earliest mainstream superheroes of African descent, though it took until 1973 for him to snag a marquee spot in a comic entitled \u201cJungle Action.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us is all that different from each other. We all want essentially the same things outta life,\u201d Lee wrote in the pages of Marvel Comics in February 1980. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we all stop wasting time hating the \u2018other\u2019 guys. Just look in the mirror, mister \u2014 that other guy is you.\u201d\n\nMarvel is a calibrated commercial juggernaut now, its stories drowning in the merchandise that amplifies them. It has been dismissed as mass-produced storytelling for a mass-produced age. Yet somehow, among the things Lee manages to leave behind is a lingering sense \u2014 snake oil, maybe, but potent nonetheless \u2014 that with Marvel\u2019s tales, still, anything might happen.\n\nBecause, as Stan Lee knew well before America did, we still want our fantastic, unlikely superheroes to be just like us. Or, more saliently, we want to believe that we can be just like them. And who knows what they might do to prevail because, after all, who really knows what we might do? Maybe we can be heroes, sure, but the rent\u2019s still due on the 15th.\n\n___\n\nTed Anthony, director of digital innovation for The Associated Press, writes frequently about American culture.

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico Democrats who won nearly unbridled power over state government in midterm elections are confronting competing interests within their own ideologically diverse party, as the governor-elect pursues major reforms in areas from public education to marijuana access.\n\nA key budget-drafting panel met Tuesday as Democratic Gov.-elect Michelle Lujan Grisham began the process of building legislative relationships and coalitions to carry out campaign pledges.\n\nThose pledges include efforts to raise teacher salaries and funnel money toward early childhood education from the state permanent fund \u2014 a multibillion dollar savings account sustained by petroleum and other natural-resource revenues. Fiscally conservative lawmakers including Democrats have been loath to tamper with the account.\n\n\u201cIf they want responsible fiscal policy, the door is closed\u201d to the permanent fund, said Sen. John Arthur Smith, a Democrat from Deming who leads the Senate Finance Committee and has repeatedly rebuffed attempted increase withdrawals from the permanent fund for education. \u201cIf they want to be reckless with the dollar, then it\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nLujan Grisham said this week she already is working to overcome reticence to greater spending on public education and infrastructure projects that she believes will improve the state\u2019s future economy and competitiveness \u2014 a central tenant of her campaign. She is urging legislators to comply with a recent court order to provide more resources to educate students from low-income and minority families.\n\n\u201cI hope to have a really successful 2019, and it starts by developing relationships with legislators right now,\u201d Lujan Grisham said.\n\nState government economists anticipate a $1.2 billion budget surplus beyond the state\u2019s $6.3 billion in annual spending obligations, for the fiscal year starting in July 2019.\n\nThe oil and natural gas sector is largely responsible for the anticipated windfall, which dissipates as oil prices decline. Smith said lawmakers are working to identify sustainable sources of tax income before setting new spending levels.\n\nIn the midterm election, Lujan Grisham defeated U.S. Rep Steve Pearce by a 14 percent point margin to succeed termed-out Republican Gov. Susana Martinez.\n\nDemocrats swept statewide, Congressional and major judicial races. They are likely to hold 46 state House seats out of 70 next year, with recounts pending in two races. Democrats also hold a majority in the state Senate, which comes up for election in 2020.\n\nGabriel Sanchez, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico, said the ouster of Republicans from high office is reminiscent of long stretches in state history in which Democrats dominated the political scene, amid rivalries between progressive and conservative wings of the party.\n\n\u201cMichelle\u2019s opportunity as governor to do a lot of those ambitious projects is largely about whether she can form a coalition among those two separate camps,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor initiatives to raise minimum wage, enact gun control, address climate change and allow recreational marijuana no longer are seen as progressive pipe dreams.\n\n\u201cFor the last eight years we\u2019ve been playing small ball,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, describing Democratic tactics under the Martinez administration.\n\nCome January, Democrats also will control major state watchdog agencies for elections, campaigning, open records and public accounting.\n\nVoters re-elected Democrats as attorney general, secretary of state and state treasurer \u2014 while gaining control of the office of the state auditor and state land office.\n\nAt the same time, three-quarters of voters endorsed the creation of an independent ethics commission to oversee the conduct of elected officials, public employees and others. Detailed guidelines for the commission were left for the Legislature to hammer out \u2014 something Wirth listed as a high priority for the legislative session that starts in January.\n\nSome Democrats remain wary of overreaching.\n\nState Rep. Harry Garcia, a Democrat from Grants who joined the Legislature amid a budget crisis in 2016, emphasized caution on new spending and calls to legalize recreational marijuana. That year, lawmakers used cash balances from school districts to balance the budget.\n\n\u201cMy deal is I hope we never get to the same situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard.\u201d", "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Utah officials are asking the federal government to cancel their request for a limited Medicaid expansion with a work requirement after voters approved a full expansion.\n\nUtah Department of Health spokeswoman Kolbi Young says the state has asked federal Medicaid officials to indefinitely suspend consideration of the plan passed by Utah lawmakers earlier this year.\n\nUtah\u2019s plan needed a waiver because it has a work requirement and is more limited than the expansion specified by then-President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nUtah voters approved the ballot measure last week after majority Republican lawmakers repeatedly rejected the idea over concerns that its costs would force cuts to other services.\n\nThe initiative will provide health care coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income Utah residents.

The infamous Mexican drug lord has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year. Guzman pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached New York, New Jersey, Texas and elsewhere north of the border. (Elizabeth Williams via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The infamous Mexican drug lord and escape artist Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman was alternately portrayed at his U.S. trial on Tuesday as a calculating leader of a bloodthirsty smuggling operation that funneled tons of cocaine and other drugs into American cities and a scapegoat for a conspiracy whose actual mastermind bribed crooked Mexican officials as high as the president to keep his freedom.\n\nIn opening statements amid tight security in federal court in Brooklyn, Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels told a jury whose identities have been kept secret how the man who got his start in a modest marijuana-selling business became a kingpin known for using an army of hit men to wipe out his competitors and anyone within his Sinaloa cartel who betrayed him.\n\n\u201cMoney. Drugs. Murder. ... That is what this case is about,\u201d Fels said.\n\nDefense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman sought to shift blame in his opening to Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, another reputed drug trafficker in the cartel\u2019s leadership who is still at large in Mexico. The lawyer claimed that unlike Guzman, Zambada remains on the loose because of bribes that \u201cgo up to the very top,\u201d including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.\n\nHe also suggested U.S. law enforcement turned a blind eye to the situation.\n\nIn a tweet, a spokesman for current President Enrique Pena Nieto called the sensational allegation \u201ccompletely false and defamatory.\u201d A separate tweet by ex-President Felipe Calderon called it \u201cabsolutely false and reckless.\u201d\n\nOne of Zambata\u2019s sons is expected to be the first of several government cooperators to testify against Guzman, possibly as early as Wednesday.\n\nGuzman, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached well north of the border.\n\nDespite his diminutive stature and nickname that means \u201cShorty\u201d in Spanish, Guzman was once a larger-than-life figure in Mexico who has been compared to Al Capone and Robin Hood and been the subject of ballads known as narcocorridos. He appeared in a dark suit and tie on Tuesday as he listened to Fels describe how he started modestly in the early 1970s by selling marijuana in Mexico, but built his reputation by constructing tunnels across the Mexico-U.S. border to transport marijuana and cocaine so fast that he was \u201cno longer El Chapo, the short one.\u201d\n\nInstead, he became known as \u201cthe speedy one.\u201d Before his tunnels, it had taken weeks to move drugs across the border to the U.S.\n\nBefore long, Guzman was receiving 10 to 15 planes \u201cstuffed with cocaine\u201d each day from Colombia at landing strips in Mexico for transport to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, Fels said.\n\nAs his business flourished using the tunnels, trains, planes and vessels, Guzman began taking aim at rivals in the early 1990s, leading to bloody wars. In 1993, he fled to Guatemala but was captured and imprisoned in Mexico for eight years, where he continued running his drug empire, Fels said.\n\nThe prosecutor spoke of two dramatic escapes from prison by Guzman and said he was planning a third when he was brought to the U.S. One of his escapes in 2015 was through a mile-long tunnel dug into a shower in his jail cell that he slipped into before fleeing on a motorcycle.\n\nThe tunnel escape was a black eye for the Mexican government, an embarrassment amplified when the actor Sean Penn was able to find and interview him at one of his hideouts in Mexico while he was on the run from authorities.\n\nFels said Guzman used some of his wealth to pay off the Mexican military and police and to finance assault rifles, grenade launchers and explosives to engage in \u201cwar after bloody war.\u201d He accused the defendant of personally shooting two men and having their bodies burned.\n\nGuzman\u2019s attorney told jurors it would have been impossible for him to be in charge of the cartel since he was either in jail or hiding out in the Mexican countryside during the entire time U.S. prosecutors claim he was the leader.\n\nSome of the cooperators will \u201ctell you he has no money,\u201d Lichtman said.\n\nAn email written by a U.S. agent who eavesdropped on Guzman for a year wrote, \u201cChapo was more of a myth than an actual legend,\u201d and that he was \u201cnot impressed\u201d by him, the lawyer added.\n\nOpening statements were delayed about six hours on Tuesday after two jurors were dismissed for hardships and were replaced in a proceeding in another courtroom.

(Rod Aydelotte/Waco Tribune Herald, via AP)\n\nWACO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Jared Butler is starting to feel comfortable on the court with Baylor.\n\nThe true freshman, who originally enrolled at Alabama last summer before transferring to Baylor in August, scored 22 points and King McClure added 21 points with five 3-pointers Monday night, when the Bears finally pulled away late to beat Prairie View 91-80.\n\nButler got an NCAA waiver to play immediately at Baylor, where he had 11 points while making only 4 of 13 shots his first two games. The 6-foot-3 guard broke out against Prairie View by hitting 7-of-10 shots with three 3-pointers and started a game-turning run.\n\n\u201cIn the first game, I had a lot of jitters and was wondering what it was going to be like,\u201d Butler said. \u201cOnce I feel comfortable and I feel the environment I play better, and I play more comfortable. That\u2019s what you saw tonight a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe Bears (2-1), who opened their season last week with a loss to another SWAC team, never trailed and led by as many as 16 points in the first half. But their lead was only 59-57 left with 9\u00bd minutes left before a 22-8 run that included a run of 13 consecutive points.\n\n\u201cI think we play in spurts. We can be really, really good, and we can be really, really bad,\u201d Baylor coach Scott Drew said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what you get with inexperience. ... The good parts are great; the bad parts are really bad.\u201d\n\nButler scored the first six points in the 13-0 run, including two free throws, a jumper and a layup. McClure then had a 3-pointer and a layup before Tristan Clark emphatically closed out that 2\u00bd-minute spurt with a block at one end and a two-handed dunk at the other to make it 78-61.\n\nClark had 17 points on 5-of-5 shooting, along with seven rebounds and five blocked shots. Devonte Bandoo scored 16 points. McClure also had eight rebounds.\n\nPrairie View (1-1) had five players in double figures, led by Gary Blackston\u2019s 18 points. Darius Williams had 16, and Gerard Andrus posted 14 points and nine rebounds. Chancellor Ellis had 12 points, and Taishaun Johnson 11.\n\n\u201cYou come in here trying to win, but I think you can win and not have the most points at the end of the night,\u201d Prairie View coach Byron Smith said. \u201cI think we won in some areas in that we didn\u2019t quit, and we battled on the glass. Obviously, you want to win, but if you can\u2019t there\u2019s a way to lose. It could have been worse. ... We\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPrairie View: Despite being Prairie View\u2019s second-leading scorer, Williams was a nonfactor for most of the game. He picked up another quick foul after the technical he got following consecutive 3s to start the game. He played only 10 minutes and didn\u2019t score again until the 2:29 mark of the second half. ... The Panthers were 11 for 22 from beyond the arc, which allowed them to stay in the game.\n\nBaylor: The Bears\u2019 size advantage in the paint showed up with nine blocks, but they only had a 32-31 edge on the boards. Baylor kept Prairie View without a 2-point basket for nearly 11 minutes, shot 61 percent (31 of 51) from the field and 48 percent (11 of 23) on 3s.\n\nSWAC SEASON\n\nBaylor opened its season with three consecutive games against teams from the Southwestern Athletic Conference. After losing the opener 72-69 to Texas Southern last Tuesday, their first loss ever to a SWAC team, the Bears responded with a win over Southern University on Saturday before beating Prairie View. The Bears are 58-1 all-time against the SWAC, 15-0 against Prairie View.

As long as it ends up being a win, we\u2019re good with that.\u201d\n\nThe Nets lost LeVert to what appeared to be a severe right leg injury late in the first half that brought the entire crowd at Target Center to a silence.\n\nLeVert spent several minutes on the court being attended by medical personnel. Nets players surrounded their injured teammate before he was wheeled off the court.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s a devastating blow for us, for him. That\u2019s all I really want to say about this,\u201d Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cOur thoughts should be with him and his recovery. And I really don\u2019t want to talk about the game or anything else.\u201d\n\nThe Timberwolves officially dealt Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, along with big man Justin Patton. The Wolves received Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick in the trade.\n\nButler had asked for a trade earlier in the season but coach and president of basketball of operations Tom Thibodeau said Monday that the team tried to remain patient in waiting for the right deal for the All-Star. Thibodeau refuted a report that Butler\u2019s trade demand included sending him to only a handful of teams.\n\nIn the first game of the post-Butler era, Minnesota used a strong effort from the backcourt duo of Teague and Derrick Rose, who had 23 points in 39 minutes. Teague was aggressive on offense for Minnesota in his first game since Oct. 29.\n\n\u201cWe needed the downhill play and the attack,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cI thought he and Derrick put a lot of pressure on them.\u201d\n\nA former first-round pick in his third season, LeVert was averaging a team-high 19 points entering the game. He had 10 points, five rebounds and four assists before suffering the injury with just a few seconds remaining before halftime.\n\nLeVert was taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Players from around the league tweeted out their support for LeVert shortly after the injury occurred.\n\n\u201cThere were really just no words,\u201d said Nets forward Joe Harris. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk even when we came in at halftime. There\u2019s nothing really to be said. You could just feel it, the emotions from everybody.

Brooklyn cut it to 97-96 early in the fourth before the Wolves pulled away.\n\nMinnesota overcame a season-high 23 turnovers.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: C Jarrett Allen missed the game due to illness.

(AP) \u2014 After missing 15 free throws in the first half, Arkansas regrouped from the line to shoot almost 78 percent after intermission and handle UC Davis, 81-58, on Monday night.\n\nArkansas relied on two 20-point scorers, neither named Daniel Gafford, to fend off an Aggies squad that trailed by only seven at half and hung around in the second until the Hogs\u2019 offense re-emerged to put the game away. Sophomore guard Mason Jones led the team with 21 points and eight rebounds, and junior forward Adrio Bailey scored a career-high 20 with a strong, 16-point second half.\n\n\u2033(Gafford) is gonna be the centerpiece in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Razorbacks coach Mike Anderson said. \u201cAt the same time, we saw tonight, we\u2019ve got two 20-point scorers, and it wasn\u2019t Daniel. How about that?\u201d\n\nThe Preseason All-SEC First-Team selection scored 12 points and had four blocks, but he wasn\u2019t his usual, dominant self in the post. For the second-straight game to open the season, he racked up six turnovers due to constant double teams, and he was often taken out of rebounding position, grabbing only four.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just gotta be a little bit more efficient and not be as sloppy,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta man up, and that\u2019s gonna be my message to him. You\u2019ve got the attention. You wanted it, you\u2019ve got it. So, now you\u2019ve gotta be able to handle it.\u201d\n\nRazorback newcomers continued to prove their ability to score when the opposition puts its defensive energy on Gafford. Along with Jones and Bailey, freshman guard Isaiah Joe poured in 14 points and hit two 3-pointers.\n\nStill, it was Bailey\u2019s second-half scoring outburst, which included his first career three and a 9-for-11 free-throw clip, that played perhaps the biggest role in Arkansas\u2019 victory.\n\n\u201cI stayed in the lab working on my craft, . and it just carried over to the game,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ve been working on. A lot of long nights, staying up until 3 or 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, knowing that they\u2019ve got parties going on, but you just have to make sacrifices.\u201d\n\nT.J. Shorts, the reigning Big West Player of the Year, led UC Davis with 14 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Anderson said he was proud of Arkansas\u2019 defensive effort in keeping Shorts relatively in check.\n\n\u201cWith young guys, they\u2019re always tied to offense,\u201d Anderson said, referencing how pleased he\u2019s been with his young squad\u2019s defensive effort in its first two games. \u201cThis team scored 58 points. That\u2019s pretty darn good defense. Texas shot 19 percent in the second half. That\u2019s pretty good defense.\u201d\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nArkansas: The Razorbacks continued their tendency to shoot well from the three-point arc but poorly from the free-throw line. The 8-for-20 clip from deep brought their average to just over 38 percent in two regular season games, while the 27-for-41 struggle at the free throw line moved them to 60.2 percent in those two contests plus two exhibitions.\n\nUC Davis: Though the Aggies have lost three straight to open the season, their increased competitiveness has showed up on the scoreboard. After losing by 34 in their season-opener to San Francisco, they were able to mostly hang around against an SEC opponent on the road. With 10 upperclassmen on the roster, the Aggies expect to be a tough matchup in Big West play after a grueling non-conference schedule that also includes games at Indiana, Arizona and USC.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArkansas welcomes Big 10 opponent Indiana to Fayetteville on Nov. 18.\n\nThe Aggies return home to face Texas A&M Corpus Christi on Saturday.", "In this Friday, Aug. 10, 2018 photo, Jamie Casey, right, speaks with Brian Peets at a homeless camp in New Bedford, Mass., on Friday, Aug. 10, 2018. \u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself.

Pleas to struggling souls to surrender to God. Funerals for members of their flock who didn\u2019t make it.\n\nClergy members have become spiritual first responders in the opioid crisis, often leaving the pulpit to minister on the streets.\n\nThey can be reverends, rabbis, priests or pastors. Though their faiths differ, they invariably approach people with addiction as equals. No Bible-thumping, no blaming. Quite a few are in recovery themselves.\n\nDespite some signs of a slowdown, the nation\u2019s all-time deadliest drug overdose epidemic endures. Opioids were involved in most of the deaths, killing nearly 48,000 people last year.\n\nA spiritual element to recovery is familiar to people who have worked 12-step programs, with their references to an undefined higher power. Scientific studies have found evidence that religious faith can help substance abusers with their recovery.\n\nWorking with addicted people means trips to hospital rooms and fresh graves. But there are flashes of light in the darkness, too.\n\nThree dispatches from the front lines:\n\nA CHURCH FOR IMPERFECT PEOPLE\n\nNine minutes into his sermon, Pastor Brad Hill made a confession.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. I ask myself a lot of the times, \u2019God, why did you allow me to be an addict?\u201d Hill says from the pulpit of his Grace Downtown Church. \u201cWhy are my friends dying of an overdose? ... I gotta ask God, \u2018Why, God, do you allow this?\u2019\u201d\n\nHill hears those questions a lot.\n\nThe church Hill started in the back of a Winchester, Virginia, bar moved this year to a space that can accommodate hundreds, many trying to turn the page on their addictions. Six and a half years in recovery, Hill calls it a totally judgment-free zone, \u201ca church for imperfect people.\u201d\n\nHill has a salty beard, smiling eyes and booming voice to sermonize about the suffering he sees so often in the Shenandoah Valley. His phone lights up constantly with messages from struggling people and their loved ones. One recent text read: \u201cDo those who commit suicide still go to heaven?\u201d\n\nToo often, Hill speaks at funerals for overdose victims, three in the past three months alone. He honors the dead while telling survivors, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be like this person. There is a way out.\u201d\n\nA funeral in September for a 38-year-old married father of four was especially hard on Hill. They were friends, and Hill had been talking to him about his struggle just a week before he died. It was Hill who welcomed the man\u2019s grieving family to a Sunday service.\n\n\u201cThey lost one of ...\u201d Hill swallowed, clapped his hands together twice, and continued in a softer voice. \u201cThey lost one of my favorite people. So I just ask that we pray real quick for them, OK?\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s own addiction to painkillers led to a prescription fraud conviction in 2007 and a yearlong jail sentence that cost him a thriving church in Virginia Beach.\n\nAbout four years ago, he came to Winchester and started Sunday services in the backroom of a downtown bar called Brewbaker\u2019s for a handful of people struggling with addiction. They\u2019d drop a sheet over the liquor bottles before services.\n\nIt grew by attracting people like Matthew Fanning, who met Hill at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.\n\nHill would talk about spirituality, but Fanning wasn\u2019t ready to hear it until he relapsed into heroin addiction. Hill visited him in rehab in 2015, encouraged him and gave him Bible-based homework.\n\nFanning is now in recovery and a Grace Downtown regular.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come in your quote-unquote Sunday best,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cYou come as you are, whether you\u2019re struggling, or whether you don\u2019t believe, or whether you\u2019re just curious.\u201d\n\nThe nondenominational church moved this year to a nearby strip mall with room to seat 400.\n\nWhile some churches merely welcome the homeless, Grace Downtown picks them up in a van. Other worshippers come from local rehabilitation centers. Hill estimates that more than half who show up on Sundays are in recovery or related to someone who is.\n\n\u201cI have folks that come in that just got high the night before,\u201d Hill says. \u201cI\u2019ve got folks that overdosed the night before. I\u2019ve got folks who have lost everything.\u201d\n\n(Nov. 13)\n\nNEVER STOP GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY\n\nPastor Jamie Casey prays with addicted people all over New Bedford, Massachusetts. He joins hands with them in their living rooms days after overdoses, in hospital emergency rooms and on sidewalks in front of wind-beaten houses in this struggling city.\n\nThe 45-year-old associate pastor in a nondenominational church is part of a team of clergy from a variety of faiths who regularly crisscross town with police officers and counselors. Their goal is to get people into treatment and, if they will listen, to offer some spiritual advice.\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey told Brian Peets, who stepped out from his makeshift shelter beneath a railroad track platform.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Peets said.\n\n\u201cSurrender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrender,\u201d Casey repeated, alluding to his own addictions that started with alcohol and cocaine.\n\n\u201cFor 20 years I fought and fought and fought against myself. Because you\u2019re your biggest enemy. You know that, right?\u201d he told Peets. \u201cSo what ended up happening is that I ended up in a place that I lost almost everything. But then I had to surrender to this addiction, surrender to my circumstances, surrender to myself and then surrender to God.\u201d\n\nNew Bedford logged 56 opioid-related overdose deaths last year, a per-capita rate a third higher than nearby Boston. Police hope such outreach ride-alongs can get struggling people into treatment before the next setback.\n\nThe three-person teams cold-call homes where there have recently been overdoses to see if anyone wants help.\n\nOn a recent evening, Casey put on his shirt with \u201cCHAPLAIN\u201d on the back to ride with Officer Scott Carola and counselor Peter Lagasse around the city in an unmarked car.\n\nCasey had a list of addresses of recent overdoses. But when they knocked on doors, most people either weren\u2019t home or weren\u2019t answering.\n\nThe trio was unfazed.\n\nThe person who ignores you today might embrace you tomorrow, said the Rev. David Lima, who heads the Inter-Church Council of Greater New Bedford and directs the program.\n\nOnly a small percentage will get treatment, but participating clergy contend that it\u2019s about more than numbers. Says Rabbi Raphael Kanter, quoting the Talmud, \u201cif you save one life, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve saved the whole world.\u201d\n\nThey spotted James Sessine talking to friends on a busy corner outside a food market. The 29-year-old has struggled with addiction and recently has been living in a tent.\n\nSessine\u2019s friends scattered as the car stopped, but he stayed and listened to Casey\u2019s suggestion that he get a treatment slot.\n\nCasey called a provider. Can they give him a time tomorrow? Yes.\n\nSessine got on the phone and promised he\u2019ll be ready the next morning, meanwhile, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk around all night, like I do every night.\u201d\n\nSessine ended the call and hugged Casey.\n\n\u201cI shoot heroin daily,\u201d Sessine explained a few minutes later, \u201cand it\u2019s coming to the point where enough is enough.\u201d\n\nCasey says his preaching, teaching and intervening is all part of his goal to \u201clove people back to life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend and I, we made a deal,\u201d Casey said, his voice catching. \u201cHe looked at me and he said, \u2018Promise me we\u2019ll never stop getting our hands dirty,\u2019 And I made that promise to him and God, because had people given up on me, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nThey picked up Sessine the next morning.\n\nCasey looked for Peets too, but could not find him.\n\n(Nov. 13)\n\nFRIARS FLYING THE JESUS FLAG\n\nWith his bushy beard and long gray robe cinched by a rope, the Rev. Giuseppe Siniscalchi would look at home illuminating manuscript in a monastery. But he and his fellow Franciscan friars are familiar figures on the sidewalks of Newburgh, New York.\n\nThey walk in pairs by row houses, empty storefronts and shoot-up spots in this Hudson River city. They offer people hot chocolate, iced tea or bagels along with their Roman Catholic blessings.\n\n\u201cWhen we approach the people on the street, whether they\u2019re addicted, whether they\u2019re even drunk, or whether they\u2019re high at the moment or they\u2019re a prostitute, whatever\u2019s going in in their life, we want to approach them first of all in love,\u201d Siniscalchi says.\n\nOn one afternoon walking with the Rev. Antonio Maria Diez de Medina, the pair greeted men on a street corner, a mom on her front steps and kids on scooters. Diez de Medina greeted some people in Spanish.\n\nA dark-haired woman ran up to them from across the street and proudly told him about her recovery.\n\nShe acted calmly, different from when Siniscalchi saw her sitting restlessly in a parked car months ago. He offered to pray for her. The two friars laid a hand on her shoulders as they all bowed their heads on the sidewalk.\n\nShe closed her eyes so tightly her nose crinkled.\n\nThe friars are not specifically looking for people struggling with drugs, but they make a point of walking past some of the most troubled corners of Newburgh.\n\nThis once-grand city about an hour north of New York City has a poverty rate higher than that of the Bronx. For every fixed-up row house, there is another run down or abandoned. A hospital two blocks from the friary reported that it saved the lives of 205 overdose patients over a year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThere been a few times where I\u2019ve come across people with their little hypodermic needle kit ready to shoot up ... and you just say, \u2018Hi. How are you? How you doing,\u2019\u201d Siniscalchi says. \u201cThey kind of recognize or get a sense of who we are, and a conversation ensues.\u201d\n\nThe friars moved to an old church rectory here in 2016, establishing the St. Mary of the Assumption Friary. They take turns on the four-times-a-week walkabouts with Brother Peter Anthony Curtis.\n\nIn recent months, they started dispensing drinks from a metal cart they push down the streets. The rubber-wheeled cart sports a Jesus flag and a picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a resonant image in a city with a robust Hispanic population.\n\nAfter two years, the sight of robed men with long beards chatting up people barely draws second glances. Quite a few people chat.\n\nOn one walk, a middle-aged bicyclist asked, \u201cYou guys Catholics or something?\u201d He then had his silver crucifix blessed. A passing woman took a blue plastic crucifix that matched her clothes. At one point, Siniscalchi sat down next to a downcast woman, pulled out a crucifix and told her Jesus loves her.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, looking down.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t matter, he said, Jesus does.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the friars said goodbye to go greet more souls.\n\n___\n\nMichael Hill is a multi-format AP journalist based in Albany, New York.

The Suns whittled that margin down to seven points in the fourth quarter but came no closer.\n\n\u201cAs a group, I thought we sensed the energy,\u201d George said. \u201cI felt we were the more aggressive team. .

A 3-pointer by Jamal Crawford pulled the Suns within 93-86 with 7:56 left, but the Thunder had a 15-4 run and weren\u2019t challenged again.\n\n\u201cWhen we get out and go, we\u2019re a really good team,\u201d George said. \u201cWhen we get a little stagnant is when we struggle.

Both those things happened again Monday night \u2014 but this one was different.\n\nThe winningest goalie in Carolina history took the loss in his first game here as a visitor, with Sebastian Aho scoring 1:16 into overtime to lift the Hurricanes past Ward\u2019s new team, the Chicago Blackhawks, 3-2 and spoiling the goalie\u2019s emotional return.\n\n\u201cObviously, I have a lot to be thankful for, my 13 years here, and wanted to put forth a strong effort,\u201d Ward said. \u201cUnfortunately, we came to win, and it just slipped away there in overtime.\u201d\n\nTeuvo Teravainen and Micheal Ferland scored power-play goals 66 seconds apart late in the second period for Carolina, which has earned points in three straight and beat Chicago for the second time in four nights. But the two wins over the Blackhawks are their only victories since Oct. 26.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t won a lot lately and obviously, we need wins to get some confidence,\u201d Aho said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played in many games well, but we haven\u2019t found a way to get those wins, but this one feels definitely good.\u201d\n\nWard stopped 37 shots, Jonathan Toews scored a deflected goal and Alex DeBrincat added a goal, but the Blackhawks lost their eighth straight.\n\nCarolina\u2019s Scott Darling made 33 saves against his former team, in regulation coming up with a slick glove save to stop Patrick Kane on a 2-on-1 and making a left pad save to stop Nick Schmaltz on a breakaway.\n\nAho\u2019s winner came after he took a pass at the blue line, then skated in before drifting across the net and beating Ward with a wrist shot. Ward had stopped Aho on a breakaway earlier in the game and he wanted another shot at his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI got the second chance and I saw (Ward) going down and it was east-west and I knew he had to move,\u201d Aho said.\n\nFor Ward, it was a tough end to his first game as a visitor in the arena where he won the 2006 Conn Smythe Trophy and hoisted the Stanley Cup.\n\nHe set franchise records with 318 victories, 568 starts and 27 shutouts during 13 seasons with the Hurricanes before he was allowed to leave as a free agent and signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Blackhawks in July while Carolina opted to give Petr Mrazek a one-year, $1.5 million contract.\n\n\u201cI think it took me a little bit to calm down,\u201d Ward said. \u201cObviously there were a little bit of nerves coming back, coming back and playing your former team, you so badly want to play well, and I felt like as the game progressed, it got better and better.\u201d\n\nToews scored the game\u2019s first goal with 10:53 left in the first. Parked in front of Darling, he redirected Henri Jokiharju\u2019s one-time blast from the point for his third goal in six games. DeBrincat made it a 2-0 game with 9:11 left in the second with a blast from between the circles.\n\nCarolina tied it with two rapid-fire power-play goals. Teravainen made it 2-1 three seconds into a delay of game minor on Brent Seabrook, and Ferland followed with his goal 26 seconds into Jokiharju\u2019s slashing penalty.\n\n\u201cGave up two quick goals, not fun, but still had our chances to try and distance ourselves in the game,\u201d Toews said. \u201cJust the way things are going right now that we didn\u2019t find a way to get up a few more goals or two.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Carolina LW Jordan Martinook and Seabrook traded punches midway through the third after Seabrook hit Hurricanes rookie RW Andrei Svechnikov into the boards.

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Xavier Johnson glanced down at the box score and shrugged. Sure, the Pittsburgh freshman understands the numbers he put up during an 84-75 victory over Troy on Monday night \u2014 when he scored 15 points to go with nine assists and seven rebounds \u2014 looked impressive for someone playing his third collegiate game.\n\nIt\u2019s just that it was no big deal to the athletic 6-foot-3 point guard who is off to a precocious start for the rebuilding Panthers.\n\n\u201cThis is pretty much what I averaged in high school,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m just playing the game.\u201d\n\nAnd playing it with an urgency that has Pitt off to a solid start under first-year head coach Jeff Capel. Johnson used his quickness to get in the lane and set up his teammates, took a charge on defense and even knocked down a couple of 3-pointers as the Panthers improved to 3-0.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be really good,\u201d Capel said of Johnson. \u201cHe\u2019s a willing listener. He wants to learn. You can coach him hard. He\u2019s a worker ... he\u2019s done a good job especially being thrown right into the fire.\u201d\n\nCapel is spending his first weeks on the job trying to get a feel for a group that has a mixture of holdovers from a team that went winless in the Atlantic Coast Conference last season and a handful of freshmen that are part of his long-term plans to turn the program around.\n\nJohnson is a key part of the process. His athleticism gives the Panthers a dimension they\u2019ve missed in the backcourt in recent years and he has quickly embraced the up-tempo style Capel is trying to implement.\n\n\u201cHe has an ability to make things happen in the paint,\u201d Troy coach Phil Cunningham said of Johnson. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing offensively really caters to what (he can do). He can do a lot of things.\u201d\n\nJared Wilson-Frame scored 24 points off the bench for Pitt. Kene Chukwuka added a career-high 13 points for the Panthers and Terrell Brown chipped in 12 as Pitt took a quick lead and spent most of the night fending off a series of mini-runs by the Trojans (1-2).\n\nCapel suspended Wilson-Frame for last week\u2019s season opener for a violation of team rules. The Panthers played so capably without Wilson-Frame \u2014 the program\u2019s leading scorer last season \u2014 that Capel opted to keep Wilson-Frame out of the starting lineup upon his return, hoping the versatile senior guard could provide some scoring punch off the bench.\n\nWilson-Frame has responded brilliantly. He scored a team-high 20 points in a victory over Virginia Military Institute last Friday and backed it up by knocking down 9 of 15 shots \u2014 including 6 of 10 3-pointers \u2014 as the Panthers held on.\n\n\u201cI think that he trusts that he\u2019s open and if we do things the right way, the ball will get to him,\u201d Capel said of Wilson-Frame.\n\nJordon Varnado led Troy with 22 points and Alex Hicks added 16 and Troy hung around despite never leading and shooting just 35 percent (22 of 63) from the floor.\n\nThe Trojans have lost two straight, both by single digits on the road against teams from conferences that carry a higher profile than the Sun Belt. Despite the result, Cunningham is impressed with the way his group handled itself.\n\n\u201cFor us this is two of the most physical teams we played all year and we didn\u2019t back down a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think we learned we can play in a physical setting.\u201d\n\nTroy just couldn\u2019t make a big shot when it needed one. The Trojans finished made just 6 of 21 3-pointers.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t an issue for the Panthers. Wilson-Frame knocked down 3-pointers on three consecutive trips midway through the second half as Pitt built a 14-point lead and nursed it the rest of the way.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTroy: The Trojans, picked to finish fourth in the Sun Belt Conference, will be a handful for league opponents. Troy blocked five shots and refused to bail in the second half after Wilson-Frame got hot.\n\nPitt: Rebounding is going to be an issue all season for the undersized Panthers. Troy was able to hang around for so long despite its shooting issues by crashing the offensive glass. Both teams finished with 37 rebounds but the Trojans had 14 offensive boards, which translated to a 16-5 advantage in second-chance points.\n\n\u201cWe have to do a better job rebounding the ball, especially our guards,\u201d Capel said. \u201cWe have to gang rebound.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTroy: host Southern Miss on Thursday.\n\nPitt: Welcomes Central Arkansas on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "", "Secretary of State race in Arizona is now too close to call\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 The race between Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs and Republican businessman Steve Gaynor to be Arizona\u2019s next secretary of state is now too close to call.\n\nThe Associated Press had declared Gaynor the winner on Election Day.

It was an odd stretch for a guy who had improved to a 40 percent 3-point shooter last season and a complementary double-figure scorer, yet he entered this game with just a single free throw in Friday\u2019s win against Elon to his credit.\n\nBut he scored on a layup less than 90 seconds in Monday, then followed with 3 a few minutes later to finally break through.\n\n\u201cIt was a big relief,\u201d Williams admitted, even as he tried to shrug off the frustration.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing anything different to my shot,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I told you guys, it just wasn\u2019t going in.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Indianapolis Colts\u2019 season looked lost in early October.\n\nAt 1-5, they were better positioned for the draft than the playoffs. A defense that showed so much promise in the first three weeks gave up 37 or more points over the next three. Andrew Luck\u2019s short, quick throws created debate over whether his surgically repaired right shoulder was \u2014 or ever would be \u2014 back to full strength.\n\nThree straight wins have changed a lot.\n\nSuddenly, the Colts trail division leader Houston by just two games, have slowly moved back into the wild-card chase, face only one more team with more than five wins at home against Houston (6-3) on Dec. 9. With momentum and hope restored in Indy, there\u2019s no telling how this might end.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good question to ask a perfectionist,\u201d coach Frank Reich said Monday when asked if the offense could play more efficiently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never good enough. But it\u2019s been pretty good. It\u2019s funny how we\u2019re wired in this business. This business can humble you in a second and the moment we think we can throw it out there and score 30 points in a minute is the time we get embarrassed.\u201d\n\nReich\u2019s comments explain why he refused to panic when many things \u2014 including his decision to go for the win in an overtime loss to Houston \u2014 seemed to backfire.\n\nIt\u2019s also the reason he views Sunday\u2019s 29-26 victory over Jacksonville with mixed feelings.\n\nHe was thrilled to see Luck finding open receivers throughout the first half as Indy scored on four its first six possessions and excited to look at a stat sheet that showed the Colts\u2019 defense limited the Jaguars\u2019 usually strong ground game to just 91 yards and 2.7 yards per carry.\n\nStill, he understands Indy (4-5) must continue improving to continue winning.\n\nThe offense only produced two first downs in the second half, preventing the Colts from sealing the victory until finally forcing a fumble after Jacksonville had moved into position for a potentially tying field goal with 90 seconds left in the game. They only got the ball back after a booth review barely beat Jacksonville\u2019s next snap and the replay review overturned the call on the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a mixed bag of emotions,\u201d Luck said after joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only players with six consecutive games of three or more touchdowns in one season. \u201cA win, excited, but also a little bit angry on the mistakes I know that I felt like I made and that our offense made.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of encouraging signs.\n\nLuck has thrown 21 touchdowns and six interceptions in the past six games with a reduced workload on his shoulder. He\u2019s increasingly exploited the mismatches between Indy\u2019s versatile tight ends, hooking up with them on five TD passes over the past two weeks.\n\nPerhaps most important: Indy\u2019s rebuilt offensive line has kept Luck upright.

McDermott opted to start Barkley, despite having just signed with Buffalo on Oct. 30, and a week after Peterman \u2014 starting in place of injured veteran backup Derek Anderson (concussion) \u2014 threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago.\n\nBuffalo considered Peterman to be a project in selecting him with a fifth-round pick in the 2017 draft out of Pittsburgh. He spent his final two seasons at Pitt after transferring from Tennessee.\n\nThis year, the 24-year-old went from winning a three-way offseason quarterback competition, which also included AJ McCarron, to being off the team entirely.\n\nHis starting tenure lasted two series into the third quarter, after which he was pulled in favor of Allen in a season-opening 47-3 loss at Baltimore.\n\nThings unraveled further when Peterman took over after Allen was hurt in the third quarter of a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14. After hitting Zay Jones for a go-ahead touchdown, Peterman closed the game by throwing two interceptions, including one returned for the decisive score in the final two minutes.\n\nHe\u2019s best remembered for throwing five interceptions in the first half of his first career start in a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a little under a year ago.\n\nFollowing the loss, McDermott acknowledged to his players he erred in electing to start Peterman ahead of Tyrod Taylor in a bid to spark an underperforming offense in the midst of a two-game skid.\n\nTaylor reclaimed the starting duties the following week, and closed the season 4-2 in helping Buffalo end a 17-season playoff drought, which had been the longest active streak in North America\u2019s four major professional sports.\n\nOverall, including playoffs, Peterman went 69 of 133 for 563 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nPeterman maintained an upbeat approach despite his struggles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d he said, the week leading up to what proved to be his final start against Chicago. \u201cAnd every time you\u2019re here, every time you step on the field, and you\u2019re in this building, I\u2019m always ready.

A loss is a loss,\u201d Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \u201cWe need to grow from it. It\u2019s only good if we learn something from it and do better. We\u2019ve got to do that.

But its defense must improve starting this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go. We\u2019ve got to take these one week at a time and start piling up some wins.

Gurley rushed for 120 yards on just 16 carries and the Rams averaged 6.5 yards per carry.

That\u2019s the common denominator, the consistency at the line of scrimmage.\u201d\n\nThe Rams are the only team this season to score 30 or more points against the Seahawks, but what was a rarity under Carroll\u2019s regime has become more of an issue in the past two years.\n\nFrom the middle of the 2011 season through the end of the 2016 season, the Seahawks allowed 30 or more points eight times, including none in the 2012 season \u2014 a span of 89 games.\n\nIn the past two seasons, including Sunday\u2019s 36-31 loss to the Rams, the Seahawks have given up 30 or more points seven times in a span of 25 games.\n\nInjuries can be blamed for some of the problems, but clearly the Seahawks defense is far more vulnerable than they\u2019ve been in the past.\n\n\u201cWe gave up too many plays, particularly early. It took us a while to zero in on what we needed to do to stop the running game. I really thought that was the key,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThey did a nice job again.

They enter this week\u2019s home game against Dallas (4-5) two games behind Carolina for the final playoff spot.\n\nAtlanta looked out of sync most of the day. Only in Week 5 in a blowout loss at Pittsburgh did the Falcons play worse, but quarterback Matt Ryan isn\u2019t terribly concerned.\n\n\u201cThere are seven games to go, and we are right in the mix,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cProbably the most important part of being a professional is being able to move on. That includes being able to move on from both positive experiences and negative experiences. We can\u2019t begin to start feeling sorry for ourselves or anything like that.\u201d\n\nCoach Dan Quinn told his team Monday that he was satisfied with its effort against the Browns but not much else. There was a palpable lack of speed as the Falcons fell short of reaching \u201canother spot that you go to, to play really exemplarily ball.\u201d\n\nTrailing 14-10 and getting the ball to begin the third quarter, Atlanta\u2019s next four possessions ended with a fumble, two punts and a failure to score from the 1-yard line early in the fourth when Tevin Coleman was stopped for no gain and Ryan threw an incompletion.\n\nIn between, the Browns scored two touchdowns with Nick Chubb\u2019s 92-yard run, the longest in Cleveland history, one of the most embarrassing plays of the season.\n\nLinebacker Duke Riley froze and got blocked by center JC Tretter while right guard Kevin Zeitler pinned Derrick Shelby back at the line of scrimmage. Chubb dashed through the hole and was too fast to catch after free safety Damontae Kazee dove at his feet and whiffed near the Cleveland 22.\n\nThe Browns\u2019 211 yards rushing were the most Atlanta has allowed since Sept. 28, 2014, at Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the outcome we wanted and worked for but we can\u2019t dwell on it,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe have to move forward like we did with the first couple of losses.\u201d\n\nThe offense suffered a letdown when center Alex Mack sent a shotgun snap over Ryan\u2019s head in the second quarter, causing the Falcons to settle for a field goal. Mohamed Sanu\u2019s lost fumble to begin the third was even worse because he held the ball out to get an extra yard and was still 14 yards shy of the first-down marker.\n\nSix plays later, the Browns were dancing in the end zone.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do our jobs the way we were supposed to,\u201d Sanu said, \u201cand you saw exactly what happened.\u201d\n\nQuinn will challenge his players to create more energy in practice this week.\n\n\u201cI thought over the last couple weeks defensively we knew we had faced some good runners with the Giants and certainly at Washington, and it was going to take that second and third guy jumping over the pile to get there,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought offensively we\u2019ve been hitting it on that stride for a few weeks now.\n\n\u201cSo for us not to find that speed, to create some of the explosive plays and same thing on the defensive side, not to create some of the speeds that create negative plays, those are things that I didn\u2019t think was up to our standard.\u201d\n\nNotes: Quinn said MLB Deion Jones will practice for the second straight week in hopes that he can play against the Cowboys.

(AP) \u2014 In a story Nov. 12 about election results in two California state Senate races, The Associated Press reversed the districts won by the respective Democratic candidates. Assemblywoman Anna Caballero won the open 12th District seat while Melissa Hurtado defeated Republican Sen. Andy Vidak in the neighboring 14th District.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nDemocrats gain veto-proof majority in California Legislature\n\nDemocrats win two Senate seats in California\u2019s Central Valley, gain veto-proof supermajorities in state Legislature\n\nBy DON THOMPSON\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Democrats have won two Republican-held California state Senate seats in the Central Valley, giving the party veto-proof supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature.\n\nVote totals updated since Election Day made winners Monday of Melissa Hurtado and Assemblywoman Anna Caballero.\n\nCaballero won the open 12th District seat while Hurtado defeated Republican Sen. Andy Vidak in the neighboring 14th District. Both are in the Fresno area. Vidak, of Hanford, has held the seat since a special election in 2013.\n\nThe victories give Democrats a two-thirds advantage in the 40-member Senate. The party also has that advantage in the 80-seat Assembly. The party also holds every statewide office, led by Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom.\n\nTwo-thirds majorities allow Democrats to raise taxes, suspend legislative rules and override vetoes without Republican votes.\n\nAll the state Assembly seats and half the Senate seats were up for grabs in the election. Democrats tried to capitalize on California voters\u2019 strong opposition to Republican President Donald Trump and opposed GOP-led efforts to repeal last year\u2019s gas and vehicle tax hikes that annually raise $5 billion to support transportation improvements. The ballot measure failed last week.\n\nTens of thousands of votes remained to be counted after Election Day. As they were tallied, Hurtado and Caballero outpaced their rivals.\n\nHurtado, a Sanger city councilwoman, held an 8,000-vote lead in the district that includes all or parts of Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties.\n\n\u201cDuring the course of the campaign my visits to communities convinced me we need to do more in the district in terms of improving access to health care, creating jobs, and providing children with a meaningful education,\u201d she said in a victory statement. \u201cI promise to work hard on these issues. And as a member of the state Senate, I will stand with other Central Valley legislators to make sure we get our fair share of water.\u201d\n\nVidak conceded Monday. \u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life these past five years to represent my friends and neighbors in the 14th State Senate District,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe 12th District seat is being vacated by Republican Sen. Anthony Cannella, who could not run again because of term limits.\n\nRepublican Madera County Supervisor Rob Poythress conceded his loss and congratulated Caballero. She led by about 6,200 votes in the district that includes all or parts of Fresno, Madera, Merced, Monterey, San Benito and Stanislaus counties.\n\n\u201cWe gave it all and left nothing in the table,\u201d Poythress said in a statement.\n\nCaballero promised to work hard to meet the needs of rural residents on access to health care, education, clean water and clean air, affordable housing, and agricultural production in a Legislature dominated by lawmakers representing urban areas.\n\n\u201cThe outcome tells me the message and vision of our campaign was the right one for rural California and the district\u2019s voters,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe wins give Democrats at least 28 votes in the upper chamber.\n\nDemocrats had been expected to retain their supermajority in the Assembly, particularly after voters in the June primary election chose two Democrats to compete for the seat vacated by incumbent GOP Assemblyman Rocky Chavez in coastal San Diego County.", "", "In this photograph taken Aug. 24, 2018, Rohingya faith healer Abul Kalam, 60, prays at a makeshift mosque in Kutupalong refugee camp, Bangladesh.

And in the case of mental illness, she says, many believe it is a reflection of evil forces and is best countered by a faith healer invoking prayer.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any doctors to prescribe psychotropic drugs. So, they believe in the boidus to overcome their problem,\u201d Saha says.\n\nShe says beliefs in the camps are slowly changing.\n\nAli Nesa has never known what\u2019s wrong with her teenage daughter, who spends her days in the refugee camp lying on the floor of her family\u2019s thatch hut, unable to talk, walk or eat on her own.\n\nNesa says her daughter has been this way since she was 3, when she had epileptic fits for nearly two weeks straight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if her disease is due to an evil spirit or because of difficulty in breathing,\u201d Nesa says. \u201cIf this is because of an evil spirit, then only a boidu can treat her. If it is a breathing problem, then a doctor may be able to help her.\u201d\n\nNesa says none of the many boidus she has visited has been able to help her daughter and she is losing her faith in them. She\u2019s now interested in seeking medical help.\n\nClimate extremes, harsh land and unsanitary conditions make the camps a breeding ground for diseases and mental stress.\n\nThat means there\u2019s plenty of work for doctors. It also means there\u2019s plenty of business for faith healers like Kalam, who says he\u2019s doing Allah\u2019s bidding and isn\u2019t bothered by people who don\u2019t believe in his powers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be worried by what people have to say,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cMaybe the doctor will say what does a boidu know?

He said he intends to expand the committee\u2019s staff to have the capacity to handle the investigations.\n\nGrijalva said he\u2019s particularly troubled by the Montana land deal, which involves a foundation Zinke created and the chairman of Halliburton, a major player in the energy industry that has frequent dealings with Interior.\n\nAt least one of the pending investigations against the Interior secretary has been referred by Interior\u2019s inspector general to the Department of Justice, according to AP sources. That move signaled a potential escalation of the investigations.\n\nZinke said Monday he was not notified of the referral and described communications between federal prosecutors and the inspector general\u2019s office as happening routinely.

She backed legislation increasing penalties against people in the country illegally who commit crimes.\n\nMcSally\u2019s attacks on Sinema reached back more than 15 years, when Sinema was a Green Party spokeswoman and liberal activist.\n\nMcSally backed Trump\u2019s tax cut, border security and the Affordable Care Act repeal agenda as she survived a three-way GOP primary in August, defeating two conservative challengers who claimed her support for Trump was fake. McSally also campaigned on her military record and support for the Armed Forces.\n\nSinema attacked McSally\u2019s leadership of last year\u2019s failed Affordable Care Act repeal effort as a sign that she would not protect Arizona residents with preexisting medical conditions. McSally argued that she would protect patients, despite her vote on the bill that would have removed many of those protections.\n\nThe contest drew more than $90 million in spending, including more than $58 million by outside groups, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Attack ads by both sides clogged the airwaves for months.\n\nSinema, 42, has a law degree, worked as a social worker and was a political activist in her 20s, running as an independent Green Party candidate for the Arizona House. She then became a Democrat and served several terms in the state Legislature. Sinema started as an overt liberal but developed a reputation for compromise among her Republican peers, laying the groundwork to tack to the center.\n\nWhen the 9th Congressional District was created after the 2010 Census, Sinema ran for the Phoenix-area seat as a centrist and won the 2012 election.\n\nMcSally, 52, was the first female Air Force pilot to fly in combat, flying A-10 attack jets. She also was the first woman to command a fighter squadron, again in A-10s.\n\nMcSally lost her first race in Arizona\u2019s 2nd congressional district in 2012, when she was narrowly defeated by Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, who replaced Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt. But McSally came back to win the 2014 election, beating Barber by a narrow margin. She was re-elected in 2016.\n\nThere\u2019s still a chance McSally becomes a senator soon. One of her political mentors, Jon Kyl, was appointed in September to fill John McCain\u2019s seat after Arizona\u2019s senior senator died following a struggle against brain cancer.\n\nKyl said he\u2019d only serve through Jan. 3, which would mean the state\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, would get to select another senator. That person would run for re-election in 2020. Ducey campaigned with McSally often last month.\n\nFlake was an outspoken critic of Trump and announced in 2017 that he would not seek re-election, acknowledging he could not win a GOP primary in the current political climate. His support of the president\u2019s initiatives, however, was mixed. He strongly backed last year\u2019s tax cut bill but criticized Trump\u2019s positions on free trade.", "Power transmission lines crest a hilltop above Camp Creek Road, the point of origin of the Camp Fire, in Pulga, Calif.\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California utilities again are facing severe financial pressures from the possibility that their equipment sparked catastrophic wildfires, including two that are now burning at either end of the state.\n\nThe pressure comes even though Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in September giving utilities some relief beginning next year.\n\nThe law made it easier for utilities to pass along costs from fire-related damages to consumers and also avoid possible bankruptcy from a series of major fires that occurred during the 2017 fire season that produced more than $10 billion in losses.\n\nBut there was a gap in the law: No damages specific to 2018 were included, so utilities face a higher bar to bill customers to cover those costs. And this year already supplanted 2017 as the most destructive in California\u2019s recorded history.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a cause for either of two major blazes burning now, but Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison have reported irregularities with their equipment near the time and place where both ignited.\n\nA woman who owns land near the site where a deadly wildfire started in Northern California said Monday that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sought access to her property just before the blaze started because the utility\u2019s power lines were causing sparks.\n\nPG&E shares have lost more than a third of their value since the Camp Fire broke out northeast of San Francisco, destroying thousands of homes and killing dozens of people as it leveled the town of Paradise.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service said Monday that the \u201cshortcomings\u201d in the legislation reflect negatively on PG&E\u2019s credit rating, which is barely investment grade.\n\n\u201cMoody\u2019s negative outlook incorporates the view that additional financial stress for PG&E is likely,\u201d Moody\u2019s spokesman Joe Mielenhausen said in an email. \u201cGoing forward, we will look for signs of additional legislative and regulatory support for the utility as it works through various legal processes.\u201d\n\nLast week PG&E told state regulators that it detected a problem on an electrical transmission line near the site of the blaze minutes before the fire broke out. The utility later said it observed damage to a transmission tower on the line, and a PG&E spokeswoman said the company will cooperate with any investigations.\n\nBetsy Ann Cowley, a property owner near the site said PG&E sought access to the area before the fire started, telling her power lines were sparking.\n\nSouthern California Edison told regulators there was an outage on an electrical circuit near the site where the Woolsey Fire started in Ventura County. It quickly spread into Malibu and destroyed hundreds of homes.\n\nSoCal Edison said the report was submitted out of an abundance of caution and there was no indication from fire officials that its equipment may have been involved. The report said the fire was reported around 2:24 p.m. Thursday, two minutes after the outage.\n\nShares of parent company Edison International have tumbled more than 20 percent since the fire started.\n\nCalifornia is one of just two states that hold electric companies entirely liable for damage caused by their equipment, even if they followed all safety precautions. The new law makes it easier for them to pass some of those costs along to consumers.\n\nUtilities lobbied aggressively to eliminate that strict liability standard but lawmakers dropped the idea amid pressure from insurers, trial lawyers and fire victims.\n\nInstead, legislators passed a law making it easier for utilities to manage the costs without going bankrupt. They created two mechanisms for investor-owned utilities to shift the costs of wildfire lawsuits onto their customers\u2014 one process that begins in 2019, and another for the 2017 fires.\n\nFor reasons that remain unclear, they law left the rules unchanged for 2018.\n\n\u201cThe priority was on addressing 2017 victims and putting in place some fire-safety measures,\u201d said Paul Payne, a spokesman for Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat and the bill\u2019s author. \u201cThe focus was on making 2017 victims whole.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the Legislature will take up another fight over the 2018 fires, Payne said.\n\nSoCal Edison officials say the Legislature needs to do more to shield utilities from wildfire-related liability.\n\n\u201cSCE believes the state can do more, including enacting fire-smart building codes, particularly in high fire risk areas, and ensuring the proper allocation of risk for the often-tragic consequences of wildfires,\u201d spokeswoman Justina Garcia wrote in an email.\n\nA PG&E spokesman, Paul Doherty, did not respond to questions about the legislation, saying \u201cour entire company is focused on supporting first responders.\u201d\n\nSen. Jerry Hill, a Redwood City Democrat and longtime critic of PG&E, called the report of troubles on PG&E\u2019s lines in the area extremely worrisome.\n\n\u201cAt some point we have to say enough is enough and we have to ask: Should this company be allowed to do business in California?\u201d Hill said. \u201cThese fires take a spark, and at least in the last few years fires have been caused by negligent behavior by PG&E. We need to see how we can hold them responsible, or look at alternative way of doing business.\u201d\n\nHill said he was exploring legislative options to keep a closer check on PG&E, including the possibility of breaking up the utility.\n\n\u201cThey are a monopoly and they act as a monopoly,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThat is a problem when the motive is profit, and that just may not be the right motive for providing utility services.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Garance Burke contributed from San Francisco.", "", "Democrat Kyrsten Sinema defeats Republican Martha McSally in the Arizona race for U.S. Senate", "Oil drops again after Trump tweets against production cuts\n\nOil prices are falling again, this time helped lower by a tweet from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe presidential tweet Monday was in response to news that OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and allies including Russia were signaling willingness to consider production cuts to stem a six-week slide in crude prices.\n\n\u201cHopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production.

(AP Photo/David Banks)\n\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Matt Patricia wants the Detroit Lions to stay the course.\n\nThe Lions have lost three games in a row \u2014 all by double digits \u2014 and are mired in last place. Their most recent defeat was an ugly one. Detroit fell behind 26-0 in the second quarter and eventually lost 34-22 at Chicago on Sunday.\n\nPatricia\u2019s first season as coach has been a disappointment so far, and if he has any easy, quick fixes at his disposal, he wasn\u2019t sharing them in his Monday news conference.\n\n\u201cNo time to feel sorry for ourselves,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cWe have to just keep working and getting better.\u201d\n\nOffensive lineman Taylor Decker sounded a similar refrain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to play better,\u201d Decker said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve just got to perform better. I know that sounds cliche. It\u2019s a simple answer, but it\u2019s not easy to do.\u201d\n\nThe Lions (3-6) lost their first two games of the season, then fought back to a 3-3 mark before this current losing skid. They traded receiver Golden Tate before going on the road to face Minnesota and Chicago, and Detroit never led in either of those games.\n\nThe past two games have been particularly rough from a pass protection standpoint. Detroit allowed 10 sacks against the Vikings and six against the Bears.\n\n\u201cWhatever the situation is, whatever the score is, we have to play better as an offensive line. We have to protect the quarterback,\u201d Decker said. \u201cSix sacks isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to be acceptable, and we know that.\u201d\n\nSo now the Lions are back where they were after those first two losses \u2014 playing catch-up. Only now, they don\u2019t have a long season still in front of them. Detroit\u2019s next three games are at home, but all are against teams with winning records in Carolina, Chicago and the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Lions fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano last week, but Patricia indicated no more staff changes are imminent. He said communication between him and the players is good.\n\n\u201cI think we understand (that) we\u2019re working hard to try to get everything the right way. There\u2019s not a big discussion about it, there\u2019s not a big confrontation or anything like that. I don\u2019t know where any of that really comes from outside the building,\u201d Patricia said.\n\n\u201cInside the building, we\u2019re just trying to get better. We really are just working really hard to make sure we\u2019re doing the right things and trying to find different ways, if we have to, to get those things done.\u201d\n\nDetroit went 9-7 last season and then fired coach Jim Caldwell, so that makes the decline in 2018 even more alarming. Quarterback Matthew Stafford turned 30 earlier this year, and although the Lions traded Tate \u2014 a potential free agent at season\u2019s end \u2014 for a draft pick, this franchise doesn\u2019t seem as if it\u2019s in a rebuilding mode.\n\nThat means the rest of this season is significant. Whether they make the playoffs or not, the Lions need to show some progress \u2014 some reason for fans to trust that this roster and this coach are better than what the team has shown so far.\n\n\u201cI believe in this team and we\u2019re going to work real hard every single day,\u201d Patricia said. \u201cI think the guys in that room, I have a great understanding of what they are and what we\u2019re going to do as a team. We\u2019re not hitting the panic button or anything like that right now. We\u2019re just trying to get better.\u201d\n\nNOTES: P Sam Martin didn\u2019t go into much detail about the medical issue that sent him to the hospital, other than to say he\u2019s fine and will play this coming weekend.
