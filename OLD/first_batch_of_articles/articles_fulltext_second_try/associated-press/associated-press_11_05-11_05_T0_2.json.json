(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)\n\nFrom the Vatican\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square to the Great Synagogue of Sydney, armed guards provide earthly protection for worshippers as they seek out the divine. And still an unexpected noise can send a spasm of fear through a congregation.\n\nThere is a security checkpoint to reach the Western Wall, the holy site of prayer in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City. Shiite pilgrims in Iraq, whether on their way to Basra or performing rituals in Karbala, are surrounded by uniformed soldiers.\n\nSynagogues, mosques, churches and other houses of worship are routinely at risk of attack in many parts of the world. But American worshippers are not immune to the risk of attack that has struck so often in many places.\n\nEleven people died in a Pittsburgh synagogue last month when an anti-Semitic gunman burst inside, raging against Jews. It ranked among the deadliest attacks on Jews in the United States, a country founded on religious tolerance and a spirit of welcome in houses of worship.\n\nIn Iraq, houses of worship have been favorite targets for the warring parties since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, unleashing a widespread violence and a sectarian war. Since then, Iraqis have welcomed the security blanketing mosques, churches and temples.\n\n\u201cI feel comfortable when I see security guards at the mosque gate and their presence brings tranquility while praying,\u201d said Fadhil al-Kinani, a 45-year old owner of a construction materials shop in Baghdad\u2019s eastern district of Sadr City, who performs the five daily prayer services in a nearby mosque.\n\n\u201cI agree that such places must be free of arms, but in the Iraqi context it is a must and I see no harm in their presence since they are stationed outside the mosques given the unpredictable security situation,\u201d said Al-Kinani, a father of four.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the Iraqi context.\n\nIn Denmark, a Jewish security guard protecting the main synagogue was shot to death in 2015 after blocking an Islamic extremist gunman trying to get inside. Guards are routinely posted outside services and rituals for a variety of religions in Afghanistan and Pakistan, yet attackers still find ways to kill.\n\nShiite cleric Mir Hussain Nasiri bemoans the cost ever-more-intrusive security has had on congregations. For most worshippers the peace that they once found in their mosques has been replaced by fear.\n\n\u201cEven the sound of a tea cup dropping and breaking will frighten people. Immediately they think maybe it is an attack,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are metal detectors outside the Coptic Church that Dina Atef frequents, but she\u2019s dubious that they serve much of a purpose.\n\n\u201cWe always get the feeling that anything is bound to happen which makes us think twice before heading there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happens that I shudder at the simplest noise or loud sound when I am praying there,\u201d\n\nBack in the day, the House of the Lord had 212 guards \u2014 or so the Old Testament book of Chronicles says \u2014 \u201ctoward the east, west, north and south.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must feel safe to pray,\u201d said the Rev.

German news agency dpa reported that Maassen assailed in a farewell speech what he described as radical left-wing forces in the Social Democrats, and German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is now considering whether to dismiss him or send him into retirement. (AP Photo/Michael Sohn, file)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Germany\u2019s outgoing domestic intelligence chief won\u2019t be given a new government job after lashing out at one of the governing parties, the interior minister said Monday. It was a late twist to a saga that has contributed to the administration\u2019s unpopularity.\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, part of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition, demanded Hans-Georg Maassen\u2019s removal from the BfV spy agency in September after he appeared to downplay far-right violence against migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.\n\nThe haggling that followed reflected poorly on a coalition already notorious for squabbling. Its leaders first agreed to make Maassen a deputy interior minister, technically a promotion with a pay rise, but renegotiated the deal in the face of a backlash.\n\nThey then agreed to make him a \u201cspecial adviser\u201d to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer.\n\nOn Monday, Seehofer said that he was sending the 55-year-old Maassen into early retirement instead. That was prompted, he said, by the manuscript of a speech in which Maassen used \u201cunacceptable formulations\u201d that made continuing to work with him impossible \u201cin whatever function.\u201d\n\nSeehofer said that Thomas Haldenwang, Maassen\u2019s deputy at the BfV, will take on Maassen\u2019s duties until there is a decision on a permanent successor.\n\nGerman media reported that, in the manuscript of a farewell speech to European counterparts in mid-October, Maassen alleged that \u201cradical left-wing forces\u201d in the Social Democrats wanted to use his comments as an excuse to end a governing coalition they never wanted to join.\n\nHe also said that he was known as a \u201ccritic of idealistic, naive and left-wing policy on foreigners and security.\u201d Seehofer said those remarks \u201ccrossed a line.\u201d\n\nSeehofer, the leader of the conservative Christian Social Union party, had previously defended Maassen. He said he heard about the speech on Friday and was \u201cpersonally disappointed.\u201d\n\nThe saga started with Maassen\u2019s response to violent right-wing protests following the killing of a German man, allegedly by migrants, in Chemnitz. Maassen said his agency had no reliable evidence that foreigners had been \u201chunted\u201d down in the streets \u2014 a term Merkel had used.\n\nA video posted by a left-wing group showed protesters chasing down and attacking a foreigner, but Maassen questioned its authenticity.", "AVONDALE, La.

(Peter Steffen//dpa via AP)\n\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 Less than two weeks after its biggest loss under coach Diego Simeone, Atletico Madrid will get a chance to make amends.\n\nThe Spanish team will host Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday in the Champions League, 13 days after the Bundesliga leaders beat Atletico 4-0 in Germany.\n\nDortmund is unbeaten in 15 competitive games under coach Lucien Favre and can advance from Group A with another victory. An upcoming Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich on Saturday could provide some distraction, however.\n\nThe 4-0 loss on Oct. 24 equaled Atletico\u2019s worst result in the competition, while it was the team\u2019s first four-goal loss in 391 games with Simeone in charge. Despite the result, Atletico can also advance to the knockout stage with a win if Monaco draws with Club Brugge in the earlier group game.\n\nA look at the four Champions League groups on Tuesday:\n\nGROUP A\n\nAtletico is unfamiliar with big losses but can take heart after bouncing back in the past.\n\nThe team twice lost to city rival Real Madrid 3-0 in 2016-17, but responded with three wins and a draw on both occasions, while it claimed four consecutive victories after a 3-0 loss at Villarreal.\n\nAtletico has also only lost once (to Chelsea) in 19 European games at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, and the club hasn\u2019t lost at home to a German team in eight games since a 1-0 defeat to Dortmund in 1996-97. Dortmund went on to win the trophy that season.\n\nMonaco and Club Brugge have only faint hopes of progressing, each with a point from three games so far.\n\nMonaco is a far cry from the side that reached the semifinals in 2017. Radamel Falcao returned from injury to come off the bench in Saturday\u2019s 1-0 loss at Reims, which was a fourth match without a win for Thierry Henry since he took charge.\n\nGROUP B\n\nBarcelona visits Inter Milan with hope that Lionel Messi can return after recovering from a broken arm.\n\nMessi was expected to be out for another week or so, but he recovered well and practiced with the rest of the squad in recent days.\n\nMessi missed Barcelona\u2019s 2-0 home victory over Inter last month. He missed three other matches since breaking his right forearm in a league match against Sevilla.\n\nA win at the San Siro will guarantee that Barcelona advances to the next round as Group B winner. Barcelona has nine points after three matches, three points more than Inter, which can advance with a win if Tottenham and PSV Eindhoven draw in London.\n\nIt\u2019s win-or-bust for Tottenham, which has only one point and must defeat PSV to maintain any realistic chance of reaching the knockout stages.\n\nHopes of doing so rest on Erik Lamela. The Argentine forward has been involved in 11 goals in his last 12 appearances and scored in Saturday\u2019s 3-2 Premier League win at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nGROUP C\n\nParis Saint-Germain may well need goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon at his best against Napoli, considering the form Dries Mertens is in.\n\nThe Belgium forward scored a hat trick in Friday\u2019s 5-1 victory over Empoli and has netted six goals in his past four matches, including one in the 2-2 draw at PSG.\n\nPSG is in third place with four points in Group C and needs to win, but it can also count on considerable firepower of its own in Kylian Mbappe and Neymar. They both scored against Lille on Friday with Mbappe taking his season\u2019s league tally to 11 in only eight games.\n\nPSG coach Thomas Tuchel has a big decision to make on whether to select striker Edinson Cavani against his former club. Cavani is PSG\u2019s all-time leading scorer but has fallen behind Mbappe and Neymar.\n\nGroup leader Liverpool needs to be more ruthless in front of goal at Red Star Belgrade, according to Juergen Klopp. The Liverpool manager was unhappy with his team\u2019s finishing in a 1-1 draw at Arsenal. But he may be worrying for nothing considering Red Star\u2019s defense has conceded 10 goals in three games.\n\nGROUP D\n\nPorto can close in on advancement with a win at home against Lokomotiv Moscow, which has three losses and only one goal scored.\n\nInjured forwards Jefferson Farfan and Fyodor Smolov are back in the Russian team\u2019s squad, though Farfan lasted only 45 minutes in the 3-1 win against Arsenal Tula on Saturday and Smolov was an unused substitute.\n\nPorto has hit form at the right time with five straight wins. The Portuguese champions have outscored opponents 17-3 in that run, which started after a loss to rival Benfica in the league.\n\nSchalke, which is two points behind Porto, hosts Galatasaray in the other group game. The Turkish champions are only a point behind Schalke and can look back on a 3-2 away win over the German team in 2013.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "ANN ARBOR, Mich.

This is what we do not know yet and we will find it out,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the meeting with family members, Tjahjono had said that information downloaded from the jet\u2019s flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the plane\u2019s speed and altitude were erratic after takeoff on its final flight.

Furman told lawyers to publicly file summaries of interviews lawyers conducted with key witnesses in the case.\n\n\u201cPublic access to court documents is particularly important in this case given the public interest in it,\u201d Furman said just before testimony began.\n\nThe first witness \u2014 Duke University Professor D. Sunshine Hillygus \u2014 said there was considerable evidence that adding the question will depress participation by noncitizens.\n\nHillygus, who served six years on the scientific advisory committee for the census, said she has concluded plans by the U.S. government to take steps to prevent damage to the overall count by adding the question are unlikely to be adequate.\n\nThe decision, she said, \u201cviolates the spirit\u201d of guidelines set up to protect the census and \u201cundermines not only the accuracy and completeness of the census ... but the integrity.\u201d\n\nThe trial stems from lawsuits brought by a dozen states and big cities, among others.

(AP Photo/Kathleen Malone-Van Dyke)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 At home, they can beat anybody.\n\nOn the road, the Philadelphia 76ers only beat themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s what they did Sunday night in Brooklyn, committing an NBA season-high 28 turnovers in a 122-97 loss. A team that was expected to be among the Eastern Conference contenders is only 6-5, and the 76ers are 0-5 outside Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cWe are not, right now, at this present moment, amongst the royalty in the East and we understand that,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a badge that we want. It\u2019s in us. But at this moment, after 11 games, that\u2019s not where we are. And that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cThis group does have fight, this group does have pride and we will find a way to move on, move up, move forward and that\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nThe 76ers were routed at Toronto, Milwaukee and Boston, but those are three of the top teams in the conference. The loss in Brooklyn, their most lopsided of the season, was such a pitiful performance \u2014 Brown called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d\u2014 that the coach made sure to stress that it was an outlier for his team.\n\nThe 76ers handed the Nets 39 points off their miscues, which contributed to Brooklyn\u2019s whopping 40 more shot attempts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Golden State. We shouldn\u2019t lose a game to Brooklyn by that many points,\u201d said Joel Embiid, who finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds but got only eight shots and was pulled midway through the fourth quarter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nBrown knows the Sixers have to change their ways to have any success away from home.\n\n\u201cTo win on the road, you better not turn it over at the rate that we\u2019ve been turning it over. You better have an incredible focus on rebounding,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHistorically, like, those are the tenants of road wins.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that togetherness, that toughness, the ability to take punches and still come out on the other side, that is part of growth. We don\u2019t have that right now.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia was 22-19 on the road last season, when it won its last 16 games overall and went 52-30 before reaching the second round of the playoffs behind Embiid and Ben Simmons.\n\nThat strong finish has been followed by a shaky start, and players agreed with Brown\u2019s tough talk about their effort Sunday. But he insisted afterward the 76ers wouldn\u2019t overreact and would move on.\n\nThey\u2019ll try to do that Wednesday at Indiana, another team ahead of the 76ers in the East. A victory smooths out a rough road that\u2019s left them puzzled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d Simmons said, \u201cbut I think we just need to step it up.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas (13) scores on a 72 yard touchdown reception in the second half of an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Rams in New Orleans, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018.

These two in the NFC are joined by the AFC troika of the Kansas City Chiefs (8-1) and sudden superstar Patrick Mahomes, the New England Patriots (7-2) and the Los Angeles Chargers (6-2). Worth mentioning: KC\u2019s only loss came against the Patriots; the Chargers\u2019 two setbacks came against the conference-leading Chiefs and Rams.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to the moment that got everyone talking.\n\nPrescient as can be, Thomas said he\u2019d prepared one old-fashioned phone of the sort Horne used in each end zone.\n\nKind of cocky? Sure. But also justifiable, considering that Thomas is now up to 70 catches for 880 yards and five scores, quickly establishing his pairing with Drew Brees among the most dangerous QB-WR tandems in the league.\n\nOf course, Thomas drew a flag assessed on the ensuing kickoff.\n\n\u201cThis is too big of a game to be risking those kinds of yards,\u201d intoned announcer Troy Aikman on the Fox broadcast.\n\nEven Deion Sanders, of all people, said on the NFL Network he thought Thomas made a mistake. That\u2019s because while the rules allow \u2014 as they should \u2014 the sort of choreography the Seattle Seahawks come up with week after week, what Thomas did is penalized because he used a prop.\n\nNow THAT\u2019S a terrible call.\n\nIn case you missed it, here are other top topics after the NFL season\u2019s ninth Sunday:\n\nBRADY VS. RODGERS WITH A TWIST\n\nCount on Bill Belichick to dream up something to remind everyone that he\u2019s as creative a coach as there is. The pregame focus was entirely on Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers \u2014 and which QB is really the greatest of all time \u2014 before New England\u2019s 31-17 victory over Green Bay. So, naturally, missing Rob Gronkowski and Sony Michel to injuries, Belichick figured out ways for somebody other than TB12 to shine. Kick returner Cordarelle Patterson is suddenly a running back, gaining 61 yards on 11 carries with a TD, and the go-ahead touchdown was set up by a 37-yard completion \u2014 thrown not by Brady, but by receiver Julian Edelman .\n\nCAN HE KICK IT?\n\nWell, um, no. Not very well. Not lately, anyway. And now he\u2019s out of a job. Caleb Sturgis had a pair of errant extra points and also flubbed a 42-yard field-goal try, but none of that mattered to the outcome, because LA defeated the Seattle Seahawks 25-17. Still, not surprisingly, the Chargers released Sturgis, who blew a PAT and a FG in three consecutive games, a trio of trip-ups no NFL kicker had managed to pull off since Jim Breech of the Raiders in 1979. Overall this season, Sturgis missed 10 kicks \u2014 yes, 10! \u2014 and went 9 for 15 on extra points and 9 for 13 on field-goal attempts.\n\nJULIO\u2019S IN THE END ZONE\n\nHard to believe, given just how good he is, but 12 games and nearly a full calendar year had passed without Falcons wideout Julio Jones scoring a TD until he took a short pass from Matt Ryan and took it 35 yards during Atlanta\u2019s 38-14 win at the Washington Redskins. If there were any questions about what Jones means to his teammates, it was clear when dozens came streaming off the sideline to surround him for congratulations in the end zone. \u201cWe were all fired up,\u201d Ryan said, \u201cfor him to get in there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Brett Martel in New Orleans contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, left, passes under pressure from Green Bay Packers outside linebacker Nick Perry (53) during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Foxborough, Mass. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nTom Brady didn\u2019t have to beat Aaron Rodgers in only their second head-to-head matchup to prove he\u2019s the best quarterback of all time.\n\nThe GOAT did it, anyway.\n\nBrady threw for 294 yards and one touchdown to lead the New England Patriots to a 31-17 victory over Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night.\n\nRodgers had 259 yards passing and two TDs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a vintage performance for either quarterback. Brady tossed six straight incomplete passes at one point, and he couldn\u2019t get the Patriots in the end zone on four tries from the 1 with the score tied in the third quarter. Still, he posted a passer rating of 99.0 on a night when he didn\u2019t have star tight end Rob Gronkowski and leading rusher Sony Michel.\n\nThe game was billed as the most talented QB vs. the most accomplished QB. Some considered that statement a slight against Brady. It\u2019s not. Rodgers is immensely gifted with a strong, accurate arm and scrambling ability. He makes plays with his legs that Brady can\u2019t. He makes throws few players ever could make, whether he\u2019s on the run like the 24-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling on a third-and-1 late in the third quarter, or if he\u2019s flat-footed, falling down, throwing across his body or heaving desperation passes into the end zone.\n\nBrady has a different style. He\u2019s a drop-back passer with underrated pocket mobility and perfect mechanics, and he simply outsmarts everyone else on the field. He fooled a pair of defenders with his eyes by looking as if he was throwing a screen pass and instead fired deep for a 55-yard TD pass to Josh Gordon to seal the win.\n\nBut John Elway and Steve Young also belong in the \u201cmost talented\u201d conversation, so it\u2019s not even a slam dunk that title belongs to Rodgers. Michael Vick wasn\u2019t nearly as well-rounded, but he could throw a 70-yard touchdown pass with a simple flick of his left wrist or he could sprint 70 yards for a score at any point in a game. He has a case for the \u201cmost talented\u201d debate if it\u2019s based purely on physical skills. It won\u2019t be long before Patrick Mahomes has to be considered, too.\n\nHowever, the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d argument ended when Brady rallied the Patriots from a 28-3 third-quarter deficit against the Falcons to win his fifth Super Bowl title on Feb. 5, 2017.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got five championships,\u201d Rodgers said earlier in the week when asked the GOAT question. \u201cI think that ends most discussions.\u201d\n\nRodgers is one of the best to play the game and he may be the \u201cmost talented,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t belong in the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d conversation. It\u2019s Brady. Then Joe Montana. Peyton Manning deserves a mention. So does Drew Brees.\n\nBrady has eight Super Bowl appearances. He won his third regular-season MVP award last year at age 40 and he has four Super Bowl MVP awards in his trophy case. He\u2019s still at the top of his game at 41, seven years older than Rodgers.\n\nOver 19 seasons, Brady has set numerous records and he notched another milestone against the Packers when he surpassed Manning for the most combination passing, rushing and receiving yards in the regular-season and playoffs.\n\nSo while the Sunday Night Football crew enjoyed hyping the matchup and even got Michael Jordan involved by having the six-time NBA champion record a promo saying \u201cthe best way to settle this debate is to play it out head to head,\u201d Brady already earned the title way before helping New England (7-2) to its sixth straight win.\n\nBrady is the greatest quarterback of all time and he\u2019s still proving it every week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry (30) shoots over Minnesota Timberwolves' Gorgui Dieng (5) during the second half of an NBA basketball game Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Oakland, Calif.

The NBA is on pace this season to make about 27,300 shots from 3-point land.\n\nNow, not even three full weeks into this season, five teams have broken their own franchise record for 3s in a game. The most recent entry into that club was Milwaukee, which connected on 22 3s \u2014 on 56 tries, as opposed to 39 from inside the arc \u2014 in its 144-109 win over Sacramento on Sunday. The Bucks used 13 players, with everyone trying at least one shot from 3-point range and 11 connecting on at least one triple.\n\nIt was the second time this season the Bucks tried more 3s than 2s.\n\nNumber of times in Bucks history that happened before this season? Zero.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just hopefully keep pushing that record, whatever it is,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cSee if we can get more. ... Good for us to know that we\u2019re pushing that envelope and we want to be great behind that 3-point line.\u201d\n\nThe Bucks aren\u2019t alone in their quest for 3-point greatness.\n\nBoston, which has had 3-point stars like Larry Bird, Paul Pierce, Antoine Walker and Allen in its rich history, made a team-record 24 3-pointers last week against the Bucks. The Celtics came into this season with 19 3s in a game being their franchise mark; they\u2019ve made 19 or more twice already this season.\n\n\u201cWe took what the defense gave us,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the barrage of 24 3s.\n\nFueled by Thompson\u2019s 14 3s in Chicago, the Warriors set a team record that night with 24 makes from deep. Atlanta set a team mark with 22 3-pointers against Cleveland, and Utah connected on its record of 19 in a loss to Golden State.\n\n\u201cThis is the NBA right now,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nCurry is shooting more 3s per game than ever, making more 3s per game than ever \u2014 and doing it more accurately than ever. He\u2019s already made 59 3s through the Warriors\u2019 first 10 games, and is shooting 51 percent from deep.\n\nCurry is fifth all-time in 3-pointers made with 2,188. Allen is the record-holder with 2,973, a mark Curry is on pace to get in about two years.\n\nMUST GET 100\n\nIn this NBA, if a team doesn\u2019t score 100 points, they\u2019re not winning.\n\nThen again, getting to 100 doesn\u2019t guarantee anything either.\n\nTeams that score 100 points or more are 134-99 this season, meaning they win 57.5 percent of the time. Those who don\u2019t score 100 are 5-40, or winning 11.1 percent of the time.\n\nThat\u2019s a big change from recent years.\n\nLast season, teams over 100 won 62.2 percent of the time, and teams that didn\u2019t score 100 won 20.8 percent of the time. A decade ago, those scoring 100 won at a 69.4 percent clip, and those not reaching the century mark won 30.8 percent of the time.\n\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\n\nA six-pack of games to watch this week ...\n\n\u2014 Minnesota at L.A.

The Voice. Delgado, a Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School graduate, said his opponent, Rep. John Faso, was using racial attacks to alienate him, a black first-time candidate in a district that is more than 90 percent white. Voters there are evenly split among Democrats, Republicans and independents, and went twice for Obama but favored Trump.\n\nAnd in the Buffalo-area\u2019s 22nd District, first-term Rep. Claudia Tenney, an early Trump supporter, is drawing comparisons to the president by brashly suggesting some people who commit mass murders are Democrats and promoting a petition to lock up Clinton. But in a close race against Democrat Anthony Brindisi, she\u2019s shifted to a softer tone of bipartisanship. Brindisi, a state assemblyman, argues that Tenney\u2019s hyper-partisan approach undermines her claim of working across the aisle.

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last week he was confident after a meeting with Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo the free trade deal between Australia, a nation of 25 million people, and Indonesia, a near-neighbor with more than 260 million people, would be signed within weeks.\n\nBut Turnbull also warned the government to expect a negative reaction from Muslim-majority Indonesia if Australia follows the United States by shifting its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Over the past year, thousands of residents have been evicted and their property razed to make way for the multimillion-dollar project that promises to be the new commercial center for the capital.\n\nMarota City, as Syria\u2019s largest investment project is known, is seen as setting the blueprint for how the government will undertake the ambitious rebuilding of areas devastated in the nearly eight-year civil war.\n\nThe government is using controversial new property laws to create zones where partnerships of the government and businessmen take ownership of neighborhoods and redevelop them. Officials say the projects aim at re-planning slums and destroyed areas and attracting private investors to join the massively expensive task of reconstruction.\n\nCritics say President Bashar Assad is using such projects to consolidate post-war power, expropriate property and reshape Syria\u2019s demographics by pushing out impoverished communities seen as centers of opposition support and replacing them with wealthier ones more likely to be loyalists.\n\nThe 53-year old president has survived the war, using help from allies Russia and Iran to crush an armed rebellion that aimed to oust him.\n\nThe Marota project lies at the heart of Syria\u2019s tangled web of politics and rebuilding. Having recaptured the country\u2019s key cities from the opposition, the government says it is now time to focus on rebuilding. But Western countries, including the United States, say they will not commit any funds to reconstruction without real progress on a political settlement.\n\nThe plan for upscale apartments and glossy malls in Damascus can seem particularly jarring with the enormous destruction in former rebel-held areas just a few miles away and in the rest of the country, where entire city blocks lie crumped, in scenes reminiscent of World War II.\n\nMarota is being built over a southwestern neighborhood called Basateen al-Razi that grew up on farmlands over the past decades as poorer Syrians moved in from the countryside and built unlicensed housing. The district saw anti-government protests in 2012, but they were swiftly suppressed in a crackdown, and the area was relatively untouched by the war\u2019s destruction.\n\nThe project was approved in 2012 with a legislative law known as Decree No. 66, which authorized the government to redevelop slum dwellings and illegal housing areas in the capital.\n\nThis allowed the Damascus governorate to evict the population, which has largely dispersed to other, inexpensive parts of the capital, and level the district.\n\nThe project is managed chiefly by the Syrian government, under a joint-stock company called Cham Holding established in 2016 and owned by the Damascus governorate. It has attracted investments from businessmen known to have close ties to the Syrian leadership, including Samer Foz, a wealthy entrepreneur whose name became well known during the war and who recently bought majority shares in the landmark Four Seasons hotel in the capital. The company is also said to be linked to Rami Makhlouf, Assad\u2019s cousin and one of Syria\u2019s most powerful businessmen.\n\n\u201cI expect the commercial center to shift here,\u201d says Nasouh Nabolsi, chief executive officer for Damascus Cham holding, the company undertaking the management, construction and investment works.\n\nSpeaking to The Associated Press at the company\u2019s stylish headquarters adjacent to the building site, he said the company has so far spent the equivalent of $70 million on infrastructural works for the 2.14 million square meter development. Construction is expected to begin before the end of the year. The project will provide 12,000 housing units for an estimated 60,000 residents.\n\nMarota will be followed by a similar project further south on an area four times bigger, called Basilia City, Nabolsi said, adding that plans to develop these areas existed before the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011.\n\nIn April, the government passed controversial property Law No. 10, which expanded the geographic scope of decree 66 beyond Damascus to the rest of the country and extended it from informal settlements to regularly registered property.\n\nUnder Law 10, residents initially had just 30 days to prove that they own property in redevelopment zones in order to receive shares in the projects or alternative plots of land; otherwise, ownership will be transferred to the local government.\n\nThe law created panic among refugees abroad, many of whom had lost property deeds or could not return to prove ownership. After an international outcry, Syria\u2019s foreign minister announced in June that the 30-day filing period would be extended to a year. Last month, a U.N. official said Syria\u2019s government has withdrawn the law, citing Russia for the information.\n\nHowever, there is no sign that the law has been formally amended or confirmation that it has been withdrawn.\n\nAt least four former-rebel held areas in and around the capital are now being considered for redevelopment under Law 10. They include Barzeh, Jobar, Daraya and Qaboun, where major demolitions are already underway, according to a Human Rights Watch investigation.\n\nSara Kayyali, Syria researcher at HRW, said the fact that the designated areas are all former rebel-held bastions and the lack of transparency around the property laws only exacerbates suspicions.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s urban planning laws are often used to confiscate the property of residents, leave them without any alternative housing and never provide them with compensation, so violating their property rights on more than one level,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nA resident of Damascus\u2019 Mazzeh neighborhood whose family owns property in nearby Basateen al-Razi and closely follows the subject said the new property laws were not necessarily a bad thing, but the implementation gives the impression that the government is driving out poor residents and attracting the rich.\n\nShe said demolitions started without the provision of alternative housing, and rental money offered was often insufficient to rent within Damascus. She spoke on condition of anonymity for security concerns.\n\nNabolsi rejects the claims and argues that everyone has been more than fairly compensated.\n\nHe said there is nothing wrong with developing society, adding that the Syrian crisis was fueled by poor people who were exploited.\n\n\u201cThe mistake of the government is that it did not develop these areas and let them transform into illegal housing areas, and we paid a high price for this.\u201d\n\nKayyali said there is concern that the laws will be used as a form of \u201ccollective punishment\u201d against government opponents and dispossess the poor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to exacerbate the socio-economic imbalance that was actually one of the causes of the uprising,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Hiba Dlewati in Beirut and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria, contributed to this report.", "", "", "For 2nd straight week, Packers not good enough vs NFL\u2019s best\n\nGreen Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones (33) tries to run past New England Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower (54) during the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Foxborough, Mass.

(AP) \u2014 Green Bay had the ball in field goal range, on the cusp of breaking a fourth-quarter tie, when Patriots lineman Lawrence Guy knocked the ball out of Aaron Jones\u2019 grasp .\n\nInstead of taking their first lead of the game, the Packers watched the Patriots march to back-to-back scores and put away a 31-17 victory on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a big play in the game,\u201d Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cThat was a turning point.\u201d\n\nOne week after fumbling away a late chance to defeat the then-unbeaten Los Angeles Rams, the Packers blew another fourth-quarter opportunity against the defending AFC champions, and Tom Brady \u2014 with some passing help from receiver Julian Edelman \u2014 led the Patriots to their sixth straight win.\n\n\u201cJonesy\u2019s had a really nice year for us, so that one play obviously doesn\u2019t lose the game,\u201d quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \u201cBut it\u2019s plays like that \u2014 by all of us, myself included \u2014 that have just hindered us from finishing games out.\u201d\n\nIn just the second matchup ever between Brady, a three-time NFL MVP, and Rodgers, who has won the award twice, Green Bay (3-4-1) played the Patriots even for 45 minutes before Jones\u2019 fumble stalled their best chance to take the lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening in the worst times,\u201d said Rodgers, who completed 24 of 43 passes for 259 yards and two touchdowns. \u201cWhen we have to play our best in those crunch times, we haven\u2019t been playing our best.\u201d\n\nBrady completed four passes in a row before tossing it back to Edelman, who threw across the field to James White. The Patriots running back scampered for most of the 37 yards to the 2; he ran it in from the 1 for his second score of the game.\n\nThe Packers failed to get a first down, then Brady hit Josh Gordon inside the 40; he shook off cornerback Tramon Williams before dashing into the end zone.\n\nLast week, the Rams kicked a field goal to take a 29-27 lead with 2:05 to play. But Packers kickoff returner Ty Montgomery brought the ball out of the end zone and fumbled, costing Rodgers a chance for a game-winning drive.\n\nAgainst New England, the Packers also settled for a field goal in the first quarter after a delay of game penalty at the 9.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hurting ourselves with negative yardage plays and missed throws and turnovers at the wrong time,\u201d Rodgers said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In the final days before pivotal midterm elections, President Donald Trump is painting a distorted picture of immigration while exaggerating his record of achieving economic gains for non-whites and improving health care for veterans.\n\nHe insists that Republicans will be able to attract the non-white vote in Tuesday\u2019s elections because he\u2019s achieved \u201cthe best median income numbers for all of these groups.\u201d In fact, incomes for African-Americans and Asian-Americans reached their highest levels prior to his administration.\n\nOn immigration, Trump inflates the number of foreigners living in the U.S. illegally and misrepresents Democratic legislation in the Senate as promoting \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on health care, Trump falsely suggests that Democrats would seek to destroy Medicare if they take control of Congress and overstates improvements he made to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nA look at his campaign rhetoric and the reality:\n\n___\n\nMEDICARE\n\nTRUMP: \u201cThe Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare.\u201d \u2014 Florida rally Saturday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s incorrect that Democrats would seek to \u201cobliterate Medicare.\u201d Trump appears to be referring to Democratic proposals to provide \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d but the options that allow younger people to buy into a Medicare-like plan don\u2019t involve overhauling the current program.\n\nThe plan by Sen.

More broadly, he exaggerates VA improvements under his watch by suggesting the newly expanded program will have immediate effect.\n\nCongress first approved the Veterans Choice program in 2014 during the Obama administration in the wake of a scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center in which some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility.\n\nTrump signed legislation in June to expand the Choice program by giving veterans even wider access to private-sector doctors at government expense, subject to yet-to-be-completed rules that will determine eligibility as well as available money. The VA has yet to resolve long-term financing due to congressional budget caps that could put funding for VA or other domestic programs at risk next year.\n\nKey to the program\u2019s success is an overhaul of the VA\u2019s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians, expected to take up to 10 years.

More important, there are multiple signs that the racial wealth gap is now worsening even as unemployment rates have come down.\n\nAs to Asian-Americans, the median income for a typical household last year was $81,331.

Dianne Feinstein of California is sponsoring a bill that has the support of every Democratic senator including Tester. The bill\u2019s aim is to stop the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy of criminally prosecuting all adults caught crossing the border illegally and putting their children under Department of Health and Human Services custody and care.\n\nThe bill seeks to limit family separations by barring federal agents and officers from removing a child from a parent within 100 miles of U.S. borders. Exceptions would apply in cases where a child is danger of trafficking or abuse or neglect, or when there is a strong likelihood the adult is not the parent.\n\nWhile Trump asserts that the bill would spur \u201copen borders\u201d and change immigration law, nothing in the legislation would prohibit the removal or detention of immigrants who arrive in the U.S. illegally if the families are kept together.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on the practice of allowing immigrants caught crossing the border illegally to stay in U.S. communities as they await immigration hearings: \u201cWe\u2019re not doing releases. What\u2019s been happening over years is they would come in, release them, and they would never show up for their trial. And we now have 25 or 30 million people in this country illegally, because of what\u2019s been happening over many years.\u201d \u2014 remarks Wednesday to reporters.\n\nTHE FACTS: It\u2019s nowhere close to 25 million to 30 million, nor has the number increased much in recent years.\n\nThe nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 11.3 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. That number is basically unchanged from 2009. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.\n\nThe number of such immigrants had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining due in part to a weakening U.S. economy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP, on tweeting a video blaming Democrats allowing a man to enter the U.S. who killed two police officers: \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is just telling the truth.\u201d \u2014 speaking to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: The video he spread around does not tell the truth. It says Democrats let Luis Bracamontes into the country and \u201clet him stay.\u201d\n\nBracamontes entered the U.S. illegally, in 1996, during the Democratic administration of President Bill Clinton, but he was also deported by that administration the next year after being caught buying crack cocaine and serving his sentence. He returned repeatedly. By the time he was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings of the police officers, he had been deported four times, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones.\n\nNo evidence of leniency by Democrats has emerged in the episode. Democratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year and no administration, Trump\u2019s included, has caught everyone trying to enter illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP on what U.S. troops should do if encountering migrants who are trying to get to the border from Mexico: \u201cI didn\u2019t say shoot, I didn\u2019t say shoot.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A day earlier, he said of the migrants: \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe procession has been largely peaceful. Some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but he signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s given no evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals \u2014 after acknowledging at one point that there is no such proof.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them. The Homeland Security Department issued a sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t. ... Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d \u2014 interview published Tuesday with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Scholars widely pan the idea that Trump could unilaterally change the rules on who is a citizen. It\u2019s highly questionable whether an act of Congress could do it, either, though it is conceivable that legislators could change the rules regarding children born in the U.S. of parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nPeter Schuck is perhaps the most prominent advocate of the idea that birthright citizenship is not conveyed by the Constitution to children of parents who are living illegally in the U.S. Even he says \u201cTrump clearly cannot act by\u201d executive order.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that no competent lawyer would advise him otherwise,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cThis is just pre-election politics and misrepresentation and should be sharply criticized as such.\u201d\n\nSchuck, of Yale, and colleague Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania have argued since the mid-1980s that Congress can set the rules for providing citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who came illegally.\n\nBut most scholars on the left and right share the view that it would take a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nJames Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in the Green Bag legal journal in 2006 that birthright citizenship \u201cis protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell university immigration expert, said the case against Trump\u2019s authority is \u201cnot open and shut, but the better view is it would require a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was part of the post-Civil War amendments that enshrined the rights of African-Americans. The citizenship clause, in particular, was intended to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857 that held African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled squarely about the clause\u2019s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump did not make a distinction between legal and illegal status in his remarks. An 1898 Supreme Court decision held that the U.S.-born son of legal Chinese immigrants was a citizen under the 14th Amendment; a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference for children of foreign-born parents whether they are in the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied, according to the World Atlas and other sources. Most are in the Americas. Canada and Mexico are among them. Most other countries confer citizenship based on that of at least one parent \u2014 jus sanguinis, or \u201cright of blood\u201d \u2014 or have a modified form of birthright citizenship that may restrict automatic citizenship to children of parents who are on their territory legally.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s view that U.S.-born children of foreigners live a lifetime of taking \u201call those benefits\u201d ignores the taxes they pay, the work they do and their other contributions to society.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: Trump \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d \u2014 press briefing on Oct. 29\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did not earn a majority of votes in the 2016 election.

Democratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year and no administration, Trump\u2019s included, has caught everyone trying to enter illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP on what U.S. troops should do if encountering migrants who are trying to get to the border from Mexico: \u201cI didn\u2019t say shoot, I didn\u2019t say shoot.\u201d \u2014 remarks to reporters Friday.\n\nTHE FACTS: A day earlier, he said of the migrants: \u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them, consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe procession has been largely peaceful. Some migrants in one caravan clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cPresident Obama separated the children from parents and nobody complained. When we continued the exact same law, the country went crazy.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: Actually, Obama did not do the same thing as a matter of policy.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true the underlying laws were the same, the Trump administration mandated anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted. That policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, and their children were separated and sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied migrant children. Trump\u2019s zero tolerance policy remains in effect, but he signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.\n\nJeh Johnson, Obama\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, recently told NPR there may have been unusual or emergency circumstances when children were taken from parents, but there was no such policy.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cAt this very moment, large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. ...These are tough people in many cases; a lot of young men, strong men and a lot of men that maybe we don\u2019t want in our country. ...This isn\u2019t an innocent group of people. It\u2019s a large number of people that are tough. They have injured, they have attacked.\u201d \u2014 immigration speech Thursday.\n\nTHE FACTS: He\u2019s given no evidence that people in the caravans are, by and large, dangerous, hardened criminals \u2014 after acknowledging at one point that there is no such proof.\n\nThe migrants in the caravans are mostly from Honduras, where it started, as well as El Salvador and Guatemala. Overall, they are poor, carrying the belongings that fit into a knapsack and fleeing gang violence or poverty.\n\nIt might be true there are some criminals mixed in with the throngs, given the sheer number of migrants. Trump did not substantiate his claim that members of the MS-13 gang, in particular, are among them. The Homeland Security Department issued a sheet stating that \u201cover 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership.\u201d But it did not specify how it had arrived at that number.\n\nSome migrants in one of the caravans clashed with Mexican police at the Mexico-Guatemala border, hurling stones and other objects as they tried to cross the international bridge. One migrant died; it\u2019s not clear how it happened. Caravan leaders said they had expelled a number of troublemakers from the procession, exhibiting some self-policing. Ultimately, most entered Guatemala \u2014 and later, Mexico \u2014 by illegally bypassing immigration checkpoints.\n\nThe caravan otherwise has been overwhelmingly peaceful, receiving applause and donated food from residents of the towns they pass. Mexican police have not tried again to stop them.\n\n___\n\nBIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP\n\nTRUMP: \u201cIt was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don\u2019t. ... Well, you can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they\u2019re saying I can do it just with an executive order.\u201d \u2014 interview published Tuesday with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Scholars widely pan the idea that Trump could unilaterally change the rules on who is a citizen. It\u2019s highly questionable whether an act of Congress could do it, either, though it is conceivable that legislators could change the rules regarding children born in the U.S. of parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nPeter Schuck is perhaps the most prominent advocate of the idea that birthright citizenship is not conveyed by the Constitution to children of parents who are living illegally in the U.S. Even he says \u201cTrump clearly cannot act by\u201d executive order.\n\n\u201cI feel confident that no competent lawyer would advise him otherwise,\u201d he said by email Tuesday. \u201cThis is just pre-election politics and misrepresentation and should be sharply criticized as such.\u201d\n\nSchuck, of Yale, and colleague Rogers Smith of the University of Pennsylvania have argued since the mid-1980s that Congress can set the rules for providing citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who came illegally.\n\nBut most scholars on the left and right share the view that it would take a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally.\n\nJames Ho, a conservative Trump-appointed federal appeals court judge, wrote in the Green Bag legal journal in 2006 that birthright citizenship \u201cis protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of Mayflower passengers.\u201d\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a Cornell university immigration expert, said the case against Trump\u2019s authority is \u201cnot open and shut, but the better view is it would require a constitutional amendment.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s citizenship clause was part of the post-Civil War amendments that enshrined the rights of African-Americans. The citizenship clause, in particular, was intended to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s notorious Dred Scott decision of 1857 that held African-Americans were not citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never ruled squarely about the clause\u2019s application to children of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump did not make a distinction between legal and illegal status in his remarks. An 1898 Supreme Court decision held that the U.S.-born son of legal Chinese immigrants was a citizen under the 14th Amendment; a footnote in a 1982 decision suggests there should be no difference for children of foreign-born parents whether they are in the U.S. legally or illegally.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201d \u2014 interview with \u201cAxios on HBO.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: That\u2019s wrong.\n\nThe U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship \u2014 the principle of jus soli or \u201cright of the soil\u201d \u2014 is applied, according to the World Atlas and other sources. Most are in the Americas. Canada and Mexico are among them. Most other countries confer citizenship based on that of at least one parent \u2014 jus sanguinis, or \u201cright of blood\u201d \u2014 or have a modified form of birthright citizenship that may restrict automatic citizenship to children of parents who are on their territory legally.\n\nMore broadly, Trump\u2019s view that U.S.-born children of foreigners live a lifetime of taking \u201call those benefits\u201d ignores the taxes they pay, the work they do and their other contributions to society.\n\n___\n\n2016 ELECTION\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White House press secretary: Trump \u201cgot elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted.\u201d \u2014 press briefing on Oct. 29\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump did not earn a majority of votes in the 2016 election. He did win the Electoral College, allowing him to capture the presidency.\n\nTrump won nearly 63 million votes compared with more than 65 million for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who racked up lopsided victories in big states such as New York and California, according to election data compiled by The Associated Press. But she lost the presidency due to Trump\u2019s winning margin in the Electoral College, which came after he narrowly won less populous Midwestern states including Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, Colleen Long and Mark Sherman in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd\n\nFollow @APFactCheck on Twitter: https://twitter.com/APFactCheck", "", "", "PRATTVILLE, Ala.

(AP) \u2014 Brayden Mager wasn\u2019t feeling well when Sami Farrell, Emma Malcom, Lily Petersen and Jace Poelstra came to visit him at Sanford Children\u2019s Hospital in early September.\n\nBut you wouldn\u2019t have known it that afternoon.\n\nThe infectiously cheerful 12-year-old, who was awaiting a heart transplant at the time, was all smiles when the four captains of the Harrisburg soccer team entered the room. He proudly sported maroon pants in honor of his favorite team.\n\n\u201cWe all went in thinking he might not be super willing to see us,\u201d said Poelstra, a senior defender for the Tigers. \u201cBut when we got there, he was extremely happy. He was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh. They\u2019re here!\u2019\u201d\n\nKnowing his love for superheroes, the girls brought Brayden new toys and a hat \u2014 which he wore for the entire visit. He felt special that the \u201cbig girls\u201d were taking time for him, Brayden\u2019s mother, Lyndsey Mager, said.\n\nA week after the girls\u2019 visit, Brayden passed away.\n\nHis final days were brightened by the support of Harrisburg\u2019s players and coach, who rallied around him and brought him closer to the game he loved.\n\n\u201cWe got to see someone who we honored at one of our games who wasn\u2019t able to be there with us,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe has really inspired us this whole season.\u201d\n\nHarrisburg coach Desiree Parmenter connected her team with Brayden as part of a season-long outreach that hits close to home, and the message is catching on.\n\n\u201cDez is really focused on things outside of soccer, because we\u2019re not going to be playing soccer for all of our lives,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to carry on the lessons that we\u2019ve learned throughout our high school careers for the rest of our lives.\u201d\n\nInspired by her son Jaiden who has cerebral palsy, Parmenter introduced a \u201cPlayers of the Game\u201d program at the beginning of the season, the Argus Leader reported.\n\nUnderstanding how significant it is for her son to be recognized, the coach organized the pregame ceremony as a way to give special needs students who are passionate about soccer an opportunity to experience the moment of walking onto the field before a game.\n\n\u201cMy goal (in the classroom) is to know that they know that I believe in them,\u201d said Parmenter, a special education teacher at Horizon Elementary. \u201cI apply it to coaching as well. If they have that one person who believes in them, then we can be successful at anything. \u201d\n\nAfter networking with other special ed teachers, Parmenter decided they needed to spoil their Players of the Game. So in addition to joining the team on the field for pregame introductions and team huddle, the honorees also receive a jersey, a signed shirt and a soccer ball.\n\n\u201cI think we needed a visual representation of what was actually going to happen,\u201d Parmenter said. \u201cIt all came together when you saw the experience and got to see that kid\u2019s smile. That\u2019s when you went, \u2018Oh, this is going to be awesome.\u2019\u201d\n\nParmenter wants her players to have an impact beyond the field.\n\nEach season, the team tries to work in at least 3-4 volunteer experiences. This year, their volunteer work took them to the Harrisburg Food Pantry and the Ronald McDonald House. Both experiences brought the players closer together, but Parmenter recalled a particularly valuable life lesson from their time at the Ronald McDonald House.\n\nThe girls were trying to make Scotcheroos for the families after their visit, but realized they were short on an ingredient. It was by no means a dire situation, but Parmenter reminded the girls that giving up wasn\u2019t an option. They had to get creative and figure something else out.\n\nThe solution? Chocolate peanut butter Rice Krispies balls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for these kids. I believe in them,\u201d Parmenter said. \u201cI want to be that person who can inspire kids to do more... At the end of the day, the stats matter, but the impact of the kids and the culture is more important to me.\u201d\n\nThough the wins-and-losses are secondary, the players\u2019 growth as individuals did translate to on-the-field success in 2018.\n\nThe stats are slowly coming along for the Tigers, but what\u2019s most important and what they all take the most pride in is the impact they\u2019ve had away from the pitch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the soccer portion we\u2019re working on,\u201d Malcom said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nIt was through the Players of the Game program that the Tigers were introduced to Brayden.\n\nBorn with a chromosome abnormality that affected his heart, hearing, and learning abilities, he had become close friends with Jaiden. Though both boys were nonverbal, they\u2019d formed a special relationship.\n\n\u201cThey lit up when they were around each other,\u201d said Lyndsey Mager of her son and Jaiden. \u201cYou could often find Brayden pushing Jaiden around and both boys would always have huge smiles on their faces. Jaiden was Brayden\u2019s ears and Brayden was Jaiden\u2019s legs.\u201d\n\nParmenter, who also got to know Brayden through Dakota Alliance Soccer Stars, was inspired by that connection.\n\n\u201cI knew we had to do something for him,\u201d said the coach, whose team decided to dedicate their entire season to Brayden.\n\nThough unable to be there in person, he was honored at the team\u2019s Tiger Bowl game against O\u2019Gorman. The Harrisburg players, all of whom had his name written on the inside of their wrists with a Superman logo, attached a cape to a jersey with his name on it.\n\nTwo days later, Farrell, Malcom, Petersen and Poelstra went to the Sanford Castle to meet their superhero.\n\n\u201cThey had tears of joy in their eyes,\u201d Parmenter recalled. \u201cJust hearing them speak, you can tell it really made a significant impact on them and at the end of the day, I want to make a slight impact on every kid. If I can say, \u2018Oh they remember that moment,\u2019 then I did my job for them.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor his memorial service, Brayden\u2019s family requested everyone wear either Disney or superhero attire as a way to honor his memory.\n\nThe soccer players happily obliged.\n\n\u201cSeeing them wear superhero capes to his service was amazing,\u201d Lyndsey Mager said. \u201cI am sure he was smiling from above to see everyone dressed up.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Argus Leader, http://www.argusleader.com", "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 Standing at the front of a Sioux Falls hotel conference room at a nationwide gathering, Pheasants Forever\u2019s top official told a collection of hunters to look around the room.\n\n\u201cIf those people look like you, you\u2019re not doing your job,\u201d said Howard Vincent, Pheasants Forever\u2019s president and CEO, during February\u2019s National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic.\n\nVincent then passionately described the need and importance to diversify the collection of people who go hunting.\n\nWomen. A variety of ethnicities. Millennials, who haven\u2019t picked up hunting as much as past generations. Those are all examples of populations Vincent believes can help.\n\n\u201cThe 60-year-old white males who were sitting in that room, 12 years from now are not going to be the people out pulling the trigger,\u201d Vincent said in a recent interview with The Daily Republic . \u201cThey\u2019re not the ones who will be funding conservation. That room will need to look different.\u201d\n\nThis year, South Dakota is celebrating its 100th pheasant hunting season, which runs through Jan. 6. What has become tradition each fall, people from all over the nation will trek to our state to enjoy what Vincent calls \u201cthe pheasant capital of the universe.\u201d\n\nAnd while wearing blaze orange while chasing pheasants has grown to become a part of the state\u2019s culture, there\u2019s a noticeable emphasis on recruiting a wider variety of people to go hunting, now more than ever.\n\nThat\u2019s because data shows hunter numbers are declining both nationally and in South Dakota. As the baby boomers age, they\u2019re slowly leaving hunting behind, and younger generations are not joining in at the same rate. Knowing that, groups on the local, state and national level have made it their mission to get new people involved to save the hunting heritage as they know it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned,\u201d said John E. Frampton, president and CEO of the Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports.\n\nHis organization, based in Washington, D.C., has a mission to promote the growth of hunting and shooting sports and to educate the public on the wildlife conservation contributions made by hunters and shooters.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of activity going on right now by state fish and wildlife agencies and non-governmental organizations like Pheasants Forever, and I think we have an opportunity to make a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we have 10 or 15 years. I think we have to do it and do it pretty soon.\u201d\n\nVincent laughed when asked his age.\n\n\u201cSixty-one,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m one of those guys, too.\u201d\n\nIn Pheasants Forever\u2019s most recent magazine, Vincent outlines the issue in a column titled \u201cHabitat Mission, Hunter Mission,\u201d in which he shows that U.S. hunter numbers peaked at 17 million in 1982. He shows the decline to 14.1 million in 1991 and 11.5 million in 2016.\n\nSmall-game licenses have also dropped, going from 7.6 million sold nationally in 1991 to 3.5 million in 2016. Those trends ring true in South Dakota, with resident pheasant hunters \u2014 who buy small-game licenses \u2014 peaking at about 135,000 annually in the early 1960s and decreasing to an average of approximately 60,000 annually each of the past five years.\n\nThe worry with fewer hunters is there will be less money to go toward conservation of wildlife. License fees and excise taxes on hunting goods are the main drivers to fund conservation and aid state agencies like South Dakota Game, Fish & Parks in creating outdoor recreation opportunities.\n\nVincent explained that many agencies such as GF&P and Pheasants Forever have, for a long time, focused their hunting recruitment on youth. But those efforts haven\u2019t solved the problem. Some state regulations have \u201cput barriers up,\u201d Vincent said, by dictating that children cannot hunt until the age of 12 or older.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a society that we want our kids involved, but it\u2019s orchestrated control,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s football, baseball, dance, soccer, band, all those clubs you want your kids involved with, by the time they\u2019re 12, just shy of being a teenager, they kind of have their participation controlled and in place. Then, when it\u2019s time to go hunting with your family, they\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\nIn South Dakota, for instance, a child needs to be 12 years old by the end of the calendar year to enroll in the HuntSafe course, which after completion allows them to purchase a hunting license. But earlier this year, the state updated laws to permit \u201cmentored hunting.\u201d\n\nThat allows a mentor to oversee a child of any age during open hunting seasons. The key difference is the mentor cannot carry a gun until the child has obtained HuntSafe certification.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to say, \u2018Let\u2019s get more kids into the outdoors,\u2019 and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve done for the past 30 years, and we\u2019ve done it very well,\u201d Vincent said. \u201d ... But there is an entire community out there that, if asked, if given the opportunity, would come, and you would have an opportunity to share your passion and your understandings of the benefits of being a part of the outdoors.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Pheasants Forever, GF&P and several other agencies are dedicated to the \u201cR3,\u201d a priority initiative of the Council to Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports.\n\nR3 stands for \u201crecruitment,\u201d \u2033retention\u201d and \u201creactivation\u201d and is aimed at recruiting new participants or increasing participation rates of current or lapsed outdoor recreationists, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nSouth Dakota is fortunate to have a large population of pheasants, Frampton said recently by telephone. He explained the bird is a great recruitment tool to get hunters in the field. And this year, a preseason report says there is a 47 percent increase in bird numbers compared to 2017.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a species out there that\u2019s actively hunted,\u201d Frampton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to go pheasant hunting than white-tailed deer hunting or elk hunting or moose hunting. It still requires skill. But you have a very visible species there that engagement is quite high.\u201d\n\nHe also acknowledged the work of GF&P Secretary Kelly Hepler and the department\u2019s staff in staying committed to R3.\n\nAt least some of those compliments are due to a functionary change in how the state is working to introduce a wider variety of people to the outdoors. In the past year, GF&P conducted a self-evaluation in how it educates the public in all aspects of outdoor recreation, according to Taniya Bethke, GF&P\u2019s division staff specialist of education.\n\nWhat officials learned sounds familiar: There was a lot of emphasis on youth education and not enough work teaching everyone else. The question became, \u201cHow can we target populations who aren\u2019t involved in outdoor recreation?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when GF&P started developing programs to reach out to those people while also meeting the needs of educating youth outdoor enthusiasts.\n\n\u201cWe also started reaching out to whole families, having parents attend programming with their youth to make sure that the family is also engaging outdoor recreation as a whole unit,\u201d Bethke said.\n\nNow, GF&P has an array of hands-on courses to recruit adults, including \u201cHarvest SD,\u201d \u2033Hunting 101\u2033 and \u201cHunting with Derek,\u201d a Sioux Falls-based course that teaches turkey and deer hunting from start to finish.\n\nThe first-year course introduces adults and youth to the outdoors with Derek Klawitter, group program coordinator with GF&P. He recently brought three kids out, and all three harvested a deer. They then went through the skinning, de-boning and packaging processes. He\u2019s mentored 8-year-old kids all the way up to a 53-year-old man.\n\n\u201cI would do it for nothing,\u201d he said, somewhat jokingly. \u201cI love to see kids and adults get their first deer.\u201d\n\nOther recruitment initiatives include \u201cBecoming an Outdoor Woman,\u201d \u2033Adult Date Night \u2014 Catch It, Clean It, Cook It,\u201d and an adult mentorship program that pairs adults in the community with other adults to go hunting or fishing. An unofficial count shows the wildlife education staff has reached more than 16,000 people (25 percent of whom are adults) on the topics of hunting- and fishing-related skills so far in 2018.\n\n\u201cNow, when you start looking, \u2018How can we make these programs bigger? How can we expand the impact that we\u2019re having?\u2019 That\u2019s the questions we\u2019re asking ourselves right now,\u201d Bethke said, \u201cbecause you can teach the classes and have an impact on a small scale. But how do you change a statewide trend?\u201d\n\nBethke said GF&P has not set a goal for its total reach, but said ultimately the department hopes to maintain a statewide figure that shows 20 percent of its eligible residents are involved in hunting through the crash of the baby boomer generation.\n\nWhile GF&P and Pheasants Forever are pushing hard to recruit more adults, an organization called South Dakota Youth Hunting Adventures is expanding and focusing on younger generations.\n\nEstablished in 2008 in Rapid City, South Dakota Youth Hunting Adventures now has a new James River Chapter that came to fruition within the past year. In western South Dakota, the nonprofit partners with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, but in Mitchell, it\u2019s Big Friend Little Friend. That partnership is to ensure high-quality mentors are found through extensive background checks.\n\nHunting mentors are sought out to be positive role models and \u201cthey truly care about helping children develop a love for nature and hunting,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website. \u201cThey are supportive and encouraging, patient, open-minded and good listeners.\u201d\n\nBrian Barnes has been with South Dakota Youth Hunting Adventures since its inception and helped organize the new chapter in Mitchell.\n\nHe said there have been 13 mentor-mentee matches already established for the James River Chapter, which makes a total of 100 kids involved with South Dakota Youth Hunting Adventures statewide this year. In total, 200 kids have completed the program, he said. Of those kids, 40 percent have grown up and purchased hunting licenses in South Dakota on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have tried to do what we\u2019ve done, and most have failed,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThe reason is you can\u2019t take these kids out on a single hunt and expect them to do it the rest of their life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the efforts of groups like South Dakota Youth Hunting Adventures, local Pheasants Forever chapters and proactive state agencies that have Vincent encouraged and hopeful for the future.\n\n\u201cI think this is one of the most critical issues that the hunting and shooting community is dealing with right now,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cThese people don\u2019t have to come to the sport the way the other 60-year-olds came into the sport, the way it was family-based, the way we grew up. ... I think the 60-year-old population can appreciate that other hunters don\u2019t have to look like them. Whatever the reason, we need to engage them and show them a welcoming place in this world.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Daily Republic, http://www.mitchellrepublic.com", "Alfalfa leafcutter bees fly around a container near Fargo, N.D., on Thursday, Aug. 16, 2018.

However, each mother bee in Canada can produce about two and a half larvae.\n\nNow, scientists like Wilson are trying to find out why there\u2019s a disparity, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\n\u201cThat is the whole purpose of this lab and our central question because it really doesn\u2019t make sense to us,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo all the research in this lab looking at all the little intricacies of this bee that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to figure out why is this bee not doing well.\u201d\n\nAlfalfa is the fourth largest crop in the country, and it\u2019s grown to feed livestock like dairy cows, sheep and horses.\n\nThe alfalfa leafcutter isn\u2019t native to North America. But farmers and researchers noticed that when they kept leafcutter bees nearby, the production of alfalfa seeds tripled.\n\nMark Wagoner is an alfalfa seed farmer based in Washington state, and he relies on two bee species to help pollinate and produce the seeds for the crop. He buys leafcutter bees by the gallon to help pollinate more than 1,300 acres of alfalfa.\n\n\u201cHoney bees won\u2019t pollinate alfalfa, they will just get the nectar, the alfalfa plant has to be physically tripped to get the pollen,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nWhen the alfalfa plant is tripped, the plant can smack a larger honey bee right in the face. But a leafcutter bee is small enough that it\u2019s not bothered by the plant being triggered as it\u2019s pollinated.\n\nThe students and researchers keep their bees in a \u201cbee hotel\u201d. This small structure has thousands of holes that are a little smaller than the width of a pencil. In each hole they place a small paper straw. That lets the researchers pull out the nests so they can study them back in the lab. When you walk up to the lab\u2019s bee hotel, you don\u2019t even need a protective suit.\n\nWilson\u2019s nests were created in a lab with a 3D printer, and designed so she can monitor the temperature inside the nest at any given time. They look like nine large purple stacking blocks, with four holes for nests on each block, facing four different directions.\n\nEven as she\u2019s studying the effects of temperature, she\u2019s making observations that might help farmers in the future.\n\n\u201cCurrently farmers place their boxes facing southeast. And the reason behind that is that on the southeast side that\u2019s the sun hits it first thing in the morning it kind of wakes the pollinators up and gets them out into the field earlier,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHowever we don\u2019t even know if the bees prefer that side.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s preliminary data show the bees don\u2019t like to nest on the southeast side. Given a choice, many of the bees went to the northeast and northwest sides of the box, she said.\n\nThis is the kind of detail that the students and researchers are studying at this lab. It\u2019s a partnership between North Dakota State University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAlfalfa farmer Mark Wagoner said he appreciates the research the USDA has done with local universities, but he doesn\u2019t expect a solution anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWell it would save me a lot of money because in 2017, we spent like $350,000 at least on leafcutter bees, which is a lot of money,\u201d Wagoner said. \u201cIf they could figure this out, that\u2019d be great. But we\u2019ve been trying to figure this out since the \u201970s.\u201d", "In this Oct. 3, 2018 photo, Yenni Prieto poses for a photo holding an Argentine national flag designed with an image of former President Cristina Fernandez, during a demonstration demanding improved conditions for disabled retirees, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

She has given us all of our rights.\u201d\n\nA recent survey by local pollster Ricardo Rouvier & Associates said Fernandez is neck-and-neck with Macri in terms of support ahead of the October 2019 election.\n\nThat\u2019s remarkable backing for a politician who faces numerous formal investigations into alleged bribery, money laundering and criminal association during her own administration from 2007 to 2015 and that of her late husband Nestor Kirchner from 2003 to 2007.\n\nFernandez, now a senator, hasn\u2019t been convicted of any crimes \u2014 a first trial is scheduled to start in February \u2014 and she fiercely denies any wrongdoing, accusing officials of persecuting her to distract from the current economic crisis.\n\nBut the Argentine press has been filled with picturesque scandals: bags of millions of dollars in cash tossed over a convent wall, the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused Fernandez of a cover-up, the corruption conviction of her former vice president.\n\nPart of her strength stems from disenchantment with Macri, whose budget-cutting efforts have forced thousands out of public jobs, raised electricity bills and hiked bus fares without managing to revive the economy or rein in soaring prices. His decision this year to seek IMF aid to help has roused fears among those who blame the international agency for a devastating economic crash in 2001, when Argentina\u2019s government was forced into the largest debt default in history to that point and millions of Argentines were plunged into poverty.\n\nMany credit Kirchner and Fernandez for leading the country out of that crisis, even if Macri\u2019s backers blame Fernandez\u2019s policies for eventually creating the country\u2019s current woes.\n\nUnder Fernandez, \u201cI was able to buy a new car, fix my house and travel on a plane for the first time,\u201d said Gloria Buffarini, a hairdresser. \u201cI used to pay 600 pesos a month (about $16) for electricity. Now, it\u2019s 3,000 (about $80).\n\nFernandez\u2019s supporters credit her for nationalizing the pension system, keeping energy cheap through subsidies and redirecting revenue to the poor through handouts, and see her as a trailblazer for women\u2019s advancement.\n\nThe former president\u2019s appeal also flows from her leadership of a powerful \u2014 if often fragmented \u2014 populist tide in Argentine politics that originated with strongman Juan Domingo Peron in the 1940s and from progressive social policies she passed in the face of opposition from powerful business interests.\n\nBut she also inspires deep animosity. Detractors blame her for endemic corruption and the deterioration of Argentina\u2019s economy, which was choked by restrictions on imports, exports and foreign currency exchanges in the latter part of her administration.\n\n\u201cNot since Peron has there been another leader who has generated such a situation of love and hate,\u201d said Mariel Fornoni of the Management & Fit consultancy. She said Fernandez has a \u201chard core of followers who are going to vote for her no matter what she does.\u201d\n\nFernandez infuriates people like Patricio Canbelari, a language teacher, who said, \u201cMost want to see her arrested,\u201d and called her a \u201cwhite-gloved thief.\u201d\n\nFernandez\u2019s former public works secretary was arrested in 2016 when he was caught tossing bags containing more than $9 million over the walls of a convent. He later agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, joining other witnesses in accusing Fernandez and her son of overseeing a plan to skim millions of dollars from public works projects.\n\nJudges also are investigating allegations published by the newspaper La Nacion that a senior official\u2019s chauffeur kept detailed diaries of millions of dollars in cash payments, including some delivered to the presidential offices and to Fernandez\u2019s private home.\n\nFernandez, along with other former officials, also faces trial on charges that she covered up the role of Iranians in a 1994 terrorist bombing at a Jewish center in Argentina\u2019s capital. The prosecutor who first recommended charges against her, Alberto Nisman, died mysteriously of a gunshot wound four days later \u2014 a case that is still under investigation.\n\nFernandez\u2019s former vice president, Amado Boudou, is in prison, appealing a sentence for bribery and business incompatible with his public office. He was accused of using shell companies and middlemen to take over the only company with contracts to print Argentina\u2019s currency.\n\nFernandez\u2019s Senate seat grants her immunity from arrest but not from prosecution. That immunity could be lifted only by an unlikely vote of two-thirds of the country\u2019s senators. While a conviction might theoretically bar her from running for office, that would only occur after appeals were exhausted \u2014 a process that would take many years.\n\nFornoni said some Argentines believe that although corruption was rife during Fernandez\u2019s term, it exists in Macri\u2019s government as well.\n\n\u201cThey say: \u2018They were probably corrupt, but I lived better,\u2019\u201d Fornoni said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Paul Byrne contributed to this report.", "", "", "", "An Iranian checks various currency rates at an exchange shop window in downtown Tehran, Iran, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018.

(Nov. 5)\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels in the new sanctions. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe new sanctions particularly hurt Iran\u2019s vital oil industry, which provides a crucial source of hard currency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists in Washington the sanctions already had cost Iran the sale of over 1 million barrels of crude oil a day.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to starve the Iranian regime of the revenue it uses to fund violent and destabilizing activities throughout the Middle East and, indeed, around the world,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlawed course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble.\u201d\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise of tearing up the nuclear deal, insists it does not seek \u201cregime change\u201d in Iran through the sanctions. It says It wants Iran to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nHowever, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his national security adviser John Bolton both have given speeches advocating overthrowing Iran\u2019s theocratic government.\n\nAnalysts feared in the run-up to the sanctions that global oil prices could spike on tight supply and increasing demand. However, the Trump administration allowed some of its allies \u2014 Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey \u2014 as well as rival China to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero. That caused prices of benchmark Brent crude to dip down from over $80 a barrel in recent days. It traded up over $73 a barrel Monday after the sanctions took effect.\n\n\u201cWe have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don\u2019t want to drive the oil prices in the world,\u201d Trump said on Thursday. \u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\u201d\n\nRouhani, whose signature achievement was the nuclear deal, promised that Iran would still be able to sell its oil on the international market.

We are standing up to a bullying enemy,\u201d Rouhani told government officials in televised remarks, invoking Iran\u2019s ruinous 1980s war with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. \u201cYesterday, Saddam was in front us; today Trump is front of us.

(AP Photo)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration was caught between allies at home and abroad and the reality of global economics as it reinstated sanctions Monday on Iran, forced to carve out exemptions for important allies and back off on measures that could have been even more punishing for Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. granted waivers to allow China and seven close U.S. partners and allies to continue importing Iranian crude and other petroleum products without penalty, bowing to concerns that a complete end to Iran\u2019s exports would cause a major spike in world oil prices and cause other economic disruptions. Trump conceded that reality on his way to a last-minute campaign event a day before critical midterm congressional elections.\n\n\u201cWe have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because I don\u2019t want to drive the oil prices in the world,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI could get the Iran oil down to zero immediately, but it would cause a shock to the market.\u201d\n\nThe newly reinstated sanctions target Iran\u2019s energy, financial and shipping sectors and are aimed at forcing Iran to end ballistic missile program and end its support for armed movements throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe measures restore all the U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 accord that gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a deal that Obama administration critics had argued was too soft on the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn reinstating the measures, the Treasury Department imposed penalties on more than 700 Iranian and Iranian-linked individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels. Among those are 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries, more than 200 people and ships, Iran\u2019s state-run airline Iran Air and more than 65 of its planes.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. They will also affect non-Iranian companies that deal with sanctioned Iranian firms and officials.\n\nYet, while the administration seeks to cut off Iran\u2019s oil revenue, it is allowing Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey to continue purchasing Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the list, it\u2019s obviously very large economies that still in many ways depend on Iran oil imports and at this time don\u2019t have any strong alternatives,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the Trump team\u2019s trying to balance its maximum pressure campaign against Iran versus its concerns over where the global prices of oil might go and how that could negatively impact everyone including America. I don\u2019t support this policy, but if you are going down this path, it\u2019s a way to lessen the risk of economic blowback in America.\u201d\n\nThree of the eight waiver recipients \u2014 Greece, Italy and Turkey \u2014 are members of NATO. Japan and South Korea have mutual defense treaties with the U.S. and have a key part in the North Korea denuclearization initiative. India, the world\u2019s largest democracy, plays a critical role in the administration\u2019s \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d strategy, which seeks to unite countries in the region into forming a bloc to counter China\u2019s growing assertiveness.\n\nAll of them lobbied heavily to be granted the six-month exemptions while promising to further reduce or end their imports and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the waivers were based on the specific circumstances of each and the need \u201cto ensure a well-supplied oil market.\u201d\n\nChina is the single-largest importer of Iranian oil and forcing it to look elsewhere to fuel its dynamic economy would likely have rocked the market.\n\nFor some waiver recipients, domestic concerns were paramount.\n\nSouth Korea, for example, is reliant on oil imports to drive its economy. It had been consultation with the Trump administration since the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal in May. Seoul says it will reduce oil imports from Iran by a \u201csignificant\u201d amount but the waiver will allow it to maintain a stable supply of a light form of crude known as condensate.\n\nSeeking to deflect criticism from some Iran hawks concerned that the sanctions don\u2019t go far enough, Pompeo stressed that U.S. pressure on countries to stop buying Iranian oil had already reduced its exports by more than a million barrels of crude per day costing the country $2.5 billion revenue.\n\nSome leading Iran hawks appeared to agree with the administration\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged that these waivers will only be temporary and one-time,\u201d said United Against a Nuclear Iran, a prominent group that was harshly critical of the nuclear deal and the sanctions relief it brought.\n\nIn addition to the oil exemptions, Pompeo said limited waivers had been issued to allow European and other firms to continue conversion work on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.\n\n\u201cPermitting these specific activities to continue is an interim measure that preserves oversight of Iran\u2019s civil nuclear program,\u201d the State Department said. \u201cThis oversight enhances our ability to constrain Iran\u2019s program and keep pressure on the regime while we pursue a new, stronger deal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMaria Danilova and Matthew Pennington contributed to this report.", "President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally at Show Me Center, Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Cape Girardeau, Mo..

Acknowledging the stakes in the closing days of campaigning, Trump stressed to voters that everything is on the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fragile. Everything I told you about, it can be undone and changed by the Democrats if they get in,\u201d Trump told supporters on a telephone \u201ctown hall\u201d organized by his re-election campaign. \u201cYou see how they\u2019ve behaved. You see what\u2019s happening with them.

I feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is urging Republicans in Ohio to turn out for the midterm elections in order to keep his \"political movement going.\" (Nov. 5)\n\nThere was little of that on display as Trump spent his final hours on the trail Monday in Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, where he harshened his rhetoric on illegal immigration and lobbed attacks at Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe contrast in this election could not be more clear. Democrats produce mobs,\u201d Trump said at his final rally in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happened. Republicans produce jobs.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday tweet, he warned that law enforcement was \u201cstrongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday\u2019s Election (or Early Voting).\u201d Trump has falsely claimed that millions of illegal votes were cast in 2016, which he says deprived him of a victory in the popular vote, and has stoked concerns, without providing evidence, of rampant fraudulent voting.\n\n\u201cI do eventually want to unite,\u201d Trump said in Fort Wayne, Indiana, \u201cbut I\u2019m driving them crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump has also sought to distance himself from any potential blame if Republicans lose control of the House, saying, \u201cMy primary focus has been on the Senate.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome, Trump made clear he knew his political future was on the line.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, I am on the ticket,\u201d he told a raucous crowd in Cleveland.\n\nHe warned supporters on the telephone town hall to get out and vote because \u201cthe press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are increasingly confident they will retain control of the Senate, but they face Democratic headwinds in the House. In an interview with The Associated Press last month, Trump said he would not accept blame for a GOP defeat at the polls.\n\nTrump has maintained a busy campaign schedule in the final stretch of the race, with 11 rallies over six days. In the closing days Trump has brought out special guests to join him. Country singer Lee Greenwood performed Trump favorite \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d on Sunday in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and appeared with the president Monday night in Missouri.\n\nIn Indiana and again in Missouri, Trump invited White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor Kellyanne Conway on stage to speak along with his daughter Ivanka Trump.\n\nFox News personality Sean Hannity and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh served as \u201cspecial guests\u201d at the final rally, according to Trump\u2019s campaign, though Hannity insisted on Twitter he would only be \u201ccovering (the) final rally for my show.\u201d Trump, however, did call Hannity to the stage.\n\nAt his rallies and on Twitter, Trump\u2019s closing argument has largely focused on fear \u2014 warning, without evidence, that a Democratic takeover would deliver the country into socialism, spurring an influx of illegal immigration and a wave of crime.\n\nAttacks on favorite Trump foes House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters were staples of Trump\u2019s closing message to voters as he argued that Democrats would plunge the country into Venezuela-like chaos.\n\nFaced with low Republican enthusiasm, Trump is convinced that immigration will again be an animating issue for his base. He seized on the caravans of Central American migrants to reinforce an immigration message that recalls the racially charged immigration talk of his 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an invasion. I don\u2019t care what they say,\u201d Trump said Monday of the thousands of migrants marching toward the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has also used the confirmation battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to stir up his most loyal supporters, with his aides believing it to be one of the most effective arguments for bringing GOP voters to the polls.\n\n\u201cWe energized the Republican Party with that,\u201d Trump said in Missouri. \u201cThe Democrats overplayed their hand.\u201d\n\nIn the final sprint to Election Day, Trump has pushed forward with rallies amid news events that would have halted previous leaders \u2014 holding a massive event in Illinois the same day a gunman massacred 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nOften the candidates Trump has traveled to support feel like supporting actors in the theater of his rallies, though in the final days of the campaign Trump has been more generous in his praise of the Republicans he wishes to see elected.\n\nIn cramped aircraft hangars and pack arenas across battleground states, Trump has boasted about the energetic displays of support from his most loyal backers, drawing parallels to his own White House bid. \u201cThere\u2019s electricity in the air like I haven\u2019t seen since \u201916,\u201d he said Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important election,\u201d Trump added, emphasizing the stakes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as important as \u201916, but it\u2019s right up there.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s midterm efforts will not stop with his Missouri rally on Monday night.

The truck driver later told authorities he was inhaling chemical vapors before the crash.\n\nSchneider\u2019s mother, Judy Schneider said her daughter and granddaughter\u2019s deaths are \u201cstill not real for any of us,\u201d and her 6-year-old grandson, Jasper, can\u2019t grasp what happened.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cHe said, \u2018If the doctors work real hard, sometimes God lets them come back.\u2019\u201d\n\nLake Hallie police said the 21-year-old pickup driver, Colten Treu, and a passenger told investigators they had been huffing just before striking the Girl Scout troop. Authorities said Treu sped off after the collision, but surrendered hours later. He is being held in the Chippewa County Jail on $250,000 bond and faces 13 possible charges, including four counts of intoxicated use of a motor vehicle.\n\nTreu made his first court appearance Monday and has another hearing scheduled for Tuesday, when prosecutors are expected to formally charge him.\n\nSchneider said her daughter, granddaughter and grandson moved in with her a couple of years ago and they expected the house in the Town of Lafayette to be their \u201cforever home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a little piece of heaven,\u201d she said.

Martin Heinrich in Democratic strongholds of Las Cruces and Las Vegas, New Mexico.\n\nA poll published in the Albuquerque Journal showed Lujan Grisham with a substantial lead over Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce. Pearce, a former Air Force pilot and oilfield entrepreneur, focused campaigning Monday in Albuquerque, the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Monday, Pearce dismissed polls showing him behind, arguing there will be better than expected turnout among Republicans and Democrats who will cross over for him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be surprised,\u201d he promised.\n\nBut confident Democrats late Monday were already boosting that they had an edge in early voting and ended a rally in Albuquerque\u2019s historic Hispanic South Valley by dancing to Kool & The Gang\u2019s \u201cCelebration.\u201d\n\nLujan Grisham urged all activists who voted early to volunteer to get more people to the polls to help Democrats in down-ticket races.\n\nRegistered Democrats dominated early voting in Bernalillo County, which encompasses Albuquerque and neighboring suburbs, casting nearly 91,000 ballots to about 52,000 from registered Republicans.\n\nHeinrich is seeking a second term in a three-way race against Republican political newcomer Mick Rich and Libertarian Gary Johnson, a former governor and presidential candidate who entered the race in August.\n\nRich said he was vastly outspent by Heinrich but believed he was going to at least come out ahead of Johnson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see how it all turns out,\u201d he said.\n\nPollsters predicted a close finish for Pearce\u2019s open congressional seat in a contest between Republican state Rep.

The official office of Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp said Sunday, Nov. 4, it is investigating the state Democratic Party in connection with what it said was an attempted hack of the state\u2019s online voter database that will be used at polling places in Tuesday\u2019s election. (Michael Holahan/The Augusta Chronicle via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The bruising race for governor of Georgia has been roiled by unsupported, eleventh-hour allegations from Republican candidate Brian Kemp, who is also the state\u2019s chief election official, that Democrats sought to hack the voter registration system.\n\nHis Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, said he is making a baseless accusation to deflect attention from an apparently severe security flaw in the system Kemp is responsible for overseeing.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the dispute, how it unfolded and what\u2019s at stake.\n\nTHE ALLEGATION\n\nKemp asked the FBI on Sunday to investigate the Democratic Party, accusing it of trying to hack the system he controls as secretary of state. He offered no evidence in support of his request for a probe of the opposition.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nKemp leveled the allegation after an attorney for election-security advocates notified the FBI and Kemp\u2019s office on Saturday that a private citizen alerted him to what appeared to be a major flaw in the database used to check in voters at the polls.\n\nIndependent computer scientists told The Associated Press that the flaw would enable anyone with access to an individual voter\u2019s personal information to log on to Georgia\u2019s MyVoter registration portal and alter or delete any voter\u2019s record, potentially causing havoc.\n\nThe leading candidates for governor Georgia are pushing hard for votes, ahead of what's expected to be a very close election on Tuesday. Democrat Stacey Abrams campaigned in Augusta. Republican Brian Kemp rallied with President Trump in Macon. (Nov. 5)\n\nTHE DEMOCRATS\u2019 RESPONSE\n\nAbrams on Monday called him a \u201cbald-faced liar\u201d who cooked up the allegation to deflect attention from his record of incompetence as secretary of state presiding over an antiquated, vulnerability-laced elections system.\n\n\u201cThere was never a hack,\u201d she told a gathering at a Savannah union hall. \u201cWhat was wrong is that he failed to do his job. He is abusing his power.\u201d\n\nTHE BACKGROUND\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud.\n\nPolls suggest Kemp and Abrams are locked in a tight race in a contest that has taken on historic significance because Abrams could become the nation\u2019s first black female governor.\n\nShe has accused Kemp of using his post as secretary of state to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp has countered that he is following the law and that Abrams and advocacy groups are trying to help noncitizens and others cast ballots illegally.\n\nLast month, a federal judge endorsed plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that Kemp has been derelict in his management of the state election system and that the setup is lacking in reliability.\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying that the losing side will not accept Tuesday\u2019s results.\n\nHOW THE LATEST ALLEGATION UNFOLDED\n\nAccording to AP interviews and records released by the Georgia Democratic Party, a lawyer for election-security advocates, David Cross, notified both the FBI and Kemp\u2019s counsel Saturday that a citizen had alerted him to the flaw.\n\nThe citizen also separately informed the Georgia Democratic Party, whose voter protection director then sent an email to two Georgia Tech computer security experts, one of whom sits on a commission created by Kemp.\n\n\u201cIf this report is accurate, it is a massive vulnerability,\u201d wrote the director, Sara Tindall Ghazal.\n\nThe online news outlet WhoWhatWhy obtained copies of some of the correspondence and published a story about the system flaw on Sunday \u2014 just as Kemp\u2019s office issued the first of two statements accusing Democrats of a \u201cfailed cyberattack.\u201d\n\nThat statement \u2014 bereft of specifics \u2014 remained prominent on his office\u2019s main web page late Monday afternoon.\n\nTHE FLAW\n\nFour security experts independently confirmed to the AP that the voter registration site is highly vulnerable to hacking.\n\nThey said they could not duplicate the worst vulnerability identified by the \u201cprivate citizen\u201d because that would require illegal tampering. But they said the flaw would let any user logging onto the system to access and alter the records of anyone in the system.\n\nThe experts were also able to identify additional flaws. One would allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the voter registration site that could spy on visitors or steal or alter data. Another flaw: The site lacks \u201cURL sanitizing,\u201d standard code for preventing infections from visitors.\n\n\u201cThis is the easiest part of an assignment that we give to undergrad students in a security class. It\u2019s unbelievable how they didn\u2019t do this,\u201d University of Michigan computer scientist Matthew Bernhard told the AP.\n\nAnother computer expert who reviewed the vulnerability, Kris Constable of PrivaSecTech in Vancouver, Canada, said the system \u201cclearly has never been audited by any computer security professional.\u201d\n\nDuring a campaign stop Monday, Kemp acknowledged \u201ca potential vulnerability that we found about\u201d but insisted without offering details that the state\u2019s election systems are secure.\n\nGEORGIA\u2019S PAST PROBLEMS\n\nThe state is one of just five that continue to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don\u2019t leave a paper trail that can be audited in case of problems.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp\u2019s office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn\u2019t fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia voters \u2014 6.7 million at the time \u2014 as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp\u2019s office blamed that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp\u2019s behalf.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Colleen Long and Jill Colvin in Washington;Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia; and Ben Nadler in Atlanta contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For Democrats, the midterm elections have been a beacon in the dark, a chance to re-emerge from the political wilderness and repudiate a president they view as a dangerous force.\n\nBut on the cusp of Tuesday\u2019s vote , many Democrats are as anxious as they are hopeful.\n\nTheir memories from 2016, when they watched in disbelief as Donald Trump defied polls, expectations and political norms, are still fresh. And as Trump travels the country armed with a divisive and racially charged closing campaign message, the test for Democrats now feels at once similar and more urgent than it did two years ago: They failed to stop Trump then, what if they fall short again?\n\n\u201cPart of what\u2019s at stake here is our ability to send a message that this is not who we are,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s losing 2016 campaign.\n\nThis year, history is on Democrats\u2019 side. The sitting president\u2019s party often losing ground in the first midterm after winning office, and for much of 2018, voter enthusiasm and polling has favored Democrats as well.\n\nPrimary contests filled the Democratic roster with a new generation of candidates, including several minority candidates who could make history in their races. While the fight to regain control of the Senate, largely playing out in conservative states, may prove out of reach for Democrats, the party has been buoyed by its ability to run competitively in Republican-leaning states such as Texas and Tennessee.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 focus is largely on snatching back the House and picking up governors\u2019 seats in Florida, Wisconsin, Ohio and elsewhere. The party is also seeking redemption in the Midwest where Trump won over white, working-class voters who had backed Democrats for years. In Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Democrats appear poised to regain ground.\n\nSuch victories would build momentum behind the party\u2019s shift toward a new generation of candidates who are younger, more diverse, with greater numbers of women and more liberal than Democratic leadership. They would also signal that Trump\u2019s hard-line positions on immigration and his penchant for personal attacks turn off more voters than they energize.\n\nA good night for Democrats on Tuesday would provide a blueprint for how the party can successfully run against Trump in the 2020 presidential race. At least two dozen Democrats are waiting in the wings, eager to take Trump.\n\nBut the president has proved once again to be a powerful political force late in a campaign.\n\nEven with his daily airing of grievances on Twitter and an approval rate below the average for his recent predecessors at this point, he has almost single-handedly put Republicans in a stronger position this fall. He\u2019s aggressively appealed to his loyal, core supporters with a sharply anti-immigrant, nationalist message and by casting Democrats as outside the mainstream.\n\n\u201cA vote for any Democrat this November is a vote to really put extreme far left politicians in charge of Congress and to destroy your jobs, slash your incomes, undermine your safety and put illegal aliens before American citizens,\u201d Trump said during a rally Saturday in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nIf Republicans hang on to control of Congress, Trump will almost certainly be emboldened. Democrats would be left with difficult questions about a path forward.\n\nFor example, how can Democrats assemble a winning coalition in 2020 if they fail to appeal to the moderate suburban voters who hold sway in the congressional districts that decide which party holds a House majority? And how will Democrats, if they fall short, sustain the energy from young people and women who have marched in protest of Trump, registered to vote and volunteered for the first time this election season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that if the election is not what we hoped for that people will say, \u2018it\u2019s too hard\u2019 and become disengaged,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as Clinton\u2019s communications director during the 2016 campaign.\n\nAs Americans participated in early voting this weekend, that same anxiety was palpable among some voters.\n\nIn Southern California, lifelong Democrat Theresa Hunter said she didn\u2019t take Trump seriously in 2016. But she sees a chance for Democrats to render their judgment on the president by pushing his party out of power in a different branch of government.\n\n\u201cTo see his party jump on board and march in lockstep is what\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Hunter, a 65-year-old retired salesperson from Lake Forest, California.\n\nA few hours north, California voter Lawrence Reh was casting his ballot. Afterward, his voice quivered and he wiped back tears as he voiced frustrations about Trump and his worries about the direction of the country.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t make any progress in this election, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll go from here,\u201d Reh said.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 Julie Pace has covered the White House and politics for The Associated Press since 2007.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 Only days after he stood up to key players for turning up late to a team talk, another incident underlined how Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel needs greater backing from his club over disciplinary issues.\n\nTuchel felt let down by midfielder Marco Verratti, who was stopped by police for driving over the alcohol limit late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to do that two days before a match, what he did isn\u2019t good,\u201d Tuchel said after Friday\u2019s 2-0 home win against Lille. \u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s something for the club to regulate. The club needs to regulate this because I need to control the dressing room and sporting things.\u201d\n\nTuchel already has his hands full in the Champions League, and he can\u2019t afford being distracted by player ill-discipline.\n\nBut twice within the space of a few days, his patience was tested. This, with a huge game coming up at Napoli on Tuesday, when defeat could leave PSG perilously close to elimination from the Champions League group stage.\n\nThe previous weekend, Tuchel left out star striker Kylian Mbappe and midfielder Adrien Rabiot for turning up late to a pre-match team talk before the game at Marseille.\n\nFive days after being dropped, Mbappe arrived at the stadium for Friday\u2019s home game against Lille wearing a face mask from a Netflix series. So did Neymar, walking ahead of him.\n\nWith Tuchel at pains to insist the French league is not too easy for PSG despite 12 straight league wins, star players arriving wearing masks before playing against a team sitting No. 2 in the league sends out the opposite message \u2014 and one of domestic complacency.\n\nWould they do the same for a big game in the Champions League, for example?\n\nWhat Tuchel really needs is a better response on the field in big matches. Key players lacked composure against Napoli in a 2-2 home draw last month, scraping a draw late into injury-time. It left PSG on four points from three matches, with Champions League runner-up Liverpool still to visit PSG.\n\nSimilar frailties, in terms of attitude, were exposed last season against defending champion Real Madrid in the last 16.\n\nA little more than a week before the first leg in Madrid, Neymar threw a lavish birthday party with about 250 guests present, including the club\u2019s president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and then-coach Unai Emery.\n\nVideos of the players partying and dancing late circulated on social media. The videos angered Sochaux captain Florian Tardieu, who said it was a lack of respect since PSG was playing Sochaux in a French Cup game 48 hours later.\n\nEmery said at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s good for our collective mindset to have shared this moment with Neymar.\u201d Then his team lost 3-1 in Madrid and 2-1 at home.\n\nThere was a perceived lax code of conduct behind the scenes at times last season, with striker Edinson Cavani and midfielder Javier Pastore rebuked by captain Thiago Silva for returning late from the mid-season winter break.\n\nTuchel is not the only coach who has been faced with star power at PSG. In previous seasons, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was allowed days off to go hunting in Sweden.\n\nComplacency has also been a problem.\n\nIn 2017, PSG routed Barcelona 4-0 at home.\n\nThen, two days before the return leg, the club released a video on YouTube called \u201cSupper Club\u201d with four players sitting around a table. As they ate pizzas and slurped soft drinks, former midfielder Blaise Matuidi and Verratti were joined by Julian Draxler and Thomas Meunier.\n\nThey discussed the game ahead.\n\n\u201cThe first 20 minutes are going to be tough, eh Marco? The field is really big,\u201d Matuidi said.\n\nDraxler told Matuidi \u201cYou will need to run a lot\u201d and they both laughed when Matuidi retorted: \u201cI\u2019ll need you to as well.\u201d\n\nThe casual tone smacked of taking Barcelona lightly. PSG lost 6-1, becoming the first team in Champions League history to go out after winning the first leg by four goals.\n\nTuesday night will be another test of PSG\u2019s composure on the biggest stage.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "NASHUA, N.H.

But two years after an election that proved polls and prognosticators wrong, nothing is certain on the eve of the first nationwide elections of the Trump presidency.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Democrat in this country that doesn\u2019t have a little angst left over from 2016 deep down,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List, which spent more than ever before \u2014 nearly $60 million in all \u2014 to support Democratic women this campaign season.\n\n\u201cEverything matters and everything\u2019s at stake,\u201d Schriock said.\n\nAll 435 seats in the U.S. House are up for re-election. And 35 Senate seats are in play, as are almost 40 governorships and the balance of power in virtually every state legislature.\n\nWhile he is not on the ballot, Trump acknowledged on Monday that the 2018 midterms represent a referendum on his presidency.\n\nAP Debrief: Trump looms over midterm election\n\n\u201cIn a certain way I am on the ballot,\u201d Trump told supporters during a tele-town hall organized by his re-election campaign. \u201cThe press is very much considering it a referendum on me and us as a movement.\u201d\n\nHe also contended, as he does daily, that if the Democrats win they will work to roll back everything he\u2019s tried to accomplish. \u201cIt\u2019s all fragile,\u201d he said.\n\nShould Democrats win control of the House, as strategists in both parties suggest is likely, they could derail Trump\u2019s legislative agenda for the next two years. Perhaps more important, they would win subpoena power to investigate Trump\u2019s many personal and professional missteps.\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections will also test the strength of a Trump-era political realignment defined by evolving divisions among voters by race, gender and especially education.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican coalition is increasingly older, whiter, more male and less likely to have a college degree. Democrats are relying more upon women, people of color, young people and college graduates.\n\nThe political realignment, if it solidifies, could re-shape U.S. politics for a generation.\n\nJust five years ago, the Republican National Committee reported that the GOP\u2019s very survival depended upon attracting more minorities and women. Those voters have increasingly fled Trump\u2019s Republican Party, turned off by his chaotic leadership style and xenophobic rhetoric. Blue-collar men, however, have embraced the unconventional president.\n\nOne of the RNC report\u2019s authors, Ari Fleischer, acknowledged that Republican leaders never envisioned expanding their ranks with white, working-class men.\n\n\u201cWhat it means to be Republican is being rewritten as we speak,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cDonald Trump has the pen, and his handwriting isn\u2019t always very good.\u201d\n\nA nationwide poll released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal details the depth of the demographic shifts.\n\nDemocrats led with likely African-American voters (84 percent to 8 percent), Latinos (57 percent to 29 percent), voters between the ages of 18-34 (57 percent to 34 percent), women (55 percent to 37 percent) and independents (35 percent to 23 percent).\n\nAmong white college-educated women, Democrats enjoy a 28-point advantage: 61 percent to 33 percent.\n\nOn the other side, Republicans led with voters between the ages of 50 and 64 (52 percent to 43 percent), men (50 percent to 43 percent) and whites (50 percent to 44 percent). And among white men without college degrees, Republicans led 65 percent to 30 percent.\n\nDemocrats hope to elect a record number of women to Congress. They are also poised to make history with the number of LGBT candidates and Muslims up and down the ballot.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama seized on the differences between the parties in a final-days scramble to motivate voters across the nation.\n\n\u201cOne election won\u2019t eliminate racism, sexism or homophobia,\u201d Obama said during an appearance in Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen in one election. But it\u2019ll be a start.\u201d\n\nTrump has delivered a very different closing argument, railing against Latin American immigrants seeking asylum at the U.S. border.\n\nWith the walking caravan weeks away, Trump dispatched more than 5,000 troops to the region. The president also said soldiers would use lethal force against migrants who throw rocks, before later reversing himself.\n\nStill, his xenophobic rhetoric has been unprecedented for an American president in the modern era: \u201cBarbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight,\u201d Trump told voters in Montana.\n\nThe hyper-charged environment is expected to drive record turnout in some places, but on the eve of the election, it\u2019s far from certain which side will show up in the greatest numbers.\n\nThe outcome is clouded by the dramatically different landscape between the House and Senate.\n\nDemocrats are most optimistic about the House, a sprawling battlefield extending from Alaska to Florida. Most top races, however, are set in America\u2019s suburbs where more educated and affluent voters in both parties have soured on Trump\u2019s turbulent presidency, despite the strength of the national economy.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up two dozen seats to claim the House majority.\n\nBillionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who personally invested $110 million to help Democrats this year, largely in the House, has seized on voter education levels in picking target races, according to senior aide Howard Wolfson.\n\n\u201cIn this cycle, it seemed as if there was a disproportionately negative reaction among highly educated voters to Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, Bloomberg\u2019s team poured money into otherwise overlooked suburban districts in states like Georgia, Washington state and Oklahoma because data revealed voters there were better-educated.\n\nDemocrats face a far more difficult challenge in the Senate, where they are almost exclusively on defense in rural states where Trump remains popular. Democratic Senate incumbents are up for re-election, for example, in North Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana \u2014 states Trump carried by 30 percentage points on average two years ago.\n\nDemocrats need to win two seats to claim the Senate majority, although most political operatives in both parties expect Republicans to add to their majority.\n\nWhile Trump is prepared to claim victory if his party retains Senate control, at least one prominent ally fears that losing even one chamber of Congress could be disastrous.\n\n\u201cIf they take back the House, he essentially will become a lame-duck president, and he won\u2019t win re-election,\u201d said Amy Kremer, a tea party activist who leads the group Women for Trump.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll do anything and everything they can to impeach him,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, powerful Democratic forces are already pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment, even if Democratic leaders aren\u2019t ready to go that far.\n\nLiberal activist Tom Steyer spent roughly $120 million this midterm season. Much of that has gone to boost turnout among younger voters, although he has produced a nationwide advertising campaign calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nSteyer insisted most Democrats agree.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not some fringe element of the Democratic Party. We are the Democratic Party,\u201d he said.\n\nBy Election Day, both sides are expected to have spent more than $5 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The flood of campaign cash, a midterm record, has been overwhelmingly fueled by energy on the left.\n\n___\n\nFor AP\u2019s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics", "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 One runner in the New York City marathon came away with an engagement ring alongside her medal for finishing the race.\n\nKaitlyn Curran, a nurse at St. Barnabas Hospital, says she was hitting mile 16 in the marathon when she saw her boyfriend Dennis Galvin down on one knee Sunday.

The groups agreed to bring in mediators after negotiations stalled in September.\n\nThe union\u2019s contract expired in June though its members continue to work under the same terms. Under that agreement, a teacher\u2019s salary starts at $48,886 and tops out at $89,982 for a teacher with doctoral degrees, maximum college credits and 20 years\u2019 experience.\n\nThe union is seeking a 3 percent raise to base pay for this school year and next, and a 3.5 percent raise in 2020-21. The school district has proposed no increase for the current school year, a 0.75 percent increase next year and a 1.5 percent increase in 2020-21.\n\nThe district and union are also at odds over health benefits and items of contract language.\n\nIf a contract agreement isn\u2019t reached this week, the groups can either go back to bargaining or go to advisory arbitration.

The team would include four full-time forensic scientists and aims to process an additional 120 kits each year. The team and testing are estimated to cost $700,500 per year.\n\nEfforts to process and test the backlog of kits ramped up last year when the state Legislature required law enforcement agencies in the state to report the number of kits that had not been submitted for testing. Sexual assault kits contain possible physical evidence taken from victims or suspects.\n\nTesting in Alaska State Trooper cases is being funded by a $1.5 million federal grant awarded last year. All 577 of the state sexual assault kits have been submitted to a private lab for analysis, with the state receiving results from 340, according the department\u2019s report to the state Legislature last week. The remaining kits are expected to be processed by March.\n\nThe state crime lab is testing kits from the remaining 47 law enforcement agencies across the state.

That was the main thing that came out of tonight\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nJohn Gibson made 24 saves for the Ducks, who had been 0-5-2 since defeating the New York Islanders 4-1 on Oct. 17.\n\nPierre-Luc Dubois scored twice for the Blue Jackets, who lost the final two games of their three-game California road trip. Joonas Korpisalo made 27 saves.\n\nFowler scored on a one-timer from Adam Henrique to end Anaheim\u2019s losing skid. It was Fowler\u2019s 56th career goal, tying Francois Beauchemin for second-most by a Anaheim defenseman all-time.\n\nFowler also became the seventh defenseman in NHL history to cap a hat trick with an overtime winner. Anaheim defensemen are responsible for the past three such hat tricks, with Hampus Lindholm doing so on Dec. 21, 2017 and Lubomir Visnovsky on March 4, 2011.\n\nDubois earned a point for Columbus by scoring with 31.3 seconds remaining in the third period to tie the game at 2, but Fowler said the Ducks did not get down on themselves after conceding late.\n\n\u201cIt sounds silly, but it was pretty positive,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot as a team right now and I think it shows a lot about our group because we didn\u2019t panic. We played a great hockey game, it would have been easy to get a little bit down after giving up a late goal like that. But luckily we regrouped and found a way to get a big two points.\u201d\n\nHenrique and Ducks coach Randy Carlyle each praised Fowler for his leadership and offensive contributions, which took on an added importance after captain Ryan Getzlaf was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury.\n\nFowler scored twice in the second period, tying it at 1 at 9:09 during 4-on-4 play and putting the Ducks ahead 2-1 at 18:26. He has three goals and two assists during a three-game point streak.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a bigger exclamation mark on Cam Fowler than what he was able to accomplish tonight,\u201d Carlyle said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he\u2019s going to score three goals in every hockey game, but he drives a lot of puck possession and he\u2019s got a lot of responsibility on the power play. On the other side, we ask him to play defense and defense is hard work.\u201d\n\nGetzlaf is considered day to day, but Carlyle did not know if he would be available to play at Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe Blue Jackets ended up earning three of a possible six points during the road trip, which coach John Tortorella considered a positive result for a team he said is lacking in confidence right now.\n\n\u201cAnything offensively will help us, and that\u2019s a big point,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cWe leave the California trip .500 with a team that has zero confidence, so we\u2019ll take those points and just try to keep on building ourselves up.\u201d\n\nThe power play has been the most visible representation of Columbus\u2019 recent struggles, as the Blue Jackets went 0 for 6 with the man-advantage and are 2 for 38 in their past 10 games. Artemin Panarin appeared to have scored a power-play goal early in the third period, but it came immediately after Alexander Wennberg tripped Ducks defenseman Jacob Larsson.\n\nTortorella thought it was a sign of progress that the Blue Jackets were able to put the puck in the net, even if it was waived off.\n\n\u201cWe had opportunities to score, had a couple of rebound chances that we just missed,\u201d Tortorella said. \u201cYeah, if they score a goal, sure it helps us. But we\u2019ll take baby steps right now as far as just having them feel the puck and feel comfortable making plays. It\u2019s a crazy dynamic with athletes.

(AP) \u2014 One wears a uniform, carries a weapon, answers to a supreme commander and is obsessed with completing the mission.\n\nThe other served in the military.\n\nA bee and a veteran share a lot in common, which is at the heart of Heroes to Hives, a Michigan State University Extension program started by U.S. Army veteran and agricultural entomologist Adam Ingrao three years ago.\n\nHeroes to Hives teaches beekeeping to returning veterans, and is designed to be both therapeutic and entrepreneurial.\n\n\u201cThe thing about beekeeping, agriculture, all of those things, is it allows you to feel like you are serving something greater than yourself,\u201d Ingrao, who has a Ph.D. and is a veteran liaison at MSU, told The Detroit News . \u201cThe way I think about it is basically you have gone from ensuring the security of the United States to now ensuring the food security of the United States.\n\n\u201cYou are still serving a mission greater than yourself, and it\u2019s giving back to your community just like you did when you were in the service.\u201d\n\nHands-on sessions and workshops take place at the Kellogg Biological Station Bird Sanctuary in Augusta, and MSU Extension facilities in Chatham (in the Upper Peninsula), Traverse City, Saginaw and on the university\u2019s main campus in East Lansing. Heroes to Hives is also offered online.\n\nThrough a partnership with Ford Motor Co., which has launched its own beekeeping program at World Headquarters in Dearborn, Heroes to Hives will be expanding to a company-owned facility, the 882-acre Cherry Hill Farm in Washtenaw County, starting in 2019.\n\nDuring the first year, 15 of 45 applicants were accepted into the nine-month program.\n\n\u201cWe had no idea what we would be able to take on,\u201d said Ingrao, whose enrollment has since been opened to all veterans and expanded to include their spouses.\n\nWorking with nature\u2019s winged warriors unraveled a mix of emotions and memories from former military members in the program during that first year, said Ingrao, who struggled with depression himself after being discharged from the U.S. Army in 2004.\n\n\u201cWe had two particular students who had seen a lot of combat, and being able to see them open up over the context of the beehives was really amazing,\u201d said Ingrao, who used his Lansing area home\u2019s living room as a lecture hall and kitchen as a lab where students studied bees and insects in that first year. His woodshop became a workshop where students would build hives.\n\n\u201cHaving frank discussions about people in combat . One of the people I worked with had been shot down twice. They were out in the aprium (hybrid fruit) area, and they could hear two Hueys (helicopters) off in the background, and he immediately looked up and we started talking about what that meant to him. He basically opened up about what that experience was like.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the class, we had a honey harvest. One of the student\u2019s partners comes up to my wife and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know where he would be if not for this program.\u2019\u201d\n\nNick Kaminski, a former U.S. Marine who saw combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, can\u2019t explain the tranquility the buzz from beekeeping provides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a reward-based feeling and there is quite certainly a calming effect to it,\u201d said Kaminski, a staff sergeant who served with Charlie Battery 1st Battalion 12th Marines in Hawaii. \u201cI can\u2019t quite, I guess, accurately describe to anybody in a way they would understand it, because at the end of the day, this is keeping of a venomous insect, and it may be difficult for some people to understand how or why that might be calming, but there\u2019s a lot to it.\u201d\n\nBees have a way of keeping their minders in the present, Ingrao said. The insect will sting if it feels the person nearby is not harmony with it.\n\nThomas Kusar, who runs Kusar Farms with Marie Jaegers, has been stung at least 40 times. Jaegers estimates she\u2019s received 20 to 30 bee spears.\n\nKusar served in the U.S. Marines as a helicopter repairman; Jaegers in the U.S. Army as a combat medic. The couple graduated the Heroes to Hives program.\n\n\u201cI got stung this Saturday. I mean it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh damn. That hurts,\u2019\u201d said Kusar, whose Fowler-based farm will increase from three to 14 hives next year, thanks to a grant from the Farm Veterans Coalition.\n\nFor combat veterans, a sting can be a jarring reminder to shift their focus to the here and now.\n\n\u201cI think through the context of beekeeping, we are able to get out of those memories,\u201d said Ingrao, who was discharged from the U.S. Army in 2004 after severely injuring his ankle. \u201cSo, if I have a bad combat experience that I am constantly reliving, that time in the bee apiary is not about reliving those experiences, it\u2019s about being present with that organism right now.\n\n\u201cThat is something that I harp on a lot: If you are not here, if you are not being present with this organism, they are going to let you know, and the way they are going to let you know is they are going to sting you.\u201d\n\nThis year, 108 veterans and spouses took part in Heroes to Hives. As the program has grown, sponsors such as AT&T Foundation and GreenStone Farm Credit Services have jumped in with support.\n\nWorkshops this year included ones focusing on beekeeping\u2019s therapeutic attributes.\n\nOne session involved the use of yoga and meditation through interacting with nature\u2019s honey producers. Another centered on apitherapy, which entails the use of bee stings to treat arthritis and other ailments.\n\nAbout 30 percent of students attend on-site courses while the remainder prefers the online version due to the driving distances involved, Ingrao said.\n\nFor instance, Nick Kaminski commuted 1.5 hours to take part in classes at Kellogg Bird Sanctuary. His spouse, Nicole Kaminski, a veterinarian technician, took Heroes to Hives online.\n\nThose hardships are why Ford pledged involvement is critical, Ingrao said. With the expansion to Washtenaw County, Heroes to Hives will expand to southeast Michigan where a good portion of the state\u2019s 608,000 veterans reside.\n\nAndrew Hobbs, global director of Ford\u2019s Environmental Quality Office, believes Heroes to Hives checks off two major items on the automaker\u2019s list: helping the environment by assisting urban farmers and lending a hand to veterans.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned was that this beekeeping type program was hugely beneficial to the disabled veteran community in terms of PTSD and that was their focus and how they could deal with it,\u201d Hobbs said.\n\n\u201cSo what better combination then you know dealing or providing the opportunities with our local veterans to come and manage our hives with us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Detroit News, http://detnews.com/", "JONESBORO, Ark.

She invites parents to come for an evening of art projects and guided discussion with their children about their projects.\n\nThis fall at Bridges, Muehlenhardt\u2019s after school art club is painting a hallway mural. She sketched images and words of encouragement that were suggested by students and the students are adding the color.\n\nEach spring Muehlenhardt holds a family arts night at Rosa Parks with student artwork and guest artists leading activities and giving demonstrations.\n\nMuehlenhardt has been teaching at Rosa Parks since 2010 and Bridges since 2016.\n\nShe started her career in the Waconia School District but was laid off three years later when the district cut art class from the elementary curriculum.\n\nShe spent the next five years at Capstone Publishing, where she illustrated dozens of children\u2019s books and created a series of drawing instruction books.\n\nBut teaching was her calling.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to get back into the classroom.

(AP) \u2014 Before Ken and Gloria Trom finally decided to convert the last of their Udolpho Township cropland into native prairie, they got a bit of help from Mower County \u2014 a drill bit, that is.\n\nThe couple had already noticed dozens of native species taking hold on the land.\n\nWhen they decided last year to make the conversion of cropland to prairie land, through the federal Conservation Reserve Program, they used a no-till drill planter purchased this year by Mower Soil and Water Conservation District. They used the drill to convert nearly 100 acres to native plants. They planted butterfly milkweed, prairie blazing star, stiff goldenrod, sneezeweed, black-eyed Susan and partridge pea, all without tilling the land.\n\nNo-tillage planters leave soil undisturbed while depositing new seeds. Soil and surrounding plants can stay intact during planting.\n\nLand owners who want to plant buffer zones, prairie plants, cover crops, wildflowers and pasture can rent the drill from the conservation district.\n\n\u201cIt makes it more feasible and convenient for Mower County landowners,\u201d Tim Ruzek, water plan and outreach coordinator, told Agri News .\n\nMore than a dozen landowners rented the drill for projects in all corners of Mower County this year. Having it available actually spurred some landowners to undertake conservation projects when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe demand and a late start on planting season this spring means some landowners will have to wait until next year to use it.\n\n\u201cWe had more interest than we could accommodate,\u201d Ruzek said.\n\nThe planter was purchased with donations and funding from Friends of the Jay C. Hormel Nature Center, Pheasants Forever of Mower County, the Austin chapter of the Audubon Society and the Austin chapter of the Izaak Walton League.\n\n\u201cWithout the local groups\u2019 support, we could not have acquired this much-needed equipment,\u201d said Justin Hanson, Mower Soil and Water Conservation District manager.\n\nNo-till planters have residue managers, finger coulters and double-disk openers that move some residue soil from the row to improve seed-to-soil contact.\n\nThe new equipment has improved what have already been strong conservation efforts in Mower County, conservation officials said.\n\nIn September, Mower Soil and Water Conservation District\u2019s Board of Supervisors honored the Troms as the county\u2019s 2018 Outstanding Wildlife Conservationists.\n\nThe couple had been undertaking conservation and native vegetation restoration for decades since buying the land. The support from the county and the no-till drill helped them with their latest project, they said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Agri News, http://www.agrinews.com/", "MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Scott Novotny\u2019s nickname was well deserved.\n\nEach fall, the hardware store \u201cMr. Salty\u201d bought from his parents in 2006 would become rimmed with pallets of ice melt in preparation for the inevitable slick sidewalks and driveways that accompany Wisconsin winters. The 50 pound bags would be stacked in front of the store along the sidewalk and wrap around the south side of the building into the small parking lot and dwindle away as spring approached.\n\nBut in July 2017, Novotny died from bone cancer that was diagnosed just six months earlier. He was 55, the Wisconsin State Journal reported .\n\nHis death could have meant the end for Quality True Value Hardware but the tons of ice melt and the family business have been retained along with Novotny\u2019s legacy and philosophies.\n\nNovotny\u2019s wife of more than 30 years, Sherry Novotny, continues to own the company while their three children have taken over the day-to-day operation of the 3,000-square-foot store that is split into two levels. And just in case there\u2019s any questions about how things should be done, there are not-so subtle reminders strategically tacked and taped up throughout the store.\n\nThe \u201cWhat Would Dad Do\u201d signs can be seen, among other places, below the screen of the cash register at the front of the store and on a bulletin board in the store\u2019s office downstairs. They help guide his children and the store\u2019s two other employees in their approach to the business, that has been a staple here since 1945 and that has survived recessions, a fire in 1988, a few robbery attempts, the arrival of big box retailers and on-line sales.\n\n\u201cWe find ourselves asking that quite a bit,\u201d Shawna Novotny said of the signs about her father. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult but we also have the sense that we\u2019re making him proud and following through with what he wanted. We\u2019re carrying it on and following in his footsteps.\u201d\n\nShawna Novotny, 29, is joined by her two brothers, Shane Novotny, 34, and Skyler Novotny, 27. All three have worked at the store since before they graduated from Oregon High School and had been taking on more responsibility even before their father got sick. Only now, the weight of the family business is on their collective shoulders and has also undergone a slight name change to just Quality Hardware.\n\nTrue Value was purchased by Acon, a private equity firm, earlier this year, a move that did away with the company\u2019s co-op and left retailers without a majority say on the board of directors. The transition allowed the Novotnys to end its relationship with True Value and switch to Orgill as its primary vendor.\n\nOrgill was founded in 1847 and is one of the fastest-growing independent hardware distributors in the world. The Tennessee-based company serves more than 6,000 retailers, has seen its sales double over the last 10 years with sales in 2018 expected to hit $2.5 billion. The move is allowing the Novotny family to lower its prices on 75 percent of the 16,000 items in the store.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we\u2019re really excited about,\u201d said Shawna Novotny. \u201cI feel some may associate going independent with slightly higher prices due to a lack of purchasing leverage, but that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nHer grandparents, Ralph and Gloria Novotny, took over the hardware store in 1971 with Scott and Sherry Novotny buying the business and switching to True Value from Ace just a few years before the 2008 recession. The closing of the Dorn True Value on Broom Street in February has pushed some customers to the Novotnys but with over 800 commercial house accounts, Quality Hardware derives just 20 percent of its sales from walk-in customers from the neighborhood. The remaining 80 percent is to management companies, UW-Madison, construction companies and other businesses. Although, the percentages are on their way to a more 70-30 ratio.\n\nHowever, the store, with just two other employees besides the Novotnys, is not open on Sundays.\n\n\u201cWe want to draw in more (business) from the neighborhood,\u201d Shane Novotny said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve always struggled on and a lot of it has to do with the pricing perception. We beat or match (the big boxes) constantly on everything from snowblowers to faucets.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj", "In this Sept. 29, 2018, photo, Casey Smith, left, and Eric Oertel, pose for a photo at Horlick Field during a game between Racine Lutheran High School and Milwaukee Saint Thomas More in Racine, Wis. (Peter Jackel/The Journal Times via AP)\n\nRACINE, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Casey Smith didn\u2019t particularly like Eric Oertel when they first crossed paths in August 2006.\n\nThe Racine Lutheran High School football team had just reported for practice that summer and one of its leaders was Smith, a junior linebacker. The son of longtime Lutheran coach Scott Smith was mature beyond his years, played the game the way it is supposed to be played and valued winning more than anything.\n\nOertel was an incoming freshman running back and linebacker that August and Casey Smith was turned off by what he considered to be his self-assured mindset that bordered on cocky. No freshman, even as talented as Oertel was, should just assume he was going to play on this team.\n\n\u201cHe was saying something on Myspace (a social media platform) about how he was going to get playing time right away,\u201d Smith told The Journal Times . \u201cWe had some good ballplayers back then and I was like, \u2018Who is this kid? He\u2019s not going to get any playing time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTruth be known, Smith wasn\u2019t exactly Oertel\u2019s favorite teammate at the time, either.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re that young, you have a very self-centered way of thinking and football was everything to me at that point,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cAnd football was everything to him in the same regard. When you have two head-strong people who are very dedicated to their craft, you bump heads a little bit.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we figured out that we wanted the same thing.\u201d\n\nCircumstances beyond football would draw the two closer by the end of that year. As the years passed, they became best friends who keep an eye out for one another as officers for the Mount Pleasant Police Department and are there for each other through each step of their lives.\n\nSmith, an only son, had a brother for the first time.\n\nAnd so did Oertel, who was adopted by Dan and Carol Oertel and was an only child.\n\n\u201cEric will always be there for me and he always has if I need him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI will always be there for him.\u201d\n\nGradually during that 2006 season, animosity made way for acceptance between Smith and Oertel and they established common ground. Both came to understand that winning was what mattered most to each of them.\n\nAnd then Dan and Carol Oertel divorced in late 2006, sending Eric into a traumatic emotional void. Scott Smith asked Casey Smith to be a buddy for Eric Oertel during this time and he accepted his father\u2019s request with the conviction he had on a football field.\n\nThere would be no going through the motions. Casey Smith was going to put his heart into being an older brother for Eric Oertel.\n\n\u201cIt was a time for him and I to bond,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cIt was a big hurt for a 14-year-old kid. It wasn\u2019t easy. I was in a tough place at that time in my life and he came along as the big brother that I needed at that moment. It was real cool to see.\u201d\n\nSmith graduated from Lutheran in 2008 and was a four-year starter for Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri. Oertel graduated two years later after becoming the all-time leading rusher in Racine County history and earning first-team AP All-State honors as a senior running back in the fall of 2009.\n\nBut their friendship continued to evolve, even from long-range. When Oertel went through stretches of frustration as a member of the Washington State University football team, Smith was only a phone call away. When Smith\u2019s football career was abruptly ended by a neck injury during the fourth game of his senior season in 2011, it was Oertel who talked his buddy through the loss of something he loved.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty hard for me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen I had to stop playing football my senior year, it was pretty hard to comprehend. I never wanted to take myself out of a game and now football was being taken away from me.\n\n\u201cWhen I had tests to see how bad it was, Eric was one of my first phone calls. He said, \u2018You have to be thankful for the time you had to play football.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith, 28, joined the Mount Pleasant Police Department in August 2012, just after he received a degree in criminal justice from Southwest Baptist. Partly because of Smith\u2019s influence, Oertel joined him two years later after graduating from Washington State.\n\nWith Smith on second shift and Oertel on third shift, the two typically don\u2019t work together. But they do in overtime situations, which come up several times a year, and they constantly have each other\u2019s back when things get tense.\n\n\u201cThis car went flying right past him and the driver never hit his brakes,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEric said he was going to make a traffic stop. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll start heading that way.\u2019 He must have had the phone on the center counsel and it was still going, so I could hear him trying to catch up to this car.\n\n\u201cI could just tell in his voice that this car might not be stopping. Right away, I could tell, \u2018Oh, Eric might get into something here and I want to be there for him in case this guy runs.\u2019 That\u2019s not what happened, but I think it\u2019s just intuition. You\u2019re friends with someone for so long and you can tell what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\nOertel was also there for Smith \u2014 and this time, the incident was far more serious.\n\n\u201cAbout two years ago, Casey was dealing with a very large, combative subject,\u201d the 26-year-old Oertel said. \u201cI drove to his location as fast as I could because I knew there was a very good chance that he was going to have to physically subdue the subject.\n\n\u201cI was right because when I showed up, the subject was extremely uncooperative and started fighting with Casey and I. Casey\u2019s cousin, Cody (also a Mount Pleasant police officer) was there with us and it took all three of us to take the very large subject into custody.\n\n\u201cCasey and I are alike in that we would drop anything at work if we knew one another was in any kind of danger.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also there for each other in times of celebration. That never more was the case than June 25, 2016, when Oertel married former Horlick standout athlete Justine Boerger and Smith served as his best man.\n\n\u201cHe literally did renovations to his house, adding bedrooms, months before so all my friends and teammates from Washington had a place to stay,\u201d Oertel said. \u201cHe also hosted them for the entirety of their stay.\n\n\u201cOn my wedding day, he took the time to come find me when I went on a walk by myself just an hour before my wedding, just to pray with me. That moment is one of the top-five moments that will stick with me forever,\u201d\n\nBrothers are what Casey Smith and Eric Oertel will always be.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Journal Times, http://www.journaltimes.com", "BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Shelley Samples could have earned $25,000 more in salary this school year teaching for Waterford schools.\n\nBut she turned her back on that for a chance to live in Battle Creek, closer to her daughter and grandchildren.\n\nHer new employer, Battle Creek Public Schools, softened the financial blow by giving her $10,000 to help buy a home. Samples, a special education teacher at Battle Creek Central High School, might even get another $10,000 in matching funds to remodel her kitchen and bathroom.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love it,\u201d she said of her new home on Eaton Street. \u201cIt\u2019s got a fenced-in back yard, sidewalks, amazing neighbors, and it\u2019s a quiet, friendly community.\u201d\n\nThe city of Battle Creek received a $1.5 million grant last year from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to provide support for entrepreneurs and to strengthen struggling neighborhoods.\n\nThe grant included $750,000 for a housing incentive program for BCPS teachers and central office and building administrators who commit to the district for three years and want to live in eligible neighborhoods, most of them on the north end of town.\n\nThe city had initially planned to give no-interest loans of up to $3,000 for down payments or closings and up to $12,000 for renovations. But changed the terms and amounts after meeting with the district.\n\nThe updated program, designed to attract teachers to live in neighborhoods within the district, now provides up to 20 percent of a home\u2019s value \u2014 or a maximum of $10,000 \u2014 for down payment assistance, closing costs or for mortgage buy-downs to reduce monthly mortgage expense.\n\nThe program also provides an incentive of up to $10,000 in matching funds to teachers and administrators buying homes and for those already living in the district who want to make improvements to their existing homes.\n\nSo far, 19 teachers and five administrators have inquired about the program and 18 have applied to purchase or renovate a home, said Chris Lussier, the city\u2019s community development manager. Fourteen teachers or administrators have applied to buy a home, while four have applied for matching funds to renovate their homes.\n\n\u201cThe housing incentive is very important because everyone benefits when teachers and administrators live in the communities where they work,\u201d Anita Harvey, director of district transformation, told the Battle Creek Enquirer . \u201cIt creates a closer-knit community where we all can play an integral part of the community and (be) invested in the community.\u201d\n\nSamples and six other teachers have already received down payment assistance. Two other teachers have received money to renovate their homes.\n\nThe city is contracting all of the renovation work, including writing work specifications, preparing bid packages, hiring contractors, inspecting workmanship, processing payments and maintaining records for two mains reasons: because city workers already do that type of work and to help the teachers manage the projects financially.\n\nThe program ends on May 30, 2020.\n\nLussier said the city benefits when teachers live in city neighborhoods. It\u2019s also a great benefit, he said, when more people buy homes in city neighborhoods and move closer to the downtown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going great,\u201d Lussier said. \u201cThe goal was to create meaningful incentives for Battle Creek teachers, and I think we\u2019ve done that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of teachers that are taking advantage of this program, and it\u2019s also successfully attracting teachers to buy and, in some cases, to renovate homes in Battle Creek neighborhoods,\u201d he added.\n\nLaVon Hunt, a prekindergarten teacher, found out about the renovation incentive on her birthday. She applied for the money the next day.\n\nShe and her husband, Denny Hunt, are investing $33,000 this year to renovate their home on East Avenue. LaVon Hunt said she\u2019ll now forgo her plans to retire in two years and stick around for a third.\n\n\u201cI told my husband, I just got a $10,000 birthday gift,\u201d she said.\n\nOver the past 23 years, the Hunts have spent more than $50,000 on their home, renovating their kitchen and dining room, adding a hardwood floor to the kitchen. They\u2019ve also added new siding, windows, roof and remodeled the upstairs.\n\nBut there was still a need for outdoor renovations.\n\nThanks to the housing incentive, they\u2019ll widen their driveway, replace sidewalks and crumbling steps, regrade their back yard for drainage purposes and install retaining walls.\n\nThe driveway alone cost them $17,000, the retaining walls another $7,000.\n\n\u201cI feel very blessed. I sort of feel like it dropped out of heaven,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThe Kellogg Foundation is helping our district and, in essence, our city.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Battle Creek Enquirer, http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com", "This photo taken Nov. 11, 2016, shows a couple looking at the names on the Cleveland County Veteran's Memorial during the Veterans Day and Memorial Ceremony, in Reavs Park in Norman, Okla.

Much in demand were blankets to ward of the chill, a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat.\n\nMany people went to medical tents to get treatment for blistered and aching feet, illness and other maladies. \u201cSince we got here, we have not stopped,\u201d said Tania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City\u2019s public health department.\n\nMelvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was traveling with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8.

Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence; others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support loved ones back home.\n\nAlba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she had walked for five hours and hitched a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 people. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.\n\n\u201cI looked for work, and nothing,\u201d Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn\u2019t do worse. \u201cAnd when one does find a little job they kill you for the money,\u201d she said.\n\nArriving in Mexico City, some migrants stopped at the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a major pilgrimage site, to thank the Virgin Mary for watching over them during the journey.\n\nMany had struck out ahead of the larger caravan but intended to regroup in the capital. Oscar Ulloa, 20, an accountant from Honduras, said he arrived by bus from Puebla thanks to handouts from Mexicans. He expected the group would assemble and vote in the coming days on their next moves.\n\nThe 178-mile trek (286 kilometers) Monday from the Gulf state of Veracruz to Mexico City was the longest single-day journey for the group of about 4,000 migrants.\n\nBut there were obstacles on this latest stretch.\n\nTruck after truck denied the migrants rides as they trudged along the highway into the relatively colder November temperatures of central highland Mexico.\n\nAt a toll booth near Fortin, Veracruz, Rafael Leyva, an unemployed cobbler from Honduras, stood with a few hundred others for more than 45 minutes without finding a ride.\n\n\u201cPeople help more in Chiapas and Oaxaca,\u201d Leyva said, referring to the southern Mexican states the group had already traversed and where pickup trucks frequently stopped to offer rides.\n\nMigrants converged on tractor trailers, forcing the big rigs to stop so they could climb aboard. Such impromptu hitchhiking is precarious with dozens scrambling onto vehicles at a time.\n\nCesar Rodas, 24, had pushed a friend\u2019s wheelchair for 24 days across three countries. But he couldn\u2019t lift his friend and the chair onto a truck bed crammed with 150 people. Rodas was trying to get Sergio Cazares, a 40-year-old paraplegic from Honduras, to the U.S. for an operation that Cazares hopes will allow him to walk again.\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\nMany said they remain convinced that traveling together is their best hope for reaching the U.S.\n\nYuri Juarez, 42, said he thinks there\u2019s a \u201cvery low\u201d chance he will get asylum in the United States. But he said he had no way to work back home in Villanueva, Guatemala, where he closed his internet cafe after gang members extorted him, robbed his customers and finally stole his computers.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having at least three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz. The largest group has been followed by about 1,000 who crossed over from Guatemala last week and a second group of about the same size that waded over the Suchiate River on Friday.\n\nMexico\u2019s Interior Ministry estimated over the weekend that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through Mexico. The ministry said 2,793 migrants have applied for refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their home countries.\n\nThe presidents of Guatemala and Honduras, which have been under intense pressure from the Trump administration, called Monday for an investigation to identify the organizers of the caravan.\n\nHonduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said that \u201cthousands\u201d of his countrymen have returned to Honduras. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales went further, calling for an investigation of people who \u201cpromote or participate\u201d in the caravan, saying they \u201cshould be judged based on international laws.\u201d\n\nMost of the migrants interviewed say they joined the caravan spontaneously to stay safe, and many were already on the road when it caught up to them. Activist groups that have been trying to help organize things appear to have emerged only after it formed and began moving north.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie contributed to this report.", "CONCORD, N.H.

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)\n\nCORDOBA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Tired, swollen and blistered feet are among the biggest challenges for the thousands of Central American migrants making their way through southern Mexico in hopes of starting new lives in the United States.\n\nThree weeks of pounding the hot asphalt of highways every day takes a toll, especially for those plodding along in flimsy flip flops. Whenever possible, the migrants discard damaged footwear, replacing them with donated shoes found at stops along the way or with spare pairs they carry in backpacks.\n\nThe most grueling days demand treks of more than 100 miles (160 kilometers). Migrants eager to find strength in numbers must keep that pace to remain with the group. And they do so in cheap shoes and sweat-drenched socks, which they eagerly peel off at the end of each day.\n\nBlisters are a nasty foe for migrant feet, young and old alike. Red Cross personnel at waystations bandage swollen feet or apply antiseptic to broken blisters. Children wince as their wounds are treated. Flies gather on open sores. The risk of infection is high.\n\n\u201cThese are extreme conditions,\u201d says Ignacio Escotto, a Mexican vascular surgeon who specializes in treating extremities. Unrelenting contact with hot pavement will cause the feet to swell, he says, while dehydration and malnutrition wreak havoc on soft tissue. \u201cAt the end of the day, this articulation must be painful.\u201d\n\nYet the migrants hobble through the pain, determined to reach the U.S. They grin and bear it as they limp along. Those who can no longer take it bow out of the caravan. The Mexican government says around 3,000 migrants have applied for refuge in Mexico in recent weeks and about 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nOn Sunday, 21-year-old Marisol Salamanca dug into a pile of donated shoes at a sports facility in Cordoba in search of a replacement for the sandals she has padded around in since leaving El Salvador several weeks earlier. \u201cI keep tripping and hurting myself,\u201d she said.\n\nDarwin Hueso, a 39-year-old-farmer from Honduras, was also thrilled to find fresh shoes, even though they were a bit tight and formal. The soles of the work boots he has been wearing for more than 21 days are inflexible and tough.\n\nAdan Lara Barahona, 62, a wiry rancher from Potrerillos, Honduras, dismissed the blisters on his feet as a minor nuisance. \u201cThey are drying out already,\u201d he said, complaining instead of dizziness brought on by a severe respiratory infection.\n\nThere\u2019s no turning back for Lara Barahona, who says gangs killed his wife and two of his children seven months ago when he didn\u2019t pay them protection money.\n\nMany of the about 4,000 migrants in the caravan have now covered more than 800 miles since setting out from Honduras on Oct. 13, hitching rides on flatbed trucks when possible and they face another more than 800-mile trek to the nearest U.S. border crossing. Clamors have grown in recent days for buses to transport scores from the caravan to the Mexican capital, where the fatigued travelers hope to find respite and medical treatment. Those buses haven\u2019t come.\n\nThe group now finds itself in the Gulf state of Veracruz, traversing what some call the \u201croute of death\u201d because of the large number of migrants who have disappeared in the state in recent years. It is unclear what part of the U.S. border they will aim for eventually, but their latest overnight stay in Veracruz could be one of their last before they head to Mexico City, a potential launching spot for a broader array of destinations.\n\nInspired by their progress and outpouring of support from townspeople along the way, several smaller caravans of migrants have formed in Central America in recent weeks in an attempt to improve their odds of making it to the U.S.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Stevenson reported in Cordoba and AP writer Amy Guthrie reported from Mexico City.

China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, the latest venue for their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia. (AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) \u2014 China and India are closely watching the constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, which has been a battleground in their struggle for geopolitical supremacy in South Asia.\n\nChinese and Indian diplomats have been careful not to overtly take sides in the political turmoil, which has seen President Maithripala Sirisena oust Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, replace him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, and suspend Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe, meanwhile, has holed up at the prime minister\u2019s residence and insisted he is Sri Lanka\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nThe caution exercised by the Asian giants stands in contrast to calls from Western diplomats for Parliament to immediately be summoned for a floor vote on Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment and underscores the economic and military importance the countries place on the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hedging their bets,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s South Asia Center. India and China \u201cboth have stakes in the global system and want to play a bigger role, so they have to signal they\u2019ll work with whomever.\u201d\n\nFor China, Sri Lanka is a critical link in its massive Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to use infrastructure projects to expand trade across a vast arc of 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. It has handed out billions of dollars in loans for Sri Lankan projects over the past decade.\n\nLocated just 23 kilometers (14 miles) off its southeast coast, India sees Sri Lanka as a bulwark in its military defenses to ward off potential Chinese incursions and also sees the island as a key partner for regional trade. India has grown wary of China\u2019s economic influence over Sri Lanka and was troubled by a 2014 port visit from a Chinese submarine and warship.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s ties to both nations date back thousands of years. It was a stop along China\u2019s old Silk Road trade routes, where merchants picked up pepper, cinnamon, ivory and pearl.\n\nSri Lanka traces much of its genealogy and culture to India, with folklore saying the island\u2019s majority Sinhalese are descendants of an Indian prince banished there 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe nation\u2019s minority Tamils, meanwhile, are in part the descendants of more than a million tea and rubber plantation workers brought to Sri Lanka from southern India by British colonial rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nYet that hasn\u2019t always led to smooth relations. During Sri Lanka\u2019s decadeslong civil war, which pitted Tamil rebels against the government, India intervened in the 1980s by sending a peacekeeping force that quickly found itself engaged in battle with the rebels. They were asked to withdraw a few years later amid allegations of abuses against Tamils.\n\nChina filled the vacuum left by India, providing military assistance that helped the Rajapaksa-led government defeat the rebels in 2009. In 2012, China helped block a UN Human Rights Council resolution demanding that the Sri Lankan government investigate war crimes. It would later pass, but it prompted little action by Rajapaksa, who was in power from 2005 to 2015.\n\nChina is partly involved in the current crisis because of tensions over the billions of dollars of loans it has given to build a network of highways, the Hambantota seaport and airport in Rajapaksa\u2019s home district, and other projects. The most iconic of these has been the $1.5 billion port city being built on reclaimed land off Colombo\u2019s coast.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s debt more than tripled during Rajapaksa\u2019s presidency, Sri Lankan Central Bank figures show.\n\nNew Delhi and other international critics have called the loans a debt trap.\n\nCentral bank figures , however, show that Sri Lanka\u2019s debt to India stood at 145 billion rupees (about $19.9 billion) in 2017 versus 135 billion rupees (about $18.5 billion) owed to China the same year.\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s defeat at the polls in 2015 was partly a reaction to all of that debt, said Gopalaswamy, the analyst.\n\nLikewise, Wickremesinghe, prime minster from 2015, saw his popularity begin to wane last year after his government handed over operations of the Hambantota port to a Chinese company in a 99-year lease.\n\n\u201cFrom a democracy perspective, there\u2019s been huge public resentment because the quality of these projects is questionable, there\u2019s little parliamentary scrutiny and no one knows where this money ends up,\u201d Gopalaswamy said.\n\nResponding to public outrage over the lease, China in July offered Sirisena a nearly $300 million grant that the president said could be used \u201cfor any project of my wish.\u201d\n\nWith so much at stake, the Chinese ambassador to Sri Lanka, Cheng Xueyuan, was among the first to congratulate Rajapaksa after he was appointed prime minister on Oct. 27. But that day, Cheng also visited Temple Trees, the official prime minister\u2019s residence, where Wickremesinghe has been holed up since his ouster.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said that Cheng\u2019s visits to rival prime ministers was simply part of China\u2019s policy of maintaining \u201cfriendly exchanges will all parties in Sri Lanka,\u201d repeating China\u2019s routine assertion that it doesn\u2019t interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\nBut after the surprise win of an opposition candidate in the Maldives who campaigned on a promise to reduce China\u2019s role in the Indian Ocean archipelago nation, Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic position has increased. If projects in the Maldives are canceled, Sri Lanka would be China\u2019s main Indian Ocean link between Asia and the Seychelles, off the coast of East Africa.\n\nA spokesman for Sri Lanka\u2019s new government, Kehaliya Rambukwella, said Rajapaksa had spoken to Chinese officials about revising the terms of the Hambantota port lease.\n\nNew Delhi doesn\u2019t have many options for how to respond to the crisis, said G. Parthasarthy, a retired Indian diplomat and an expert on Sri Lanka affairs.\n\n\u201cWe would like to see South Asia integrated much more closely with India, so we cannot be seen as taking sides,\u201d Parthasarthy said, adding that India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe in separate visits to New Delhi last month.\n\nThe day after his ouster, Wickremesinghe met with Colombo-based diplomats from the U.S., Britain, Australia, the European Union and India, among others. Many issued statements calling for the country\u2019s constitution and democracy to be respected. Sirisena held his own meeting with foreign diplomats on Oct. 29.\n\nWickremesinghe said he hasn\u2019t received any official support from foreign powers, nor has he sought any.\n\n\u201cI agree with them that the constitution must be followed,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the crisis began, constitutional scholars have argued over whether Sri Lankan law allowed the president to remove the prime minster and appoint someone new.\n\nSirisena on Sunday ordered Parliament to reconvene Nov. 14 for a confidence vote on Rajapaksa. China and India will be closely watching to see if the vote eases or exacerbates the crisis.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo and Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report.", "Bishop Richard Malone, Bishop of Buffalo, speaks during a news conference Monday, Nov. 5, 2018, in Cheektowaga, N.Y.

Two priests at the meeting asked for his resignation, he said.\n\nOutside Infant of Prague church in suburban Cheektowaga, where the meeting took place, a handful of people carried signs calling for Malone\u2019s resignation and told priests entering the church they were praying for them.\n\n\u201cThe secrets have gone on for far too long,\u201d said Mary Ellen Sanfilippo, who attends St. Mary\u2019s in Swormville, where a priest resigned over the summer amid allegations of misconduct involving a young man. \u201cThis has been like an explosion to the people and to our faith.\u201d\n\nPressure on Malone has intensified in recent weeks following revelations that his former executive assistant, Siobhan O\u2019Connor, secretly copied and leaked internal emails to reporters after becoming concerned that Malone had left accused priests in ministry and purposely excluded others from the list of 42 names he made public in March.\n\nMalone has acknowledged making mistakes handling cases involving adult complainants, including recommending one for a job as a cruise ship chaplain, but said he never knowingly allowed a priest accused of child abuse to remain in ministry.\n\nThe establishment of the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program in March, he said, added to a flood of new complaints.\n\n\u201cWe asked the victims to come forward.

No priest ordained in the past 20 years has been accused, Quinlan said.\n\nThe revised priest list released Monday includes priests from other religious orders, which had previously been excluded. Diocesan officials said they would not name an additional 66 dead priests who were the subject of a single complaint.\n\nThe diocese is cooperating with state and federal investigations into clergy abuse, attorney Terrence Connors said.", "Today in History\n\nToday is Monday, Nov. 5, the 309th day of 2018.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Serge Ibaka outscored the Lakers by himself in the first quarter, and he didn\u2019t miss a shot until the third. He beat LA inside and outside on the way to the biggest offensive game of his career.\n\nThanks to Ibaka\u2019s brilliance for the Toronto Raptors, Kawhi Leonard wasn\u2019t missed by anyone except the Lakers fans who might have been hoping to entice him home.\n\nIbaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn\u2019t need an injured Leonard in a 121-107 victory over Los Angeles on Sunday night.\n\nIbaka had 10 rebounds and didn\u2019t miss a shot until 5:16 remained in the third quarter, finishing 15 of 17. He was overpowering while the Raptors jumped to a stunning 31-point lead in the first quarter, and he returned in the final minutes to close out Toronto\u2019s eighth consecutive win over the Lakers.\n\n\u201cI was just focused,\u201d Ibaka said. \u201cI knew Kawhi was out tonight, so I just wanted to go out there and do my best.\u201d\n\nWith the Lakers\u2019 small lineups struggling to contain Ibaka early on, he became the first player to start a game 14 of 14 from the field since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did it in February 2006, according to the NBA.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cThe best thing is he\u2019s doing it with some real good composure. He\u2019s getting in there and taking his time. He\u2019s using his size, his power, and using pretty good footwork, so it\u2019s something we can go to.\u201d\n\nKyle Lowry added 21 points and 15 assists for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors, who haven\u2019t lost to the Lakers since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to put some pressure on them and guard the ball,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe got off to an unbelievable start. We looked athletic and fast all over the place tonight.\u201d\n\nToronto didn\u2019t let its huge lead dwindle significantly until the final minutes, when the Lakers\u2019 youngster got the margin down to 117-107 with LeBron James on the bench. Toronto was forced to re-insert its starters in the final minutes to preserve the win.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been playing like they\u2019re the best team in the Eastern Conference so far,\u201d said James, who finished with 18 points and six assists. \u201cThey just came out and hit us right in the mouth, and it\u2019s going to be very hard to make a game of that when you\u2019re trying to expend so much energy to get back into it.\u201d\n\nKyle Kuzma scored 24 points and Brandon Ingram added 16 for the Lakers, who are 4-6 after their first 10 games with James after this defeat on the tail end of a back-to-back set that began with a gritty win in Portland on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, unfortunately, most of the time when a player like Kawhi sits out, that team ends up winning,\u201d Lakers coach Luke Walton said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of freedom and joy that comes when a top player like that is out. We tried to explain that that\u2019s part of how this works, but it doesn\u2019t seem like we took that to heart.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nRaptors: Leonard has sat out three of his first 10 games with Toronto, missing two games last month to manage his workload coming back from last season\u2019s injury struggles. He injured his foot late in the Raps\u2019 win at Phoenix on Friday night. Nurse doesn\u2019t know whether Leonard will play Monday at Utah. ... OG Anunoby took Leonard\u2019s spot in the starting lineup and contributed seven points.\n\nLakers: Starting with their fourth-quarter slump in Portland, the Lakers were outscored 75-34 in a 21:16 stretch spanning the two games. ... Fans at courtside included Denzel Washington, Kristen Bell, Dax Shepard, Ariel Winter, middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez, New York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and UFC featherweight title contender Brian Ortega, who will fight Max Holloway for the belt in Toronto on Dec. 8.\n\nBYE KAWHI\n\nLeonard sat out with soreness in his left foot, depriving Lakers fans of their only look at the superstar before he could become an unrestricted free agent next summer.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers spent the week telling anyone who asked that the other guy was the better quarterback.\n\nIn the second matchup between the future Hall of Famers, it was the one with five Super Bowl rings who walked off the field with the victory.\n\nBrady threw for 294 yards and a touchdown, and James White ran for two scores to lead the New England Patriots to a 31-17 victory over Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night.\n\nIt was the sixth straight victory for the Patriots (7-2).\n\n\u201cWe made some plays in the fourth quarter when we needed to,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnytime you beat a good football team it feels good. So, 7-2 is a long ways from 1-2 where we were.\u201d\n\nRodgers completed 24 of 43 passes and two touchdowns but failed to rally his team after tying the game in the third quarter. Rodgers won the first matchup with Brady at Lambeau Field in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf you play long enough, and you have the sustained greatness that Tom has had, there\u2019s going to be a lot of records,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe\u2019s been the gold standard at quarterback for two decades.\u201d\n\nIt was 17-all late in the third quarter when Aaron Jones fumbled for Green Bay (3-4-1).\n\nNew England receiver Julian Edelman hit White on a 37-yard catch-and-run to set up White\u2019s second score, a 1-yard run. On the Patriots next possession, Brady connected with Josh Gordon for a 55-yard TD.\n\nGordon caught five passes for 130 yards, the 12th 100-yard receiving game of his career.\n\nWith tight end Rob Gronkowski out with a back and ankle injury and leading rusher Sony Michel out for the second straight week with a knee issue, Brady and the Patriots had to get creative.\n\nThey again turned to receiver Cordarrelle Patterson to help carry the load in the backfield.\n\nPatterson was effective for the second straight week, rushing 11 times for 61 yards and a touchdown .\n\n\u201cSo much of our team is guys being in roles that maybe they didn\u2019t sign up for,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut they\u2019re asked to do it. ... A lot of guys down and you\u2019re short at certain spots. Obviously, we have a lot of trust in him that when he\u2019s got the ball in his hands good things are going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe worked in tandem with White to keep the Packers defense guessing. White took advantage and found space to turn short completions into first downs.\n\nNew England also capitalized on a pair of long flea-flicker passes to set up scores.\n\nRodgers was on target in the first half. He was elusive in the pocket and extended plays with his feet, keeping the Patriots\u2019 secondary off balance long enough to create space downfield or some big gains.\n\nThe longest was a 51-yard pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the third quarter that helped set up Rodgers\u2019 15-yard TD pass to Jimmy Graham that tied the game at 17. But the pocket got smaller in the second half as the Patriots defense sped him up, hitting him six times and sacking him once.\n\nBrady completed 16 of his first 22 passes but had six straight incompletions in the third quarter.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a turnover in the game until Green Bay\u2019s Jones was stripped by Lawrence Guy early in the fourth quarter. The fumble was recovered by Stephon Gilmore on the Patriots\u2019 24.\n\nNew England quickly capitalized, using four straight completions by Brady and a 37-yard pass from Julian Edelman to get to the Packers\u2019 2. White scored from a yard out two plays later to put the Patriots back in front 24-17.\n\n\u201cIt was obviously a big play in the game,\u201d Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \u201cThat was a turning point.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 defense tightened on Green Bay\u2019s next drive. It culminated on third down when Adrian Clayborn and Trey Flowers dropped Rodgers for a 9-yard sack and forcing a punt.\n\nIt proved costly.\n\nOn just the third play of the ensuing drive Brady found Gordon over the middle. Packers cornerback Tramon Williams had a shot at a tackle, but whiffed, springing Gordon for his 55-yard touchdown .\n\nTOSSED\n\nPackers safety Jermaine Whitehead was ejected in the second quarter.\n\nWhitehead was trading shoves with Patriots center David Andrews when second year defensive back from Auburn spun around and slapped Andrews in the face.\n\nHe was called for unnecessary roughness and tossed. Whitehead was the replacement for Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, who was traded to the Washington Redskins last week.\n\nINJURIES\n\nPackers: WR Geronimo Allison was inactive for the Packers with a groin injury. He was a key contributor in the passing game before missing two weeks with a hamstring issue. ... Starting RT Bryan Buluga left the game in the first half with a knee injury and did not return. ... CB Kevin King left the game with a hamstring injury and did not return. ... S Kentrell Brice left in the third quarter with a knee injury.\n\nPatriots: Gordon said he dislocated his finger early in the game while catching a pass but played through the pain. \u201cIt was just like a freak accident. Nothing too crazy,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt dislocated.

I thought in the first half he played very well.\u201d\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns finished with 23 points for Minnesota. It was his fourth straight game scoring 20 points or more. But scoring was not the issue for the Wolves on Sunday, as the Blazers got plenty of points at the free-throw line.\n\n\u201cDefensively, the penetration really hurt us,\u201d Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau said.\n\nPortland, the league\u2019s best free-throw shooting team, took advantage of its free-throw attempts in the first two quarters for a 61-45 halftime lead. In the game, the Trail Blazers shot 28 for 32 from the line.\n\nThe Blazers continued the onslaught in the third quarter, pushing their lead to as many as 28 points.\n\nFor the second straight game, the Blazers struggled from beyond the arc (7 for 28), but it didn\u2019t matter against the Wolves.\n\nThe timeout helped as Minnesota stormed back, even taking a brief two-point lead on a 3-pointer from rookie guard Josh Okogie.\n\nPortland, however, took control of the game on the strength of their subs.\n\nTowns already had his knees wrapped up before the 4th quarter even started, knowing his night was over.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTrail Blazers: In each of last three seasons, Portland\u2019s CJ McCollum has averaged over 20 points per game. But despite a league-wide scoring boom, McCollum has actually seen his scoring average drop to 19 points. While McCollum is sacrificing some individual glory, the Blazers have a 7-3 record and entered Sunday with the third-ranked offense in the NBA.\n\n\u201cI think obviously having Evan (Turner) out there with them, playing more minutes with Damian (Lillard) affects how much the ball is in his hands. His numbers are probably down a little bit but not significantly,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of the adjustment for McCollum. \u201cThe emphasis this year was, again, passing and incorporating the team more and less off the dribble. That\u2019s how we are playing right now. I think everybody was on the same page.

It\u2019s a pretty unique niche.\u201d\n\nHe credits his family members and others in the furniture business with helping him land on his feet after a tumultuous few years that saw the end of one of his family businesses and the relocation of another.\n\nHis Italian parents, Domenick and Maria, came to High Point in the early 1970s, by way of New York, where they sold chairs made in Sicily.\n\n\u201cHe and his brothers learned from his father and grandfather how to do wood carving,\u201d Pennisi recalled about his father. \u201cThey ended up doing carving models for companies in High Point. They made the leg models and apron models for the manufacturers here in High Point to put chairs and tables on.\u201d\n\nDomenick Pennisi and his brother, Andrew, opened Pennisi Originals, a full-scale furniture manufacturer in High Point.\n\n\u201cThey were doing some things that weren\u2019t all that common in High Point at the time,\u201d Anthony Pennisi said. \u201cThey did machine carving and a lot of intricate veneering and finishing.\u201d\n\nHis father opened PAMA Furniture in 1984, importing specialized frames from Italy that he would stock and sell to local companies that fashioned them into chairs and tables.\n\n\u201cHe started selling to the manufacturers. It kind of got embedded into us that that was our customer base. He focused on that instead of retailers,\u201d Pennisi said. \u201cHe also set up a woodshop at PAMA and we started building frames for Edward Ferrell. That was our first big customer in town. I worked in the shop during the summers, and that\u2019s how I learned to manufacture furniture.\u201d\n\nPAMA closed in 2012 and Pennisi started Domenick\u2019s, reaching out to old customers who needed help building furniture frames.\n\nWithin a couple of years, he had woodworking, finishing and upholstery operations going in a rented space in south High Point, where he was awash with business from other companies that needed help filling orders.\n\n\u201cOur business model was set: We can be a service provider to help these guys that are overwhelmed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the hospitality industry was not booming, I would not have a business.

All these companies in town needed help.\u201d\n\nBut a challenge presented itself last spring when his landlord sold the building where Domenick\u2019s was based. Pennisi scrambled to find a new location, which he did over the summer, repurposing an old building on Tate Street.\n\n\u201cWe had our best month ever in August. We have been extremely busy, because once we made the move, people got confidence: \u2018Give it to Anthony, he\u2019ll get those 400 pieces done,\u2019\u201d Pennisi said.\n\nHe\u2019s used his connections, including networking through the N.C. Furniture Institute, to drum up business and find the skilled craftsmen he needs to meet the demand for the work.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s based on my family\u2019s history in High Point,\u201d he said. \u201cOur reputation was very high-end.

(AP) \u2014 Dylan Wright always knew he would end up making money playing video games though his parents might have had their doubts.\n\nOver the course of a recent weekend, the 16-year-old, Greenwood High School student and a teammate won a total of $70,000 at a California gaming tournament. His nearly 8,500 matches played in the game Fortnite paid off at the game\u2019s official Fall Skirmish tournament.\n\nThe tournament spanned a recent weekend in San Jose, California, at a convention for the online streaming service Twitch, called TwitchCon 2018. Wright qualified for the tournament after spending many hours a day \u2014 some days spending nearly all day \u2014 playing Fortnite, a game that pits up to 100 players in a battle royale to be the last person standing.\n\nWhen he walked into the convention center that Saturday, he said his nerves were getting the better of him. He was suddenly in the same room, getting ready to compete with world-class players he\u2019s been a fan of online.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy.

He came into the game tied for the NFL lead with 10 interceptions , and the four picks were a new high.\n\n___\n\nDROUGHT DONE\n\nJulio Jones caught a 35-yard scoring pass from Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter against the Washington Redskins, dragging safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix on the way into the end zone. His score helped Atlanta beat Washington 38-14. It was Jones\u2019 first touchdown since Nov. 26, 2017. He had played in 12 games since his previous score.\n\n___\n\nACTION JACKSON\n\nChicago safety Eddie Jackson had a 65-yard fumble-return touchdown in the Bears\u2019 41-9 victory at Buffalo. Jackson, who had a 76-yard interception return for a TD and a 75-yard fumble return for a score against Carolina on Oct. 22, 2017, joined Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders (three touchdowns in 1994) as the only players since 1970 with at least three defensive TDs of 65 or more yards over any two-year span.\n\n___\n\nSHARING SECRETS\n\nFormer NFL receiver Steve Smith acknowledged on the NFL Network he left his Carolina Panthers\u2019 playbook for his new team, the Baltimore Ravens, to find when he was released in 2013. It\u2019s not unusual for players to share secrets about their former team after being released or waived, but it is difficult to recall anyone talking about it publicly. \u201cWhen I came in I had the playbook and said, \u2018It will be on my desk and what you do with it is on you,\u2018\u201d Smith recalled. Smith said the playbook was missing from his locker for a couple of days before it was returned and he took it home. Smith said he had a copy of the Panthers\u2019 playbook because it was given to him by another player who was cut a couple years before he was released by the team. Smith said he thought the playbook might be helpful if he got into coaching after his playing career.\n\n___\n\nFITTING TRIBUTE\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Ben Roethlisberger wore cleats emblazoned with a Star of David in response to the late-October shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. The Star of David was in yellow and served as the upper part of the Steelers logo. There were also the words, \u201cStronger Than Hate\u201d on each shoe. Roethlisberger and his wife are friends of Michele Rosenthal, a former team employee. Two of Rosenthal\u2019s brothers were among the 11 killed in the attack.\n\n___\n\nBUNCHES OF SACKS\n\nNine of the franchise-record 10 sacks by Minnesota in the Vikings\u2019 24-10 win over Detroit came from its front four, including 2\u00bd by backup defensive tackle Tom Johnson. During the heyday of the Purple People Eaters, the Vikings had nine sacks in a game in 1968, 1969 and 1970. They also did it in 1993. But this was the record-setter, thanks to a well-timed mix of blitzes called by coach Mike Zimmer and the relentless rush by Danielle Hunter, who had 3\u00bd, and his friends up front.\n\n___\n\nSWING AND A MISS\n\nLos Angeles Chargers kicker Caleb Sturgis missed two extra points and a 42-yard field goal attempt in a 25-17 win at Seattle. Sturgis is the first kicker with a missed extra point and missed field goal in three straight games since Raiders kicker Jim Breech in 1979.\n\n___\n\nHAPPY HOMECOMING\n\nBrandon McManus missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired, leaving Demaryius Thomas a winner in his homecoming as the Houston Texans escaped Denver with a 19-17 win over the Broncos. Thomas finished with three receptions for 61 yards, but two of them were back-to-back for 31 and 18 yards on the Texans\u2019 opening touchdown drive. Thomas had started all 114 games for the Broncos since Jan. 8, 2012, when he caught an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow on the first snap of overtime to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 29-23. This time, he drew loud ovations when he emerged from the tunnel for pregame stretch and again during a video tribute after \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Outside the stadium, the Broncos put up a giant \u201cThank you, D.T.\u201d banner at the bottom of a 10-story-high image of Thomas next to one of Von Miller.\n\n___\n\nHELLO?\n\nMichael Thomas caught a late 72-yard touchdown reception and then celebrated with a cellphone in a throwback to another famous New Orleans play, and the streaking Saints handed the Los Angeles Rams their first loss of the season with a 45-35 win. Thomas\u2019 long TD came on a pivotal third-down play with about four minutes to go, when the Rams seemed to expect the Saints to run a play closer to the first-down marker. Thomas ran free behind Marcus Peters, caught Brees\u2019 long throw virtually in stride and ran straight to the goal post, where he got out an old-school flip phone \u2014 reminiscent of Joe Horn\u2019s Sunday night TD celebration in 2003. Like Horn, Thomas was penalized, but the Rams never threatened after that.\n\n___\n\nSIDELINED\n\nCleveland defensive backs Denzel Ward and E.J. Gaines left with injuries in the first quarter of a loss to Kansas City. Ward was sidelined by a hip injury, and Gaines sustained a concussion. Linebacker Christian Kirksey also departed with a hamstring injury, and the short-handed Browns allowed 499 yards in a 37-21 loss to Patrick Mahomes and the high-scoring Chiefs. ... Already without left tackle Trent Williams after right thumb surgery, Washington lost left guard Shaun Lauvao to a left knee injury and right guard Brandon Scherff to a left shoulder injury. Lauvao got hurt on the third play of the game and was taken off the sideline in a wheelchair. ... Miami left tackle Laremy Tunsil left in the fourth quarter of the Dolphins\u2019 13-6 win over the New York Jets because of a knee injury. ... Denver center Matt Paradis sustained a serious right ankle injury when quarterback Case Keenum rolled up on him just before halftime of their 19-17 loss to Houston. Paradis had never missed a snap in his four-year career.\n\n___\n\nSPEAKING\n\n\u201cWe feel that we can do what we want to do.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Russell Wilson missed a wide-open Jaron Brown for a potential touchdown. He reverted to a problem from earlier this season taking too many sacks. Most costly, he misread coverage and threw a pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nYet for all those issues, Wilson was a slightly deflected pass away from leading a remarkable comeback and getting the Seattle Seahawks into overtime against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\nEncapsulating Wilson\u2019s performance in Seattle\u2019s 25-17 loss to the Chargers is not simple. At times, he showed the same brilliance as a week ago against Detroit when he posted the first perfect passer rating in team history. In other moments, Wilson looked uncertain \u2014 especially with Seattle\u2019s run game working only in spurts because of a hip injury to starter Chris Carson.\n\nHe\u2019ll be lauded for giving Seattle a chance to force overtime on the final, untimed play of regulation following a pass interference penalty against Tyler Lockett in the end zone. But he\u2019ll also lament Chargers safety Jahleel Addae getting the tip of his finger on the throw and deflecting it just enough that David Moore couldn\u2019t make a clean catch.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a tight window and we tried to get it in there,\u201d Wilson said. I think it maybe got tipped a hair. It was tough. David has done a great job all year making those plays.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s day mirrored Seattle\u2019s as a whole. Their offense was great on the opening possession, only to face problems with penalties and sacks that put them in difficult down-and-distance situations and caused the offense to stagnate. Defensively, the Seahawks allowed the Chargers to average 10 yards per play in the first half, and rush for 7.3 yards per carry for the game. Melvin Gordon ran for 113 yards on just 16 carries, averaging 7.1 yards per rush.\n\nBig plays were a problem, too. Seattle allowed a 34-yard touchdown run by Gordon, a 28-yard run by Keenan Allen, a 54-yard pass to Allen and a 30-yard TD toss to Mike Williams.\n\n\u201cI feel like we got in our own way a lot,\u201d Seattle defensive end Frank Clark said. \u201cWhen you look at the past few weeks, you watch how much we\u2019ve improved from where we started. It\u2019s obvious. The stats don\u2019t lie. The rankings don\u2019t lie where we placed. But at the end of the day, we didn\u2019t come to show that today. We didn\u2019t show up and show out at the end of the day and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do in this league.\u201d\n\nDespite those issues on the defensive side, it comes back to the play of the quarterback as usual. Seattle\u2019s intended style worked to perfection on the opening drive when Wilson used up more than half of the first quarter and capped the 13-play drive with a 10-yard TD pass to Brown.\n\nFrom there is where Wilson and the Seahawks struggled. Of Seattle\u2019s next nine possessions, none gained more than 49 net yards and only one \u2014 finishing off the first half \u2014 ended in points when Sebastian Janikowski hit a 44-yard field goal. Wilson was sacked three times and while he was 15 of 20 passing for 148 yards during that stretch, many of those completions came with Seattle facing long down-and-distance situations. Seattle had just 53 yards rushing in the second and third quarters combined after running for 45 yards on the opening drive of the game.\n\n\u201cWe got behind the sticks today and it hasn\u2019t happened for about a month now. ... It changes everything. That\u2019s not the way we\u2019ve been playing,\u201d Seattle coach Pete Carroll said.\n\nDespite all that, Wilson nearly pulled off another fourth-quarter rally. Wilson hit Nick Vannett on a 6-yard TD with 1:50 remaining to cut the Chargers\u2019 lead to one score. Seattle got the ball back with 1:24 left at its own 22 and after two completions and a roughing the passer penalty on Melvin Ingram, the Seahawks were at the Chargers 44 with 50 seconds left. Wilson scrambled for 16 yards to the Chargers 28 and, after a spike, Seattle had 30 seconds left.\n\nSeattle got a break on the pass interference call, putting the ball at the 1 for an untimed down. Seattle\u2019s J.R. Sweezy was called for false start backing the play up to the 6, and Wilson\u2019s final attempt for Moore was partially tipped by Addae and fell incomplete.\n\n\u201cIt was really close. We had a chance but it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "Packers S Whitehead kicked out for taking a swing at Patriot\n\nNew England Patriots running back James White, right, runs past Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander for a touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Foxborough, Mass.

Not at the current moment, anyway.\n\nMcManus sailed a 51-yard field goal try wide in the final seconds as the Broncos lost 19-17 to the Houston Texans on Sunday.

The Broncos had the ball at the Texans 37 with about 43 seconds remaining. Case Keenum completed a 5-yard pass to tight end Jeff Heuerman and instead of sprinting up to the line, the Broncos took their time, before running back Phillip Lindsay lost a yard on a run up the middle.\n\nSo instead of getting it closer, they settled for a 51-yard try with 3 seconds remaining.

We\u2019ll get better and be better at it next game.\n\nOrlando snapped a four-game skid, but had to bring its starters back into the game to preserve the victory.\n\nThe Spurs went on a 25-6 run over 6 minutes to erase the Magic\u2019s 105-79 with 9:02 remaining and close within five points with less than 2 minutes left.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let go, we can\u2019t take our foot of the gas,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to finish thoroughly or teams will come back.\u201d\n\nSan Antonio veteran Pau Gasol sparked the run by blocking and collecting Gordon\u2019s shot and racing downcourt, where he was fouled with 7 minutes remaining. Gasol\u2019s hustle led Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to reinsert DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills and Bryn Forbes back into the game despite Orlando leading by 18 points.\n\nThe Spurs responded with a 9-2 run to pull within 107-96 with 5:28 remaining and forced Magic coach Steve Clifford to take a timeout to slow the momentum.\n\nClifford was forced to take another timeout 2 1/2 minutes later when Bryn Forbes\u2019 3-pointer cut Orlando\u2019s lead to 111-104.\n\n\u201cWe had the game at a place where were ahead by enough and that\u2019s where we stopped playing defense and they took advantage of it,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cThat three-minute stretch in the fourth quarter, where they were good and we lost our concentration, except for that, I thought our defense was good all night.\u201d\n\nGasol\u2019s 3-pointer pulled the Spurs within 113-108 with 1:41 remaining, but the Magic were able to salvage the win and preserve their best offensive performance of the season.\n\nOrlando failed to score 100 points in its three previous games, but jumped out to an early lead.\n\n\u201cThey deserve a lot of credit,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey were really efficient offensively and haven\u2019t been all year. They\u2019ve been at the bottom of the league in offensive efficiency and a lot of it is because it\u2019s a new system.\u201d\n\nMills finished with 16 points and Gasol finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists in 23 minutes.\n\nTerrence Ross added 17 points off the bench for Orlando.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nMagic: Orlando entered the game last in the league in scoring at 99.9 points per game as well as field goal percentage at 41.4. ... Former Spurs forward Jonathon Simmons received a warm ovation upon entering the game late in the first quarter. Simmons, who was listed as questionable with bruised right wrist, had no points in 18 minutes. ... Jonathan Isaac did not play due to a sprained right ankle. ... Timofey Mozgov missed the game with sore right knee.\n\nSpurs: Jakob Poeltl played 14 minutes, including starting the second half. It was the most minutes Poeltl has played since logging 13 minutes against Indiana on Oct. 24. He finished with two points and five rebounds. . Marco Belinelli finished with 15 points, one shy of his season high. Belinelli was 2 for 5 on 3-pointers.\n\nADAPTING\n\nDeRozan is averaging 1.1 steals per game, which matches his career high, and is on pace to collect the most steals in his career in a season.\n\nDeRozan is adapting to the Spurs\u2019 defensive system and has collected most of his nine steals by stepping into passing lanes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to with me or what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good basketball player. He\u2019s been an All-Star for I don\u2019t know how many years. He does all those things. He\u2019s a very good player.\u201d\n\nBUSY NIGHT\n\nRudy Gay missed his first game of the season, sitting out due to right heel soreness.

Asylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)\n\nMATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Waiting on the southern end of a bridge that leads to the United States, Humberto Alvarez Gonzalez warily follows the progress of the caravan winding through Mexico with the goal of reaching the border.\n\nAlvarez and about two dozen other people are waiting in Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Texas, because U.S. customs officers say there\u2019s no space to process them. They sleep on cots near the bridge and rely on donors who bring them food and clothing. Some have waited for two weeks.\n\nNow, Alvarez, a 32-year-old from Cuba, is worried that large waves of migrants in a caravan still more than 800 miles away from the border might provoke the U.S. government to reject them altogether.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to enter before the caravan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are afraid that the group of migrants will reach us and that they will judge us together with them.\u201d\n\nAsylum seekers already camping at border crossings worry that how the Trump administration responds to the caravan of some 4,000 Central American migrants and three much smaller ones hundreds of miles behind it could leave them shut out. President Donald Trump last week threatened to detain asylum seekers in large tents and send as many as 15,000 active-duty soldiers to the border. He\u2019s also spoken of closing the border.\n\nU.S. government officials say the bridges remain open to asylum seekers. But in South Texas, the busiest corridor for unauthorized border crossings, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers stand at the center of bridges to check documents and stop most asylum seekers.\n\nAnd in San Diego, people at the San Ysidro crossing wait more than a month, and volunteers operate an informal take-a-number system to spare migrants from having to wait in line or sleep out in the open. Inspectors there typically process about 100 claims a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not turning people away, it\u2019s asking them to wait,\u201d CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said recently. \u201cWe are taking people in as we have capacity to do so.\u201d\n\nAt the bridge where Alvarez and dozens of others wait, security guards on the Mexican side hold back asylum seekers until U.S. border inspectors tell them how many people they will accept. Some days, five or 10 people are allowed. On other days, the asylum seekers said, no one is.\n\nAt another bridge separating Brownsville and Matamoros, four women and their children slept under a blue tarp on the bridge. The tarp had been left behind by previous asylum seekers. One of the women said she had waited there for two days.\n\nSeeking asylum at a port of entry is legal under U.S. law, as government officials have reaffirmed this year. Trump has proposed banning people crossing illegally between ports of entry from claiming asylum \u2014 something many immigration experts say he can\u2019t do under the law.\n\nThe U.S. fielded nearly 332,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double that of two years earlier and the highest of any country in the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. And many asylum seekers wait for years to have their claims adjudicated, a delay criticized by administration officials and immigration lawyers alike.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions ruled in June that fleeing gang or domestic violence would generally not be considered grounds for asylum, a decision that would affect many people\u2019s claims.\n\nJodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, said she believes the government was trying to frustrate asylum seekers into giving up.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using a lot of ruse and double-speak to try to circumvent the law,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo women and three children were waiting Saturday at the center of the bridge between McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico, a day after soldiers had installed concertina wire on the bridge and the riverbank below.\n\nAfter some time, an official from Mexico\u2019s migration bureau came up to the group of five and directed them off the bridge, away from U.S. customs.\n\nAssociated Press journalists followed as the official and then a private security guard led the group back into Mexico and into a migration bureau office. An employee inside the building would not let the AP interview the group, and U.S. border inspectors on the bridge declined to comment.\n\nAt the bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, Alvarez continued to wait with others from all over the world: Honduras, Peru, Venezuela and Cameroon.\n\nThey insisted they will only enter peacefully and lawfully, waiting their turn at the bridge.\n\nJavier Mederos Mendez, a 44-year-old from Havana, said he was fleeing political repression because he disagreed with the ruling Castro family. He said he had flown from Cuba to South America, then crossed through jungles and violence-torn areas of Central America and Mexico to reach the bridge.\n\nHe and others had seen people drown or starve along the way.\n\nAsked what he thought of Trump\u2019s announcements about asylum, Mederos said, \u201cIt would be unfair of me to decide what is good or bad for a country.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cI will wait as long as necessary until they receive me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.", "RAWLINS, Wyo.

He was met at the airport by Kim, who joined him on the ride into the city past flower-waving and cheering crowds.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s state media reported the two held talks at the Paekhwawon State Guest House and stressed their shared socialist history and vowed continued solidarity. The official media offered few specifics, but said the talks proceeded in a \u201ccomradely and friendly atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe meeting with Kim could be seen as a shot across the bow for Washington, which has run into increasing difficulty in its efforts to wrest significant progress from the North on the denuclearization issue.\n\nPyongyang, which has also been quietly cozying up to Moscow recently, has been hardening its rhetoric ahead of a meeting in New York later this week between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the North\u2019s main negotiator, Kim Yong Chol.\n\nOver the weekend, Pyongyang used its official media to criticize the U.S. for its continued support of sanctions \u2014 a political tool Washington has also used extensively on Cuba and Russia \u2014 and hinted it may resume nuclear development if Washington doesn\u2019t change is tune.\n\nSanctions-busting has been high on Diaz-Canel\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Diaz-Canel discussed a nearly $50 million arms deal with Russia and won a similar vow of expanded political, economic and military ties from Putin. The two then issued a joint statement denouncing U.S. \u201cinterference into domestic affairs of sovereign nations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, initially imposed in 1958 and subsequently expanded, has remained in place.

(Ben Ludeman/The Oregonian via AP)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 The Portland Timbers did what they needed to do at home for the first go-round against the rival Seattle Sounders in the MLS playoffs.\n\nSebastian Blanco put the Timbers in front with a goal in the 29th minute and Portland hung on over a tense second half to go up 2-1 in the opening leg of their Western Conference semifinal against the Sounders on Sunday.\n\nThe second leg is set for Thursday night in Seattle.\n\n\u201cWe won, that\u2019s the important thing,\u201d Timbers coach Giovanni Savarese said. \u201cWe\u2019ll think about everything else later. We needed a win today and found the win that we needed.\u201d\n\nSeattle was hurt by a pair of key injuries to starters Cristian Roldan and Chad Marshall in the opening half that could impact the second leg.\n\n\u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t the result that we wanted, but at the end of the day we got a road goal, so that always helps. It\u2019s something to put in your pocket for later. But we understand win the game on Thursday. Those are the facts,\u201d Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said.\n\nSeattle, the second seed in the West, had avoided a knockout round game this week after wrapping up the regular season with a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes. The win, secured on Raul Ruidiaz\u2019s stoppage-time goal, combined with Colorado\u2019s Decision Day victory over FC Dallas, slid the Sounders into second place in the standings for the opening round bye.\n\nThe Sounders won 14 of their final 16 regular-season games in another remarkable second-half surge under Schmetzer.\n\nFifth-seeded Portland lost its final regular-season match against the Whitecaps and had the daunting task of facing FC Dallas on the road in the knockout stage. But the Timbers pulled off a 2-1 upset with a pair of goals from Diego Valeri, despite playing for much of the second half a man down.\n\nThe victory set up the Cascadia semifinal between the two teams, who last met in the 2013 conference finals with Portland winning 5-3 on aggregate.\n\nRuidiaz scored in the 10th minute to give the Sounders the early lead. Roldan moved the ball up the left side and passed it off to Victor Rodriguez, who served it into Ruidiaz out in front of the goal. Ruidiaz tucked his shot into the left side of the net out of Jeff Attinella\u2019s reach. It was his 11th goal this season.\n\nThe Sounders went into the match 12-0-0 in MLS playoff games when they scored first.\n\nBut the Timbers pulled even a short time later on Jeremy Ebobisse\u2019s goal. Stefan Frei rushed Ebobisse and slid to try to stop the ball, but Ebobisse got it past him and the shot sailed into the net in the 16th minutes\n\nBlanco maneuvered around several defenders before a clinical finish out of Frei\u2019s reach to put Portland in front.\n\n\u201cWe won. This is important. Now we need to rest and play the next game in Seattle,\u201d Blanco said. \u201cVery hard.\u201d\n\nRoldan had to leave the game in the 31st Minute with a groin injury. He was replaced by Waylon Francis. Seattle also lost midfielder Marshall, who had to be stretchered off the field with a right knee injury. He was replaced by Roman Torres in the 40th minute.\n\nSchmetzer said the two would be evaluated once the team returned to Seattle.\n\nThe Timbers thought they had another goal in the 80th minute on Lucas Melano\u2019s rebound but it was called offside.\n\n\u201cI think when we went out in the second half we controlled the game,\u201d said Sounders defender Kelvin Leerdam. \u201cOf course they got some chances, but I\u2019m very positive with what we\u2019ve show in the second half and I believe we can take that to our home game, and I believe we can finish it out\u201d\n\nThe two teams met three times during the regular season, but Seattle won the last one 1-0 at Providence Park.\n\nPortland was without Larrys Mabiala after he was sent off with a red card in the match against Dallas.", "", "", "Bills go from anemic to comedic in 41-9 loss to Bears\n\nBuffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy (25) is tackled by Chicago Bears' Roquan Smith (58) during the second half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Orchard Park, N.Y.

It was the Bills\u2019 eighth TD of the season, and first since Peterman\u2019s 16-yard pass to Zay Jones in the fourth quarter of a 20-13 loss at Houston three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt was like a domino effect today,\u201d receiver Kelvin Benjamin said. \u201cIt just kept stacking up on us.

Rookie Wyatt Teller saw playing time at left guard, while Jeremiah Sirles eventually split time at right tackle.\n\nMcDermott was vague in saying he sat McCoy because of what the Bears were doing schematically.\n\nMcCoy, meantime, didn\u2019t stick around to share his thoughts. He was spotted exiting the locker room before reporters were allowed to enter.\n\nThough Peterman will bear the brunt of the blame, not all the interceptions were his fault.\n\nNewly signed receiver Terrelle Pryor caught Peterman\u2019s pass and lost control as he turned up field, with the ball landing in defensive back Adrian Amos\u2019 hands. Three snaps into Buffalo\u2019s next possession, Peterman\u2019s hard pass over the middle struck Jones in the hand and bounced directly to Floyd, who returned it for a touchdown.\n\nDid you love seeing this from @Leonard90Flo as much as we did?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thought so. pic.twitter.com/vw3T85gFH5 \u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) November 4, 2018\n\nPeterman finished 31 of 49 for 189 yards and sacked four times in an outing reminiscent of his previous meltdowns.

Another victory for the surging Chargers, holding off Wilson\u2019s late rally for a 25-17 win over the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.\n\nThe Chargers won their fifth straight, putting a capper on Philip Rivers\u2019 200th consecutive start with another clutch defensive stand. Rivers threw two touchdowns, Melvin Gordon ran for 113 yards, yet those two were standing on the sideline watching after a pass interference call against Michael Davis on the final play of regulation gave Seattle an untimed down and a chance to force overtime.\n\nAnd just like they did in London when the Chargers denied Tennessee\u2019s 2-point conversion attempt to preserve a 20-19 win, the defense came through again.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have come down to that but it did,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe found a way to win.

(AP Photo/Bruce Kluckhohn)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions were at a disadvantage, playing in a deafening stadium against a daunting Minnesota defense that\u2019s rounding into form at midseason.\n\nThe departure of their leading pass-catcher in a trade earlier in the week left the Lions with one less way to attack the Vikings, but the absence of Golden Tate became an afterthought while the team struggled to protect its quarterback. Matthew Stafford was culpable, too, often hanging onto the ball too long.\n\nDanielle Hunter had 3 1/2 of Minnesota\u2019s franchise-record 10 sacks plus a fourth-quarter fumble return for a touchdown , making for a miserable afternoon for Stafford and the Lions in a 24-9 victory by the Vikings on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very, very, very, very talented front,\u201d left guard Frank Ragnow said. \u201cDudes on every single position. So credit to them, but it\u2019s all on us. I think we all know we need to play better than that.\u201d\n\nHunter also was credited with nine tackles and four hits on Stafford as the Vikings (5-3-1) limited the Lions to a season-low 214 total yards and stopped their streak of 14-plus points at 25 straight games. The last time the Lions scored in single digits was a 17-6 loss to the New York Giants on Dec. 18, 2016.\n\nThe Lions assembled only two drives that netted more than 30 yards. Tate was certainly missed \u2014 the Lions went just 4 for 15 on third down \u2014 but the Vikings dominated this game on the line of scrimmage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to play some teams that are going to have some really elite rushers and who are really elite players,\u201d left tackle Taylor Decker said. \u201cWe know in our division, we\u2019re going to get that every week. It\u2019s a tough pill to swallow, but we have to play better.\u201d\n\nThe previous high sack total of Stafford\u2019s 10-year career was seven, against the Vikings in 2015. He has been sacked five times or more on 15 different occasions, six of those by the Vikings. The Lions are 3-12 in those games.\n\n\u201cWe need to learn how to be consistent all the way across the board with everything we do,\u201d coach Matt Patricia said. \u201cThere have been some weeks we have been consistent from the start of the week through the games, and some weeks haven\u2019t been consistent. Things change on gameday pretty quick depending on the opponent and what they\u2019re doing, and being able to handle some of those changes affects that.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings effectively mixed in blitzes to keep the Lions off balance, but nine of the 10 sacks were registered by their defensive linemen. Three of them came inside Minnesota\u2019s 20, over two different possessions that ended with a field goal by Matt Prater.\n\nDefensive tackles Sheldon Richardson and Tom Johnson switched places on a perfectly executed stunt that ended with them sharing a sack of Stafford on third-and-goal from the 8 early in the second quarter. Everson Griffen pushed Decker back toward Stafford, too, in a complete collapse of the pocket.\n\n\u201cIf we go into the red zone and we score touchdowns there, then the score of the game would\u2019ve been a lot different,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", "", "Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) attempts a two-point conversion as Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Allen Bailey (97) makes the tackle during the second half of an NFL football game Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018, in Cleveland. The attempt failed. (AP Photo/David Richard)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The coach changed. Everything else with the Cleveland Browns stayed the same.\n\nUnable to slow Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City\u2019s thrill-a-minute offense, the Browns were soundly beaten \u2014 and beaten up \u2014 in a 37-21 loss on Sunday in Cleveland\u2019s first game under interim coach Gregg Williams.\n\nMahomes threw two touchdown passes to Cleveland native Travis Kelce and Kareem Hunt, another local kid who drove past FirstEnergy Stadium almost every day, scored three TDs as the Chiefs (8-1) overpowered the banged-up Browns (2-6-1) while sending them to their fourth straight loss.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t figure to get better anytime soon for Cleveland, which had three more defensive starters get injured.\n\nThe pain isn\u2019t going away.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep going \u2014 next man up,\u201d defensive end Myles Garrett said. \u201cWe have to do the best with what we have.\u201d\n\nThe loss ended another tumultuous few days for the Browns, whose promising 2-2-1 start has dissolved into more disarray.\n\nStill, rookie quarterback Baker Mayfield managed to extract some positives. He passed for 297 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cOffensively, I think there was a lot more good in this game than we had in the past,\u201d said Mayfield, who twice connected with running back Duke Johnson on scores. \u201cThere is a lot to build on, but there is obviously so much more room for improvement. When you are playing a team like that, you have to stay in the game.\n\n\u201cYou have to give yourself chances. You have to do the little things right. You have to chip away, take time off of the clock just because of the offense that they have. There was a lot of good on offense, but we just have to keep getting better.\u201d\n\nCleveland\u2019s hopes of staying with the Chiefs took a major hit when defensive backs Damarious Randall (groin), E.J. Gaines (concussion) and Denzel Ward (hip) were sidelined by injuries. Randall was scratched before the kickoff, and after Gaines and Ward went down in the first quarter, linebacker Christian Kirksey (hamstring) got hurt.\n\nStopping the Chiefs with a full roster is tough.\n\nShort-handed, it\u2019s impossible.\n\nThe Browns were already missing Pro Bowl linebacker Joe Schobert, who sat out his third game in a row with a hamstring injury.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that really affected us was that we lost two of our starting corners in the first drive,\u201d cornerback T.J. Carrie said. \u201cThat definitely put us in a different situation. We practice with those guys throughout the week, and when those guys go down, it changes the game plan. They are a high-powered offense, and I don\u2019t think we did a good job at all stopping their momentum.\u201d\n\nThe injuries put more pressure on Williams, who did not relinquish his duties as defensive coordinator after being asked to replace Hue Jackson, who was fired on Monday along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley.\n\nThe Browns may have been outmanned by the more talented Chiefs, but Williams liked how his players fought through a week full of adversity.\n\n\u201cI never saw any flinch,\u201d he said. \u201cNever saw a flinch today. Never saw body language poor today. You have to build on that. This is the National Football League. There are no excuses. You have to continue to get better. You have to. We all have to.\u201d\n\nWilliams set an early tone for his shell-shocked team with a fourth-down gamble on Cleveland\u2019s first possession. The Browns converted then, but Williams\u2019 choice to go for a 2-point conversion in the second quarter resulted in the Browns chasing points all afternoon.\n\nCleveland went 0 for 3 on conversion tries.\n\nFollowing the game, Mayfield and Mahomes met at mid-field and shared a hug and some words of encouragement. They\u2019ve been friends for years, college rivals and part of the NFL\u2019s next wave of young quarterbacks.\n\nWhile Mahomes appears to have it all \u2014 more talented teammates, a stable franchise \u2014 right now, Mayfield doesn\u2019t think the Browns have to try to replicate Kansas City\u2019s offense.\n\n\u201cWhat we do is perfectly fine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to be better at it. They have guys who are making their plays. Their quarterback is putting it in the right spot. He is giving them a chance to win. We just have to be better. We are not going to abandon ship with what we are doing and try to do the Chiefs offense. We just have to trust our guys, trust our playmakers and do our job.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "FOXBOROUGH, Mass.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 By the time the Baltimore Ravens play another game, they\u2019ll have gone five weeks without a victory.\n\nAfter enduring nine straight weeks of football to get this far, the weary, aching Ravens will gladly take a week off before attempting to end a three-game losing streak.\n\nBaltimore (4-5) will use the time off to rest, regroup and assess what went wrong during an inexplicable skid following a 4-2 start.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at everything, as we always do during the bye week,\u201d coach John Harbaugh said after Sunday\u2019s 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh. \u201cI think the biggest thing we need to do is get healthy and get fresh.\u201d\n\nGetting back starting tackles Ronnie Stanley (ankle) and James Hurst (back) will certainly help an offense that started the season going 12 for 12 in converting red zone opportunities into touchdowns over the first three games. Lately, though, those chances inside the 20 have resulted in field goals.\n\nTwice in the first half, the Ravens drove deep into Pittsburgh territory and had to settle for field goals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because in these types of games, you don\u2019t get that many plays and that many opportunities, and obviously, scoring touchdowns is the name of the game,\u201d quarterback Joe Flacco said.\n\nIn the first half, Pittsburgh scored two touchdowns and the Ravens got two field goals. That put Baltimore in a hole from which it could not recover.\n\n\u201cIt helps if you can run it in,\u201d Harbaugh said.\n\nThe Ravens have yet to get their running game on track. On Sunday, they finished with 61 yards rushing \u2014 including two attempts for 4 yards after halftime.\n\n\u201cI think we can turn it around,\u201d wide receiver John Brown said. Brown was Flacco\u2019s go-to guy early in the season, but his effectiveness has been negated by frequent double teams.\n\n\u201cThings happen. We have to find a way to get it right,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBut a struggling offense is only one of Baltimore\u2019s issues.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s most dominant defense has suddenly become vulnerable to the pass, particularly the underneath routes that elongate drives and turn short throws into big gainers.\n\n\u201cThey kept us on the field for a lot of long drives, just grinding us down,\u201d defensive end Brent Urban said. \u201cYou can\u2019t win like that.\u201d\n\nSince blanking the Titans 21-0 in Week 6, the Ravens have yielded 82 points in three defeats. Sixty-seven of those points came in a stretch of six periods through halftime of Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not up to our defensive standard,\u201d defensive back Anthony Levine said. \u201cWe know what our standard is, and that isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nWith the Ravens struggling at the bye and in danger of missing the postseason for the fourth year in a row, it\u2019s only natural that Harbaugh would start fielding questions about job security. He said Sunday he wasn\u2019t concerned with being fired.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been someone who\u2019s worried about keeping a job,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been, for me, (about) doing the job.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "", ""]
